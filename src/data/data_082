They pulsated from a deep red to a bright orange. At first they were motionless, lined up one on top of the other. Then, the one on top slowly descended to the lower one and they came very close to touching. It was obvious these things were being controlled/maneuvered.  There was no sound at all. They hovered for what seemed to be about 3-5 minutes and then slowly dimmed and flew off, changing speeds from very slow to rather quick movements. I checked for any reports around this area, something i've never done before and I have noticed that more people are seeing similar things around this area. I know tonight there was a meteor shower, but these objects were not meteors or comet debris. I spend enough time star gazing to know the difference.  These objects descended then ascended, never fully disappearing until they flew away.

Suddenly I spot what I first believe is a flock of birds flying gently through the night sky.  I keep looking at these strange birds and wonder how come they glow.  The sky is pitch dark, so the only way for them to be seen is if something is shining on them from below.  The flock slowly move through the sky, and they keep the same glow all the time. Within a second it suddenly comes to me that this cannot be birds.  There are about a hundred spots in the sky, in a fixed, stretched (not even) formation.  Fortunately there were a lot of sky outside our balcony (there was a park, so no walls hid the sight).  I kept looking at the formation for about 5 minutes, before they no longer were in my visible area. Two spots came a little later.  The last of them seemed to consist of two bright spots, rotation very closely to each other. The fixed formation and the quantity of the spots makes me really confused.

I laid there for about 15 minutes and watched.  Still hoping someone else was seeing this. I did want to go out or even open a window, but at this time I had 3 dogs in my tent and I really didn’t want to get them all going crazy and barking , but looking back now I wish I would have went back outside and observe what was going on. In the morning I was the first up and when my sister woke up I asked her if she got up last night she said she woke up and I said did you go outside she said no.  I started to tell her when I woke up to go to the bathroom I saw these lights right way she says I saw something laminating my tent and I heard Lucy bark and I thought you were up walking around with a flash light.  Then she said ""I was trying to figure out what you were doing and I was thinking to myself why is she starting the fire again"".   After exchanging the complete story with her and all the other campers I am convinced what I saw was some kind of phenomenon that I can't even began to explain.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,35.2754,-82.6909

While the sighting was very brief, lasting only 1 - 1.5 seconds, it was concluded that the object or objects were either entering or leaving the atmosphere due to the direction of travel and angle from the horizon. The size and speed were approximated by comparing their size in the night sky relative to the distance from the observation point. No sounds were heard and the object(s) did not leave any trail(s). It was 1 and 1/2 hours before moonrise, without a cloud in the sky.  Visibility was excellent, and light pollution was virtually non-existent. It was too dark and the object or objects travelling too fast to verify the shape or outline of a craft, or whether is was three distinct crafts flying in formation, but both witnesses believe it was one craft with three propulsion devices aligned in a triangluar formation since the distance between the three lights remained constant. Just prior to the sighting, I-40 Westbound was closed for over 1 hour due to a tractor-trailer truck fire, and the sighting occurred 15-20 miles West of the truck fire, about 15 minutes after the road was re-opened. Both witnesses described the exact same event whereas the object seemingly traveled from one point to another in the sky along a Westward linear path, without leaving any path or trail in between the two instances in which it was seen.  It's not known whether or not this ""jumping"" from one point to another seemingly instantaneously is because the object was simply travelling too fast to be properly observed by the unaided eye or because of some other reason.

As I watched them the arc formation of lights began to shift closer to one another.  There were 4 lights that moved close together forming a diamond momentarily (indicative of a helicopter or aircraft losing altitude rapidly in formation flight) and one additional light nearer (higher on the horizon). They changed their formation while moving north, toward me.  At this point I was out of my car and walking toward the lights, south along the street. The way the lights changed formation they appeared to hover and move slowly as a helicopter might, but there were no white anti-collision lights.  Al! l of the lights were a bright red with a slight tinge of orange and after the movement of the lights occurred some began to grow dim.  As I walked closer I expected they would soon pass directly overhead or nearby, but by the time I reached a tall group of pines that were obscuring my view all of the lights had vanished. I am a former Army helicopter pilot, Chief Warrant Officer (retired 2007), and what I saw does not make sense.

I've been seeing some incredibly odd and wierd activity going on in the night sky since this past April of 2012. The main things I have been seeing are random stationary flashes of light in the night sky and white-colored lighted and sometimes orange-colored lighted round orbs/ufo's.  The flashes of light seem to occur at random points in the sky and at random times.  As for the white rounded lights and orange colored lights (orbs).. from the 6 to 7 months I've been watching/witnessing them, I've come to the theory that they are reacting/investigating commercial/civilian aircraft at night.  My theory is that they are attracted to the strobe/beacon lights that aircraft must use during night time flights.. because whenever there is high air-traffic over the top of my house, that's when I tend to see them the most.  The other thing that lea! ds me to believe that they're investigating and or are attracted to the lights from commercial/civilian/military aircraft is the fact that 90% of the time, when I see an airplane/helicopter approaching to fly over or close to flying over the top of my house.. 90% of the time I'll see one of these white-lighted orbs and the orb will suddenly appear (like someone turned on a light bulb from the switch) and will either intersect the paths of the airplanes or will follow the exact same flight path that the airplane/helicopter just flew. Also, sometimes these white colored orbs will be very dim.. but sometimes will slowly start to get really bright (like someone using a dimmer switch on a light bulb to slowly turn up or down the brightness level of the bulb) and sometimes they'll stay really bright for a long time and then they'll start to slowly fade/dim back down to their original brightness level.. or sometimes they'll even dim all the way out to where you can't see them at all. Almost like someone turned off the light switch, per say.  That's the best I know how to explain it. I have quite a few of these things on video.  I actually got the best video footage that I've ever gotten over the past 7 to 8 months.. just last night!  I got video of a civilian airplane and one of these orbs passing each other.  I also have video of these things showing how they go from almost invisible to incredibly bright and then dimming back down to either barely visibly or completely turned off. These objects appear to definitely be round in shape and when I watch some of the videos I capture of these things, I can actually see colors that airplanes don't use and the colors almost seem to morph into each other before each color changes from one color to another color. The best thing to do, in my opinion.. would be for me to send one of my videos to you, so that you can see exactly what I am seeing. Now, of course, there are nights where I won't see any of these things.. which is generally the same nights where there is very little to no air traffic within the vicinity of my house, which is yet another reason why I think these things are attracted to the lights from airplanes/helicopters.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,35.353695348837206,-94.38678217054263

This sounds a little implausible but obviously I am taking the time to report this, and may have been the only witness (also I have never seen a UFO before, although I once saw a satellite move across the sky late at night). I was driving alone past a crowded mall last night about 7:15pm CST (right in front of the Brookwood Village Mall, just south of Birmingham in Homewood, Alabama)-hardly the place where one would expect to see a UFO.  Being just before Christmas, there was a lot of light from passing vehicles and of course from the mall itself. All of a sudden, I became aware of a single bright light passing rapidly overhead, directly over my car maybe 2-3,000 feet up or possibly higher than that, moving in the same direction as my car.  As quickly as I saw it (I did NOT imagine a bright light moving overhead), it was gone, so it was moving quite fast. In all, the whole incident couldn't have lasted more than 3 seconds. In my best judgment, no way that was a plane, a satellite, or even a reflection on my windshield, which was my first thought, since I plainly saw an isolated light up in the sky outside the car, and obviously very bright (like a ball of light) in order to show up over the ambient light from the mall and passing vehicles.  I had the car windows rolled up, so I wasn't able to hear anything to be honest. Since I live nearby, I know planes don't customarily fly over the Brookwood Village, much less that low, so that is obviously not a flight path.  There is no way the light could have been from a military jet, a private jet or even a regular plane, since I would have noticed lights on its wings, or a blinking tail light etc. and again it was moving far too fast to be a plane.  This was a SINGLE bright light (the color of a car headlamp) which was moving very rapidly. I have no idea what it could have been, but thought you'd like to know.  I started to call 911, but decided against it, so I don't know if anyone else has reported this.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,,

I live 5 miles south of sky harbor.  To my amazement there they were!!!  About 20 white orbs. All flying from the west to east.  About 9 orbs broke off and hovered. what looked like to my angle over sky harbor or even a bit more to the north of the airport. so the 9 the broke off. 3 started to form a triangle with one blinking (strobing) fast in the center top of the triangle.  The other 3 try to make what seem to be a other triangle to me facing to the west ( none in this formation where blinking) later these appeared to form in to one orb..  And the other three where just hanging around watching.  Mind you it was cloudy and raining last night. But some of the orbs shined thru the clouds.

Kind regards, ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter    All morning I have been receiving information about other people in this area who have witnessed sightings, although I believe most of these are in respect of the massive meteor shower that we had last night. Going back to my own report, I must say that I believe I now have a much clearer understanding of my own sighting.  May I briefly present this to you:  at 11.00 pm I saw a large meteor burning up on entry to earth.  This was seen from my sitting room window where I never close the curtains.  I immediately ran outside and the meteor had gone.  However, what I then saw was most definitely not a meteor.  This set my heart racing and it stayed that way most of the night!  I saw a very large craft (around 125 feet in length) reflecting no other light than two distinct rows of lights, probably 6 on each row, one slightly in front of the other.  The lights were equi-distant from each other and gave off a low level glow.  They did not pulsate or change colour.  I watched in awe as the object moved slowly and silently across the sky just above rooftop level above my neighbours' houses.  It was moving in the direction of a town called Bridgnorth from where there have been reports made this morning of strange sightings. I shall continue to pursue this, Peter, and will be back in touch with you if and when I have more information.  I made a drawing of the object last night so that I would not forget any details.  However, I cannot send this electronically as my laptop just will now allow me to do so.  If I can use a friend's pc then I will send you the picture asap. Meanwhile, many thanks for your kind support.  You have made me feel a little less crazy though I think I will still be a bit nervous tonight. Kind regards, ((END ADDENDUM #2))",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

As morning came closer it was apparent that there was smaller (or farther away…very faint) dots in a circle around it, perfectly spaced apart.  This big one would move up and then back down and because of the tower you could see it moving.  Then it would just sit there for 30-45 minutes, then move a few feet.  You could see flashes of lights coming from this object, like rays shooting out.  All of a sudden further to my right (going towards Buffalo) I saw flashing white and red lights in the sky (looked like lights that would be on top of a police car). It would get brighter and then get dimmer again. When it got bright you could see disk shape to it and at random I could see green lights go in a circular movement around the bottom of it. Then I noticed a bright red/white flashing object directly above my apartment building. The two smaller ones and the big one formed a HUGE triangle in the sky. I sat there and watched this from my balcony for hours.   Around 5:30 am the smaller ones were in the sky together to my right and they looked more orange.  All of a sudden I saw the sky around one light up with a flash. (Like something you would’ve seen on Independence Day) and then it was gone. Seconds later the same things happen to the other one. The whole time the bigger one was moving so slowly back into the sky, but was still brighter than the North Star. As the sun came up and all of the stars disappeared I could still see this object.

It was exactly 6:30 am on the clock in my car.   I noticed a very, very bright night kind of hovering over the sky above the house.   In perspective, it looked like it was right over the point in the attic of the house.   So I back up and as I back up, this light goes straight up vertically right over the house, moving higher into the sky.   I noticed….and stopped... When I stopped, it stopped.   Then I put the car back in drive and moved back into the driveway, the light followed and dropped back down, moving closer.   I did it again and the light followed each time. Then I started thinking, maybe it is a police helicopter of something.  So I back out again and pulled out as I normally do, still seeing this light moving with me.   I went to the end of the drive and began to pull out on to the street.  Curiousity had a hold of me at this point so I put the car in park and got out again.   The light had moved over horizontally again as if it was following me. I noticed the time was now 6:50 am, which seemed was crazy,  time just flew, I did not realize I had spent so much time watching this bright light. So I get back in the car, and drive away.    I drove 2 blocks over and 4 blocks up which took me to the stop sign at 23rd and F street.   I  put the car in park again and got out to see if I could see the light.   It was there, right above the street ,  definitely following me.   I wasn’t afraid or anything, I just kept thinking, what the heck is this. So I was getting back in the car and I saw a man going to his car….I kind of waved to him and I asked him if he could see this light…he kept saying no, but there is no way anyone could miss this light.   I told him to  follow the tree  line and look again.  He said no and got in his car. So I got back in my car and proceeded to work.   I work off of 120th and Maple.   When I got to work, I glanced up quickly to see if I see anything and I did not. So a few minutes later, a coworker arrived, she had picked up breakfast and her hands were full, so I went to the door to help her gather her things.   The light was there. I asked her if she could see it and she did.  She said she thought it was a black hawk helicopter  and did not seem too impressed, but by now, it was lighter outside and it did not look as spectacular  and of course she did not see it move across the sky as I did.

Last night (8/11/2012) from around 2300 until 0030 this morning military time, my husband and I were sitting in our back yard in a rural area of extreme Southwestern Virginia, watching the Perseid meteor shower.  I wanted to count the meteors and report the count back to NASA on an Android phone app, so we were intently watching the sky, particularly in the northern direction. We noted several obvious airplanes which passed throughout the approximately one and a half hours we were meteor-watching and we saw approximately 25 meteors, which were quite obvious.  At approximately 2350, I noted a light in the northwestern area over the mountains, which seemed to appear from nowhere, traveling at a very high rate of speed, in comparison to the planes we had been seeing periodically.  I called it out to my husband, who saw it as well.  It was initially headed towards the west (to the left), but then it changed directions very quickly towards the east. It changed direc! tions a couple of times, and then was joined by another identical light to its right. They appeared to follow one another, both changing directions and getting closer, then further apart, from each other several times (about six or seven times). There were no flashing lights, no red strobe lights like on a commercial airliner. In comparison with the planes we saw, these lights were traveling several times faster than the planes- they traveled in straight lines, or at least appeared to do so. They were not meteors, they did not originate high in the night sky, and they did not fall downward. They did not have tails, they were definitely exhibiting lateral movement, and appeared to be under intelligent control since they seemed to “meet up” with one another and then separate. I would have to describe their movement as akin to “playing tag”, although I obviously cannot say exactly what their intentions were.  After what I would guess to be about two minutes later, both lights ! took off towards the west over the mountaintops and disappeare! d at the same time. They left the same way they appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. They did not go behind the mountain range or treeline, they simply disappeared together. There was no noise associated with them. Since we live in a rural community, everything was very quiet and we heard some of the planes (although not all). Lights were bright white, non-flashing, steady. Size and distance were difficult to determine. I could not describe the shape other than to identify them as seemingly round lights. Both my husband and I agreed that they did not exhibit the same pattern of movement, speed, or visual light pattern of any airplanes we have ever seen. And they were obviously not planets, stars, or meteors. My husband has a background in the construction trade. My background is technical, in a science-related field in a clinical hospital patient-care setting.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,36.981,-82.4886

My future wife and I were driving home from a late work shift.  About 12 minutes out of town we noticed what looked like a low/large orangish star.  (We were thinking Venus or Mars or something.)   The closer we came to town we noticed the object seemed to get larger and lower in the sky.   About 12 minutes pass and we arrive at the first stop sign in town.  At this point the object was really low and a little big to pass for a star/planet.  I stepped out of the car to look at it clearly (without windshield between line of sight).  I told my wife (future) as I stepped out that it was really low in the sky.  As I said this, I pointed at the object.   At that precise moment as if reacting to my pointing it made this fantastic manuever that I know for a fact no known human craft can do.  It made a really fast spiral pattern, leaving a light trail behind it. (motion blur).  It then began to ""float"" across the sky very slowly.   I drove up the street a little further, pulled over into a parking spot and watched it some more.  I noticed a police officer parked just up the street and walked out to his car to point out the object to him.   I did not see what happened next myself, but my girlfriend (wife now of 13 years) said as I walked up to the officers car the object shot off into the horizon at amazing speed.  It may be one of those ""you had to be there"" moments, but for me and my wife it was something that we still talk about and are still confused and intrigued by today.  I would definitely like to be contacted about this by an investigator if possible.

Once it got to about 1/4 mile from us, it turned and continued to go fairly slowly around the tree tops and out behind our property where it disappeared.  This craft was completely soundless.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,30.266904680969628,-81.6163728336584

UFO REPORT Submitted March 19, 2012  Sighting Occurred: 1976.  Burlington Ontario Canada  I was driving home this particular evening in the autumn. It was very dark.  My family at the time lived several miles north of town in the country with very few neighbors.  I was driving north on Appleby Line from Highway 5 (Dundas Highway) at about 60 mph along a straight section of paved road and looked up and to my left (west).  High in the sky I saw what appeared to be a very bright star moving quickly in one direction then stopping and moving in a different direction.  It would pause periodically between movements. It was impossible to tell how far away it was and therefore how large it was or how fast it was moving.  But from my vantage it was a bright light about the size of a dime and would move a foot or 2 in each direction it traveled.  It had the appearance therefore of bouncing around in the sky.  My parents (my father was a doctor and my mother a registered nurse) had each seen similar lights over the years and this was really the first time I had seen one and it was so large and so obvious I was excited to get home (about 1 mile) to get the whole family out to watch it. Some moments later I turned and looked directly to my left.  Over the field that was adjacent to the road was a massive cluster of lights.  Because it was dark I could not really make out the outline of the object, but I thought at the time it could have been about as large as a passenger jet (727 or perhaps larger). It appeared to be over the middle of the field, traveling in a straight line to the North, at about the same speed I was then traveling.  I thought it might have been a helicopter, since there were some high voltage power lines nearby and I thought maybe there was some kind of inspection going on.  I slowed the car to about 10mph and rolled down my window.  There was no sound at all. The object was “gliding” at about 60-80 feet above the ground and was going only a little faster than my car. It could have been a blimp, except there was no engine noise.  I stopped the car completely at this point to watch and listen. The lights were mostly white.  One or two as I recall were blinking (like lights on an aircraft). What stood out however was an array of red lights.  They appeared rectangular, and 2 sets of 3 across, stacked one above the other.  I remember thinking that they looked like so many sets of Thunderbird tail lights which back then were large and rectangular.  There was also a search light scanning the field below and in front of the object.  I had read about UFO sightings before and heard stories related to me by my father as a follower and believer in UFOs so I had heard of sightings like this.  I seriously thought that perhaps the object was looking for a cow to dissect, since it was a cow field (there were no cows that particular night. Lucky cows). I considered stopping the car to get out and watch more closely and perhaps flag it down to communicate with it. I recall reasoning however that a) I might be picked up and never heard from again, b) have a close encounter that no one would ever believe, since there were no other witnesses or c) I would stop and it would keep on going and I would not be able to watch it again.  I opted to drive home (very fast) in order to get my family out to see it, so that I would have corroborating witnesses. I sped home and up the driveway. I ran into the house to get my parents and brother and sister. Apparently I was so excited and agitated that they could not understand what I was trying to tell them. I ran back out onto the front yard and stood there as this massive array of lights and shadowy form glided over our front yard in total silence. By the time my parents came out to see what I had been yelling about it was a mile or more away and only about the size of a quarter in the distance. My dad had me draw what I recall it looking like immediately afterward. My heart was racing. It took me hours to calm down. Several days later there was a story in the local paper about a lady who had a sighting and it was accompanied by a drawing that was very similar to mine. I have had many years to contemplate this “sighting” and a number of questions/issues arise. I have also done a great amount of reading and study on cosmology and physics over the years since then:  have always concluded that the lights over the field were the same lights of whatever it was originally up in the sky.  It could be that they were 2 separate objects. If this object was from a superior intellectual species (either extraterrestrial, other dimensional or from years in the future) and they had the ability to design a craft that could apparently defy gravity, move without engine noise, move at incredible rates of speed, etc….. why would it have lights?   Especially blinking warning lights!  Who are they attempting to warn? Would it not be within their technology to fly around without lights?  This makes no sense. -	Were they looking for a cow??  With a search light? Again, certainly they could locate an animal with something other than a bright light, especially since they would be drawing attention to themselves in the process. -	Don’t they care about being seen?  Why not have NO lights?   It would appear that the lights are on purpose… that is, they WANT to be seen. -	Since the nearest stars and planets are many light years away, it seems unlikely that these objects are from those (unless there is a worm hole or a crinkle in the space-time fabric that allows it to happen).  In short, traveling that far as fast as they would have to go, by the time they got here from there and back, so much time would have elapsed on their own planet that the trip itself would be moot. -	My guess is that it is more likely that they are either from another dimension (the existence of which is pretty well accepted among physicists) or from a different time (either the future moving back to our time or perhaps a past time moving forward into ours) and perhaps from within our solar system (Mars from a billion years ago perhaps).  Current physical theory postulates that ALL time past present and future exist concurrently.  So it is not inconceivable that one could move from one era to another without the so called grandfather (time) paradox.  In the alternative, where moving backward in time could create such a paradox, moving into the future would not have the same effect.  So it could be that these objects were created WAY in the distant past and moving into their future (our present).",2012-04-18T00:00:00,43.38223451178451,-79.82626717171718

It was a darker brushed metal color. Because it was such a long time ago, I am not quite sure the month of my siting, but I was with my girlfriend and it was the spring/summer of 1978.  We were starting 9th grade in the fall.  The location was northeast Philadelphia around the neighborhood of Tacony. Somewhere in between our two houses we were walking and saw an unusual light in the sky.  It wasn’t a star or a plane because it was moving erratically but was controlled.  For example the light moved from right to left a distance of several blocks in a second.  Then we saw it move north to south in a distance of several blocks in a second.  And so on.  We started running around the neighborhood following it. Somehow we found ourselves quite a distance from our houses, we were standing by a neighborhood school near Vandyke Street in Philadelphia.  It was a catholic school I believe.  We were looking up in the sky and we lost sight of it.  Suddenly, the craft came out of an invisible slit in the sky if that makes any sense.  The entire thing didn’t appear at once, it was as if there was an invisible door or envelope in the sky and something was coming through it. Now, it was not far up in the sky, it was about equal to the second floor of a row house.  Right above the roofs.  I did not find the shape described in the form that you have.  The best way I can describe it is if you put your two thumbs together and your index fingers together.  It’s sort of a square shape that was sanded down at the edges to make it more rounded. The color of the metal was something I had never seen before, the best way I can describe the color is like a brushed metal, not shiny.  It was a darker color.  There were no lights on the craft at this time.  When we saw it in the sky it was a light.   There was also no sound. As soon as I saw it coming out of the invisible slit in the sky I took off running behind the school building after I picked my bottom jaw up off the ground &#61514;  My friend stood frozen and just stared up at it.  I was peeking around the building looking at her. I don’t remember much after that except we walked home.  I was very late coming home.  It only seemed like an hour but I cannot remember what time I got home.  My mother was extremely angry with me especially when I insisted for days that I saw an unusual object in the sky which I followed and that was the reason I was late.  Actually for years after I insisted but everyone just laughed at me. It is strange but my friend and I never talked about what we saw after that.  You would think we would. I do not remember having any contact with any type of being.  I moved out of Philadelphia later that summer to another state but have since moved back to Pennsylvania but not Philadelphia. In my thirties, sometime late 1990s or 2000, I was home alone and I woke up, saw what looked like a strange being with a big head standing in my bedroom door way staring at me, I started screaming and then must have fallen back to sleep.  I’m not sure if I was dreaming or not. I never reported this at the time of my siting because I was young, and no one believed me.  I listened to you on Coast to Coast and you mentioned that you would welcome reports of sitings despite how long ago it may have happened.  Thank you.

After seeing them for about 20 seconds the two on the outside sped away at about 45 degree angles from the one in the center at an extraordinary speed with the one in the middle staying on the original track also at the same high rate of speed.

This afternoon while traveling North bound on interstate 295 something caught my eye in my peripheral vision.  I was at approximately mile post 28 near the Richmond Airport.  It was 4:14 pm.  A perfectly clear, sunny day with a gorgeous blue sky.   I assumed it was an airplane and turned for a quick look.  It is thrilling to watch the big jets cross over the highway.  Except this was not a jet.  It was round and silver/white like a perfect mylar balloon with absolutely no markings.  It was very large and was only about 200 feet above the ground.  I looked at the car next to me and as the driver passed me and saw it he pulled hard right across two lanes of traffic and stopped on the shoulder of the highway.  I slowed way down and watched as the circle dropped to about tree height and held position.  As I got closer I was anxious about driving by it but before I reached it, it pulled up a bit and quickly crossed the highway and dropped behind the trees quite rapi! dly.  The most disturbing vision was of the undeniably huge circular shadow it cast and watching that shadow move across the highway in front of me.  At least two other cars pulled over and watched.  I was too afraid to stop.  I have been trying to explain this away to myself and others since it happened but that shadow refuses to tuck itself away in my mind.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,37.558607538635506,-77.50798002261591

They dissipate and another fireball, the same size as the first, lights up not too far from the first. The first goes out and then lights up again after about 5 min.

But that is what I thought at first.  I have been reading others accounts of a similar sighting in the same spot, which makes me believe it has a reasonable explanation that no one has cared to investigate. I know I haven’t.

I am curious but not curious enough to drive back there.  About 15 years ago I saw a similar light in the sky and my parents told me not to worry about it. Not really sure the relevance of that.

The night of June 27th, 2012 at around 10:45 P.M. I went outside for a cigarette and to watch the stars as I do several times every night when I spotted what I thought was a plane.  I was facing west and this thing was hovering about 35 to 40 degrees off the horizon and seemed closer than an aircraft should be (maybe about a quarter mile away if not closer).  But, the more I stared at it I noticed that it had 3 horizontal white lights in a straight line with red and green lights underneath flashing at a very fast rate.  The 3 white lights did not blink and I could see them lit the entire time and remained in a straight line.  The object was moving slowly but strangely. I went inside to grab my binoculars and came back out and the object was still hovering in about the same spot but, doing a circular motion and moving up and down and sideways.  I focused the binoculars on it and played with the zoom in and out trying to get a clear look when I noticed the 3 white lights started to turn vertically and then kept turning until it did a 360 degree turn.  This is when I went inside and told my husband to come outside.  He tried using the binoculars and even went inside to get his hunting spotting scope but could not get a perfect view of it since we have a light on a pole close to our deck which makes it harder to see the sky.  He still thought it was a strange sight and not a plane. I had a better view of it since I was a little further away from that pole lamp. We watched it for several minutes before it finally took off slowly and finally went behind a tree where we could still see some white lights through the leaves before it finally d! isappeared from our view. The whole episode must have lasted about 10 minutes and I could never get a clear view of the body of the object because the green and red lights were flashing so bright and fast (and I was shaking a bit)  but it seemed to have a dark (maybe black, gray or silver) body.  I could not tell the shape of the body but if I had to guess it appeared to be cigar or disc shape.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.  Every night I watch the planes, stars, planets, satellites and occasionally shooting stars in the sky and am very familiar with objects in the night sky but this was a new experience for me.

This sparked my attention because I saw the same bright lights around the same day of the week and time of night last week.  I watched it hover for a long time and thought it could have been a helicopter because of how it was hovering and how low it was.  I stepped outside to see if I could hear it because if it was a helicopter, you would have definitely been able to hear it because it was so close.  I can make the helicopter sound comparison because of an aerial search conducted recently for an escaped convict from a local prison in which helicopters were used to search in our area.  The aircraft didn’t sound anything like the helicopter I heard several weeks ago and as a matter of fact, didn’t have a sound at all until it was flying overhead. After several minutes, the aircraft began slowly moving closer and eventually flew directly over our house and was so low I could see it was a triangle shaped aircraft with lots of bright white lights and a green and red light.  If the aircraft had been a plane, you would have definitely been able to hear it as it was so low and so close but I couldn’t hear anything but what sounded like a plane that was flying at a high altitude, miles and miles above.

My first thought was it looked like a commercial airliner coming towards us.  I was surprised on how close this object was in the night sky.  After watching for a few moments it was clear they were 2 round balls of orange fire.   They stayed parallel to each other as they moved across the sky moving from north to south. They weren't streaking in the sky and there was no apparent tail behind them.   We watched for about 20-25 seconds and as they moved above us, they then faded away at the same time.   About 10 seconds later, another single round ball of orange fire followed about the same path, about another 20-25 seconds and faded away in the same area.   Again, about 10-15 seconds later, a larger ball of fire, this time more reddish in color followed and faded away in the same area in the sky.  During the entire event, no sound was emitted.

The center of the light burst was obstructed by the tree line, but the edge of the ""burst""  had a pinkish hue to it.  (The burst was quite bright.  I literally said out loud to myself, ""What was THAT?"" Then,a moment later, just to the right of the burst and slightly higher than the flash - again- just above the tree line - were two vertical ""laser"" type beams, seeming to emanate vertically from a center point.  The two beams of light were perfectly vertical, and perfectly crisp...like a laser, but fanned out and dissipated slightly at the furthest most points. The flash disappeared almost instantly.  The beams of light appeared immediately following the flash. I was able to look directly at the beams and recognize exactly what I was seeing. I made 2 cell phone calls immediately after, and noted signal issues during my first call.  Also, my car stereo reception became fuzzy at this time.  (This may or may not be related to the event.

I was out in the backyard tending to our dogs when I looked up and noticed one pink/orange light in the sky.  It was moving more slowly than the planes that I often see above my suburban estate and was not blinking or flashing the way plane lights do.  It was an hour past sundown so the sky was dark and there were stars out and light cloud here and there.  As I watched it head from the north east towards the south-west I saw two other lights, that were exactly the same as the first, come into my field of view from behind the tall trees two streets away.  The first light stopped and seemed to wait for the other two lights which slid into place behind and either side of the first, forming the three points of a triangle, before all three began to move slowly south-west together.  They emitted no sound that we were able to perceive.  I called my mother out to watch them and she agreed how strange they were.  She said it looked like the head lights and wing lights of a very, very large yet invisible plane, such was the unformity of their movement ( see points below for vague illustration of position). . . . After continuing south-west for about three minutes the lights seemed to stop dead and I felt like they were watching us.  Mum (who's in her seventies) went back inside, bewildered and I went in to grab my camera.  When I returned less than a minute later, there was no sign of them.  They may have disappeared into the light cloud but should have eventually come out however they didn't in the next 20 minutes I watched for them.  I did notice that an aircraft did enter into the zone from which the second and third spheres had first originated in the 20 minutes after our sighting.  This patch of sky is not on any of the flight paths that extend over and around my house.  I have lived here for six years and am regularly in the backyard at night smoking cigarettes so I know the traffic of the sky here very well and these lights were like nothing I have ever seen. I am willing to entertain the idea that they may have been Chinese lanterns, as apparently they move with the absolute uniformity possessed by the lights we saw, and the wind was out of the ENE that evening, which would mean they were heading with the wind.  Also no other sightings of these lights have been reported which, given the time, leads me to believe they were local and lends credence to the Chinese lantern theory. However, there was absolutely no flickering or wavering of the lights of any kind.  They were a solid orange with a light pink haze surrounding them.  I'm not sure whether that is how Chinese lanterns are perceived by observers.  If it is, then the mystery is solved, but if not, these lights were indeed UFOs.

As I got closer I noticed it hadn't moved and I could see 3 separate closely-grouped lights and what seemed to be a slight reflection of those lights off an object that the lights sat on top of. I could not distinquish the shape of the object.  Thought it might be an advertising balloon belonging to one of the nearby car dealerships but it was too high for that and no tether was visible.  As I passed the Portsmouth traffic circle and continued to the I95 Piscataqua Bridge the object stayed stationary in a position that seemed to be between Pease TradePort and Woodbury Ave.  It was dusk and difficult to distinguish shape of object just below the 3 lights but there did seem to be something with no well-defined shape- sort of like a light framework was all it looked like.  I lost sight of the object just before I crossed the I95 bridge.  Took exit 1 after bridge and pulled over as I had binoculars in my truck but could no longer find the object.

Tonight me and two friends decided to go for a sunset flight out of Clearwater International Airport in a Cessna 172.  We were airborne around 7pm (eastern standard time) and flew out to Clearwater Beach than turned heading south.  We flew over toward the Skyway Bridge.    By the time we reached the bridge the sun had completely set.  After doing a flyby near the bridge we turned around and headed back up toward clearwater beach (North of our location) flying along the coast.   At roughly 7:40pm I noticed (while sitting in the co-pilot seat) an orange ball of light that appeared to be on the water surface.  For what ever reason I became fixated on the object, something about it did not seem normal.   While I was watching this object it suddenly skyrocketed to easily 4,000ft in under two seconds.  at this time I started freaking out and pointed the object out to my buddy (flying the plane) and my friend sitting in the back right passenger seat.  We all saw this object!   Through the 15-20 or so minutes watching this object it changed extreme flight levels over 10 times from what appeared to be from the water surface and at one point easily over 5,000 feet.  There is no way this was any type of known government aircraft for the G's this object would have had to be pulling were in no way survivable by any human.   As we were watching this bright orange orb I noticed two smaller much lighter colored objects (both orbs as well colored more like a light star).   These smaller orbs seemed to be getting closer to the bigger orange orb and than would move away in a different direction quickly.  The big orange orb would then seem to chase them almost like a few kids playing tag with each other.   We are all freaking out so much that we tried to make sense of this occurrence, we even started flying in different directions with the aircraft to view it out of different windows to make sure it wasn't some type of optical allusion out of the one win! dow we first started observing from.   This object was easily (! from wha t it seemed) 5-7 miles off shore.  It even looked as if there was some type of boat near the objects, which in my mind any crew member would have had to have seen these orbs.   Due to the distance between us and these objects I can not say for sure the size of the objects, but for sure there was one larger orange orb (which seemed to be either a mother craft or something, just seemed as if it was in charge) with two much smaller lighter (whitish) orbs.   I know aircraft very well and have been around them my whole life, this was not a plane or a helicopter of any type.  This was not an aircraft/object flown by any human..... this thing shot from ocean level to 4,000 feet in a matter of 2 seconds or less (no exaggeration).   We all know what we saw tonight.  We tried to take video but we only had iPhones which of course could not zoom in on these objects.   We observed as much as we could and than decided that we needed to head back to the airport and land which was around 8pm or! so (give or take a few minutes).   This is hands down one of the craziest experiences of my life.   Might I add we were all perfectly sober too, this is legit and like I said, we all know what we saw.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,28.0316,-82.8214

Defying inertia and gravity with no sound.  Seen by USMC Scout/Sniper To Whom It May Concern,  I make this report of sound mind and sound health. I was a USMC Scout/Sniper from 1988 to 1994. I served in Kuwait and Liberia. I consider myself to be a highly trained observer. Thursday,January 24th I was tired from work and I fell asleep at 7 pm. I woke up at 2 am and I decided to make a cup of coffee. So, after 7 hours of good sleep and a nice big cup of hot coffee I decided to take a walk to a local park approximately 1,500 meters from my home. I live in a beautiful suburb of Sacramento,Ca. Elk Grove, Ca is south of Sacramento. I reside in the southern portion of the city of Elk Grove, Ca. I have, for the last 60 days, been repeating this very same routine. I generally sleep from 7 or 8 pm to 2 or 3 am. I am a professional Sales Manager for a local Elk Grove company and I have clients on the east coast. I start work on my laptop, contacting clients in Rochester, New York at 4 am my time and 7 am Rochester time. The distance from Elk Grove to Sacramento is 17 miles or 27 kilometers. To give an accurate location I used my GPS that comes standard on my cell phone which is a top of the line ""Samsung Galaxy III""... Please note from paragraph 1 that I am a trained Scout / Sniper from the USMC. I know what I saw and with that said I place the following report:  At 3:15 am I was standing in a local park in south Elk Grove.  The park is called ""Machado Dairy Park"" and is 1.0 miles south of Whitelock Pkwy and approx .2 miles west of Bruceville Rd. I was standing in the park about ready to sure-up one of the laces on my boots when I was drawn to some rather odd looking lights in the sky.  Traveling North to South, from Sacramento to Elk Grove I saw 2 craft that were delta shaped, but with the middles cut out resembling more of a chevron type structure.  These 2 craft were darting about the sky at fantastic speeds.  They were making right angle turns and skipping about as if they were on water.  I know enough from my training in the Marine Corps that these 2 craft were definitely intelligently controlled.  It had rained out yesterday,Thursday, here in Elk Grove and in Sacramento quite heavily and there was a lot of water on the grass in which I was standing.  I was going to lie down on the ground and try to quiet my body for a more accurate description because I knew in an instant that what I was observing was something very special.  So, I overcame the wet ground and quickly got into a prone position on my back , I was positioned north to south. The objects displayed a disregard for inertia:  They were flying as if there was no such thing as gravity.  They sped up, then stopped, then flew at a tremendous speed, in my direction, so that to me they (appeared to be) standing still.  The next instant they changed course. ... In other words, the flying objects had overcome gravity. The objects were making no sound that I could hear and were about 1000 ft above my head with a visible ceiling of 3,000 ft.  I could at one instance see another flying object traveling east to west at about 15,000 to 20,000 ft and it had all the typical lights that one would see on a passenger jet ( i'm 100% sure that's what it was).  Quite frequently I see passenger aircraft because I believe that I reside under the approach corridor for Sacramento's airport. I see a lot of aircraft and I know without a shadow of a doubt that these 2 ob! jects were not of this earth, or better yet, if they are, they displayed a secret technology that has been very well kept from the people of this planet. I have my own opinion on that and do not wish to cloud the issues at hand. At one point the craft were speeding up and stopping so quickly that it was as if they would disappear and then reemerge (appear) at another point in the sky.  I could see 3 faint lights at the tip or points of each craft. They were a gun metal black and looked to be perfect in shape.  A perfect triangle with and angle of 60 degrees at each tip.  Equilateral or Delta I believe.  The 2 craft then just quickly sped off in a western direction and within mere seconds were gone from my vantage point. I then quickly ran home and went upstairs and grabbed my binoculars (Vortex 8 x 42  Razor HD ) & my spotting scope (Leopold Tactical Mark 4  12-40x60mm  mil-dot ).  Upon my return I did not see the 2 craft again. I spent another 40 minutes scanning the skies with my binoculars and my scope.  I just saw the usual aircraft for that time of morning. I plan to search the skis later tonight after work with my set of night vision because now I am ""hooked"" as they say.

Based upon the location, I assumed it was military as the coloration was different and appeared in the same vicinity from my vantage point as Moffett Field in Mountain View, California. Upon assent, it was apparent that the object was a missile of sorts as it had a distinct amber trail.  As it climbed in elevation, the relative perceived speed provided a clue the object was much further away that originally thought. It appear to reach the upper atmosphere and the object's propulsion begin to lighten in intensity and then disappear.  I then asked two family members to witness the remaining two launches.  I believe this was probably launched from a vessel at sea given the distance. It appears the path was due South from a launch point somewhere near the Farallon Islands. I don't believe this was extra terrestrial, just some sort of military testing however I can't believe I would have been the only one seeing this as there was plenty of commercial and private aircraft traffic airborne at the time.

It was 23:00hrs. I was out in my backyard having a cigarette before bed. I was looking at the stars when I noted an obvious satellite travelling along a SSW to NNE vector. It passed just parallel along the bottom of the entire length of Ursa Major. That’s when a large pulse of light caught my eye a bit further east of the satellite.  It was a large bright pulse or flash of white light. I scanned for it expecting to see a plane and its running lights.  I couldn’t hear any engines since I expected it to be a small private plane at lower altitude given the size of the flash.  Thinking that the pilot was turning the interior lights on and off. I couldn’t see any usual running lights.  Then (about 10 or 15 seconds after the first flash) there was another flash or pulse, which took place in another spot further along what appeared to be a linear course, travelling away from my position. It was running in a SSW to NNE direction and lower in the sky.  A third flash occurred, the time between flash/pulse 2 and 3 was roughly about the same time between flash/pulse 1 and 2. It had no real shape that I could see, but was brilliant.  From what I could determine, the speed of this second object was constant.  After the third flash, there w! as nothing. As I was scanning the sky in that area I noted yet another light. Higher in sky.  It was a bright orange and larger in size to the satellite I first saw.  It too was travelling in the same direction as the first satellite and it followed basically the same course until it faded out. I am imagining that that was a satellite as well but never saw a brilliant colour of orange like that before. The weather was clear. There were no lights on in the backyard. Stars and constellations were visible.  After a few minutes after seeing the flash I even saw an actual airliner travelling west to east that was passing close to my position but a bit further south.  It had its running lights on and could faintly hear its engines. I have been watching planes at night for years and know the usual flight paths of both commercial and private aircraft in the area.  I have also seen many natural phenomenon like fireballs, falling stars, etc.  I can't really tell what this 3-flash event was.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572

The triangular UFO's were very bright and almost looked as if they were glued together, very close to each other with one immediately behind the other, moving fast across the sky.

The 2 sets of lights following at some distance, were each double lights, one white, one red, neither blinking and were moving at the exact same speed as the triangle lights and in the same direction.   All of these objects were moving much faster than commercial jets fly, going horizon to horizon in about 30 - 45 seconds. There was the sound of a jet coming from the direction of the last set of trailing lights, but sounded like it was even farther back than the last set of lights.  The large triangle shaped lights in the front outlined an enormous object, much bigger than an airliner (8 - 10x larger than a commercial jet) would normally appear at cruising altitude.  A number of air routes cross over our town, but commercial jets are always at very high altitudes here as we have 13,000 ft peaks just outside of town. There are no airports within 100 miles that can anything larger than a Learjet can land at, so it is unlikely that a large commercial jet would be flying at 5,000 ft above us (our town is at 7,500 ft).

The only other detail I noticed was a strange quiet, but this could have been an effect of the shock of the moment.  The object made no sound. I could not surmise the size of the object, or be sure of its solidity, but it appeared large. With my arm outstretched, it was about the size of four of my fists.  Distance unclear.

Four of us, me and my 3 classmates, were laying on the concrete saw the object flying North to South.  I pointed to it the same time a second person next to me saw the object.  Two others on the concrete saw it as well, making it four observers, including myself (all in my Masters program).  It had no lights.  It did, however, have 3 visible circles in a triangular pattern, and a faint fourth circle in the back, making a diamond shape.  The circles looked like, what I would describe, a suction cup.  They were dark on the edges, become lighter towards the center, and were darkest in the center.  It gave the appearance like these circles, we were seeing were cone-like, and we were seeing them from below the cone, from wide end to the tip. What could be seen on the object was only due to the reflection of the city.  It was flying at a medium speed at a lower level from North to South.  It left no trail behind the object.  There was also no sound. We had it in view for about 45 seconds.  I'm assuming it was a lower level because of the reflection of the city lights off its exterior.  What I found most intriguing was that there were no lights on the object as a plane would have on its wings.  There were no red or white lights. The only colors we could make out were shades of gray.  There was only one object.   We tried to get the other three people with us to see the objects, so we stood up, and pointed at it.  However, we lost it in the street lights as our eyes adjusted to the lights.  As we went upstairs, I drew a picture of the object and asked the others if it was what they saw.  All three observers exclaimed, ""YES! That's EXACTLY it!""  We did not feel threatened by it.

I was viewing this sighting from about 2 miles southeast of the intersection of Interstate freeways 5 and 8 in the community called Mission Hills.  Most of the sky was covered in tropical clouds; but there was one large section south and southeast of me which was mostly open blue sky (just a few small clouds).  This open area would be over the San Diego airport.  The clouds were moving southwest to northeast pretty fast.  I saw one round black object that was moving against the wind from north to south towards the San Diego airport.  This black object was not moving fast, but was clearly moving against the wind.  When I saw this object, it was not directly over me, but already southeast of me.  The black object was round and it appeared as a sphere.  At the time of the sighting, I could not tell how big it was; other than it was lar! ger than a weather balloon, but smaller than a commercial jet.  It was just below the few clouds that were in the open area.  These clouds were dipping a little, like it was raining up in the clouds, but the water was not hitting the ground.  The black object was traveling below the main part of the small clouds, but through the wispy part of the clouds that were dipping down.  This object, if it was a balloon or a floating object, would have been traveling with the clouds; but there was no doubt, none, the object was moving north to south against the wind.  This object was did not look like a disc, but more like it was round or a sphere.  I saw it for about one minute.  This object was round and black.  The black color did not reflect or shimmer; but maybe it was rotating.  I did not see it rotate, but there was a rhythmic change from solid black to something other than black.  It would be solid black most of the time, and then a reflective shimmer for a short time.  It was not like the reflective shimmer you see when there is an aluminum balloon floating by.  There are no words for it, but maybe half-way between simi-transparent and the aluminum reflective shimmer of a balloon.  I don’t know if that makes sense; but the object was a solid black round object for most of the time, but then for a short few seconds, it would almost become transparent.  And then back to black, a very solid black.  I should have timed the rhythmic change; but I did not think of doing that during the sighting.  There were no lights on this object and it did not make any sound.  After a minute, it was too far away to see.  I did not have a camera with me.  I had that sighting yesterday afternoon in full sunlight.  I was not able to judge the size of the craft; but this morning, Sunday morning, a military transport jet flew by the same location at the same elevation, just below the clouds.  So now, since I just saw a jet about in the same location, the black object I saw yesterday would be the size of the tail wing section; but of course, filled in as a sphere. ((NOTE FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC WEBSITE)) Anyway it may be minor but I found one suspicious report in my own neighborhood or perhaps the reporter was just confused. San Diego, 9/22/2012 16:45.  Witness twice stated that the object that they witnessed  was ""South and Southeast"" of their location (In Mission Hills.) ""over the San Diego Airport"" ( Lindbergh Field?). That airport is SOUTHWEST of Mission Hills. Of course this could be a typo. They stated that the wind was from the southeast to general North, the exact opposite of the norm in this area but not unheard of. They further stated that this was one reason they were awed as the craft flew against the wind ( Eliminating balloons.). Well if the wind direction they described was accurate then aircraft landing at Lindbergh Field would in fact be landing in the direction of the craft sited. As this is unusual, likely the witness has rarely if ever seen aircraft in this pattern and mistook a final approach for an unknown object. I also note that the time, 16:45 is prime landing time at Lindbergh. ((END))",2012-09-24T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

On the Petaluma side.  We pulled off the highway and stopped, facing in a southerly direction. Red Honda Civic in case anybody saw us. We saw 5 lights, in a generally straight line and roughly equidistant.  Slowly traveling east and ascending. They were a light, muddy red color, 2-3x larger than a planet in the sky and noticeably twinkling.  Twinkling a bit too much for a lower altitude ""light"". When we first noticed them, the furthest away and lowest light was at our right and just above the hills on the coast hills on the west side of the north Petaluma farmland, about 6 miles away, perhaps near and above the Two Rock Coast Guard station/Tracon Petaluma (707) 765-7000.  Maybe at 500-1000 ft above the ground. The closest light to us was to our south, in front of us and higher than the one to the right. Then, 3 formed a loose group up high in front of us and winked out.  The other 2 traveled towards where the loose group was and winked out, one by one, in about the same area, at maybe 6000 to 10,000 ft.  They stayed about the same size, maybe a little larger as they traveled from our right, to right ahead of and above us. After the first 3 disappeared and the other two started traveling in the same direction, 2-3 other new identical ""lights"" winked into existence low over the hills to our right, roughly equally spaced and followed the others to the same general area and winked out. We tried to call Petaluma Coast Guard Tracen. Not open. It wasn't airplanes or helicopters - no red beacon or red/green nav lights. They moved too quickly to be balloons and too slow for jets and who ever heard of jets forming a sloppy 3 unit group in 6 miles? No matter which direction these objects were traveling (it seemed that their direction varied slightly), their brightness remained consistent. The surface winds were light and from the west. It wasn't high altitude objects with the setting sun reflecting on it, because we were on the wrong side of the object for a reflection. The objects were to far away to hear if they made any sound. Literally, 300-500 people must have passed us on the highway.

On the evening of September 22, 2012 @ 0755 central time, I stepped out of my ham shack for a little break.  The door to my ham shack is facing east.  It was dark outside and the moon was low in the South West at the time.    I noticed a reddish, orange glow in the sky above my garage.  The glow was located about 50 degrees off of the horizon in the northeast direction which is about 15 degrees north from my ham shack.  This glow seemed to be moving in a south east direction.  When I first noticed the glow, it was fairly large and when it disappeared it was about ¼ its original size.  I watched it move across the sky for about 3 to 5 minutes before it seem to completely disappear. About a minute before it disappeared, I ran to my house and alerted my wife who also witnessed it for about one minute before it disappeared.  When it disappeared it wasn’t due to it going over the horizon, it was like a switch was turned off and it disappeared about 30 degrees over the southeast horizon.   The glow seemed to have a small tail on it and it appeared to be glowing.  This tail was more dominate while the glow was in the northeast sky than it was in the south east sky; it reminded me of a Chinese lantern.  I could not tell how high it was due to lack of clouds or anything else to gauge its distance from. I do remember that there was no sound at all from the glow.   The glow seemed to moving in a straight line, there was no noticeable maneuvering from the glow.   I was raised on various USAF bases around the world for 18 years, and then served 16 years in the US Navy.  I have seen lots of aircraft in the sky at night but this type of glow I have never seen before.

She described the same thing without knowing what we saw. My daughter stated I guess you saw the same thing. The duration of sight was about a minute and a half. The direction it came from contains a large beaver pond, with the way it looked I believe it had come and submerged in the pond using the rod as a periscope or air supply. It scared the birds from the water as it emerged and probably emitted a high frequency to cause the coyote’s to yelp.

I was outside last night 08-14-2012 (I thought) around 7:30PM. I sensed something in the sky, looked up and a few seconds later I saw a large bright fireball appear and move upwards. There was no visible craft near the fireball. The fireball left a single (short) very bright trail which then split into two separate trails and recombined back into one.  The trails were intermittent (visible then not visible). After the trail stopped, a very small craft (in relation to the trails) appeared by itself with a violet aura around it. It was there for a for a few seconds then disappeared (did not appear to move off, just disappeared). The trail began again farther up (but with no visible craft). It is difficult to judge what the size of the craft was because of the distance it was from me. There was no sound noticeable at any time. Total time of event was a little over one minute. I thought this happened last night (08-14-2012). However, when I went to place the date/time stamp on the images, the date said 08-12-2012. I checked the camera and the date/time is correct. I cannot account for the time differential. I do have memories of the last few days. However, when I try to remember specifics about that time, my memories are incomplete/jumbled.  This has happened quite a few times before. Usually it’s almost impossible to reconcile such time inconsistencies unless there is some type of anomaly that occurs (in this case photos with a time/date stamp, or a receipt, a specific event or some other type of evidence that can be used as an anchor point to help account for any missing time).

My house is on the fringe of the countryside, at the edge of Wayne county and bordering Washtenaw county.  I was alone when I witnessed this. Just as I opened my garage door, my attention was caught by a flash of light. It was brighter than most meteors I’ve observed before.  This object entered from the North at about 20-25 degrees above the horizon.  It had a plasma type trail wider, brighter than anything I’ve ever seen and it was traveling faster than any known object I’ve witnessed, such as meteors or conventional propulsion craft.  The air had a slight electrical discharge and a very faint crackling sound as it appeared out of nowhere in the sky as it headed from the North to the South covering about a third of the horizon in travel distance, over what would be from my direction looking North East toward I-275 and the area North East of that highway.  This would be in the areas of Livonia, Southfield on up toward Warren, Michigan. At first I thought it to be a meteor, however, I instantly looked to the end of the flash and noticed a shape appearing that of a craft about a mile up or more, possible disk shaped with a corona type discharge around the craft, making it look like it had some sort of field generation effect around the craft. From my vantage point it had stopped in midair, just pass the I-275/M14 interchange for about 1-2 seconds, then traversed back the way in came, but much slower like an aircraft.   It zig zagged  to the East direction, went straight up, zig zagged some more in the same direction and again went further straight up, taking what appeared to be an orbit like a satellite with the same speed as one, heading toward Lake St. Clair, Canada.

This event took place in the fall of 2006.  I’m not sure the day or the exact month, it was either September or November.  The time was around 11:00-12:00 noon.  I was at work in Detroit.  My office was at the Renaissance building, with my desk having a window view facing the city of Windsor, over looking the Detroit River. While I was busy talking on the phone, I noticed a small, bright light that was traveling up the river that had just passed the Ambassador Bridge that connects the USA with Canada.  At first I thought it was a small airplane or something similar, until it was close enough to notice it was a round shaped sphere.  It had a very highly polished metal that was reflecting the Sun and giving the appearance of a lighted craft.   My co-worker and I both looked taken back, as this machine was bopping up and down in the air over the river, about 20 feet or more above the surface.  It was about 10 feet in diameter or so it appeared. It made no noise, as all craft that travel on the river or anywhere in our tower can hear just about all noises from vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, etc.  The building is not very good for keeping sounds out. This machine was solid looking all over, no visible portals or attachments.  It had a round, small black little ball that traveled around the object about every second that was not attached.  The sphere turned in front of the Renaissance building and headed toward the Canadian side of the river.  Went up and over the Windsor hotel, still not high in the air, about 20 feet or so.  Weaving, bobbing ever so slightly, not traveling as though it was in a hurry, but rather seemed to be checking things out is what it felt like to us.  It climbed up and went up into a small black rain cloud.  The black rain cloud looked odd to us for some reason.  Also, it was the only cloud visible on a clear blue day.  I could see jets taking off in the background at the Windsor airport.  My co-worker and I watched the rain cloud for a long time, at least 5-10 minutes, until the cloud dissipated.  The machine never came out or went through the cloud to the other side.  I inquired with people in the building ! who would have had a good chance of hearing or seeing anything that goes on in the area.  As far as I know, we were the only people to see it, but I find it rather hard to believe, as this was broad daylight during lunchtime in downtown Detroit.

It was around late summer or early fall, sometime in the early evening.  It had previously been raining.  The street lights from the end of our block toward the town were all working, but our block leading up towards the weather center were all out.  Our lights in the house had also gone out, first time since we moved there.  I looked out our bedroom window and saw at least a dozen lights moving around in a neighbors yard.  I thought it was probably little children running around playing with flashlights, but I didn´t see any children.   I watched two or three minutes and then the lights all darted upward at the same time, way over the top of their house, probably a dozen or more lights, and all took the shape of a circle of lights going round. I called my husband and he came and watched the circle of lights with me for several more minutes.  Then they started separating and going off in different directions.  One ball of light came over the top of our tree line and ! went back and forth several times along the tops.  It looked like a small sphere, maybe the size of a softball, and it was the color of a really soft but vibrant and pulsating blue.  After a few minutes it came down the side of our trees on the treeline, and then traveled in a very fast motion across the flower garden just under the trees, back and forth, just as it had done across the tops of the treeline.  It did that for another couple minutes and then came directly across the yard in a very straight and direct line, toward the window where we were standing. Half way between the treeline and our window it stopped abruptly.  It just stayed in place about a foot and a half above the grass, kind of pulsating and spinning at the same time.  We watched for another couple minutes and for some reason I got a really bad feeling.  The window we were standing in was one of those that went nearly ceiling to floor.  My husband stayed watching it there.  I went to the laundry room where ther! e was a smaller window higher up, where I could kind of just p! eek out. Then, it started moving quickly again, back to the flower garden, back and forth a few times, back up the treeline and back and forth over the tops of the trees, for several more minutes. Then all of a sudden it just took off in my direction again and sailed right underneath the window I´d been watching from, out the other side of the house, down the driveway, and just disappeared. We knew by the way that thing acted, it was not any kind of swampgas. It appeared to move with precision and deliberation. Within less than a minute, all the street lights on our block and in the house came back on. We thought about calling the PD, or weather station to ask what it might be, or if anyone else saw or reported anything, but thought they would think we were a nuts or making it up. We really weren´t into much knowledge of UFO things and didn´t really know what to think. We don´t drink, we don´t smoke, we don´t do drugs, and it wasn´t in the middle of the night where we had just woken! up or anything like that, so we know what we saw was real. We just don´t know what it was. We were always the type that believes there is a logical explanation for everything. A couple days later we were talking about what it might have been, and our teen aged son overheard us. He began telling us that at the same time, while the lights had been out the day that same day we saw the lights, he had been up in his bedroom and saw a bunch of little round light, floating around just below the ceiling in his bedroom. He said he thought they were different colors, but since he is color blind he wasn´t sure what colors they werem some were just darker than others. He said he looked out his upstairs bedroom window (his room was on the opposite side of the house) because he thought maybe it was flashes from an emergency vehicle, but that when he looked out, nothing was there, and when he closed the window they were gone, so he had just ignored it all, and hadn´t thought anymore abou! t it. It has been a few years since that early evening,and we ! moved ov erseas, but we have not been able to forget about that experience. If anyone else has seen those kinds of things, we sure wish we knew what it could have been. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Delta flight #840 was scheduled to depart Las Vegas at 7:55 AM for arrival in Salt Lake City at 10:20 AM.  Following the layover, Skywest Air (Delta partner) flight #4524 was scheduled to depart Salt Lake City at 11:05 AM for arrival in Denver at 12:32 PM. During one of these two flights (I am having difficulty finding the note I made on which flight) I looked out of the right side of the plane (I had a window seat).  Traveling in the opposite direction of the plane, at an altitude a bit lower than the plane, and at a distance of approximately 120 - 250 meters away, I clearly observed a gray metal sphere.   The object had a diameter that was approximately the same as an exercise ball (or about 2.5 or 3.5 feet).  I was immediately shaken /startled at how close this sphere was to the airplane.   I thought to myself that this object, and it was clearly an object, could have been a severe threat had it collided with our aircraft.  I discussed it with nobody as (1) it was gone in an instant and (2) I was concerned that a report may draw alarm by the passengers or airline crew, even though the object harmlessly passed by.   I do not know if other passengers or crew saw the object.  However, I did imagine that others who looked out the window would have likely seen it. Again it was moving in the opposite direction of the plane at a trajectory that was roughly parallel to our travel path.  So, it is difficult to approximate the speed of the object as both the plane and the sphere were both in motion. There are no photos or video of this event, as I could not react quickly enough.   I plan to continue to search for my notes that may help specify which of the two flights corresponded with the sighting, at which time I will file an updated account with NUFORC.

If I'm outside and an aircraft goes by, I've never been able to keep from observing it. my Grandfather was in the Air Force in his day, and instilled in me a deep appreciation for aviation at an early age. what I'm saying is, although I'm no expert by any stretch, I pay an above average amount of attention to passing aircraft. While driving through a neighborhood just after sunset, I noticed an object in the sky, to the west of my location, headed east. at first I thought it was a helicopter, because through the trees, it's perceived size, altitude, and speed, matched that of the common medical/news/misc chopper you see frequently in the area. we also have frequent, often daily fly overs of apache helicopters as well, but this object seemed to move, at first sighting, a bit faster than the typically observed apache cruising speed. intrigued, I exited the neighborhood and got a better look, with no obstruction from trees. although with RDU very close by, and the area not far from a large commercial flight path, I ruled out fixed wing aircraft immediately because I noticed the object was clearly round, or egg-shaped. within a couple of seconds, a light coming from roughly the center of the object became very bright. I originally mistook this light for a typical forward facing nose or wing-mounted 'headlight'. but, as the craft got closer, and also slowed down very rapidly, and began to hover, the light began to burn bright like fire. at this point, I turned in to another neighborhood street and immediately parked with the object in clear view. it had slowed to almost a complete stop, but with some slight drifting. it's shape was somewhat oval, like an up-side down egg, and had a bright light burning in the center. on a quiet evening with almost no noise pollution, I could hear no sound from coming from the object. all of these characteristics combined to remind me of the many hot air balloons I'd seen growing up in the midwest. however, when it slowed down, it's size and structural shape where much smaller, darker, and solid in appearance. based on it's distance from me, I assessed it to be roughly the size of the average mid-sized suv. the light quickly grew so bright and firey that I realized it was not being put out by the object, but was actually a reflection of the sun, that had just dipped below the horizon. over about 10 seconds, it slowly drifted out of the waning sunbeam, and went completely dark. it had no lights of it's own, but was still very visible in the still back-lit light blue sky. after pursuing it's original course when I first sighted it, which I perceived to be eastward, and then pausing to drift for 10-15 seconds, it begin to move and pick up speed in a north-west direction. I pursued it through the neighborhood, but came to a dead end, and the object quickly disappeared behind a treeline. when I was able to get out to the main road, and searched in the area I thought it to be headed, it was nowhere to be seen. so, overall, I observed an object that appeared to be several hundred feet up, and several hundred feet away. round or oval shape, dark, with no lights. no sound that I could hear. this was right around the intersection of High House and 55 in Cary.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,35.78376197916666,-78.80133489583334

At first, I thought it was just a star. The longer I looked at it, the more details I could see. It almost seems shaped like the symbol from the Blair Witch films (best way to describe it). It's a cross with ends pointing out in different directions. Two red lights can be seen circling around it at times. It appears in the same general location of the sky almost every night. It seems to move at a painfully slow pace.  It just hovers for a long time. I check back on it every few minutes and it has barely moved from view behind a large tree outside my apartment. The even stranger thing is that very small looking planes seems to fly right past it constantly.  These are tiny red lights that flash quickly and fly fast.  One night it seemed like two of them were harnessed together and then the one in the back just dropped from the sky and vanished. Tonight my strange star in the sky, slowly shrunk until it was almost invisible to me.  It was strange because at first I thought a cloud had passed in front of it (though I believe it may be too low in the sky for that).  But it just appeared to get more and more hazy until it was just a pin prick of what it once was. So, I have no idea what to call this thing that appears here nightly.

I was looking to see what they had pulled off for, and as we passed I saw that one person had either a camera or phone pointed up at about a 45-50 degree angle in front of him. It was odd because it was dark and all that was in front of him at that angle would be either a fence, a house's rooftop or the sky. So I was ""rubbernecking"", then some lights caught my attention in the dark sky, in the direction where he was pointing his camera/phone at (West of us). I saw a line of a number of glowing reddish orange glowing orbs, lighter and bright at the center, lined up in an arc formation moving from left to right and up, in the sky. I shouted out to my family to look, look, look, a line of strange reddish lights. I realized why the people had pulled off and what they must have been taking pictures of. My husband who was driving, also saw the lights I was shouting about and pulled off the road too. We were now ahead of the other car, with their headlights facing us. My husband and I got out of the car and watched, calling our daughter to come look. She did, but seemed scared and hesitant. None of us recognized what they could be, orb shaped, with that reddish orange glow, brighter and lighter in the center. It was obvious to us that they were not planes from how they looked, moved, lined up and disappeared. There was also a plane flying in the opposite direction toward them off to the right, likely intending to land at the airport in that general area..

I only indicated 3 who saw this, counting only my family though I know at least 2 other strangers saw it as well. I wondered if the people in the plane did also. Eventually all disappeared.

Lake Charles native got a close up view of a large hovering disk on the hwy between Lake Charles and Bell City.,Holmwood,LA,1984-06-20T20:20:00,oval,25 minutes,"Occurred : 6/20/1984 20:20  (Entered as : 06/20/84 20:20) Reported: 4/8/2012 11:27:58 PM 23:27 Posted: 4/18/2012 Location: Holmwood, LA Shape: Oval Duration:25 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88280.html,"Lake Charles native got a close up view of a large hovering disk on the hwy between Lake Charles and Bell City. A friend and I were driving on Hwy 14 from Lake Charles LA, heading to Bell City LA to visit a friend for the evening. A few miles from Holmwood, LA; and after making one of the curves onto a long straight away, we saw a set of very bright lights appear about a mile or two in the distance. The lights were like two flood lights, side by side. They were close together similar to car headlights and were positioned off the right side of the road; they appeared to be about fifty feet or so in the air. I commented that it looked like a car was sitting on top of a telephone pole with its bright headlights on. I started to slow the vehicle down as I got closer and closer to the lights. My friend and I began discussing and trying to figure out what they could be. I could not detect any movement from the lights, which led me to the early conclusion they must be on some kind of structure such as a light tower or possibly a new drilling rig that I had not noticed before. As we got closer and closer to their location, the lights looked more and more out of place and so I started slowing down so we could get a good look as we went by. I was traveling about 30 mph by the time we got to within 1000 ft of the lights. There was ample moonlight and so we began to be able to see that the lights were coming from a large oval shaped object that was sitting about twenty five feet off the right side of the road, and approximately forty feet in the air. We coasted past the object at about 15 mph with the windows open, looking directly up at it as we slowly passed by. The object was a bronze colored, metallic oval disc. It was maybe a little longer than a city bus, about thirty feet wide and probably about twenty feet thick. There was a series of lights that ran all the way around its circumference, and also on its underside that we could not see until we had cleared the bright frontal beams. My heart began thumping in my chest and my mind raced as I tried to comprehend what I was seeing. The realization hit me that I was looking at something beyond the scope of my understanding when I saw that there was no tower - or structure of any kind supporting this object in mid-air; nor was there anything above that the object that it could have been suspended from. This massive object that I was staring up at was just frozen in mid air. It wasn’t hovering like a helicopter or a jump jet, which can hover in one place in the air; those types of craft have a degree of movement that you can detect as they work to hold their place. This object looked as if it were being held in place. It was absolutely, completely, perfectly still. It appeared to be “at rest” in mid- air. The most astonishing thing about it, which my mind could not reconcile and what made the object completely unexplainable to me was the fact that it did this in complete silence. I knew that we were looking at some type of craft, so the total lack of any sound defied logic and eliminated every propulsion system that I had ever heard of. I could not wrap my mind around how something so big, could hold so perfectly still without making so much as a whisper. I just kept asking myself; “why isn’t this thing making any noise?”  I was struck with a kind of fear I had never experienced before or since. I put the pedal to the floor and sped away.  My friend started yelling for me to stop because she wanted to get a better look at it; and after about a mile, I regained my composure and stopped in the car the middle of the highway. We both got out and stood there, looking back at the object which from behind, and because of the distance was just a hovering light off the side of the road. After about a minute the lights became bright and we realized that the object was moving toward us. We both jumped into the vehicle and took off fast. I accelerated up to about 90 mph but the object caught up to us quickly and pulled even with the car. The object matched our speed and shadowed us about 100 yards off of the right side of our vehicle. When I slowed down to make the big curve toward Bell City, the object crossed the highway behind us and pulled around the left side of our car, still 100 yards or so off the highway. It stayed right with us so I just continued at normal speed for the remaining 20 minutes of our trip. When we arrived at our destination, we immediately got out of the car and stood in the driveway where we watched the object climb several thousand feet rapidly, and then pass directly overhead. We spent several minutes watching the skies but the object did not return. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-04-18T00:00:00,,

Back of my house was facing the bayou and across of that was just empty space (later on apartments were build there)    As I started to walk I looked at the sky and saw full moon on my left across the bayou over the empty space.  And something felt strange: moon looked reddish and was low, not up in the sky.  And then I looked to the right of me, and there was a real moon in the sky!  I suddenly was scared and run as fast as I could to the bus stop. Next morning I decided to take a long way to the bus stop (it was a different stop and it would take me 10 minutes longer, but I would by walking by houses in the neighborhood).  As I turn to one of the streets I saw a black van parked on the street in front of one of the houses and in near the van I saw 2 tall men standing and watch what I thought several children playing on the front yard; I am nearsighted so it took me sometime when I came near the children to see that it was not children, and either I blocked instantly what those beings look like or it was blocked from me.  I was terrified  from what I saw and I could not even describe it immediately when  I happened.  I started to run (in my mind I heard that they were amused my terror).  I run all the way to the bus.

But here is what happen… We were hunting outside the town of Jasper , Fl on some leased land for a private hunting club. There were only 3 of us at the end of the day, and we were responsible for locking-up the main-gate to the entrance. The main road entrance runs perpendicular across a power-line with 200 yds wide of clearnce- very clear night, no obstructions of view, etc...  As I sat there listening to my Step-Dad and his Friend talk, I noticed a 3 light configuration moving in a circular pattern- but remaining in the same altitude -not moving up or down or side to side -just hovering... (cannot remember EXACT colors now) but it startled me enough to point it out to Wayne. This OBJECT was so close that I knew it should be making some sort of sound.!  And as a 16 year old kid, (at the time- 44 now) I realized  that Wayne and his friend were as curious and unsure of WHAT IT WAS as I was. In fact, enough that I begin to back up quit scared - to be honest! As I stepped backward toward the truck- intently watching this thing- it vanished.  It was at that moment I remember hearing Wayne and his friennd say, ""Why didn't it make any sound?"" And I looked to my right, at the same exact angle, but to the right-side this time, there it was AGAIN! Not making any sound, but visible lights rotating... I got so scared that I got into the truck and begged Wayne to get in also, and let's go!  It disappeared finally, and we left rather starteld. It must of lasted about 3-4 minutes total, and 'the thing that scared me the most' (my Dad was a U.S.A.F.

Coming down the grapevine from LA we encountered pea soup fog but kept going slow because of drinking a lot of coffee, wanting to get to San Rafael on Thursday before Grateful Dead Halloween shows (Marin County civic center). Just about every other vehicle had pulled off because of dense fog. We finally came out of the fog and I was remarking how the sky was so clear, stars bright like in the desert when Janis asked ""what are the weird colors off in the distance?"".  I was just joking, playing with stereo and stated it was a flying saucer.  It looked like it had landed on little landing feet West, SW, some distance away in fields.  Well, I joked it was a UFO and maybe only less than a second later, as if it knew what we were discussing, ((female name deleted)) started going ""don't look now it's right behind us!!!!!"" it was following (pacing) just behind to the left of my car, then pulled right up alongside, (Janis going 'I TOLD YOU NOT TO LOOK!!), started doing every most outrageous seemingly impossible flying stunts you can imagine, including circular flips, just showing off all the stuff it could do, for over 5 minutes. It had a day-glow green color that emanated from it like fibers of light, more bright near what I assume was the metallic object. It was as close as a lane and a half, or 30 feet the whole time, just off the ground barely, so close it made all the hairs on my body stand straight out, like from static electricity. We were going ""oh, sh*t"" and stuff like that when it took off like a slingshot, disappearing in horizon to left of very straight road goes all the way north. Well, we were discussing it at length, saying I never imagined one like that could truly be until we saw it like 30 feet away. I think it was about the size of one and a half Lincoln continentals, round, saucer shaped, domed, we both think it may have had some portholes. We were wondering how on earth it could do somersaults and stuff like that, when it came back, a little more higher, flying (facing from underneath sort of) us from directly ahead for a minute or so, we were going ""whoa..."" again, when I think something came on or opened underneath it, only time it made any noise, and started the bright spotlight on my car, which had of a! ll things, a bumper sticker that said : ""STARSHIP"" on the front (for rock band Jefferson Starship). Well, it made a noise like a hatch opened, then the white light started, with a vzzzzzzzzzzz sound that got louder until it was as bright or brighter than sunlight, like a spotlight on my car, pacing ahead (little higher this time, yes) until it got to it's full brightness and loudness, by then going VVVVVAAZZZZZZZZZ, when I seized the opportunity to tell her to wave at it as a friendly gesture, as now it had given me a feeling of inner peace, knowing there must be life elsewhere, then it made a Kkuh sound, and the buzzing noise subsided at the same time the light dimmed, I think I heard a hatch close, then it repeated the taking off like a slingshot again, just to left of road, then took off in the horizon, a little more left (didn't need a road). Well, we were feeling a bit too overcome to stop at the windmill truck stop as we came up on it, but called ok, time out, and pulled it off in the rest area just past windmill a ways. We were feeling a bit weirded-out, when some French guy I swear looked kike Marcelle Truffaut or something right out of the movie close encounters, just like the saucer, comes running up frantically waving his arms, hollering something about a ""phenomena fantastique!!!!!"", just gave him a weird look, like, yeah, we saw something like that back there.  Yes, I think it was Thursday morn' way early then, just before Halloween of '83, so we kept going north, starting to feel a bit haggard.  Going back after visiting friends in Mendocino, we tried to tell where we first saw it, just past the fog, well south of the air base, and realized there was nothing there for maybe over a hundred miles or more except some cattle, they were making colored lights of all colors for some cattle??   Well, I shrugged it ! off as just an 'ornry cattle saucer' but looked up much researching over the years to this day to see who else may have seen that saucer, far as I could tell, just her and I and this French guy maybe and maybe 2 or 3 trucks headed south maybe saw it zipping by, don't know.  ((female name deleted)), being a bit of an artist, drew a picture of it with the words ""genuine ufo"" underneath.  I didn't need to have made any photography anyways, as I have a DVD where it is called one of what are known as the ""Guardian Saucers"" in Vancouver, Canada, I think, where it had all the multi-colors from underneath, yeah, made my skin feel like it wanted crawl when I first saw the video, yeah, like it was just like something we saw, for real.  She won't discuss it anymore because she said she had some bad dreams about it.  Had some strange dreams myself, except more friendly, and peaceful, seeing all these drawings and video stories about grey extraterrestrials with enlarged heads and large black eyes that stare ! into a void or something.  Now I have a friend Susan, who tried! at firs t to keep changing the subject, but with my ongoing research, she's been saying ""Malcolm if I saw something like that I think I would be so SCARED"" to which I replied yeah?,  I guess if you think it would make you so scared it would, if you think it would make you have bad dreams it would, and yes, as in my case, if you think it would give you a feeling of inner peace, probably WOULD. I know, I had always studied astronomy since I was a youngster so interested in it my family bought me a telescope. I joined the San Francisco amateur astronomers, had always had a more Saganistic approach towards the subject, even though many friends had pointed out ""things in the distance"" or had even related their own encounters, just thought, sure, sure, bah. Now I wonder, what would Carl Sagan himself had thought if one of those came up and did a lot of aerial acrobatics from like 30 feet away, it's unmistakable. Your welcome to forward my sighting to carlsagan.com, etc., get tired of rela! ting it or finding WHERE to. Still have an intense interest in cosmology, even more now although I think many cosmologists views would have or will change after seeing a thing like that from only 30 feet. Some friends may feel my Star Trek stories are more real in their view, I really have nothing to prove and don't care if they like astrophysics, x-files or Rael. I know I had the SETI screensaver for some time. I'd just like to find out if anyone shared our sightings that night other than us, I'd appreciate if you could in exchange for my story email it back to me so I don't have to keep going over it, I will have my official story reported and on file now, special thanks.  Feel free to contact me for any further details, if some stuffed shirt gov't guys come having too many questions or something adverse you know, it might have been the planet Venus, just the planet Venus (chuckles) heh, heh if that's what they want people to think from their view, fine by me, I guess they just want people to have the feeling of security that ""only the air force controls the skies over the US"", really don't care, someone going to give me too hard a time over it I'll just forget I saw anything same as Janis, big deal, sheez. Cheers, Malcolm <*snip*>  ------------------------------------------------------     UPDATES! May 03, 2006  Thank you very much, I can feel at peace now getting the story off my back, not knowing who to tell. I have the page bookmarked for reference, thanks. Only thing I might add, I felt it had peaceful vibes, because anything that advanced that meant harm could have done anything bad, although I woulden't recommend shooting at them like the air force. I think maybe what was up with the spotlight maybe they were making some kind of video starlog for their mothership maybe. I had thought I could have made some sort of hand signals like pounding my chest and pointing up to show I might like to go with them someday. I can't figure why people refuse to believe our sighting so much, conditioning perhaps, like in trying to suggest it was reflections of the planet Venus or something, I uh sure don't th9ink so. All I can say is if you see one close up like that from 30 feet or so, being so apparently unmistakable, remember I said they are out there for super real, wayn more than anything! fictional or imagined. I have the drawing in a storage in Orange Co., if I can ever dig it out someday I'll forward it, I think you all must know the variety of craft though, try freezing shots of the Canadian ""Guardian Saucers"". Love your web site, hope this may be of help to your research and readers, thanks. Please though, if anyone saw that saucer that night please let me know, a whole library of books seems to suggest there wasen't, hmm.

I was looking out the windshield and started seeing something shiny and small coming toward me about 60ft in the air.  There was a small antenna tower behind the building I was in front of so I tried to estimate the height by the tower. It couldn't have been much higher than that. The closer it got the more confused I became.  At first (with the sun setting behind) I thought it was an ultralight flying due to the slowness and altitude.  But then I realized it wasn't one object but 5.  I have excellent vision, especially from far off, so I knew within the space of about 30 seconds it was more than one thing coming in my direction.   As it flew closer and went over my head it seemed like they were almost floating.  They were totally silent. They looked like big chrome balls, about 2.5-3 feet in diameter, and they were in a v-formation.  The reason I say ""chrome"" is because I could see reflections of everything around me in the balls.  Maybe they were mirrored, I don't know.  They flew right over my head and just kept going. I lost sight of them almost immediately because across the street from where I was parked there is a farmhouse with big oaks in the front yard. It looked like they were traveling roughly parallel to Steele Rd.  I have never come across anything like that in any description of a ufo.

At about 11pm, on October 16, 1992, just after I reached up to turn off the lamp above my bed, my room was filled with dazzling yellow light, as bright as daylight.  Thinking a transformer had blown on the power lines on the next street, I got up to look out the window.  The light coming in between the curtains was warm to my skin, like sunlight.  The source of the light seemed to be very close to the window.  I, then, wondered if someone were on the roof of the neighboring warehouse, shining some sort of light around the roof.  Earlier in the day, I the dirigible had made a chugging sound, and this light source made no sound. When I opened my curtains, I saw a small, round, Oreo cookie-shaped vehicle, with a domed top and bottom.  In the center layer were small round lights on the outer ring of the craft.  The lights were amber in color.  From the bottom, emitted the singular, enormous light beam I had seen coming through my window.  The craft was about twelve to fifteen feet above my window and seemed to be about three and a half feet in diameter.  It was slowly ascending from the roof of the adjacent warehouse. By now, the light beam was no longer pointed towards my window, but had swung away from it, shining along the wall to the back garden and the adjacent warehouse that made an L-shaped wall around the garden.  It shone on the garden for a brief moment, then, swung back so that it was perpendicular to the craft.  Then, it retracted into the craft and the entire vehicle disappeared.  It had not made a sound. I woke my next door neighbor who reported seeing two beams of light coming through his window earlier, maybe 30 minutes before my experience.  He said that one beam had been blue and the other had been amber.  His windows faced the warehouse wall below where I saw the craft. He had been too tired to get out of bed to investigate. At this point, it was midnight and I could not account for an entire hour of my time. We went outside to see if we could see the lights or anything unusual, but we saw nothing.  No one on the street seemed to be looking surprized or paying any attention to the building where we had seen the light.  My neighbor climbed on the roof of the warehouse to see if there was evidence of something having been there, but he found nothing. The next day, the elderly woman who lived in the apartment directly above mine reported being frightened by the bright light shining in her window the night before.  She did not open the curtains to directly observe the light.  She had lived in the building for 40+ years and was terrified of this light that night, deciding, ""It was a sign from God!""   Also, prior to seeing the light, my apartment had smelled strange, as if something hot and metallic were burning a bit.  I even checked my oven to see if the smell emitted from there, but it did not.  The other peculiar thing is that an electric alarm clock kept buzzing--not with the alarm sound, but with an electrical hum--in the hours directly preceding my sighting of this craft.  This clock was on a bureau beside the window from which I had seen the craft. Ten months prior to this experience, in mid-January 1992, a bright light had awoken me around 2am. (My room was normally very dark, sheltered from outside street lights.)   My boyfriend was staring at the light, but did not respond when I asked him what it was.  In this instance, I did not get up and investigate.  I was too frightened to get out of bed.  The light lasted a moment or two and went out. The next morning, my boyfriend did not recall seeing any light in the middle of the night. I think that this was the same craft perhaps visiting on two separate occasions.  The warehouse on which it was located stores food for a large local restaurant, but particularly houses many whole potatoes that are cut up to make a popular item at the restaurant.  My building and the warehouse were owned by the same person.  I did verify with the building maintenance personnel that no one had been on the warehouse roof with a light.  They all said that they had not been up there and that no light of that candle power was on the property, nor any other thing that could have looked like what was seen.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,40.443091945513764,-79.97424169381107

It seemed odd to me somehow so I watched it but continued to walk.  I would describe it as a silver metallic, teardrop-shaped object.  It stood out very plainly against the backdrop of a dark storm cloud that was coming in from the northwest.  (I might not never have seen it, if not for that.)  Anyway, even though it seemed to be moving just a bit too fast to be an aircraft, I really didn't think too much of it right away.  I just assumed that's what it actually was because I live so close to the military base.  I continued to watch it for several seconds, when suddenly it just came to a full stop in mid air!  I was stunned!  Needless to say, I stopped walking and just stood there and watched it.  It then started to move very erratically, changing speeds and directions seemingly at random.  It would occasionally stop and then start moving again.  The way it “danced” and “wiggled”, it made me think of a drop of mercury.  I watched it for about 30 seconds at most before it finally stopped in mid air one final time and then shot up straight into the sky like a slingshot and vanished.  It should be noted that the main gate of Eglin Air Force Base is barely 2 miles north of the town I live in (Shalimar, Florida) and this object appeared to me to be in the skies just to the west of the base's main gate.

I was outside, smoking a cigarette on my balcony when I realized the sky had cleared up from its cloudy & rainy state, earlier today.  I could see some stars, so I moved forward on the balcony to get a better view.  There are a lot of trees on my property. Immediately, a strange looking star caught my eye.  It seemed to move around like a bug-- going side to side and up & down, all while moving diagonally upward-- but was shining brilliantly.  I noticed there was a hint of a warm color in it, but could not determine which one.  Red?   Yellowish?  Thinking it might be a satellite, I kept my eyes fixed and saw that it was not just one light, though one was brighter than the rest, there was a line of lights, like matinee lights, lighting from front to back in succession. I felt quite dizzy from the sight, as I have never seen anything of the sort before... & let's just say I am a skeptic on the idea of alien UFOs.  It continued to dart around, making me move about my upstairs deck to catch it through trees, until it was visible in a clearing, unobstructed.  I had doubted what I had seen until this moment, when I felt sickeningly certain of the bizarre lights and even more bizarre movements.  Suddenly, it stopped. I thought my eyes were strained because it became more and more difficult to see.  The light became a pinpoint in the sky, hardly visible, and then disappeared completely. I waited around a little, then went back inside to look up sightings, though I believe it was probably too soon.  After a moments searching,  I decided to go back out for another look.  I stood where I had been on the balcony when the lights vanished, and looked around, examining each star I could see in the area.  I feel very hesitant to describe my next experience, as I could just be hyper sensitive due to the mind-blowing phenomena, but I sensed something out of the corner of my eye, very close to me that made me panic, briefly.  I was in the front corner of the balcony, second story, and to that corner of my eye there should have only been air-- it was beyond the railing.  Strangely, I ignored it and my panic, still scrutinizing the patch of night sky, and then I became overly aware of the ""thing"" next to me.

I pulled halfway into our driveway but had to stop because the glowing object was so large that it startled me.  I thought maybe they had a big promotion using some sort of light to shoot their image straight up into the air, because it was not moving and it was stationary just over my neighbors house.  However, I could not see any lights underneath or around it and there were no letters or symbols. When I stepped out of the car, I realized that the object was not a sign, airplane or anything I have ever seen before. I reached for my cell phone to call my husband to come out of the house and see what I was looking at.  However, before he could run downstairs the object started moving slowly away (to the East) as if it noticed that I was watching it.  It began to become smaller and smaller as it slowly moved east from our area.  We both video taped it on our cell phones when it was leaving as it elevated into the sky.  As it gained altitude, it was noticable that the speed was increasing before it disappeared, even as it was moving away from us. We called the news station to report it, but they told us they were getting ready to go on air and hung up.  I managed to get a pretty good video of the color.  It is difficult to describe the experience because it is not something that I have seen before.  Looking at our cell phones, it lasted for no more than 10 minutes.  Did anyone else see this same sighting?   Description:   It looked like the shape of the Shell logo (a triangle with a circle on top) but it was more orange/red on the inside and yellow on the outside.  From my view point (my drive way to above my neighbors home), the object appeared very large, approximately the size of an actual shell gas station sign up in the air and in the shape of an upside down pear diamond. The object was not blinking, it was like watching a shimmering fire but there was no sound and it only shimmered around the outside.  There was more of a shimmer effect from the bottom portion of the object, but the object appeared as a perfect clean shape and not blurry.  So beautiful that I felt mezmerized and immediately had goose bumps. We have 3 videos (2 are taken at the same time from 2 cell phones) and 1 photo (camera was shakey).",2013-02-18T00:00:00,47.82623459119497,-122.3462679245283

Five lights came one one at a time in a perfectly straight horizontal line until they were all on, they stayed on for a second or two, then they all went out at the same time.  A couple of second later, another series of 5 lights came on in the same manner slightly higher and to the right of the first set of lights. These lights were orangish-yellow, with the look of a lantern, or firelight.  They were perfectly clylindrical, with no tails or streaks of any kind.   They were quite high in the sky, almost as high as the moon, which was directly above me at the time.  There are no hills or buildings that they could have been on.  They did not move or blink, they just turned on then they were off and gone.  I tried to get my camera on, but they didn't stay on long enough.   Less than a minute after I saw the first sets of lights, I saw them come on again in roughly th! e same area, but this time only two lights came on in the first, lower set and one in the higher, second set. I pulled my car off to the side of the road to get a better look, and try to get a pic, but once again I didn't have time.   I did get to take a better look at the sky and there were no aircraft of any kind to be seen, and not a cloud in the sky.

All of a sudden, my friend said “Look at that UFO!” I of course laughed thinking he was joking and I looked up in the sky, Northwest of where we were standing.  That’s the direction he was pointing from where we were.  There was a figure, that seemed saucer shaped (it was hard to make it all out because of the clouds) and it was flying, back and forth, up and down, sideways, and even went in circles and upside down. It had no particular pattern to it.  It was a self-illuminating object, and it had a green tint around it.  The object seemed rather large and pretty low to the ground. It rose not too many miles above the trees, from what it appeared.  It wasn’t extremely high, but it wasn’t much higher than a low plane coming closer to the ground to land.  It seemed much larger than any airplane; probably five to ten times bigger. I couldn’t keep my eyes off o! f what we were seeing. The way it was flying was unlike anything we had ever seen. The color of the glow made it even weirder. We were baffled. There was no way it was a plane, helicopter, or anything like that. It wasn’t a shooting star or comet. It wasn’t a light shining from anywhere either. This lasted at least 3 hours that I am aware of. I watched it off and on for about an hour.

We spend a lot of time on our back porch which faces due East, and have been observing this ""light show"" for several years now. We have never heard any sound of overhead aircraft, seen strobe lights from aircraft, or any such visible or audial evidence of any terrestial craft involved with these sightings.  The duration of the ""orange globes"" is usually a matter of 1, 2 or 3 seconds, at most. Usually they appear in singular, but tonight we saw several ""batches"" of 3 to 4 at one time.

These lights individually stayed visible for relatively longer periods of time than the ""normal"" sightings we've had. In other words, they stayed visible for periods of up to 20 seconds, whereas the lights we usually have been observing last approximately 2 to 3 seconds, at most.

This happened in South Charleston, WV. I even mapped the geographical coordinates of where we were laying. I and another witness were at 38.32238,-8172043 laying on a set of monkey bars behind a school both facing northeast. I noticed the object first. It was a yellowish glow high in the sky and I made a joke about how that star looked like it was moving. Upon further investigation I noticed it had been moving. From what I could see it was flying around the same elevation as most aircraft were that night. The night was clear and no cloud coverage at all. There were a lot of other aircraft and one aircraft even flew right into the yellow glowing object, however it looked as if it passed over top of it. The object had no particular flight pattern and moved erratically. Based on surrounding aircraft I would assume it flew at over a 600 miles per hour and would stop and switch directions quickly. It moved in every direction, left to right, up and down, and they weren’t always constant flight patterns. They would also fly from left to right and then slowly sweep upward in a curved motion.  There were multiple other aircraft that were all easily identified even when they were flying at a higher altitude and this flight pattern matched no aircraft possible in the area and had no hazard lights to let you know that it was a normal aircraft. The sighting occurred 6/28/12 from approximately 9:30pm to 11:30 pm. We watched the object move to many different areas of the sky. We actually looked up and placed it to be flying around the Hercules constellation from where we were laying. I took great care to include all accurate details and did have  a witness. This is my first sighting of an object like this, and I’m sure it was no meteor (there was a meteor shower) and I’m positive it was no local aircraft I’ve ever viewed. I tried to film it on my iPhone, unfortunately the ambient light from the light pole wouldn’t allow it to focus and concentrate on the beam. The object was too far away to determine a shape, but it was definitely highly illuminated. We even wondered while watching it how the aircraft could not notice or see this or maybe they had. There was a very unusual amount of air traffic that night too from what I observed, especially for the time frame.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,,

It wasn't a flourescent colored light but more of a pumking color orange light.   At first I only noticed one bright light but as it was getting closer I did see a much smaller light on the right side. I was watching it out of curiosity mostly because I hadnt ever seen a orange light from an airplane plus it was moving quite slowly so it struck me as unusual.  My camera was right behind me on a small table so I stepped back about 2 feet to grab my camera. When I turned back towards the sliding glass door, I could barely see the light and it was ALL the way back over to where I originally noticed it, basically on the other side of the lake where I first noticed it. I did snap two shots however.  Within about 2-3 seconds, the light was gone. It took a little more than 2 minutes for it to get as close as it did and within seconds it was where it started from, or atleast from where I first noticed it.

I looked up and saw a bright orange light moving from a southern direction heading to a northern direction.  There a total of 4 bright orange orbs moving in the same direction. They were over the water moving at a slow pace so you had plenty of time to view them.  The first passed and disappeared over the top of the northern tower of rooms.  The second came next and followed the same path. My husband said get your camera in case there are more.  I grabbed my sony digital point and shoot camera.  Managed to get it turned on in time to see the third large bright orange orb pass by in the same trajectory as the other two.  Snapped one pic of it.  Then my husband said record them. Moved the camera to video mode and the third one had passed.   So we waited a minute at least and the fourth orb came from the south.  I started recording it.  The recording isn’t top notch because I was so excited over what we were seeing I kept moving too much and loosing it and having to refind it in the camera lense.  But it was on the same smooth trajectory as the other two.  I wished I had a tripod under the camera and the quality would be better. Then there were no more and we waited quite a while to see if more would come.  The thing that was most striking was how large the light looked when it was at least a half mile away over the ocean.  They all followed the same specific path of flight.  And there was absolutely no sound at all.  You would have missed them if you were not watching the sky.  Small planes flew in and out of a nearby airport and you could hear them over the ocean noise but these orbs made no sound before or after or during their passing.

The only truth I could decipher is the visual illumination of the craft and the absence of sound behind the illumination. The first two were visually flying together.

We observed from an estimated distance of about a city block away, perhaps less.  The sky was dark but overcast, no stars or moon were visible. No other aircraft were sighted during the occurrence.  The object was most definitely mechanical, and intelligently controlled. My impression of the object's size was that it was equivalent to or somewhat smaller than a helicopter, but I am uncertain.  The most significant physical feature was what appeared to be two blue-white lights in close proximity that seemed to quickly oscillate with yellow, looking like headlights. (Though they appeared as headlights, their apparent brightness remained relatively uniform despite three-dimensional maneuvering).  Somewhat higher and slightly offse! t from these was a smaller periodically flashing red light, but this was only intermittently visible, due I believe to the face of the object that contained the flashing light being turned away as it maneuvered.  Because of the lights' brightness and the dark of night, the actual shape of the object was difficult to make out.  The object made no sound, of jets or propeller blades, and left no contrails. The object's motion was most peculiar.  It was capable of great dexterity and unpredictability, sudden acceleration and stops, hovering, and a very slow controlled vertical descent.  It would shoot off very quickly in a straight line, stop on a dime, hover for about 30 seconds, then perform a very slow zigzag, stop and hover again for a period, then dip and weave off to another section of sky and repeat similar motions. At two points the object stopped in air, hovered, then very slowly descended vertically to disappear behind the roof edge of the apartment complex on the corner. It remained unseen from our vantage point for about 2 minutes, then unexpectedly came zipping back into view. For the entire period of observation, the object stayed within the same area, roughly a square city block. It did not appear to be following any conventional search pattern, but instead behaved very erratically.  I was waiting at the corner for a bus when I first noticed the object, noting it at first for the unusual brightness of the light and its low altitude. As I began to take photos with my phone (unfortunately, the camera is low-quality), a youth also waiting at the bus stop noticed and began to take video with his smart phone. As we continued to observe and document, marveling to each other and trying to identify the object, its motions became more and more bizarre, as described above. About 5 minutes into this, a resident of the apartment complex came by, noticed and commented on the strangeness of the object as well, but didn't stay for more than a moment. After about 15 minutes, the battery on my phone had gone out, and the object had disappeared beyond the roof's horizon for several minutes. As I traded contact info with the youth, the bus came; I got on and left. I can confirm without reservation that the object I saw was neither a plane nor a helicopter of any type. I did observe a police helicopter performing a search later in the evening in a different part of town, and can report that the light patterns and motions of the two were absolutely dissimilar. I am a 29-year-old college graduate, history major. I work in education, helping to build websites for educational curriculum. I am not an active UFO hunter, and have never seen anything like this before. I don't know the fellow taking the video or his background, but he appeared to be about 18, and was just as flabbergasted as I was. The woman who observed in passing was most likely a college student, as that area is very close to the University of Texas. I am still waiting for word from the youth, hoping that he will send me the video to forward along. Unfortunately, the photos I did manage to get on my phone are pretty low-resolution, but if you zoom in on the bright blue object in the center of most of them, you will see the basic shape of the twin lights I have described.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

Around 11:00 pm, three of us (my husband, my best friend, and I) decided to walk to the beach and look at the stars.  This is something I enjoy doing when I come to the beach.  When we got there, we all sat down on our beach towels to look at the sky.  It was a clear night with occasional small, thin clouds rolling through. About fifteen minutes after getting there, I was turned to the southeast, facing my friend and chatting.  My husband was on the other side of me.  I suddenly saw a bright orange orb-shaped object appear in the sky above us.  It did not fall from the sky or come from the ground or ocean.  It simply appeared.  We all sat up and watched it.  Seconds later, two other identical objects appeared next to the original one, and they hovered there for a moment before disappearing.  This happened five or six times.  The orbs appeared to be moving in a formation, with the two secondary orbs following the lead of the first.  After about fifteen minutes of this, we did not see any more of the orbs. A few minutes later, we noticed that a smaller, whiter light that had been stationary over the horizon, out on the sea, was starting to move.  It moved horizontally southward, and also up.  It moved erratically, quickly, and occasionally moved northward and back and forth.  A second light of the same size appeared a few minutes later.  We watched these lights for close to an hour.  The second light appeared to follow the first.  They moved all the way across the horizon in a matter of minutes.  These were certainly not boats or any aircraft that we’ve ever seen.  No boat or aircraft moves or behaves the way these lights did. My husband and I also saw one giant flash of white light near the area where the two smaller white lights originated.

As my car got closer to a department of transportation building in the area I noticed a strange light formation from a small object appearing to be about 60-70 above ground level.  This is only a guess as it was still fairly dark but this is the feeling I got looking at it.  As I slowly drove by I noticed red and green lights.  They were not pulsating or flashing. The green lights appeared in a row and the red light or lights were on the other side of the green, but were not in a row.  They were either a circular cluster or just one large, round light.  I couldn't see the body of the craft but it moved in diagonal and irregular patterns very slowly and without sound. It also rotated slowly as it traveled.

A white light the size of a star moving at a high rate of speed!! I am 51yrs. old. I was facing south and the the object I saw was a white round light. It looked like a small star only it moved across the sky in a straight and seemed like a deliberate direction from the west in a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed. I have seen passenger aircraft and military jets at high altitude like the size of a star, day and night time with the blinking light or lights and they appear to crawl across the sky, when in fact they are also flying at high rates of speed. This object around 10:00PM-05/16/2012 did not blink it was a solid round white light and moved so fast. This is the second time in my life I have ever seen anyting move this fast in the sky. It looked and moved just like what I saw in the in the very early 70's when I was around the age of 11yrs old. Facing north, that object at first sight looked like a helicopter spotlight low in the sky then in a blink was the size of a tiny star moving from west to the ESE direc! tion at a very high rate of speed. At school the next day I told a friend Wallace what I saw I gave no detail because he responded ""Hey I saw the same"" before I could finish. I honestly did not believe him until that evening after school in the front yard of my house he pointed to the sky exactly where I saw the object, he moved his arm in a fast motion while pointing, like he was following the object in the same exact direction!  This on the night of 05/16/2012 was not an airplane, it was not my imagination nor was it a helicopter spotlight,shooting star ETC! I may be a skeptic to some degree but, I know what I saw was not normal!! I was in the navy starting in 1979 at Cecil Field Naval Airbase in Cecil Field FL. I never saw anything move as fast as what I saw on the night of may 16th 2012 and on that night in the 70's. My wife and I now live in the same house I grew up in.

It did not change direction and was visible to me only for about 15 seconds in the area visible to me because of trees.If this had been a normal aircraft like a military jet or even a passenger plane it would have taken at the very least a minute to pass the same exact distance.I take our trash out every night and look to the sky because I love the night sky and checking out the moon. I see aircraft all the time and know there is a major difference in what I see every night and what I saw the night of 05/16/2012 around 10:00PM and that night in the 70's.

Almost in parallel sets of 2. Moving quicker than a plane, much brighter than stars At approximately 10:30 P.M in Waterdown, Ontario. My girlfriend and I spotted a cluster of 10-15 bright orange/yellow (more orange in color) orbs moving across the sky. They were moving faster than planes based on the fact of personal experience seeing air-planes moving through the sky. They were slightly less bright than the moon, but they were much, much brighter than stars. They were circular orbs in shape, but the strange thing was is that they were in a formation in sets of twos. Both orbs in the “sets” looked as if they were parallel with each other. While moving, the sets never gained distance nor height in proximity to their partners. The other sets were at different heights but from my standpoint they looked rather close to the other sets (Maybe a few hundred yards apart from their actual location.) They all moved at roughly the same speed. I am no physicist so i am unable to calculate the degree to which i was looking at the orbs. They looked much! lower to the ground than a normal air-plane though. I am not sure what other information you guys need but if you need any other information from me or this was not enough detail feel free to contact me via email or phone calls. From my standpoint, the aircraft moved about 30 feet (between the houses) within 60 seconds, possibly less. Perhaps your team could compute an apparent velocity regarding the information just given. I would appreciate being kept up to date with any other information regarding this. This is a serious reporting, i am a little freaked out myself and i would like an explanation.

To remember as much detail as possible and keep it to yourself until you can report it to the proper individuals. On this night I had to work overtime on second shift. I take the same route to and from home each time. I was traveling north on Route 45 and just past the intersection of Clay Street heading for Route 307 East, which is my turnoff. I looked up and to my left and saw strange lights in the night sky. They were at a diagonal to my left in an NNE-SSW configuration. Seven, if I remember correctly. Three in a""“top"" row in a fairly uniform line, three in a bottom row not as straight to each other, on one more not quite in the middle at the end of the two lines. At first glance I knew they weren’t stars even though they appeared to be stationary.. Same general shape, but they were too close and had a reddish-orange tint to them. When I was almost perpendicular to them I’d estimate that a baby aspirin held at arm’s length would cover each individual light. These lights did not flicker or pulse though occasionally one would dim or pass from view for a second due to spotty rain cloud cover. They also did not look to be lights on one larger individual craft. Since I was still driving I had to continually keep looking in front of me for oncoming traffic, etc. I’m pretty darn sure I wasn’t the only one to witness this event as both the minivan in front of me and oncoming traffic had slowed considerably. (Also, once we’d both turned left onto Route 307 East, the minivan pulled over into a parking lot and the driver appeared to be dialing a call while looking up at the lights.) Before that turn, I then noticed another light of the exact same type in the same diagonal path further south and to my right, and right  of Route 45. But this one was moving! Then further behind it, yet another. They were on an intersect path with the stationary lights. I did not hear any sound, but that’s because I had the radio on and, unfortunately, the automatic window motors on my car died long ago so I couldn’t roll the windows down. Even so, if those had been military helicopters (which do fly over quite frequently) I’d have heard them. Nothing stealthy about the ones that fly over these parts and seven of them hovering in place would have woke the entire area.

The craft had NO LIGHTS! This was by FAR the most interesting thing about my sighting  2. The craft was flying too fast and the sighting only lasted 6-10 seconds, I was too busy trying to focus my eyes on the craft so I could remember it and rule out a bird or airplane; there was no time to go grab my cell phone, and the picture would not have turned out anyway due to the color-matching of craft and sky.   Taking a picture MAY have been possible with decent equipment/night vision/quick reflexes but I don’t carry that stuff around just in case! Specific location of sighting: On the Northwest corner of Oak and Locust, looking East Witnesses:  From what I know, and please remember the time of night, I was the only person so see it.  It was a fluke by all accounts.  I was talking to my ‘date’ about my love of the sky and how beautiful the stars were.  When I looked up, within minutes of 0230 am, this is when I noticed it and my skin began to tingle!   After the 5 seconds of awe-struck staring, I quickly yelled, interrupting my dates talking to say there’s a UFO right there, but he thought I was kidding, so by the time I had pointed my finger at where the craft was, it either had disappeared or faded into the sky roughly 3-5 miles in front of us (I am no pro at judging distance but it was definitely close- as a side note, I would have attempted to take 380 East in an attempt to see if I could locate it again, but it was 0230 in the morning and I had to wake up at 5 am!  I didn’t think my excuse of following a UFO for being late would have gone over very well.)  Visual conditions: No cloud-cover what-so-ever, clear night, not many stars visible due to light pollution  Duration of sighting: 6-10 seconds of visual, from midpoint of the sky until craft faded or disappeared  Sound: None   Direction of flight: almost EXACTLY from West to East, this can be judged because the highway 380 is almost a perfect West to East direction. Shape of craft: between a diamond, teardrop & triangle Color of craft: black, blended almost completely into the dark night sky, but please remember there was quite a bit of noticeable light pollution, which enabled me to initially see the outline and then focus on what was happening. This is hard to judge because this craft almost appeared to be intentionally the same color as the night. If it had been darker out, I know it would not have been visible. Height from ground: Approximately 500 feet (this is a guess, I am not too familiar with judging distances) – if you were to look up into the sky, the size would appear to resemble the size of 2 thumbs-widths and was not high enough to have been in clouds, had there been any. Wish I could describe this better. Speed: Roughly 3 times faster than a plane may be seen traveling at the same altitude Size: unknown, however, I would guess  around 150-200 feet long.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,33.19502279411765,-97.11429981617647

I have a little ranch house set in the woods but the area around the house is clear of trees.  I have a dog who usually has to go out during the night.  Sometimes I let him out on the back lead and let him wander or I take him out front on leash for a quick pee.  He woke me up at 2:22am September 23, 2012 to go out.  I took him out the front. He did his business but seemed like he wanted to do more, so I walked him a bit down the driveway.  When I had originally stepped out I looked up at the sky to see what the weather would be like the next morning.  It was overcast and cloudy, no black sky and absolutely no stars.  As I walked down the driveway I noticed several very bright, big lights in the sky.  They were situated over an area which is a state park called Chatfield Hollow in CT.  I thought it  was weird because if they were stars, first of all they were super big and bright and there was no black sky around them, just a hazy cloudy sky.  So my sleepy mind is trying to figure how these stars are shining through the clouds. Then I noticed a clearing in the trees that 3 of them are in  a perfect vertical line spaced evenly apart.  My first thought it was the 3 Sisters stars but then realized it couldn’t be them because the 3 Sisters are not so perfectly spaced or in such a straight line. I then noticed to the left  a second set of 3 lights perfectly spaced in a straight vertical line running horizontal to the first set.  They stood motionless but were giving off a very bright glow.  Then I noticed a 7th light off to the left, almost like it was the sideways tip of a pyramid (for all 7 in  formation)   These lights were spaced out very far apart like several football field lengths. This 7th tip light was just as bright but had more of a redish glow.  I remember thinking Mars, maybe this was Mars.  This is what really scared me….about 7 seconds after I turned my face up to this 7th light and I am trying to figure it out, it got a little brighter for a second, like a quick pulse and then went out  But it wasn’t a quick switch off more like a quick pull back.  And my first thought was….”.Oh my God, they saw me seeing them….”  I quickly went back into the house. Needless to say I did not sleep  most of the night.  About 10 minutes later I heard an airforce jet fly over coming from the area the lights were and over my house.  So I was wondering if someone else saw these and reported to the airforce.  I dozed off somewhere around 4:20 and 5:15.  My senses were so alert to all noises at this point. Normally it is so quite at night you can hear your own blood in your veins, but what woke me up was a low steady humming sound that lasted for about 10 minutes.  But I also noticed the crickets got louder if that makes sense.  I was thinking why are they so loud and was afraid to look out the window as I was sure I would see a UFO hovering over my house. This wan't a plan or helicopter as the sound was the same and steady and then gone. So I lay in bed literally frozen in fear and after ten minutes the  humming went away and the crickets sounds had diminished greatly.  About another 15 minutes passes and I hear the humming again but it is fa! ther away, it didn’t feel like it was right over my house and the crickets got louder.  I remember thinking o.k. now they are over my neighbor’shome,  who is down the road a bit. It then went away about 10 minutes later and the crickets quieted down.  A third time I heard the humming faintly, crickets got louder and then it went away.  Crickets got quieter.  I definitely could tell the difference in the sounds when the humming stopped.  (I do not have a furnace that could possibly have made this noise)  At about 5:45 I could finally breath and close my eyes to rest. Here is the really weird thing, my daughter who is 21, her bedroom window faces where the lights were and her bed is up against the window.  When she got up I didn’t mention anything to her.  I asked her how she slept.  She said she got up in the middle of the night and closed the curtains on her window.  She said she woke up in the middle  of the night with the weird feeling someone was watching her, “like some creepy guy”. There was definitely something to these lights. I figured if they wanted to harm us they could do it anytime and there is nothing I can do about it, you can’t call the police.  I know I am not crazy, I don’t drink or take drugs, I am a professional and I have no reason to make this up.

On September 23, 2012 at 6:55 PM ET, I saw three unidentified flying objects in the sky.  It was dusk. I was traveling west bound on Route 1 in Langhorne, PA (Bucks County) and the objects were in the western sky traveling south.  The objects were approximately 10-15 miles away. There were three separate objects in a formation.   One of the objects was 60 degrees above the horizon, the second object was 80 degrees above the horizon and the third object was 100 degrees above the horizon.  Each object appeared as a bright white line with a bubble or half orb shape on the top followed by a pinkish orange flame.  The flame remained constant in shape and size on each object.  The objects were descending, all at the same trajectory, and seemed to be moving at a slow and steady pace.  I know what a comet looks like moving through the sky and these were not comets.  Also, there was an unusual high activity of aircraft in the sky.  There were approximately a dozen planes i! n the sky flying toward the objects.  The aircraft were faster and smaller than passenger jets and I assume that they were military or fighter jets.  One of the aircraft circled around and flew low over the highway and I could see that it was a fighter jet, probably an F-18. I continued traveling on my intended route and got on the PA turnpike (Rt 276) heading West  and once on the PA turnpike, I identified a fourth object, similar in all regards to the other three but flying to the North and much higher than the others.

The reason it caught my attention was because it wasn't very high in the sky and it was a dim orange color, almost like a dull overhead highway light.  It was pretty still so I had time to notify my family in the car and the odd nature of it's position in the sky.  It wasn't high enough to be a plane (plus it wasn't moving) nor was it low enough to be a street light.  My wife reminded us that when we left there were several hot air balloons in the area, however it was pretty dark and it was unlikely they were still floating around. As we continued to drive we were now moving in a different direction so we were watching from the side window and now the object appeared to be almost like a fireball but we knew it wasn't because if it were an actual fireball it would have been much brighter however we thought it might be possible of it was a leftover hot air balloon in terrible distress.  We took another turn now heading towatds the object and were expecting to get a better view oit the front windshield when the object appeared further away even though we knew we were moving closer to it.  At this point the object gradually moved directly up and out of sight leading all of us to conclude that this was something very different.  We don't normally believe in such happenings but this occurrence doesn't leave a whole lot of other explanations that we are aware of which lead us to the iternet when we got home.  Most surprising from our internet research was reading other descriptions of sightings that included fireball like observations further validating what we know we observed.

At 10:30 PM Sunday evening the 12th of August my wife ((name deleted)) (48 yrs old) and myself (49)were in the 16 foot illuminated (underwater light) pool surrounded by darkness and stars in the back yard for a half hour or so when I noticed a glowing round orange object flying north to south just west of our property, less than quarter mile away at about 500 feet up (fairly low altitude in the densely populated neighborhood we live in North East Salem).   5 minutes later, from the north, 5 orange balls of silent traveling light could be seen traversing over the neighborhood between my street (Siesta) and the street to the west of ours (Bonanza) at about 20 to 30 miles per hour, traveling against a 5 to 10 mile per hour wind and rapidly approaching the airspace directly across from our pool.  During the approach my wife suddenly came to the realization this was not conventional aircraft, got spooked and insisted I get my glasses as she quickly got out of the pool.  I d! ashed to the kitchen door and retrieved by glasses and ran back to the edge of the pool, propping my arms up on the wood pile that lined the property line.  My wife was now standing behind me watching as the objects now slowly cruised by together, reminiscent Japanese lanterns but at a close enough vantage point to eliminate that possibility.  They also were clearly traveling together and independent of the wind so I quickly dismissed the possibility of such a man-made object.  The glowing balls of orange light, less than a quarter mile away and at about 500 feet briefly continued away from the pool to the left and each orange ball, one by one, imploded on itself disappearing one by one till all has disappeared from the sky. A couple of observations. I have been a student of the UFO phenomenon for over 25 years, spending the late 80’s and 90’s as a field investigator and assistant state director for MUFON and eventually helping establish Oregon UFO Research in 2000.  At the time of this event, the wife and I HAD JUST been discussing the subject of unidentified flying objects, and in particular I was in the middle of telling her about an incident in 1988 when I saw a low flying orange ball of light in my back yard in West Salem.  Almost immediately on the heels of telling her that story these balls of light appeared coming in over the homes along our street and heading our way and looking exactly like the object I had seen 23 years before.   I caught myself saying, ""You gotta be kidding me,""  to my wife in light of just recalling to her the incident 23 years before. My gut feeling as I watched the orange glowing orbs or balls was that the flight was intentional, that they slowed as they passed us next to the pool and that we were being watched as we watched them, strong feeling.

I have seen plenty of airplanes, shooting stars, meteor showers and satellites and t! his my friends was neither!!  It was almost like i had just seen this thing as it flew by zap out of this time back to where ever it came from!  I hope i was not the only person who seen it!",2012-08-19T00:00:00,47.4061,-121.9953

While watching for the asteroids i noticed a light north/north-east up in the sky, above and to the left of where Jupiter was last night, that was yellowish, and was moving left and right, down and up, waving, and behaving erratic. I quickly realized it wasn't an asteroid and called my boyfriends attention to it.  He too said that it looked to him like it was moving.   I then moved to put it in perspective with a near-by saguaro to really tell if it was moving, thinking maybe it was just our eyes playing tricks.  Sure enough it was moving to one side of the cactus, to the other. It was moving.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Then about 5 minutes later it reappeared, and this time it was higher in the sky, but in the same region.  We got in the car and drove about a mile towards it to get a better view.   It then started dimming, then brightening, sometimes disappearing, and returning quickly. Then it was gone.   We watched for about 10 minutes, and decided we didn't think it was coming back.

As I approached Happy Valley Rd. it appeared as though it would continue going south, however, as I crossed Happy Valley Rd. it took a sharp turn to the left (east) and shot down that street (where I intended to turn anyway before I had decided to follow it).  I turned around almost immediately to follow it down Happy Valley Rd.  As I turned down that street I could still see it, and it appeared to be stopped or had significantly slowed it's speed (actually, I thought it had turned back towards me at one point for a few seconds, however it was much too hard to tell).

With the both of us shooting straight down the road, it seemed to accelerate further and I soon began to lose it.   Eventually, it banked off to the NE (across a barren, semi-mountainous landscape).  I pulled over on the gravel shoulder, grabbed my binoculars out of the glove box, and got a good view as it floated away.  Again, it was nothing but an orange orb.

The past week I have been seeing what I believe to be the same craft. It is orange in color and kind of strobes, sometimes slowly sometimes quick.  Each time I've seen it I see it just still in place, then I get my camera to take long exposure shots and I was suprised the first time I saw it because my shots showed it's movement.  I photographed it until it completely dissapeared the first time.  The second time I saw it I spotted it in a completely different area, probably about 70 degrees away from the first spotting, I wasn't able to photograph it this time because I had to drive.  When I returned to the same spot about 20 minutes later it was gone.  THEN, tonight I actually saw it appear.  I was outside looking at Arcturus in the NorthEast or so and I was gazing around when all the sudden it appeared at 12'oclock ahead of me.  I immediatly ran inside and grabbed my camera.  As soon as I got my camera set up it started to slowly move left.  I was able to get two 30 second exposure shots of it before it went behind trees,  It was very bright.  I grabbed my tripod/camera and ran through the field infront of my house and it just kept moving but this time away from me.  I ran across a highway and into these other fields where it pretty much shot away fast, and I then spotted it very far in the distance, I was able to get a few more shots but it was too far away and I called it quits.  Plus it was cold and Iwas only wearing pajama pants.  This thing is sure to appear again.  Hopefully I will get it again tomorrow night.  I thought I was able to see a shape to it but I'm not sure...I can only say for sure that it was very bright orange.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,48.5448,-114.34729999999999

Without getting up, I dismissed him back to bed by telling him it was likely a planet. I wish I had listened to him sooner.  A few minutes later I retrieved a pair of binoculars, then my 40x Sony Handycam camcorder.

The object moved very slowly to the Northwest, toward Beijing.  Our home is about 100 kilometers from Beijing.  I have no idea what this flying object was.  Two airliners flew over which we could hear and see their outline.  This object had no sound and no silhouette.  With the naked eye, the bottom light looked like it was quickly changing colors from red, to green to blue, back to red, but the video doesn’t really pick up on this.

I was born in 1959. My father was an independent trucker and on weekends and holidays from the age of 6-15,I went with him. He had been telling me about ,when in, West Texas at night he had seen lights in the night sky that move in a way that were not of this Earth. I first saw them when I was about 8-9 and I knew myself it was true.This is why I wasn't shocked or freaked out by what I'm going to report to you. I was living in a apartment in Corpus Christi, Texas, that a ex girl friend had rented for us when I had been away for a month working.  I had a friend over that night and we were throwing darts and visiting with each other.  There was a knock on the door and it was my ex girl friend. She was excited and asked me to come outside and follow her.  She lead me west to the parking lot and instructed me to stand there pointed to the Northwest and said look over there and talk to me a while.  We talked for a couple of minutes and while looking to the West I felt heat on the back of my neck and a yellow flash. I started turning to see what it was and between West and North there it was.  I froze.  To the NOrthwest about 400 yds away and about 150-200ft off the ground was a huge hat shaped object. The brim was fat and the crown was short.  The outside wasn't glossy it was like flat paint. It was clear as a bell.  It wasn't moving and it seemed to have no power no sound.  In a few seconds I h! eard like a loud mechanical engaging and segments like those from a digital clock appeared in random order underneath.  Then another mechanical engaging sound(like a electrical motor starter?) and the other half of the segements came on and created a wagon wheel shape, colored in darker than lime green light.  In a few seconds more it looked like it moved towards the west for just a split second and disappeared.  I couldn't tell if it flew off or went into another dimesion,but it was gone.  She was looking at me when I looked at her and she said what was that.  I said I don't know but don't tell anyone.  My other friend over heard us and started saying Yall didn't she see anything what did yall see.  We didn't respone and went back into the apartment and just acted normal until they both left. It didn't dawn on me, I guess because of the gravity of the sighting, until a couple of days later how did she know when to come get me, where for me to look, to show me what she knew was go! ing to be there.  I sent word through her brother that I needed! to see her.  In about a week she showed up after work and after visiting for a while I asked her how she knew?  She looked at me like she didn't know what I was talking about.  Years have passd and after remebering some vague statements in the 2 yrs. before the sighting she made to me, there is a bigger picture formed not in this report that make this even more interesting and important. If you are interested in these statements and my opinion feel free to contact me anytime.  I am available and have a answering machine with no caller ID.

I was riding in a pick-up truck on the passengers side.  I looked out of the side window and saw an object suspended just above the trees.  It was absolutely stationary. The only thing visible was the windows.  They were all equally lit.  The color of the light was uniform and identical to the color given off by an ordinary incandescent light bulb. There were two rows of windows, one row across on top of another(upper and lower, vertically in line) and approximately 18-20 across. All windows were the same size, about 6-8 feet high by 8-10 feet across.  The object was between 150 - 200 feet away. I stared at it intently without even blinking, expecting that I would see somebody come to one of the windows, if I didn't take my eyes off of them.  At the same time I was watching, I was yelling at my friend, who was driving, to pull over.  I repeated myself very sternly to pull over 4-5 times.  He was preoccupied at that very same time searching the middle of the seat for! his tin of chewing tobacco with his right hand, while driving with his left hand and never took his eyes off of the road.So he didn't see it.  I couldn't tell him to look because we had just came off of a curve, before I saw what I saw and we were heading for another curve shortly.  Also, I think I was just so excited, that the only words that I could get out of my mouth was ""pull over"" repeatedly.  Has we approached the next curve the object became obscured by trees and a house for 2-3 seconds and then we pulled over after that.  The place where we pulled over was only about 2-3 seconds past the time that I lost visual contact and the area between where we stopped and where the object had been was totally clear, but it was not there any more.  Neither was there anything visible any where in the entire sky. My friend was very irate and asked me what the big emergency was which we needed to pull over for.  I told him what I saw and he just seemed perturbed about it and didn't seem! like he believed me. The road is a road that I drive almost e! very day , about a mile and a half from my house.  What I saw was akin to seeing a well lit, 2 story, 125 foot long office building floating stationary over a familiar area of trees that would normally be clear of any lights.  It was a very clear, very crisp sighting of something very solid and real.  I've got to tell you also that I had an immediate thought that crossed my mind as soon as I could not see the object any more and that was, ""Could we have just been abducted even though it appears that we never left the vehicle, didn't lose any time, didn't pull over until the object couldn't be seen, and it seems that I was very aware of what I saw before, during and after, exactly as I have explained it here.""  What I saw sticks with me like glue and it seems to get under my skin more and more as time goes by.  The past few years I have searched the internet for pictures and diagrams of objects other people have seen, hoping to find out if anybody else saw the same thing at any time.  I came! across the sketch that Barney Hill made of the object that they saw.  It looked to me that it was the same thing that I saw, only looking at it from the side.

"Shiny, silver, metallic disc with three small lights horizontaly side by side on the outer edge and rotated.",Santa Cruz,CA,2001-05-05T12:00:00,disk,20 minutes,"Occurred : 5/5/2001 12:00  (Entered as : 05/05/01 12:00) Reported: 3/19/2012 6:12:03 PM 18:12 Posted: 4/18/2012 Location: Santa Cruz, CA Shape: Disk Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87864.html,"Shiny, silver, metallic disc with three small lights horizontaly side by side on the outer edge and rotated. During the first half of the year 2001 I was living in the surfing town of Santa Cruz, California. Around the first or second week of the month of May I was sitting in my bedroom one Saturday afternoon.  It was a perfect California sky.  All blue with no clouds at all.  I was sitting in a beach chair that had very short legs so I was very low to the floor and I was facing towards the north. I had a very large picture window and from the vantage point of my beach chair being low I could see a large portion of the sky above the Santa Cruz Mountains/Silicon Valley region.  The only object that I could see was the top portion the telephone pole outside with one wire going the length of the window I was looking through.  After about five minutes of looking at the sky to the north I noticed a tiny flicker of light way up in the sky.  After a few more minutes I realized that it was not moving, so I payed more attention to it.  The flicker and non-movement made me doubt that it was a plain.  So I got up and went to the window. I am fortunate to have perfect 20/20 vision and focused extremely hard on the light.  Once I settled my vision I noticed that it was NOT a plain but something odd.  I continued watching it a little longer and could make out a circular shape around the flickering light.  I then went into the living room and got a pair of old binoculars that had one broken lense.  I used the telephone pole and the wire as a reference point to locate the object with the one lense that worked, and then focused in on it.  After I settled my arms and got the best focus I could I was shocked to be looking at a U.F.O.  It was a silver metallic disc with three, small, round lights on the outer edge of the disc.  They were side by side and very close together.  The lights spun around the disc as it rotated in place.  The disc was at a bit of an angle and was reflecting the sun off the top of the disc causing it to flicker with the lights. The disc would also get caught in turbulence every few seconds and wobble as it spun around. I tried to time the spin by watching the lights and I estimated that a complete rotation of the lights took about 1 and a half seconds up to two seconds.  The craft appeared to be up at commercial airline heights of 25,000 to 35,000 feet.  Plus when I watched it with my naked eyes it seemed to be about the size of a commercial jetliner.  From the time I first noticed the flicker to the end when my eyes got tired I am guessing I watched it for about 20 minutes. My final portion of this report I would like to state clearly, the same way each witness did during the 2001 U.F.O. Press Club conference in Washington D.C. that I will testify in front of Congress to what I witnessed on that day in May of 2001 in Santa Cruz, California.

It looked quite high in the sky and because of its similarity to a very bright star, and lack of lights, and speed, I assumed it was a satellite.  It was moving about 3 times quicker than a normal commercial aircraft would move.   All of a sudden the object took a sharp turn around 30 degrees to the west and its speed picked up about two to three times that of what it was originally traveling.  It traveled at that speed for about one second and then all of a sudden picked up tremendous speed and shot out of view.   The whole sighting lasted maybe 5-10 seconds.

My husband looked out of our large bay window (from the second story of our house) and noticed 2 solid orange/red round lights coming over the trees from across the street (from the East).  They were spaced apart and flying evenly spaced.  We all looked out the window and noticed another set of 2 lights coming behind the other 2, spaced evenly apart as well. Then we noticed another set of 2 lights, also spaced evenly from each other.  There were 3 sets of these lights, 6 altogether, flying slowly and evenly in formation in a Northwest direction.  We ran outside to get a better look and to determine if they were planes or helicopters, but there was no sound coming from the lights. Intrigued, I called our next door neighbors (who are our relatives) to look out of their front door to see the lights.  By the time they got there they saw the last set of 2 lights.  They didn’t hear any sound either and couldn’t figure out what it could be.  We have a military airstrip not far away and frequently see military planes practice over our houses on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but we all determined these were definitely not planes. The lights were orange/red in color and were round in shape.  I thought I saw a small blinking light in them, but it was very tiny in comparison to the solid orange color.  They moved slowly and evenly and seemed to eventually disappear as they were flying north.  My son described the lights as flames coming off the back of missiles, but I thought they were more consistent in shape than a flame would be. We came back inside and a few minutes later a single orange/red light started coming from the direction the others had come from. It was not spaced out evenly behind the others; it was farther behind the rest.  But it moved slowly following the same path the others did.  It eventually disappeared in the sky as well.

I say  i saw 1 to 3 craft in the form above, but i believe it was one craft shaped like a triangle, with 3 orange lights, one light on each tip.  It could have been three craft in triangle formation, i just do not know. They were orange, moving  much faster than an airplane, about as wide apart as my first three fingers held at arm's distance.  We live in the flight path for newark airport and see all kinds of planes fly over with and without landing lights on, sometimes we see the landing lights go off or come on.  we are close enough to the airport to see the planes drop or raise their landing gear.  When they pass over, they are 4 minutes from landing at newark.  This was not an airplane.  It made no sound, was lower than 1,000 feet, and moved faster than any airplane i ever saw. The lights were orange and in a triangle formation. The odd thing was, one point of the triangle was pointing away from the direction of flight (you would think one point only would lead---like a formation of geese, but no), the two other lights were abreast of each other and leading , like a triangle flying backwards. The lights were not firey, they were like a lit up bulb. No flickering, no drifting like balloons or lanterns.  These lights moved together as if attached,  and maintained their direction and speed.  It was around 10:20 pm, on february 11th, 2013.  it was too late for them to be satellites, they remained bright till they got too far away into the eastern horizon and tree line. They faded from view due to distance.  I could not tell if there was a structure attached to the lights. The weather was cold (30 degrees) and very breezy.  the sky had intermitant clouds and became very  cloudy after the event.  These lights appeared in a swath of clear, dark blue sky.  The stars were clearly visible during the pass. I have seen satellites, these were not satellites.  The wind was blowing from northeast to west, the lights moved from northwest to due east.  They took approximately 20 to 30 seconds to cross my view and be gone, if that long.  My wife looks all the time to see if there is anything strange in the sky.  I thought she was crazy until tonight.  I do not believe they were chinese lanterns, or anything commonly mistaken for a true ufo.

It was about 22:33pm on Friday June 29,2012 and while we were talking I was looking at the view and I looked at my friend (who had his back to the view in the east) for about 4sec, when I looked back up behind him I had seen that three red/orange lights (about twice the size and brightness of the star cluster of Sirius on a clear winter night) were sitting in a large equilateral triangular formation over (what looked like from northern Capitol Hill to the junction of I-5 and SR-520 East). As we watched (which the whole duration of the event was over a period of approximately 4min) the triangle started to move slowly to the north an upwards (from my perspective it would be approximately 1mph). As the triangle formation of red/orange lights moved, another light ! of the same color (red/orange), size, and brightness appeared about 450meters up and 300 meters to the north of the triangle appeared. Then the light began to slowly move north at around 5mph (from my perspective) and a greater speed to the east towards Kirkland before slowly fading out. As this occurred, four lights of the same original intensity and color as the initial triangle (which at this point was still in formation) of lights began to appear from behind Capitol Hill to the east and appeared in a straight line, one after, another (and these moved up quickly (from my perspective 10-15mph)  before slowing to a stop) in a perfectly straight line (which would bisect the lower southern corner of the triangular formations roughly 45° angle if drawn through the four new lights, connecting to the bottom , southern corner light, and through the equilateral triangle itself). As the four new lights were appearing, the triangular formation began to form into a line perpendicular with the horizon. What was the top light of the triangle began to move into the original spot of the light which hovered about the fir! st triangular formation before disappearing. This light then moved in the same direction and speed as the light before it had before slowly disappearing in the north, but mainly east (east towards Houghton and as far north as the University of Washington campus). The new four lights that had come up in a line to the bottom, southern corner of the triangular formation began to move upwards at approximately (from my perspective about 5mph). As these lights moved upwards, the top ones would take the spot of the others before it and would hover in a single spot before moving slightly north to the east and slowly fade away. The last four lights had moved upwards and the first four had pretty much disappeared in the distance by now (It was about 22:36) when the first of the four new lights moved into the upper position to the north east. The three lights below it then went into a small equilateral triangle formation (within approximately less than 100meters of each other). These three lights then moved into another formation forming a perpendicular line with the horizon before gradually moving up and to the north east before fading away. I feel crazy writing this, I believe in UFOs but my friend doesn’t but neither of us is sure what we saw. We watch airplanes (both commercial and military) helicopters come in for landing and move across the city skyline every night but never have we seen anything like this. The lights did not blink like airplane lights would and they were more orange than red. But they weren’t to be mistaken with airplane headlights either. Airplane headlights are a white/yellow light and accompanied with the green, red, and white wing and taillights. I have never seen any aircrafts fly like this and make these formations and possess these lights. Airplanes which are able to hover in the way which these lights/possible crafts did are extremely loud and can be heard from miles away. There was no sound accompanying these lights in the sky. I know what I saw, I can’t explain what it was but I don’t think it was normal. I hope my descriptions of my sighting can be understood and can help. By th! e time we really believed that this was for sure an unusual sighting and set up the camera to take a photo, the lights had faded too much in order to get a quality photo of them. I called the National Weather Service here in Seattle and they reported that the winds were coming in from the south at the time and area of the sighting.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

The one on the top was slightly to the right in relation to the one on the bottom. They looked bright and big (size of Jupiter or slightly bigger) with a deep color of orange/red. As they began to move from left to right slowly, I tried to get a better view through the branches of the trees in my yard which were partially blocking the view. I was curious to find out if they were planets but once they began to move I thought it could be a plane. But then, 2 planes one on top of the other didn’t make much of a sense to me. So I called my husband to come outside and look at these lights. He came out and looked but was too concern on stepping on dog poop outside. It is cold tonight in the 40’s. So he came inside and didn’t want to bother being cold. I was still curious to find out what it was as the 2 lights continued to move from left to right. All of a sudden I see then 3 lights. If I were to connect the dots they would form a triangle in the sky about 4 inches apart from each dot. The color of the dots were exactly the same color as the other 2 lights. As this happened, I ran inside to call a friend of mine so she could go out and look at the west sky ! to see if she could see the same lights. The 3 lights began to move from left to right and instead of 3 dots I could only see 2 kind of horizontal lights from each other moving again from right to left (west to southwest). It seemed like the lights would move and stop.  The one far left kept going while the one on the right stopped and dimmed to no light at all.  I moved my position down the driveway toward the south so I could keep an unobstructed view of these 2 objects.  The light on the right continues to move slowly and more dimmed but I still could see it. All of a sudden the light that had dimmed before came back on with a white brightness just like a flood light shinning down and immediately dimmed to no light again.  It seemed like this light had appeared for 2 seconds disappearing again completely.  It was very cold and since I had no jacket, I just noticed the light from the left continue to move southwest and getting dimmer and dimmer.

It didn’t make a sound and it slowly vanished in the clouds towards the north.  I called my husband to check it out but we didn’t make a fuss out it thinking it was just a flare or a Chinese lantern. The second sighting was yesterday at about 7 in the evening, November 16.  It was also a single bright orange orb flying soundlessly,  this time going straight to the east.  It again vanished in the clouds.  I immediately thought it was an airplane of some sort because it’s impossible for me to experience 2 UFO sightings in a week. The third one was late in the evening of the same day, November 16 at exactly 10.30.  My family was going on a road trip and was about to load ourselves in the car when I saw the orange orb again going to the east.  I told my husband it must be an airplane because I saw one earlier.  My daughter and I were already in the car when my husband yelled it wasn’t an airplane and when I looked there were around 10-15 orbs flying towards the east.  The first group of orbs was flying in a wide triangular shape.  The second group formed a line.  They all headed in one direction and vanished in the same spot. It was already late and nobody saw it aside from us.  My husband made a shout out in his social network to check if other people saw the lights but nobody claimed to have seen them.  It didn’t look like a flare to us because it was flying on a straight path and it didn’t look like Chinese Lanterns either because they formed a triangle and it looked like it was in control of it’s direction and vanished in the same spot.

It seemed to hover or move slowly near its position at first, then it appeared to gain elevation and move in an arc trajectory towards the S/SW. The whole sighting lasted for about 40 seconds.  After recognizing that what I was seeing was not natural, I took out my phone and started recording video (about 5 seconds after first seeing the orb.)  However, it only took a couple glances at the screen to see that what I was recording would not be very clear/detailed.  I then focused mostly on the object itself and watched it move until I finally lost sight of it behind a large Douglas Fir tree. I still can't quite wrap my head around the type of fire-like orange light this object generated.  The movement was also outside the norm of any craft I've ever seen.

The lights were spaced widely apart, and holding my arms straight out and pointing at the first and last light, the distance between my fingers was approx. 10 inches.

Observed three lights in formation -- red/red/white -- while at a new observatory site in Washington.  The site is located at about 1600 feet in elevation in the Wallula Gap hills south of the Columbia River, just north of the Oregon border.   We were setting a North-South line in the now empty observatory in preparation of setting the large telescope mounting into the observatory.  We were done with our work at about 10:15 PM and came out of the observatory building to notice the ‘lights’ floating along to the north of us:  two bright red lights and one while light with flashing running lights.   They were equally spaced and moving slowly.  I laughed and noted to my friends “look a UFO”.  I commented that any non-astronomer would likely comment that the object(s) were a UFO.   We watched for about a minute as the object moved to the west.  They did not keep perfect spacing, so the object was not something solid and made us think they were three separate aircra! ft.   Then, the lights turned and headed north, and it was easy to see they were likely three aircraft moving in formation, one after the other, as you could see them form a nice ‘arc’ of lights as they moved in their turn.   The interesting aspect was the front two craft had steady red lights, while the trailing craft had a white light and running strobe lights as normal aircraft do.  So, whatever craft the red lights were, they did not have normal strobe lights, which is maybe why they had a trailing craft to make sure they were not mis-identified by other aircraft. ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) The aircraft were at two-three miles away.  They were moving slowly, much like small fixed wing aircraft or helicopters.  Because we were on a hilltop they were at eye level elevation.  We were looking north and they were due north of us.  They were traveling west at first and we saw the port running light in the last aircraft blinking as well as the white light, and then as they turned north, we could see both the port and starboard running lights in the last aircraft.  Both of the advance aircraft just had red lights and no blinking running lights. Yes, all three of us, all astronomers with extensive experience observing celestial objects thought they were aircraft and also mused how others without experience in observing moving objects in the sky could be convinced they were UFO's and or 'baffled' by the formation.  I have seen much more startling formations of lights in the night sky in the form of aerial tankers refueling jet aircraft as well as formations of satellites in orbit around the earth.  I have seen much more 'baffling' formations.  These were clearly aircraft moving in formation.  The thing we questioned was why the front two aircraft did not have normal running lights and only bright red lights.  Perhaps you could find that out and let me know.  I like to report these types of events to my students so they can be better observers of celestial objects, moving or not. ((END ADDENDUM))",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

Description of siting:  There was no visible craft but lights were observed twice within about 1 hour (in the same location).  The first time the lights were observed was by 1 person around 11:00pm and was discounted as a plane but in a strange location (not the typical approach to the local airport).  The second time the lights were observed was at 11:50pm by 2 people.  There were multiple lights with different colors (red, yellow, orange) in roughly a straight line but not exactly lined up. The lights stayed fairly consistent but did appear to fluctuate somewhat.  Then the lights simply went out.  The craft/lights did not appear to move, land, fly away or otherwise act like a plane, helicopter or other normal aircraft. The area that the siting occurred is generally in the path of the local airport (Hagerstown Washington County Regional Airport - HGR) and it is typical for planes to approach the airport from this direction which we observe many times over the years.  When planes come in from a far distance, they appear to be standing still for a few minutes but then move to the left as they approach the airport.  This is the typical observance of landing aircraft seen by us many times.  The first reaction to what was seen on the night of 1-29-13 was that it was just an airplane, but after a few minutes of it ""not moving,"" we went to get binoculars, then the lights went out in about seconds.  Aircraft approaching the airport DO NOT turn their lights out completely right before landing!!  If anything, they turn their landing lights on as they get closer.  Again the craft did not appear to move at all and was seen in the same location about 50 minutes apart, then the lights simply went out.  ! We observed the entire area for another 20 minutes looking for the lights to re-appear, they did not. Another concern is that the location of the siting was about +/-10 miles southwest of a military installation known as Site R (aka ""the underground Pentagon"") just north of Camp David.  This area is a strict no-fly zone and aircraft approaching the airport (HGR) must abide by the approved flight path. Other observations we noted.  We saw some clouds, stars (big dipper), a nearly full moon, communication towers in the far distance with red blinking lights and several high altitude aircraft with their typical red blinking lights which were much farther up in the sky (perhaps 5,000 ft or 10,000 ft).  All of these items are observed nightly, which is normal.  The siting of the mysterious lights were distinct and nothing like the other lights or items listed above.

On September 23, I was driving on Hwy. 27 north, going through Trion, Georgia, county of Chattooga.  It was approximately 7:00 pm and while I was driving I noticed a rather large, bright object in the sky. It made me think of an extremely bright star that one would see at night, but this was just before sunset had started, it wasn't dark at all yet, and there weren't any other stars visible in the sky. The object appeared to be reflecting light, it looked similar to the effect sun light has when reflected off of a mirror and because of this I had a hard time telling the exact shape of the object. By my best assumption, the object appeared to be round, circular, or spherically shaped, much like how a star looks. The object was larger than any plane I have ever seen. What really made me think that this was something unusual, though, was that the object wasn't moving in any direction. It was perfectly still. I watched the object while driving, from the time I noticed it, for about one or two minutes. It suddenly disappeared. Instantly it was gone from the sky. Nothing blocked my view of the object from the time I noticed until it vanished. There was most definitely a bright, shiny, static object in the sky one moment and then there was nothing. Immediately after it disappeared, a jet came flying from an eastwardly direction at an alarming rate of speed and seemed to be flying a bit low. It appeared to be flying towards where the object had previously been. None of these events make sense to me. It actually gave me goose bumps when the thing just disappeared. I am most curious to see if anyone else saw this, and if someone of authority might have a logical explanation of this event. Thank you.  To whome it may concern, I am of sound mind. I am a twenty-six year old mother and wife. I am well educated and have been at my current job for six years. I have never before seen or reported anything such as this. I am an ordinary woman with an ordinary life. I only want an explanation of what I witnessed.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,34.5848,-85.2903

I reluctantly asked the guy behind me when we landed if he happened to see anything odd from the plane and he said he said he saw it as well and that it freaked him out and that he was just going to pretend he didn’t see it.  He said he was ex military and it was definitely not a stealth probe.   He agreed to go to the pilot afterwards with me.

The craft or ""orb"" hovered there for about 20 or so seconds and then a huge bright yellow/whiteish light emmited from the craft/orb. It was so bright that anyone looking in that dirrection couldnt have missed it. there was absolutly no noise or ground vibrations that you would nomally feel and hear from a low flying helicopter, and the tree tops remained motionless. the large bright light shined for quite some time and then shut off. as s! oon as that light turned off two more lights , i think they were red and white, started blinking. this may sound weird to most people but it was almost like this firey orange glowing orb turned into a helicopter. It was too dark out to see what it ""morphed"" into, but i think it was trying to mimic a regular aircraft or something...after this thing got done doing what ever it was doing, it continued to travel west with the two lights still blinking. that was by far the weirdest sight that ive ever seen. i will keep my eyes posted in the night sky everytime i go outside now. i couldnt believe i saw that. its something that ya here about from time to time but to experiance it was somethin else.

I was walking out of a convenience store to my car a little before 8:30pm on September  23, and I noticed 3 very bright red lights in the sky, hovering in a triangle formation.  I couldn't figure out what they were; it was very cloudy, so I realized these couldn't be stars or planets because they were below the cloud cover.  As I continued to watch them, I noticed they were moving, flying up, down, left, right; and they moved independent of each other, so they were not connected to one aircraft.  As I watched the three red lights, a fourth one came flying from over the store into my field of vision very fast, then stopped on a dime near the other three and just hovered there next to them.  Then all 4 of them hovered, and would individually fly slowly to the left and down in my field of vision.  Then, 2 of them flew very, very close together, like they were almost touching, then separated again.  Then, one by one, they each appeared to flicker out--which prob! ably means they flew higher up into the cloud cover and out of my sight.  I watched this group for about 3 or 4 minutes. I sat there in my car a few more minutes, and sure enough, two more red lights flew from over the store into my field of vision, so they were flying from south to north.  I called my parents, who live a block away from the store, and they ran outside and saw these ones.  As I was talking to them on the phone, another one flew from south to north and joined these other two.  They hovered and flew subtly back and forth, independently, for several minutes.  Then, just like before, two of them flew so close together that they appeared to touch.  Then, they each flickered out, one by one, disappearing into the clouds. A friend of mine, who lives 1 block north of the store, said that a group of people were standing in a parking lot across the street from his house, and they were pointing and shouting things about the sky.  He regrets not going outside to look for himself. I don't know if these events are related to these UFO's, but the Internet stopped working for several hours all over the east side of Erie, and a firefighter friend of mine reported that the power went out in half of the borough of Wesleyville, which is where I saw these objects. I personally witnessed these two groups of red UFO's for about 10 minutes total, but they were already in the sky when I came out of the store, so I don't know how long they were visible before I saw them.  I don't know if the second group of 3 UFO's were the same ones I saw minutes earlier (in the first group of 4), or if there were 7 different UFO's.  There was no sound associated with this event. I am 37 years old, and I've never seen anything like this before.  I am a church music director, and I was coming home from working with my church's youth group when I saw these UFO's.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,42.09974517647059,-80.07763388235293

Firstly, despite the lack of any noticeable wind at ground level, all four of the objects were moving at an eerily fast rate: they had each passed over the street facing our house and were at least a quarter mile away less than twenty seconds later. Secondly, each object, while grouped relatively close, moved at variable speeds and transcribed smooth arcs and lateral movements that brought them within feet of one another at times (excepting the fourth, which was the first to pass overhead). The glowing objects appeared to dim and wink out as they moved to the middle distance: the entire encounter having lasted no longer than two minutes.

I’m trying everything I can to record these things flying around my house almost every freakn night.  There is no way they are just planes because these things just set in the same spots for hours sometime before slowly moveing off. Some look like really bright stars but if you watch them among other star you can see they move around a lot. I was able to catch 2 on my recorder at night fall and one of the really bright ones at night. My recorder won’t work to good at night so stars show up but the light does.  There seem to be 2 different types of flying objects.  One has 2 whits light and smaller red ones between the white ones.  The other is several small white and red lights that look to rotate in cirles like its spinning.  I star to see them at night fall and on thru the night.  A lot of times the smaller one form a triangle when they get in that form they seem to go off in another direction but come back later on and separate and go in different directions. I just need help to figure out how to record them or catch them.  It is Sunday night and I started watching them about 8:30pm til around 1:00am and I counted 22 sightings. I don’t know if it was the same ones leaveing and comeing back but I have seen up to 6 in the sky at the same time. They cross one another and come within feet of one another and just stop and set there for a few minutes then take off again.  I can’t see air planes getting that close. The one I recorder in day light looks like a mirror flying by it was so bright. At that moment there was 3 in the air but I could only get one clearly because my recorder wouldn’t zoom in any more plus they are fast to follow. I even got what looked like a jet following that one but  left the jet way behind.  I never thought That stuff like that was real but after I saw the first one I kept looking up and on a clear night I could see a lot of them. If they are planes then ! I guess every plane in the area goes over my house. What gets ! me is ho w many there is and how low they are. Plus they seem to just set in spots for along  time. Everytime I try to record or watch them they stay at the edge of the clouds and for some reason my recorder battery dies within minutes. I only recorder like 10 minutes all together and the battery was dead after being fully charged. Its never done that til now. During the day if they are close you start to record but the object doesn’t show up in the recorder but the streamer  is still there.  You know how jets leave a cloud streamer behind them. Well, these do to but that’s all you can see in the camera but you can clearly see the object with your eyes. Plus my recorder uses the tape to record and dew at night messes with the camera so it hard to do. But I did get the really bright one where all of the other smaller ones meet up at before flying off.  I need help figuring out how to catch better recordings of these so I can prove what Im saying. The few recordings I have are not enou! gh for me. If I have to I’ll buy a better recorder because these aren’t planes. I’ve watched them for almost a month. But they seem to be returning more than before or I just noticed it. I’ve watched them every night for 2 weeks. Even on cloudly nights you can see them sometimes. From 8pm til midnight is the best  I’ve seem. I put a spot light on one and about 4 can back and just circled around for about a hour before moveing away. I did notice that when they form a triangle the lights look almost orange and brighter but I’ve only seem that twice in a week.

My seventeen-year old son and I were on the deck of a cabin we’re vacationing at on the south side of Crystal Lake near Frankfort, Michigan. Shortly after midnight we observed a bright orange light coming from the west, growing larger until it stopped a third of the way up the lake between two trees and hovered for about a minute. Then it slowly moved east over the horizon and shot like a bullet straight north over the horizon, disappearing into a small dot and then disappearing altogether in well under a second. It was impossible to guess how large it was or how high in the sky it was, though it appeared to be at about the same height a helicopter might fly. It was obviously not a star, an airplane or helicopter, or any ordinary light. It appeared to be moving deliberately, and it was completely silent, which is especially notable on a lake where sound carries very far. I’m combining two reports into one because the next night, 7/15/12, at approximately the same time, my son and I were out on the deck observing the stars and joking about how funny it would be if the light appeared again, when out of the west, it did.  This time it hovered long enough that by the time we absorbed what we were seeing, I had time to remember that I should go get my cell phone and take a picture. Before I could, the light flew quickly back to the west out of sight within a fraction of a second, was followed within 2 or 3 seconds by a slightly smaller orange light that hovered in the same spot in the middle of the lake for a minute or so before it shot west out of sight.  All three lights that we saw were close to the same size but appeared to get larger as they advanced towards us to hover   I would say about half the size of a normal full moon at their largest, and maybe just slightly oval but mostly round. My son and I are both in agreement about the details of what we witnessed and that whatever the light was, its movements were unlike anything we’ve ever seen before and not explained by any known aircraft, satellite, or other typical explanations for an unidentified object/light in the sky.

Just killing time waiting for my dog, I studied them and they had lights at regular intervals along the side or perhaps bottom.  The moon did not provide much light but what I observed appeared to be ""bars,"" long and rectangular, with lights equidistant along the side. As I stood there, I realized these objects in the sky were not moving at all but were totally stationary.  I watched a plane fly over but the ""bars"" were exactly where they were when I first saw them, perhaps 20 minutes before.  They were not aligned in any pattern but scattered randomly overhead. As someone who firmly believes in UFO's, I was slow to accept that I might be seeing them. As I said, I first thought they were large passenger planes and that I was seeing the windows lit up; however, they were too high up to be such.  I waited for them to move but they did not. A little frightened since they were in the sky right above our house, I took my dog and went in. Thus, I don't know how long they were out there, but I was out watching them about 25 minutes.

I noticed that there seemed to be a lot of airplane traffic on my way home from Bloomington, and some very bright stars looking to the west from Interstate 494 north but it was when I was approaching the highway 12 bypass, while still on Interstate 394, that I noticed an either extremely large or very low flying set of lights in the sky coming from the west.   As other planes were also visible in the sky (they did not appear to be 'chasing' the object) I really didn’t take much notice of it until I registered just how big it was and then realized it didn’t appear to be moving.   I realize that depending on location of the objects and positioning of the viewer, some moving objects can appear stationary.  This did not appear to be the case, and I could see all the other airplanes in the area moving in the direction of the airport.  The object was on the north side of the road and above the trees.  When 394W ends the highway splits, one way takes traffic highway 12 through Long Lake, and the other is the bypass.   The object was centered between the 2 highways.  Had it been a normal road I would have pulled off to the shoulder, but that stretch of road is not safe to do so, but I could see it through the windshield by leaning forward and peering up at it.  There were noticeably more lights on the front of the object than would be on an airplane, all along what would be the wings if it were an  airplane; none were blinking and all were white; there were no red or green lights.

They were going very very fast; fast enough to break the sound barrier in my opinion. I didn't hear anything.  The speed they were going reminded me of shooting stars. The V formation wasn't perfect witch led me to believe that all the crafts where individual.  They were extremely bright (white) and big. like the size of holding a dime at arms length.  They didn't leave a trail or tracers & they didn't change color.  It sent chills down my spine cause it was as plane as day and the most bizarre thing i have ever witnessed in my life.  The crafts were flying a few hundred feet above the mountains behind utah lake (to the east). Maybe 20 seconds after the event i looked to the south and saw an airplane flying from south to north but it was much closer to me (to! the west) Im not sure if the airplane was close enough to see it.

INTRODUCTION: On Friday May 4, 2012 I was on my way to work from my home in Santa Fe,Texas to Galveston where I work as a veteran police officer of 32 years currently assigned to the night watch 11: pm to 7: am. DETAILS: It is a 23 mile one way trip of which I have been driving for twenty years. This particular Friday night was no different than any other.  I was driving east on FM Road 1764, a four lane with a center turn lane and narrow shouldered concrete state highway, in the right lane out of habit and right at the speed limit of 50 mph.  I knew there were approx. four or five other vehicles or so behind me by their head lights in my rear view mirrors.  This is a fairly consistently busy and traveled roadway all the way from State High way 6 in Santa Fe to Bay Street in Texas City.   As in any typical like story I was just driving along when something in the distant sky got my attention.  For a few split seconds I saw what I initially perceived to have been the typical small red marker light of an air plane of some sort, frequently seen in this part of the country.  There's quite a bit of air traffic around here as we are only about 20 - 25 miles or so to the south west of  NASA Space Center Houston, Hobby Airport Houston, USAF Ellington field Houston, George Bush International north Houston, Shoals field Galveston, and a hand full of small privately owned airports as well. In a matter of seconds I guess it was the fact this light I initially saw was getting much bigger because of its speed now that I think about it. In fact it is really beginning to bug me in that I can not remember verbatim the exact sequence of events but to get right to enough of what I did see is this. This light began to pick up speed from a tiny red like dot in the lower part of the sky oncoming to the south east of me headed west as if it were may be originally running along parallel to the sea shore of and/ or coming in from The Gulf of Mexico out of Galveston.  Then it seemed to have hooked a sharp 90 degree turn of some sort to the north, headed in my direction but ahead of me which would have been some where around IH 45 I guess.  This was when I could clearly see that it just wasn't one light I was looking at. I could have sworn I was seeing a whole string of these things, as many as 40 plus? What ever they were began to make different formations, three abreast side by side in two coll om’s with one coll om slightly ahead of the other in multiple pairs of a distinct total of six and so on.  I even saw them shift from this to the typical triangle type image you can find on Youtube in that all you could see was the lights themselves, no structure of any kind if any att! ached to.  Then back to a single perfectly aligned long row just one after another headed back to the west. I had slowed down to 30 mph or so glancing back and forth from my rear view mirrors as I didn't want to get hit from the rear while desperately trying to watch this parade it seemed, of lights across the sky. This was when I noticed no one was passing me and could only assume they were doing the same thing in awe of these lights.  Then again, they cut to the north switching to these same type of different formations, back to the west if I recall, then as if intended just for me and the few others behind me, to the north again just in time to parade across High way 1764 a short distance ahead right in front of me. I was ahead of all east bound traffic the entire time in this area and had pulled over onto the narrow shoulder to a complete stop by this time. I was fanatically trying to find my Nikon digital camera I try to carry at all times with in reach of which turned up a little too late in the back seat of my car.  I watched these lights disappear into the  northern sky between glances back and forth looking for my camera.  One thing I do in fact distinctly remember was that when they crossed over the high way in front of me, almost directly over head as I had to look nearly straight up through the upper part of my windshield from rolling to a gradual complete stop not expecting them to turn like they did and cross the high way, I counted 7 individual lights one right after another in single file as they crossed the high way. They were a sort of a hazy orange in color at this time and about the size of an orange regarding the distance in the sky from me in which I was watching.  There was a darker solid looking orange ring around the circumference of it with no glow, tail,etc. such as a star or a comet and there was defiantly some sort of rotation going on with in. Once on the other side of the high way they went back to a staggered two column of three side by side formation with a single one by itself behind the six in front of it as if this position were some kind of safety watch for the six in front? I can also recall that when ever they did decide to maneuver one way or another in altitude or  in making a turn on a dime as they say, it would be in this single file pattern all coming together one behind the other and kind of gave me a roller coaster feeling just watching them as I saw this several times in the entire episode from start to finish. This is exactly what it reminded me of in watching a roller coaster from the ground at an amusement park when you see the first car cresting over the steepest longest drop and all the rest following behind i! t as they one by one come into view picking up lighting type s! peed in a split second free fall, and then whipping into a sudden sharp embanked turn one direction or another at the bottom of fixed tracks, only this was a roller coaster ride taking place right before my eyes in the sky. I don't know why I was not any more excited than usual at the time this was taking place.   May be it is because I am 57 years old now by just a few days and a total of 38 years of my adult life as a police officer in “nothing surprises me any more” in being just numb to it all. Just losing my dear mother in March, family problems, just finishing an extended extra job just the day before didn't help anything either. I was tired and wore out from it all hence not being able to find my camera in time. I had awoken from about just three hours or so of no sleep in between headed in again for another eight hours. I was not in a good mood to begin with but on my way again just the same. During this ordeal I couldn't help but think, no I'm not going to get on the (police) radio with this and for what as in “it's best to remain silent and just have others guessing your a fool rather than opening your mouth to confirm it” and for what even though by force of habit I found myself reaching for it. They were gone in a matter or seconds any way. I found myself in this situation the rest of the way to Galveston. I know what I saw though and better yet I know what others behind me also had to have saw. When I got to work I called the Santa Fe Police dispatcher on ! the telephone as I refuse to have a cell phone since they are now so user friendly, and reluctantly asked her has anyone with in the last 20 minutes or so called in anything out of the ordinary in the sky? She stated that I was her “second call” in regard to. This was good enough for me in that I knew I had saw something that up until then, I have only heard others report of. What I found interesting was that she could only tell me that the call came from a female however who ever she was, reported seeing more or less the  same thing only involving a total of SIX different lights. Whether my count or hers was off or not wasn't important. It was just the fact that I was assured I wasn't beginning to “see things that were not really there” and the part of human nature I guess in knowing I wasn't alone. It is now May 13, just a week and a day since I saw this event. For various reasons I haven’t been able to complete this report. During this time by accident I caught in on part of what my youngest son was watching on The History Channel, “Ancient Alien's” a couple of days or so after the fact, newly released and very well put together I might add. I happened to see the part where Christopher Columbus reported his nearly identical sighting of unexplained lights in the sky as far back in his days which were explained as The Jewish Manor a in his words. These lights I saw were identical to the ones presented (recreated) in this program with the exception of in The Jewish Manor a there was a total of nine instead of the seven I believed to have seen and the six by the unknown to me report e to The Santa Fe Police Department. Since I wasn’t able to take any pictures this is the best example I can provide at this time as to exactly what I know I saw. The only question in my mind as in anyone else for that matter remains, just what exactly, were they?

Some friends and I were driving down a country road one summer surrounded by farms and cow fields.  We stopped the car and were just hanging out like teenagers do.  Out of no where i hear my buddy who was standing about 80 ft away start yelling and pointing up above him.  I looked over and immediately saw an oval shaped craft hovering COMPLETELY silent about 50 ft directly above his head.  It looked mettallic against the night sky with a rotating red light beneath it that was revolving in a circular motion.  It was completely still.  My jaw dropped. I ran towards my buddy and the object in complete shock and curiousity.  The two girls we were with saw it as well and paniced.  They started screaming and crying for us to leave and ran to car.  My friend and i however were nore intersted in watching it or trying to communicate with it.  As soon as i got to where my friend was standing the object shot thru the sky so fast to another point (which looked about a mile away)! that it appeared to disappear then reappear.  Once it reappered of in the distance we observed there were 2 more just like it!  They moved thru the air as if they were dancing following no particular direction.  Just moving erratically.  We stood and watched in awe for about 20 minutes until they all flew in one direction which we then noticed a larger craft that appeared to be triangle shaped with three huge bright white light at each point.  The three smaller craft (appearing as red lights at this distance now) seemed to circle around the triangle as if it was thier mothership?  They appeared to become part of the big triangle one and then split off again and again.  We watched this dance for a few more minutes in disbelief before all the objects seemed to shoot off or disappear.  One of the things that was strange is that we could hear dogs howling and barking for miles as if they were terrified or in pain?  If that makes any sense. We told everyone we knew thinking people would! be intersted, instead, we were ridiculed and made fun of.  So, we all pretty much never talked about it again.  I know what we saw. Im not crazy.  If i wouldve been alone i may have wondered if i was!  However i was with three other people who all saw the same thing.  I went back to the sight many nights after armed with a camera and patiently waited for hours sometimes but they never returned.  Most AMAZING thing ive ever experienced.

Just as the ceremony ended the crowd of some 5,000 attendees was proceeding north toward the main platform.  I was headed in exactly the opposite direction toward the television remote truck, the event was broadcast on cable TV, to retrieve a piece of equipment I had loaned the production crew. It was a nearly cloudless day, the air was very clear and the sky was deep blue.  Out of the corner of my eyes I noticed something unusual seemingly floating north to south across the valley at about 500 feet altitude. I t was perfectly round, about 30-40 feet in diameter, brown like a basketball with no seams, it had no windows and it made no sound.  It looked like a dull brown ball, was completely smooth and devoid of any features.   What I saw was a silent brown ball slowly moving across the valley heading due south. There wasn't another person within a hundred feet of my location so there was no way to point it out to anyone else.  I may have been the only person to notice it.  Apparently whoever or whatever was in the thing was checking out the large crowd of people on the ground beneath it.  It took less than a minute for it to cruise past then suddenly it took off at high speed and disappeared into the distance gaining altitude as it left. At the time I just blew it off. I was not particularly motivated to mention my sighting to anyone since when the subject of UFOs comes up most people roll their eyes and ask, ""What were you smoking before you saw it?""   I wouldn't bring it up now except not quite a year later I got my real introduction to UFOs.  In May of 2006 I was being a tourist taking pictures of the Sundial Bridge in Redding, California.  That evening I loaded the pictures on my PC and while looking them over I noticed something in one photo that caught my attention.  It's just a bright spot in the photo but it is clear enough and distinct enough that I knew it was not simply a reflection in the lens. I had no idea what it was but I was determined to find out if it was an anomaly or if the experience would repeat.  I went back to the same location and shot over 800 still photos with a Sony DSC-F828 digital camera.  I not only caught more of the bright objects, many of them, but I snapped another even stranger looking object that really got me into finding out what I had tapped into. In August of 2006 I purchase a Canon GL-2 video camera. It has a 200x zoom and something called Frame Mode which treats each frame of video as a stand-alone jpeg rather than the interlaced images most video cameras shoot.  The still frames shot with the GL-2 are clear, sharp and jitter free. To date I have over twenty hours of footage shot in a variety of locations that in my opinion proves without doubt that we are anything but alone in this universe.  There are four distinct objects that I find all the time. Some large and some unimaginably small, approximately .030"" in diameter.  The tiny ones are around by the hundreds at very close range.  I have video of them on my hand. I've made rudimentary communication with the small ones.  They obviously know I'm shooting video of them.  They put on a display I can only describe as waving to me. I printed one frame of their formation and waved it in front of them and they repeated the wave at my request. I reported this to MUFON, actually met with the regional director in Portland, Oregon.  After showing him some of my footage he basically blew it off and brought up an image on his computer that he claimed was a ""real"" UFO. My video is all shot in daylight making the objects  clearly visible, not just blobs of light in a dark sky. His ""UFO"" video was nothing more than a tiny white light in a black sky. Oooo! I was unimpressed. The UFO shows on television are mostly eye-witness accounts with no photos or videos to back them up. I've seen better on You Tube. I have clear videos of objects that unless authority is truly hiding some serious technology from the public were not manufactured here. If you are interested in seeing clear video of objects that can fly circles around fighter jets and have flown circles around airliners in my video, look me up. If not I really don't care because I've found the mainstream self proclaimed UFO hunters to be frauds working to hide the truth rather than expose it. If you are different let's talk.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,42.1563,-122.52979999999998

The first craft angled up and started to climb. Then the second craft came into view.  Double shock!   They were both on the same flight path. Here is the strange part.  They hit the same spot in the sky and disappeared like they walked behind a tree.   They were the same craft that were spotted in England.

It appeared to 'teleport' in, is the only way I can best explain it as it came from the direction of my lounge window.  It was very tall (approx 7ft), thin, and I could see its spine very clearly.  It had no mouth as such and communicated telepathically.  It mostly kept its back to me, wore a dress and a wig!   I know that sounds absurd but it felt to me that it didn't want to alarm me.  It went over to my laptop, which was on at the time, and did something on it.  I asked the being what it wanted, but it didn't say.  It pressed a few keys and from the ceiling a blue metal star shaped object appeared. It said something about a binary star system, 01, and a machine.  The star 'machine' made a loud crackling noise and 'on/off' sound 3x. I was told 'plasma'.  It said we downloaded and uploaded information like satellites, using stars, which was us, and mentioned supreme! technology.   I was aware it was of no sex but maybe appeared feminine for whatever reason.  I was totally made to feel at ease with it.  I got the sense of Sirius and 'star-being', communication technology and 0-1.  Stellar communication.

My Location: on my deck facing west with clear visibility to the northwest. Visual:  I managed to see it through my binos. Direction:  Object came from the westerly direction traveling northeast. Altitude:  object stayed at constant altitude throughout. Speed seemingly consistent; did not seem to slow or speed up. Shape spherical Color orange - glowing Looked at it through binoculars – NO smoke or shooting flames, but the surface seemed to be like molten lava rolling into itself. Object continued along until obscured by buildings – my daughter and I ran out to road so we could see to the northeast.  It continued at its elevation until out of sight. Witness: While on the road a lady that walks her dogs also saw it.  She mentioned some fellows up the road also witnessed (I don’t know who they were). My Thoughts I always try to eliminate the obvious or disprove, rather than get too excited about something like this, but after seeing that there was no smoke, no flames and the object was not coming down as something on fire would – I became excited. I did not report this as I had no picture – and felt ‘what’s the point’, until I heard your interview on Coast to Coast.  My husband, when he heard your description, said to me, ‘there you go’. I am happy you are there doing what you do – I don’t want to just report to anyone.  I will, henceforth, write any sighting in a report for your information.

They were all a brilliant white and were traveling east to west at different altitudes.  Their speed seemed to be around twice that of the passenger jets that I see frequently flying east to west or vice versa.  Some of these objects were below the clouds some were in the clouds and some were at very high altitude.  I heard no sound associated with this phenomena.  The sighting lasted approximately 20 to 25 minutes as I counted in excess of 50 objects flying by at different speeds and altitudes.  The objects seemed to pulsate bright white. There were no navigation lights on these objects.  There were also airplanes in the area that were significantly dimmer and flashing colored navigation lights.  On several occasions I saw objects change direction and or stop in-flight to avoid flying aircraft.  In fact I saw two objects change direction at 90° angles instantaneously to avoid aircraft, then continue their Westerly progress. I have been an amateur astronomer most of my life.  Consequently I know an airplane when I see it. These were not airplanes.  I have always been a skeptic of these kinds of phenomena.  I am 55 years old and can honestly say I have never ever seen anything like this in my lifetime.

When I first looked at it I thought it was the northern star because of how bright and big it was.  Then as I looked towards the right of the object I noticed a red pulsating light.  At first I thought it was just a plane going past, but then I realised that it wasnt moving.  My mom stopped the car and we just sat their in awe.  We were watching it for a good couple minutes and I decided to whip out my Ipod and film everything we were seeing. As the few minutes went by the bright light suddenly began to fade immensly. I screamed at my mom, ""The lights going away, its dimming""!  And then it started to slowly move to the left. My mom and I began to follow it with our car.  All of a sudden it shot so fast behind a tree, that we had to speed up greatly to get in view of it again.  When it shot super f! ast it looked like a mdoern day deciption of a UFO. It was very slim and oval like. When we got in view of it again, on the other side of the tree, it was now giving off the very same bright light that it was giving off when we first saw it.  My mom decided to pull up in a little parking area and get closer to it. I on the other hand was freaking out.  I told her no. I was afraid of getting abducted because of all the stories I have read about things like that happening. But my mom was not scared, she was facinated and incomplete awe.  As we were wathching it she was telling me, ""I have never seen anything like it.""  As we were sitting their, the UFO was going in all sorts of directions, kind of like it was scanning the are.  Then all of a sudden it stopped, and soon enough it started coming towards us. I was freaking out and telling my mom to ""Go, get out of here! Go!"". I was literally crying tears of freight. But within a few minutes it began to turn around and slowly turn around and go the opposite direction. The white light began to immensly dim again but the red light was still pulsating through all of this. At one point when we were so close to it, it looked as thoughs omething was hanging down from it. My mom thinks that maybe it turned and as we could only see the red light, the white end light of it was hanging down as it turned. We really are not sure what it was hanging. While we were sitting their watching all of this occur, I remeber telling my mom a few times ""Look how big it is! it looks like a car"".  And let me tell you it was huge! I also remember a hearing it when we were very close to it. As it was coming closer I began to hear it even louder. It sounded like the noise a helicopter gives out. But the thing was..it was NOT a helicpoter. As it was going the other direction, my mom backed out of the parking space we were in and began to follow it. It was moving at a farily steady pace at this point. As we were on the street of our house already, my mom stopped the car at the side of the road and we just sat their watching it. The bright light began to dimmer again, and the red light went away. As we sat their I remember there was one point in which the light was gone completely and we couldnt see it anymore. But then it lit up again. We watched it as it went higher and higher up into the sky. It sat in the same exact spot for the rest of the night until we went to bed. If any other person didn't see what we saw and just looked up in the sky at the moment, they would have thought it was a little star because thats what it looked like. A little dim flickering star up in the night sky. This experience will stay with my mom and I for the rest of our lives. I have always believed in UFO's..but my mom on the other hand, has not. She doesnt believe in UFO's, ET's, or even the paranoraml. She is a ""I'll believe it when I see it"" type person. And after tonight..she whole heartedly believes that wer are not alone in this universe. A few times throughout the video we shot, you can clearly hear us saying, ""Its just a helicopter"", then ""No, its not"". We were in denial and didnt know what the heck the thing was. It was def not a plane or a helicopter. There were planes flying throughout the sky while we were watching the UFO. They looked NOTHING alike. All in all, my mom and I know what we saw last night..and no one can take away that experience form us.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,43.1311,-88.3359

I got online and realized more like myself have seen the same thing, Thank God-I am not alone! Makes you want to find more people that saw it too. Here is my sighting... I was outside on the back porch looking right in the direction of it!!! I witnessed it do something really strange! It was just going right through a couple of tree's. I immediately stood up and jumped on a chair to see it over the fence. Once standing I saw it going in a straight line, it had to be flying low because I could see it sitting down. I watched it go through the tree's then it made a very sharp turn up and back down-Almost like a 90 degree angle, then back down to the ground, field.  Then I did not see it anymore.

But as I got closer they appeared to be too big - about 10 feet in diameter. After passing over Congress Ave they continued on then turned south and kept going parallel with the street behind me. They disappeared behind the trees, and I turned around at Hypoluxo Blvd to go back south and try to catch them on my camera, but never saw them again. They were in view for perhaps 30 seconds, starkly visible against the bright blue sky and cumulous clouds. They appeared to be about 200-300 years away at the beginning, and maybe 50-75 yards up. They kept their formation the whole time, one higher and ahead of the other. I couldn't tell if it was directly in front of the other or not. I was in the car in traffic and heard no sound from the spheres. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Me and my fiance went out to have a smoke around 12:20am on August 2nd of 2012, and just as I walked outside I looked up into the sky.  I spotted this weird thing, and quickly pointed it out to my fiance because I thought my eyes were playing tricks.  But no, he saw it too.  It was this, almost orb of fire hovering across the sky. My fiance almost thought it looked like someone had shot a flare up into the sky, but it just flew in a straight line, no trail behind it.  It was going about as fast as a plane does when you see them in the sky, but it was a lot closer than a plane.  Almost maybe as high up as a 80 story building. I'm just guesstimating here.  But it was moving at a decent speed, but slow enough to follow for a few minutes. Both me and my fiance caught it on our camera phones.  My camera wasn't to good on the quality, but I'm still going to try and upload it somewhere.  The orb was like a fire color, a little orange, some red, and a little white at the edge.  The camera didn't pick it up that way though.  Me and him followed it for as long as possible, which about a few minutes, before the flame look went away and all we were able to see was a dark grey disk fade behind the tree's.  There was no sound to the strange thing, not like a plane would give off, no crash sound later on from like a meteor, no tail on the thing trailing behind it, just a fiery orb floating across the sky. I had posted the story on my Facebook, onto my paranormal web site, to see if anyone could help to identify it. And then someone sent me a link to this site.  I noticed some others were having similar experiences as us.  All I know is when the craft disappeared, I had the strangest gut feeling that we were not meant to witness that.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,37.66861323741007,-120.99442244604317

I stepped outside to investigate and what I witnessed was unlike anything I had ever seen before. About 10 miles south of Lake Havasu City AZ I saw a very large UFO about the size of a city or maybe bigger, it was gigantic.  The saucer shaped object appeared to be a silver or chrome plated color glistening in the moonlight.   The object was hovering motionless in the air with seven or eight very bright flickering white lights attached in a circle around it. relative to a star, each light appeared to be about the size of the moon however the lights were not in space.  The UFO also had a plasma like coating around it and was completely silent. This event only lasted a duration of about thirty seconds or so.   I rushed into my house to find a camera but by the time I got back outside, the lights had become very dim and faded away. The craft was so advanced in technology, it was like seeing something out of a sci-fi movie. I believe it may have camouflage capabilities and other unknown abilities.

((NUFORC Note:  Witness submits second report, reporting that the sighting had been caused by a missile launch out of Cape Canaveral.  PD)) Unidentified Object Over Stuart/Hobe Sound, Florida  While driving north on US Hwy 1 in Hobe Sound, Florida (just south of Stuart)on January 30th, 2013 - at approximately 8:49pm - a fast-moving, bright orange object caught my eye, to the east, over Jupiter Island. At first, I thought it was a plane, but noticed it looked too large to be airplane lights, and that it had a fiery / flaming orange trail. It was flying south, parallel to the coastline. My next thought was that it was possibly something that had been launched from Cape Canaveral, as we can occasionally see night-launches from our area. I had just driven from Jupiter/Tequesta, and had noticed a bright light (also in the east) possibly from a helicopter or airplane, about 8 miles south of where I saw the above-mentioned object. The reason I mention this, is because what initially caught my eye was the great speed of the orange flaming trail in relation to the light seen over the Jupiter/Tequesta area, less than 10 minutes prior. The sky was clear, with no clouds. I pulled over in a church parking lot (east side of US Hwy 1) to get a better look, and immediately dialed my husband from my cell phone. (8:50pm) I told him to look to the southeast. I asked if he could see it from our home in Stuart, just a few miles north and slightly west of where I had pulled over. He could not. He is a pilot, and thought I might have been seeing a jet-engine flaring. I did not think so, due to the fact it was moving so fast, and also, so straight. (Horizontally) After about 20-30 seconds, the trail was no longer visible, but I could still see a light (just a circular light)traveling straight and to the south, but much faster than it had been moving while the trail was visible. At this point I assumed it might be a meteorite or satellite, but thought it unlikely due to it's speed and how it did not lose altitude. The entire viewing lasted less than a minute. I watched the evening news at 11pm, thinking I would see a report of something unusual. Since I did not, I decided to research news online. Upon finding nothing, I chose to contact your agency via your telephone hotline, where I was advised to put it into writing,in my own words.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,27.05459090909091,-80.1434690909091

It was very cool, clear, with highly visible stars and a ¾ moon in the W/SW sky. As I turned to do a 360 view I saw a very bright very white sphere off to the northwest moving very slowly toward the southeast. I’ve seen single engine prop planes move faster than this object. The object appeared to be 2-3 times the size of the largest/brightest star in the sky. It appeared to not be as high as the stars but more the height that an airliner may fly (35,000-40,000 ft). There were absolutely no sounds at all. The shape or color never changed. I kept expecting a sound as it past over me and finally left my view. The visual time was somewhere between 3-5+- minutes (I had no watch with me).  I remained outside for another 5+-minutes to see if I heard a sound like jet engines, but never heard any sounds.

I don’t know if this has anything to do with the sighting but I found it very odd. The day before, we were expecting some possibly sever storms so I had my weather radio on. When the weather threat was over I turned the weather radio off and moved it away from my bedside. It was still in my bedroom.  When my dog woke me up to go out, just before the sighting, I heard a noise in the bedroom that I thought was our old ceiling fan. It turned out to be that the weather radio was on and off station.

I was in the absolute middle of nowhere about 20 miles away from Milton, Florida when I saw four white fireballs in the sky. They were extremely close, fast, and made no noise at all whatsoever.  The fireballs would flash into the sky and then reform into balls of white light and fly around close to eachother. I pulled off the highway to see them as did other drivers.  They disappeared and I continued on my drive. Ten minutes later while driving I noticed a red orb of light slightly smaller than the white ones and more solid to the left of me seemingly going at my pace and following me.  While that was happening the white orbs were back and above me to the right in the sky doing the same thing as before- flaming/flashing into the sky and reforming into balls of white firey light all the while flying around. Again, they disappeared into thin air. So, the real kicker to this story is that I was almost home (Navarre, Florida) and I saw three of the white fireballs again and over ten light colored military tanks were pulling out of a side road heading towards where the balls of light were coming from.  I can't speculate that the military tanks were going to investigate this I just found the timing odd.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,31.140228571428572,-87.07442857142857

There was no neighbor outside and their exterior lights were also all shut. I went to the far end of my backyard and sat down on a chair, alone, relaxing and looking at the sky. A few minutes before the sighting, I spotted the usual planes and one possible satellite. My eyes were rapidly scanning the sky when something caught the corner of my eye. A ""star"" was traveling very fast across the sky, from west to east. As soon as I spotted the object, I tried to focus on it and follow it with my eyes :  I was completely mind blown. There was a total of three star-like objects moving fast in a linear formation!  They were surrounded by a very faint white disk-shaped halo.  What happened after that just blew my mind: the objects steered to form a triangular formation.  They regained their initial linear formation after about two seconds and I lost sight of the formation in the horizon.  They made no noise, no blinking lights or no strobes. It was just like that: stars travelling at enormous speed. I got chills immediately afterwards, I knew that what I just saw was not of this earth.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,,

An object traveled across the entire sky from southeast to northwest at an elevation of about 30 degrees above the horizon as it passed in front of us.  We saw no maneuvering, but it might have turned slightly more north toward the end of our viewing.  It was orange in color and looked like a burning orange, but no flames.  It was not a spec but rather a sphere or disc, perhaps subtending an angle ¼ that of a full moon.  No changes in appearance, color or speed.  Its altitude appeared to be that of small private aircraft.  It could not have been as high as commercial jets because had it been, its speed would have been so great that we would have experienced a sonic boom.  It was moving moderately quickly, I estimate at 200 mph.  What was most interesting is that there was no sound! from it!  We both are adults, an engineer and a teacher.

Not expecting anything I removed my glasses for a spell to rest my eyes in the dark. I live between  two airports so I am well acquainted with the aircraft coming and going.  Pontiac Airport has smaller aircraft such Lear jets and private planes whilst  Detroit has larger passenger commercial planes. I am also familiar with seeing satellites and the have seen the space station on occasion.  I watched mechanically as an incoming small aircraft approached above Pontiac Airport when a speck of light caught my attention. It was so high my first thought was,  'It's a satellite.'   I put my glasses back on to have a better look and as I watched I realized it was moving faster and faster unlike any satellite I've ever seen. It was not a meteor; of that I am sure, having seen thousands of them my whole life.  There were no telltale flashing aircraft lights nor was there any sound.  It just moved swiftly straight across the entire visible sky. I realize this is not enormously interesting in that it wasn't closer to Earth with more detail to report. But I was shaking and know it was like nothing I've ever seen before, and I would be interested to find out by the mathematics of speed based on approximate altitude, distance and time; perhaps that would be an indication of whether it was of this world or extraterrestrial.

Not too long after, we decided to go inside and get back to work, but not before I looked up at the sky.  I noticed a little blinking light in the stars.  It wasn't moving, and it didn't seem like a plane to me.  I pointed to the little blinking red light in the sky and said ""I think that's either a satellite or a UFO"" in a joking manner.  My fiance asked me to point out the light to him and said ""No, that's just a plane.  You can tell because the light's blinking red.""  I shook my head disapprovingly at him, as I saw the little light begin to move upward, ""Planes don't fly up."" I said to him.  I was a little bit afraid (and still am) so I wanted to go back inside.  He asked me to stay as he was really interested in it, and we sat outside watching this little light move around.  Once we accepted the possiblity of it being a UFO I waved at it and said ""hello"" in a rather silly way.  It moved in circles, rotating around and around.  It w! ould go up, and then back down.  It seemed to me like it was trying to keep it's balance, because it seemed wobbly.  There was a round cloud around the flashing light (if I was a more educated in the fields of physics, I'd go as far to say that it looked like it might have been breaking the speed of light or sound.)  The cloud moved around with the object, and seemed to be leaving a trail behind it as it moved.  The stars next to it (it was a little to the left of the big dipper) seemed to be reflecting off of it, but that might just be my own eyes, me just being in shock.  At about 2:35 AM I looked down at my watch as my fiance reached for his phone which he ended up not having anyway.  As we sat for another five minutes, we observed that it was moving very fast.  At this point it looked like it might have been moving away from us, but I'm not entirely sure.  We were out there until about 2:40 AM when I finally convinced him to come back inside with me.  A few minutes later I decided to go outside for a few seconds and see if I could still see it, and sure enough it was still there.

It was orange with some yellow color in it flickering brighter then dimming in a stationary position for about 8 seconds.  Then the object started to move to the south very slowly, still circular in form but getting brighter in intensity. As the object continued to the south it dipped down about 5 degrees very quickly continuing at the same slow pace south bound as before. Then three slow out of time blinking lights appeared on the outside of the object, pulsing off and on but not like a planes lights blink.  Then the bright orange, yellowish center of the object went out and just the little blinking lights remained. The craft continued south bound very slow and then dissapeared, not because it was too far to see but just vanished.  This all took place over a span of about 15 seconds.

At first I momentarily thought it was fireworks, then when it kept moving through the sky I thought it might be part of the meteor display I had been told about.  But the light kept coming steadily and really didn't seem like a meteor.  Next I thought it might be a helicopter with a bright search light.  But as it came closer there was no helicopter noise.  And then I thought it was a plane on fire.  I was horrified.  But it kept moving at the same speed and did not change direction.  It passed completely over and I watched it go east  over the Atlantic Ocean.   This took about 2 minutes. I turned back to the west to get out of the pool and was astounded to see another flaming ball approaching from the west following in the same path as the first going at exactly the same speed.   I could still see the first orange red fireball and watched as the second one silently followed the first out over the ocean.  They appeared to stay at exactly the same height. I gradually lost sight of the first one and then lost sight of the second about 2 minutes later.  The total time seemed to be about 5 minutes.  At first I thought they might have been military experiments.  But after some cursory research,  I suspect they are pieces of space debris still in orbit but on fire.  Seeing as there are hundreds of thousands of pieces of space debris out there, this makes the most sense.  Especially given their straight path and steady speed.

Five lights were visible at first sight, as the craft traveled North-South at a rate of speed and likeness of motion I can only compare to that of a blimp.  The distance between our vantage point and the object appeared to be very approximately 500-800 feet.  No “engine noise” was present, instead a fluxuating, “whirring”, or “humming” noise seemed to float down from it as it traveled at a very constant elevation (also unusually low for ANY aircraft, seemingly mere hundreds of feet above our treeline). Approx. 1min after the initial sighting, it began to turn, rotate rather, as if on a central axis.  It then began to travel from West-East, at the same rate, & elev.   After traveling another short distance, ( for approx. 1.5 min, )   It appeared to come to a complete stop, hovering in mid-air, as it again rotated on axis 90^.

We turned on 35th ave and saw another one moving past us at a high altitude.   We then pulled into a driveway that went into a open desert area and one came from the tree line heading towards us.  As it got closer it began climbing higher and was straight ahead of us and stopped.   From the same tree line a second ball of red light that had a cone of light shining from the top of the ball began to follow the first.   Once the second ball got closer to the first the first one began to take off again heading away from us and climbing higher into the night.   As the second ball followed the first ones path turning away from us a THIRD one began to fly towards us from the same tree line.  This one seemed closer and even bigger.  It turned away in a large turn and quickly sped behind the other two.   All three got to such an altitude that they disappeared.

I was facing the Northern Skies, the moon was full and the sky was clear. My friend and I were trying to kill time before visiting our mutual friend. We were in the same part of town as her apartment in Marion, IN. We were at a local Dollar General and a Casey’s General Store between sightings. Sighting One: Dollar General, MARION, INDIANA (State Road 15, also known as “the bypass”) I saw a bright star-like object near the moon moving downward and then it had disappeared. There are many things it could have been such as a satellite or a small space rock falling towards Earth, this I regarded as something ordinary. Sighting Two: Casey’s General Store   I was sitting in my friend’s Jeep while he bought gasoline.  I was downloading ""Sky Maps"" from Google Play on my phone because I wanted to identify a bright space object.  The object I was trying to identify was star-like in appearance, yet not uncommon.  It was most likely a planet or satellite, but still close to Jupiter. A few seconds later, I saw something otherworldly out of the corner of my eye and I stuck my head out of the window of my friend’s Jeep.  When I observed it fully, I was facing it, Northern Skies, the same part of the sky the moon was in and a bit far away from Jupiter.  I saw two orange lights on what seemed like a cigar or disc shape, the object slowly floated to the left of my field of view and had vanished, like it had faded into the sky while still moving slowly in the same direction.

Could throw rock and hit it. Early August 2012:  Large Craft seen by 5 individuals   I submitted the two earlier sightings to MUFON and to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I did not submit this following report because I believed that it was so unbelievable.  I only told this story to Mary Margaret Zimmer of the Miami MUFON when she visited me in late August of 2012 but to no other authority. I have been thinking about this event EVERY DAY since I saw it.  The most important item to retain in this quick summary is that I specifi-cally called this object--  it did not just mysteriously appear. After my wife saw the large UFO craft on July 8, 2012, I started to seriously begin my research on UFOs and paranormal issues.  I purchased numerous books from Amazon and spent all my free time on the internet.  I learned that many individuals (Steven Greer, Prophet Yahweh, and many others, call UFOS and then record videos of these objects. On a cloud covered night in the first week of August of 2012, at about 9 PM, a friend of mine called me and informed me that he was coming by and dropping off some of his traffic tickets.  I am an attorney and had previously told him that I will write up No Contest Motions to resolve these tickets for him.  He said he was close by and would be at my home in minutes.  I decided to wait for him outside. I live in a large cul-de-sac with only 3 houses.  My neighborhood has large yards and is very quiet.  It was dark and very cloudy.  I then decided to ""play a game.""  I remembered the Steven Greer and Prophet Yahweh videos and started to consciously wish to see the large multi-colored UFO craft  my wife saw on July 8th to appear in front of me just like it did for her.  Approximately every 2-3 minutes I turned around 360 degrees to see if I saw anything.  I did this for about 15 minutes.  Just when I was ready to give up, I saw this huge object on top of my neighbor’s back yard extending approximately 200-300 feet back. The object was not a solid object.  It was made up mostly of thousands of streaks of circular or oblong shaped white thin lights.  It appeared to me that I saw two possibly three distinct outlines formed by the  oblong perimeters of these white light streaks.  One circular object nearest to me was partially covered by the palm trees in front of my neighbor’s house.   This smaller oblong object was connected to a much larger oblong object as formed by the perimeter of these light streaks.  There appeared to be hundreds of swirls of circular white light streaks all inside of this object. The object was positioned at a horizontal position rising at approximately a 15 degree incline.  It was positioned at about an 8 o’clock to 2 o’clock format.  It was about 50 feet from the bottom of the backyard of my neighbor’s house to the bottom of this object.  It is difficult to determine its height but I would say that the object was about 100-200 feet in its height.  I was clearly very long, I would say at least 300 feet in length.  (Attached are Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7 which are drawings done by myself, my 10 year old daughter, my friend Luis, and his Wife Sandra). I then started yelling for my daughter to come outside.  My daughter had just turned 10 years old.  She had told my wife and I that both she and I had seen UFOs and she wanted to see one as well.  After about 1 minute of yelling outside her bedroom she came out and asked me “what was that”?  I told her that I did not know but believed it was a UFO in “hiding”.  She just looked at the object in amazement. After about 2-3 minutes of observing this object, my friend, Luis, who is 48 years old, his wife, who is 52 years old, and the daughter of his wife who is 17 years old drove up to my house.  Both Luis and his wife were trained as engineers in their native countries.  Luis is a conservative Catholic who was raised in Mexico.  He goes to Catholic Mass every Sunday and participates in various ministries.  He never believed in UFOS.  Both he and his wife were shocked and constantly asked me “what is that”.  We all tired to come up with logical explanations but we clearly could not come up with one that adequately explained this phenomenon.  We all doubted whether this was indeed a UFO and discussed that it must be some type of large light “anomaly”. Suddenly, all throughout the inside of the object, star light objects started to flicker on and off, flashing on and off in a fraction of a second.  I was surreal.  I believed that because we started to doubt this object, it wanted to put on a show for us to demonstrate to us that in fact it was very “real”.  It indeed was surreal.  We were not scared but instead started yelling— “look at that, look over there”—pointing to the stars bursting all over the different parts of the craft.  It was clearly putting on a show for us, or at least that was my impression. After about 15 minutes, my friends said they had to go and they drove off.   About 5 minutes later I believed that mosquitoes were biting me and I told my daughter that it was time to go inside because the mosquitoes were killing us.  In fact, my daughter told me later that there were no mosquitoes out that night.  After about one half hour later, I “woke up” and realized what a fool I was for just walking away from a scenario that should have been the front story of Time Magazine and every media outlet around the world if I had captured it on video.  I ran outside with my video and digital cameras but the huge UFO craft was gone. The ironic part was that about a month before this event, after my wife saw the huge multi-colored UFO outside our house, I purchased a large telescope, a night vision CCTV camera with adapters to attach this camera to the telescope, an old used SONY camcorder with the old night vision technology and a digital camera with high powered zoom for night shots.  I said to myself “the next time my wife or I see these objects we will be prepared to capture them on video and on camera so no one would doubt us”.  We know what we saw and they were real.  “Next time we are going to prove it.”  	The irony was that it never even entered my mind to take any of these newly purchased items out and take a video or a picture.  About 30 minutes after I entered my house with my daugthter, I came to my senses and ran out with my camera and my SONY video but the UFO had disappeared.  I now have been educated through my various readings that I was “instructed” to go inside and not to take any videos or pictures.  I have learned that various individuals having “close encounters” have experienced similar responses— our minds were totally controlled. Since that first week of August of 2012, my wife and I have not seen any other UFOs or similar objects either inside or outside our home.  Every day I think about what I saw and have become compulsive over these sightings and these visions have affected my work performance and my outlook on life, our role in our universe, and our relationship as spirits with God.  I am a changed person. SUMMARY  	Previous to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life. My wife is not bothered by these events because she is very religious and thinks that these visions were messengers from God.  I, on the other hand, have been “freaked out”.  I started doing research on the subject of UFOs, joined MUFON, ordered and read about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.  I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue. Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  As I stated earlier, I have various advanced professional degrees in addition to my legal training.  We live in an upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.  Now I am consumed with my visions and spend most of my free time on the internet, reading books about UFOs, alien abductions, consciousness studies, Near Death Experiences, paranormal and spiritualist literature, Buddhism, past life regression literature, etc, etc.  Over the last year I have purchased and read over 100 books on these subjects and have recently ordered about 30 more.  My wife thinks that I have become compulsive and totally consumed by my new pursuits and I tend to agree. I have just recently returned from my first MUFON meeting in Miami, FL and have a recommendation for the MUFON investigators.  Instead of solely relying on “purely scientific” techniques and tools--  the principle approach which was conveyed to the audience— I believe that the key to solving this UFO riddle is to focus on our minds--  our complex “consciousness”, our complex psychic abilities. The fields of parapsychology, involving the decade long studies by Drs. Harold Putoff and Russel Targ at Stanford and Dr. Robert Jahn at Princeton, in addition to the new “consciousness studies” involving Dr. Edgar Mitchell and his Institute of Noetic Sciences, as well as the hundreds of other “Consciousness Studies” academics that publish in the Journal of Consciousness Studies, provide the keys to “understanding” this phenomenon.  I also recommend that everyone read materials from these authors in addition to the rarely discussed book entitled “The Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century”, edited by Dr. Edward Kelly of the Department of Psychiatric Medicine at the University of Virginia. I know that I “invited” the entities of this craft to come “visit” me and that the “entities” in this craft made their “appearance” upon my “invitation”.  The key to solving the UFO quagmire is inside our own mind and spirit.  My latest event leads me to conclude that my mind, and other fellow human minds, are powerful and neglected instruments with powerful communication abilities. UFOs may not be from other planets in our universe.  They may be entities from a neighboring dimension as described in modern quantum physics.  It is very difficult to get a grasp what is going on with UFOs if one solely focuses on the “scientific method”.  The scientific method was developed to describe our physical universe and it does not adequately describe paranormal activities. Science has nothing to do with paranormal phenomena.  Science is based on the scientific method of discovery and experimentation.  The scientific method of discovery was devised for studying things in the physical universe.   Thus, when we are dealing with concepts outside of the physical universe--  things like the paranormal, UFOs, alien abductions, etc-- we are dealing with concepts outside of the physical universe and thus the scientific method breaks down.	  	New methods and techniques of investigation have to be developed to study this phenomenon, and if we do not, the future UFO investigators will remain clueless.  We are now just starting to “academically” explore the universe of possibilities beyond our physical senses to help explain what is “consciousness” and various paranormal activities.  In my opinion, we need to be able to investigate beyond our physical sense of reality and it is this new methodology that will provide a logical avenue to address the riddle of solving the UFO phenomenon.",2013-03-03T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

And then I noticed these lights, as bright and slightly larger than the stars, the color of a lit match- something between red and yellowor, like a hot orange.  There were 5 or 6 of them moving steadily from right to left in an elongated V formaton at a moderately steady pace.  The one furthest to the right was highest with the next one slightly lower, the next lower still, the next dropping much lower, the next much higher and the last higher still. They weren’t blinking or alternating color like lights from a plane, neither was there any noise like helicopters make.  I followed them as they moved across the sky until they were blocked by large tree, so I went out into the street to follow them and noticed two or three of them were gone.  I watched the ones remaining as they continued their path across the sky and noticed that one by one, from the right to the left, they were becoming fainter, losing color until they disappeared.  And then they were gone.. It was truly the strangest thing I’ve ever seen and have no idea what they were.  I’m not one for conspiracy theories and figure there’s an explaination other than extraterrestial, but I’m totally at a loss for what it is.

I live about 7 miles southwest of LAX.  Usually planes do not fly over me.  They usually fly around south of me around Palos Verdes because of noise ordinances.  Normally, we have, in the Southbay a heavy marine layer from the ocean, so seeing stars is a real treat when can. Last night I was cleaning my house. It was about 9pm at night.  I wasn't tired.  But, I went out on the balcony to shake out some rugs in my house. I stopped to notice the marine layer gone and how beautiful the stars were that evening. I look up towards Venus,the largest star.  There was about 4 stars around Venus.  I had my direction directly above and low and behold there was something moving. It had no lights that were very bright.  And it appeared totally black.  Against the black sky, one would have missed it if they were not looking directly at it.  It moved at a normal airplane pace but there was no noise. My line of site followed it.  If I looked away, I probably might have lost it. It! was heading northwest towards LAX. As I tried to make out this opaque plane, I could tell there were 6 dim lights on the bottom of it.  These lights followed a triangular pattern.  My gaze followed it until I could not see it anymore.  My first thought was that it was heading towards Vandenburg air force base.   We frequently get a lot of rockets and entrails around that direction.  My second thought was that it was some kind of military drone.  But, why the triangular shape?

Tthe next night the same two were outside and saw ""something"" floating past our house, with military escort, soundless and lightless, flying lower than any plain or jet.  two days after the three of us were out side and saw strobe looking lights coming from the military base.   i have seen the same strobe lights from the base six time since. and since posting this same thing on a UFO sighting sight i have been harassed by constant phone calls from numbers that every time i call back it says its ""no longer in service.""",2012-11-04T00:00:00,46.5366,-111.7695

My son (a volunteer firefighter) and I (a youth minister) were sitting on my front steps smoking and talking before he had to go to work.  We heard the distinct sound of a large military helicopter to the east of us and casually discussed the fact that it was strange that it was doing what looked to be training manuvers at 4:00 in the morning.  We live over the flight path to the airport and see them many times a day.  I was raised by a dad in the Air Force and was in myself so I am fascinated with aircraft and enjoy watching them when they do training excercises.   We continued to watch as it came closer going from the east to the west and were also wondering why it was flying so low.  As it approached the corner of our yard the tree was moving back and forth violently from the down draft of the rotors.  That's when we noticed the street light reflecting off the bottom of a craft flying directly above the helicopter.  It was shaped like an arrowhead and completely blocked out the stars for about 2 city blocks.  The bottom of it looked like a snakes scales made of a metal we have never seen before. It had one red light at the front and was completely silent.  Once out from under the light it was invisible again except for blocking out the stars and they just slowly continued west until out of sight.  We then realized it was not 2 helicopters doing training it was the one helicopter moving to get below the craft.

We were staying in an oceanfront house and on August 6th I went down to the end of the boardwalk to watch the ocean and look at the stars at about 9:45 pm.  While there I saw an orange light, circular in shape, come on over the ocean, then a few seconds later another.  The first light then dimmed and went out, followed by the second light.  Seconds later another light followed by two more.  All three dimmed and went out in order of their appearance.  This went on for about 15 minutes, the orange lights coming and going sometimes 2, sometimes 3 or 4, always dimming and extinguishing in order of their appearance.  When they stopped appearing, I saw a group of white lights moving across the sky, away from the ocean and over the beach and the houses before disappearing.  They were not blinking and they were not in any type of uniform order, just a ! group of white lights. They did not start out over the ocean in the same spot as the orange lights, but a bit to the south. I did not mention what I had seen to the family because I knew they would make fun of me!  However the next day I looked up “orange lights over the coast of South Carolina” on the internet and this website popped up.  All the descriptions were very similar to, or exactly like what I had seen.  I told the family then and another friend and her family who were staying a few blocks down the beach.  Of course there were skeptics, so I challenged everyone to come out on the beach the following night, August 7th, to see if the lights showed up again.  We headed out to the beach at about 9:15 pm and waited patiently. Sure enough, after about 10 minutes the orange spheres lit up again, exactly as before.  My friend and her family were was also on the beach in front of their house.  We had our phones and took photos of the lights and stayed in touch with each other to verify what we were seeing.  The only difference in this sighting was the departure of the white lights.  This time i! t was a larger group of lights, brighter and twinkling.  It moved more quickly and was located to the north side of where the orange lights had appeared, instead of the south side as had been the case the night before, but again moved away from the ocean over the beach and towards land.  As before, the orange lights stopped after the white lights disappeared. I looked for the lights the following night, August 8th with my niece and my son.  This time we saw only a few or the oranges spheres blinking off and on, lasting about 10 minutes and no white lights.  I have about 12 photos of the lights.  I thought about posting soon after I witnessed this, but finally decided to post now because my friend told me she read a story about the lights in the Charlotte Observer newspaper yesterday, November 1, 2012.  I finally decided I needed to share what I had seen; every sighting might help to figure out what these mysterious lights could be.",2012-11-04T00:00:00,,

The main color was orange, but it seemed as if there was a smaller green light at the front of the object.  Similarly, there was a darkness to the mass that made me believe it was plane with its engines on fire.  Since there was no noise, I assumed the engines had stalled out. There was not a long tail on the object like there usually is in a shooting star.  It moved horizontally and then took a sharp left.  Its path then became obscured by the trees to the right side of the highway. I was on the phone at the time of the sighting, and I'm not a person who swears much, but I swore. A lot.

As we kept driving, my friend, pointed out something coming up from out of the field to on our right hand side.  I looked out the window and didn't see anything. He told me to look up in the sky. I looked up into the sky and saw lights.  I yelled and told him to stop the car now.  He stopped the car and I got out as fast as I could.  I started recording the object. It was roughly about 50 feet in the air and increasing height.  It seemed to be hovering up slowly (2mph+). I got my iPod out and started to record it.  From what I saw it had a circular shape, with blackness around it, and lights around the blackness. It had bright red and yellow/white lights.  It started to hover over us and go south.   We jumped in the car and started to follow it.  Once we started to follow it the object started to speed up gradually.  As we got a mile down the road the object was no where in sight.  I then checked my iPod to watch the recording.  My iPod had some sort of malfunction and shut off while I was recording. It would not turn on.   About 10 minutes later my iPod rebooted and the video was not there.  My friend and I freaked out and did not know what to do. We kept going towards are desination despite of what we saw. When we reached the nearby town we noticed flashing lights.  We investigated the town and found that a house in town was caught up in flames.  The fire department was trying to put it out.  I do not know exactly what it was, but I know for a fact that it was a flying object with lights and it was something I have never seen in my life.

The sky had turned fairly dark except in the lower part of the horizon.  It was a clear night, not a cloud in sight; all I saw in the sky before taking the last three photos was a few fainted stars.

While driving I notice a flickering red orb to the left of my vehicle,just behind some trees less than a  few meters away.  A red flag immediately went off in my mind, since there were no roads parallel to the one I was travelling in.   The orb travelled exactly the speed of my car winding along the roadside as my vehicle had to make  a left and a right to follow the path of the road.  My vehicle had to stop since the road was still blocked in preparations for repairs.   The objects flew straight past my car following the road and then made a right.  I remember being so terrified but curious.   I called one of my friends at the time to stay on the phone with me.  The road that the orbs flew into was accessible to me from another path.   The drive took me about 15 minutes all the while I kept searching for signs of the o! rbs.  At last I reached an empty field and there above it were two flickering red orbs.   Terrified I sat in my car with my windows down listening for any noises there were none.  They just flickered in silence no higher than 20 feet, seemed about half a meter in diameter.   All the time I was on the phone with a friend telling her what was happening, eventually my fear and her concerns convinced  me to leave.

Above the town of Lafayette, ahead of me, I could see something rectangular in shape spiraling upward into the air, above what seemed to be the area just east of Highway 287 and the intersection of Baseline Rd.  The bright object was silvery and highly reflective.  It would disappear when the flat surfaces were not hit directly by the sunlight.  When the object changed position so that the flat surfaces reflected the sun, the object appeared to be rectangular in shape, with a tip pointing up into the sky.  The trajectory was in a slightly south and strongly easterly direction and about a 45 or 50 degree angle. About 20 or 30 seconds after the first object appeared and was ascending, a second one followed at the same angle.  Both objects shone in the sunlight, spiraling (not in unison) upward.  The second object almost caught up to the first object when suddenly, neither was visible any more.  I am uncertain if they entered the clouds or simply disappeared, but I did not see them any longer. There was a black helicopter flying northward to the west of Highway 287 when these objects were visible.  It seemed to be almost parallel to them, lower in altitude, when they were at their highest points. When I got to the vicinity of Arapahoe Rd., I stopped and got out of the car to go to a store.  This was just a few moments after seeing the objects.  I did not see any sign of the objects or hear aerobatic airplanes or jet sounds. I wondered if I had been seeing fighter jets take off from Metropolitan Airport, 5 miles or so beyond Lafayette.  I do not think this is the case, because the objects would have been much smaller at that distance, and I don’t think their shapes would have been discernible, though reflection off them probably would have been visible.

We were all sober and just hanging out and having a good time.   Around 2:30 or 2:40 in the morning we witnessed an orange light, shaped like a sphere, traveling across the sky, it stayed in one spot for about 5 seconds and then began to move, as it moved along the eastern horizon it gradually glowed brighter and brighter until it was very harsh to look at, this took around 10 seconds.  After the object grew as bright as it would go, it continued to travel along the eastern horizon and dimmed out over a span of about 5 seconds until it was gone.  The whole time it was moving, the object never moved faster than, what I could tell was, about 2mph.   After the object left we just stood there in awe and wondered to ourselves what we had just seen.

I was headed southwest on Route 3 and was a half mile south of the Rappahannock River bridge.  It travelled at right angles to the road I was on. I would estimate its height as between two of three tree lengths above ground.  It was a 5 ft diameter reddish orange sphere coming across my field of vision.  I wished there was a place to pull over and that there wasn't oncoming traffic.  It is a two lane 55 MPH road. As it got closer I could see sparks coming off of it.  It must have impacted within a minute but I didn't see any smoke from fires - it might have gone in the river.  Two unusual things (at least to me): it seemed to move slowly for a meteor and it didn't have a steep downwards trajectory as I might have expected.  It travelled mostly horizontally. Instead of steep, I would estimate the angle of decline as 10-20 degrees away from the horizontal.  It travelled more like an airplane slowly decreasing altitude for a landing.  It did have the appearance of a fireball - perfectly spherical. I was going to report it here but then opted for American Meteorological Society.

It was about 2 am my lights inside my mobile homed started to dim & to the point of such a low power state I could hardly see inside the home.  I went outside to see & check power pole & noticed street lights were at same power state, so low that they went off.   Living out in the woods where I lived there are several other homes & mobile homes on the street.  Normally a lot of dogs in the area always barking, with the woody area, & river close by, frogs and other noise makers as usuall.  Well this night was different, all went quite I mean nothing was making noise & if it was, it all stopped.  When I noticed a slight hum, a very weird hum, like a washing machine on spin dry but not that loud.   When I looked up I could see a dark object, triangle in shape, huge!  I would say football field lenght in size. No lights, no blinkin lights, nothing.  The only reason I saw it was because the moon was not quite halffull when it got blocked out of view & stars as well.  Moving slowly from east to west towards the perdido river.  My girlfriend, her brother & myself all seen this.  Not sure if anyone else in the area did.  I reported this to MUFON, I guess a week later.   Well a month went by when I took vacation from work & was barbequing on grill late afternoon I noticed the strangest damn thing.  All the tops of the trees, about the same width of the triangle thing we saw, had turned brownish & wilted, more wilted than brown, you could see the pine trees just looked sick like if u don't water a plant enuff or you water the leaves & put it in the hot sun & they wilt.  But it was fall so no way it was from weather.  2 days into my vacaction, 3 vehicles come cruising down the road which dead ends & we all know each other so veh not from residents, 1 humvee, & 2 chevy suv's all with white gov.  Plates.   They got out, took pics of trees, that I saw as well.. they where in the area for about 2 hours. I went up to the two that got out of the suv they were dressed in blue coveralls like flight suit lookin military clothin! g no nam es on clothes but patches on side on velcro lookin spot on upper arm what looked to be lighting bolts with I think a missile between the bolts, I think the numbers were 38th, at least that's what I think it was.  Anyway I asked them are they here because of the low flying craft 3 or 4 weeks ago?  They looked at each other & told me what craft, I went on explaining what I saw and what i thought caused the trees to welt.  They told me no that's not what caused it & it was a fuel release from an aircraft that had problems, which was a damn lie cause fuel would have been all over the trees falling from sky not a straight line.  I didn't argue with them of course & they asked me my name & address & who all was with me, & I'm like why would u guys want to know all this if it was a fuel release from airplane? They said In case of sickness or medical complications they told me.  But why didn't they ask rest of neighborhood? Some guy called me from MUFON about 6 months ago but not sure if he was who he said he was.. I never saw the military guys again, just 2 helicopters flying over area checking out the same area, I really wish I could have got a photo from the air to see the distance that this thing made because it was 3 streets in lenght from ground view and some.  maybe 1/2 mile of wilted tree tops 80 to 100 yards wide..it was crazy..  I mean craziest thing I have ever seen!

Our party of four had just finished watching the fireworks display in the southeast night sky over Long Beach, Ca from our backyard patio. A few minutes had passed when our attention was diverted to the southwest portion of the sky. Given that it was the Fourth of July, we merely thought it to be a floating lantern, or possibly a large flare someone shot up off the coast. It appeared to be rising from somewhere between the southwest tip of the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Catalina Island and we were able to calculate that it was rising over White’s Point, San Pedro - on the Pacific Coast (roughly lat:33°42'42.78""N, lon:118°19'7.09""W). Expecting it to explode like the fireworks cascading the night sky did throughout the day and night, we watched it intently with anticipation.  We believied it to be one final spectacular display since the major firework shows in the area had ended within the last hour. Yet,this object was moving at a steady pace - not as though it had been shot out of a cannon, and grew larger in size as it came into view. When said object did not explode and rather, ascended higher into the night sky -we realized that this was not a fireworks display. We also realized that this a! rea of the coast does not have a fireworks show. From our vantage in our backyard in San Pedro, the Palos Verdes Hill blocks any view of the firework displays in Redondo Beach and north through Manhattan Beach. When we first noticed the object it appeared as a perfect triangle. We referred to it as a “Golden Pyramid.” Its coloration was a mixture of gold, orange, red, yellow and appeared to be pulsating within itself - as if it were on fire. Said object rose into the night sky to a point where it was clearly too high for visibility. It ascended in a straight line for about 6 minutes, made an arc north for about 4 minutes, then continued to raise straight up into the night sky where it became a small pinprick of a light. It then appeared to shoot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  The reason we knew it not to be a firework was because the glowing and pulsating was contained within the shape of the triangle - there were no trails of sparks of flame leaving the triangle. For example, when one views images of the sun from space, it has flares shooting out from it’s surface. This object had the same appearance, but all was contained within the shape of the triangle. It also neve! r fell in altitude. If it were a balloon, flare, or firework - they would all pop and descend in an obvious manner. This object did not. Weather balloons also do not glow in the manner we witnessed. The four of us were flabbergasted and kept asking each other what we saw. Only a few minutes had passed when yet another object emerged in the same spot in the sky as  the previous object. It was larger than the first, but matched coloration and appearance. What solidified that the first object was not anything we have ever seen before, the second object followed the same exact course over the same exact amount of time, rising into the night sky until it was no longer visible. We attempted to film the object on our cell phones, but a combination of light pollution from the street light over our backyard and low resolution on our camera phones made it impossible. A few minutes after the second craft had disappeared into the black of night, a night flying Cessna airplane flew over roughly the same area the first UFO appeared.  We determined this was the altitude private planes must fly and that the first “Golden Pyramid”  appeared much higher in the sky.  A flare was shot off in the southeast corner of our visibility - toward Long Beach - and we concluded this object was nothing close to a flare.  These were two solid reference points for us to analyze what the situation was. Both of the crafts appeared, and rose into space.  Plain and simple. Maybe they were watching the fireworks as well!  There is no firework that could follow such behavior patterns, and there has not been any man made craft that the public has knowledge of that would accomplish such feats.  We researched rocket and missile launches in the area, and we came up empty handed for that date.  All we know is that we all saw the same thing and hope to find someone else who witnessed the same thing.  I write this review so late because I barely found this site today, but feel the need to share what the four of us saw in the night sky that evening.  There is not a single day that goes by where I forget about this experience and my life has completely changed since then.",2012-06-20T00:00:00,33.73561208791208,-118.29940934065934

We were roughly four miles from the US 6 Southwest Highway exit when I noticed a small, extremely bright silver and amber hued light flare violently in the southeastern sky.  After momentarily intensifying, it began to soundlessly plummet towards the earth at a 75-degree angle. The light, which at first resembled a pulsating silver and amber flame, was falling so rapidly I estimated it would collide with the terrain just a few hundred feet from our car in seconds.  Unconsciously bracing myself for impact, I was startled when it began to decelerate, releasing four amber-hued jets or streams of what appeared to be flaming gas as it declined to an altitude of 200 feet. After a moment of intense anxiety, I was able to discern that the light concealed a dark object, roughly disc-shaped and tilted at a 45-dgree angle so that the amber jets appeared to be issuing from its underside. As soon as I was able, I drew my spouse's attention to the disc and she began to reduce her speed to between 5-7 miles an hour.  The disc was roughly 200 feet from us at this time and we were gradually approaching it from the northeast. There was virtually no traffic on I-355 at that time and I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were alone, venerable and potentially in danger.  I felt the onset of panic but tried to remain calm. The amber jets issuing from the disc cut off abruptly and were replaced by a vaporous fog which enshrouded it as it as it hung suspended in midair roughly fifty feet from the ground. The disc had become a black silhouette which did not move or sway in the wind.  The fog quickly began to dissipate and the disc tilted from 45-degrees to 180-degrees and began to glide very slowly across the shoulder of the road and into the oncoming lane as if on an invisible track. As it approached it began to descend at a 45-degree angle, but did not change its axis.  The descent was surreally smooth.  The object did not waver or rock in the wind. I suddenly felt an intense, unaccountable feeling of calm come over me. When the disc neared the well-lit median, a small teal (the color is still difficult for me to describe - this is approximate) light or beacon slowly appeared under its outer lip or rim.  The process of illumination reminded me of the irregular flickering of a fluorescent bulb when first switched on. The light emanated from an object that superficially resembled an ornate cylinder lamp or lantern hanging from the underside of the disc's outer rim.  It also seemed as though portions of the disc had suddenly become internally illuminated by the same unusual teal light, giving the impression of an ornate inner framework and a large window-like area. As the object continued its descent it passed between two median streetlights and paused directly in front of our car.  We had slowed almost to a halt at this juncture and the object proceeded to slowly move directly in front of our vehicle.  I was now able to confirm with certainty that the object was disc shaped (although observing it from its side caused it to momentarily appear football-shaped).  It was roughly 30 feet in length and perhaps 9-12 feet in in height.  It emitted no sound whatsoever. Its surface was metallic and highly refractive like an intensely polished mirror.  Its undercarriage appeared to be corrugated in the light of the teal lamp. The object kept an even 30 foot distance from our car at all times, moving silently forward as we approached it while remaining directly in front of us at all times.  Again, it did not rock or sway in the wind. The disc remained in front of us in this manner for about 20-40 seconds, then slowly moved west to the shoulder of the road where it continued to follow us from an approximate 30 foot elevation and 30 foot distance for another 20-30 seconds.  It then proceeded into the darkness over an adjoining field.  As it moved out of the street lamp's illumination, the disc’s internal illumination dampened and gradually went out - leaving only the glowing of teal lamp to identify it. When it had passed completely into the darkness the disc became almost totally camouflaged, except for the teal light, which had become faint and ghostly.  My spouse and I strained to observe the object as it begin to climb in elevation and pass over the (then) unfinished structure of the Silver Cross Hospital near the US 6 Southwest highway exit. As we traveled towards our home, I was able to observe the object by following the small teal lamp.  I was also occasionally able to see the entire disc as the ambient light beneath it caused it to become visible.  The object remained visible in the night sky for a distance of about 5 miles and a span of about 5-6 minutes before it vanished moving towards the southwest.

I kept watching it, and I realized that it didn't have the same type of lights as an airplane does.  The lights were white, unlike airplane lights that are green, red, and white, and they were flashing in sequence. There was no noise such as you hear when a jet flies overhead.  The object was silent or nearly silent. The object appeared to be triangular, but it was very hard to tell, since it was dark outside at the time.  I didn’t see any real outline of the object, again probably because it was so dark.  It took a straight path over my head and over the restaurant. I took a video (I take my camera everywhere), but it was extremely difficult to keep the camera stable without a tripod.  I’m always aggravated with UFO videos that are taken by a camera operator with a shaky hand, but now I realize just how hard it is to keep a moving object in the shot while also trying to watch it yourself. I was very excited, because I'd never seen anything like this before.  Eventually the object just flew too far to keep track of.  I still don't know what it was, but I'd certainly like to.

While traveling by car East on the Parkway in Utica, NY my wife and I observed  three orange round lights that looked like they were moving in a Northeasterly direction.  I pulled the car over on Pleasant Street and both of us got out to observe them more. The lights looked to be the size of soccer or smaller basketballs from where we were standing.  They were traveling in a straight line, one behind the other left to right.  There was absolutely no sound at all from them that we could hear. The first one separated from the other two and the light slowly dimmed from view.  The remaining two continued going in a Northeasterly direction. Then the first one (if it was the first one or perhaps another one) came back around (we did not witness it coming back around as we were in the process of getting out of the car; it was just there again)and continued to follow the other two in the same direction.  We watched until the lights on all three slowly dimmed and then all three disappeared.  The duration of this was probably 2-4 minutes. We called the FAA Flight Service Station (my wife went on line to try to see who we should call when we got home to report what we saw) and spoke to a gentleman who assisted us. He was going to report this sighting to his superiors and gave us the wind velocity information we understood that you may want.  He also gave us the number to report our UFO sighting.

Several witnesses, 3 more lappea What I first thought I saw was some kind of firework that was floating across the sky.  It was followed by 4 others and they had the exact same path which would have made it impossible to be a firework of some kind.  It appeared to be no further that 10 - 15 houses away from me.   I very clearly saw what I saw.  They appeared to be upright cylinders 2-3 long, bright orange' almost as if on fire. Each one that followed the other was equal distant from each other, and traveled the same path.  It was quiet out except for the sounds of a raccoon in the woods.  If these were a man made object, I would have heard a propeller, or propellant of some sort.  Nothing, I heard nothing.   I tried to take pictures with my iPhone, but even at that close distance is was too much for the IPhone to handle.  I did get pictures of it, but they look like dots.   After the 5 had come towards my house and then moved over the mountain, I stood outside completely dumbfounded by what I! had just witnessed.   I was expecting other people in the neighborhood to be coming out of their houses as excited as I was.  No one.  Unbelievable.  I guess from my perspective I could see them, but if they were directly over your house, you wouldn't.  I waited and hopefully watched for about another 5 minutes, and 2 more appeared from the same area, taking about the same path as the others.  I called into my house and three others came out to see the tail end of then second of the two that had just come.  No explanations, nothing.  I again listened very closely for the sounds of a propeller, or propellant, nothing.  There were no sounds of overhead airplanes or helicopters.  Nothing else but sounds of the night.   We all waited around for another minute os so. And nothing else.  My wife had been upstairs sleeping with our granddaughter, and I was hesitant to call her In the beginning, for fear of waking my granddaughter.  After the 6th and 7th appeared and departed as the ! first 5, I continued to wait for more.  I went back into the ho! use and quietly told my wife what I had just seen.  She had wondered where I had been all of this time.  She was asking, what was it.  I had no idea.  I went back outside, hoping for one more sighting , and Wow, an 8th was appearing.  I went into the house a yelled up to my wife, ""there's another, come down"".  She did, as well as the other 3 witnesses that I called earlier.  Everybody else saw the tail end of the 8th unknown object.  This ones path was a little further away but in the same area, and took a similar path up towards the mountain.  Wow, exciting, but puzzling.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,41.53889934640523,-72.79349084967322

FINALLY!  That is what I said when I concluded that it was not just another piece of space debris or satellite. I was on the balcony, doing my usual observation of the night sky, as it was a clear beautiful night. The moon was high and bright, and there were fireworks going off at multiple points in the horizon, as people were already beginning to celebrate Canada day. During my scan of the night sky, I happened to notice what appeared to be a bright star, that I could have sworn was not there just a few seconds ago.  As I observed, it gradual became bigger and brighter. It then began to lose its luminosity, as it was moving north.  I was thinking it was a piece of space debris, as satellites have the same glow as they travel across the night sky, in a dead straight line, at a constant speed.  It soon came clear to me that it in fact was not a piece of space debris, as the object came to a stop, and headed back south. After all these years of soar necks, and countless time spent scouring the night sky for any form of activity, other than planes and satellites, it finally happened-  I was observing an unidentified flying object in space.  I finally was observing a UFO! In my immediate excitement, I called my wife to come out to the balcony and see what I was seeing. By the time she came out, it was gradually fading out as it moved further south.  We were both observing it until it had completely faded out of sight.  I knew it was not because of any clouds, as the immediate surrounding stars were clearly visible. About 1 to 2 minutes later, I finally saw the object travelling northbound again.  It maintained its level of luminosity, and rather than travelling on a straight path, was what I can best describe as swerving erratically left to right.  I followed it until it was no longer visible from my viewpoint. I am indeed very excited to have experienced my first UFO sighting. I hope my wife and me were not the only ones to have seen it.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,43.513051704545454,-79.88477670454546
