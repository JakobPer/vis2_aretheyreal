"Object was very large, very high, and very fast.",Kenmore,WA,2004-07-06T03:30:00,triangle,4 minutes,"Occurred : 7/6/2004 03:30  (Entered as : 07/06/2004 03:30) Reported: 7/18/2004 12:24:44 AM 00:24 Posted: 7/25/2004 Location: Kenmore, WA Shape: Triangle Duration:4 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38185.html,"Object was very large, very high, and very fast. I believed, initially, that it was one craft but at the end it may have actually been 3. On that particular night I had stayed up to see the ISS passover, it was due at 4:30 AM, and when I went out at 3:29 AM to have a cigarette, I was looking in the sky in the direction the ISS would be coming from, SSW and almost immediately saw 3 white lights in a triangular shape moving from that direction towards me. I looked inside at the clock, because I thought maybe I was mistaken as to the time, and saw that it was 3:30 AM. I came back to the railing and watched the 3 lights. 2 of the lights were on what I presumed was the front with one light trailing behind but centered on the other 2. There appeared to be about a 1/2 degree separation between the 2 lead lights and the other trailed about 1 to 1 1/2 degrees behind. The object appeared to be moving across the sky at about the same rate that the ISS appears to be moving whenever I see it. As I continued to watch it, I realized that it would be passing directly over my head. I noticed that any stars which it seemed to pass in front of would disappear until after it had passed that position in the sky. After a couple of minutes I further realized that the object was not getting any larger, as a plane would if it were approaching, which meant that it had to be extremely high for that to happen. I watch planes on a regular basis and even when they are flying at 20,000 to 30,000 feet I can still notice a change in size as they come closer. Therefore, whatever this was it had to be very, very large. I never heard any sound or saw any other lights on or around it. Just before it got over my head, one of the lead lights suddenly started pulling away from the other 2 at a tremendous rate which made me think that maybe this was not one craft but three. However, I remembered from earlier when it had passed in front of the stars that it had seemed to be solid. Now, suddenly, one of the lights was pulling away very quickly. At this point I had to question w! hether it was 1, 2 or 3 objects I was actually seeing and, if it was more than one object, then why did the stars get blotted out ""behind"" it. As it disappeared, I live on the second floor of a 3 story condo building, pass the edge of the roof, the light which had begun pulling away from the other 2 now had about a full degree of seperation from the light which it had earlier had only about a 1/2 degree of seperation from earlier, and the other lead light and trailing light had not changed position relative to one another. Since then I have been puzzling out in my mind how it could have blotted out the stars if it were actually 3 objects instead of one. My conclusion is that it must have been one object, but somehow maybe launched something that was at that one point, that it was extremely high flying (possibly suborbital or even in orbit), was travelling extremely fast for the altitude and was very large because if it was at an altitude of 100 miles up in orbit, it would have had to be miles long. I can hear jets fly over at altitudes up to about 40,000 feet so since I could not hear it it had to be at least that high, and at even 50,000 feet, given it's apparent size, it would have been thousands of feet long to take up that big a slice of sky.

It had the same deliberate and steady motion. I was able to follow it to within a few degrees above the NE horizon. As it receded, it not only became smaller but also decidedly more orange. Since it still had considerable angular speed when it approached the horizon, it convinced me that it was following the earth in a circular orbit. Based on these observations, I would have to conclude that I had seen an unknown satellite. What puzzles me though is the fact that about 1.5 hours after sunset, it should have blinked out at an elevation of about 22.5 degress as it entered the Earth's shadow.

It was a beautiful clear early fall sunday, not a cloud in the light blue sky. My mother, her boyfriend and myself were sitting in the meadow of prospect park. My mom's boyfriend looked into the sky and pointed out what would have looked like a constellation of stars in a night sky. Six ""stars"" total, all equidistant from each other in a V-shape. We stared and stared and watched as they remained perfectly equidistant and seemed to float ever higher in the sky for at least 35 minutes. They were much higher than any other aircraft and eventually they disappeared from our field of view. We thought the show was over and we returned to our conversation eagerly trying to discern what we had just saw when to the Northeast two UFO's appeared this time much lower in the sky. They were visibly silver to the naked eye and appeared oval. Again these two objects remained perfectly equidistant and floated ever higher in the sky until they also disappeared from view. After the two objects were gone from view, my mother & her boyfriend decided to head home to their apartment rooftop to see if they could view anything else. I stayed behind, and about ten minutes after they left a silver object shot across the length of the sky. It moved quickly, seemingly lower than a comercial plane and totally silent unlike a helicopter. It moved west to east across the sky (airplanes over the park all fly south to north). It's movement seemed much more fluid than an airplane, I orginally thought it looked like a giant silver bird flapping it's wings. I tried to dismiss the sighting thinking my eyes were just playing tricks on me, when a second object of equal size & color followed along the exact same course! This one, however, changed course about a third of way. It turned sideways and reversed course quickly out of my field of view. When it turned it appeared to have ""wings"" that were shaped like shark fins but it was hard to tell if these were multi-dementional or flat. After that I finally went home, eager to see if any other sightings had been reported on the news. I saw no other mention of this sighting which I find odd given the amount of people in the park that afternoon and the length of the events. My family and I have never seen anything like this before and my mother's boyfreind who initially pointed out the objects is a very skepticle person, yet we all agree we saw something that afternoon that cannot be explained by today's known science & technology.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The second time I saw the same exact thing was when I was exiting from the Irvine Spectrum Mall in Orange County, CA, an hour South of LAX, and again in the corner of my eye going West was what I thought was another beautiful long-tailed meteor.  But when I looked directly at it, I saw a few seconds of it clearly and I exclaimed to myself out loud ""ANOTHER green fireball thing!!!!""  There it was in all it's neon green, long green-tailed glory.  WHAT ARE THESE THINGS?  Nobody else I tell has ever seen one and I don't want to start sounding like a crazy person. The date of this was a couple years ago or so. I have a serious ""date memory defecit"" and my sense of time is completely bad unless i have some date or event to relate it to. I'm sorry I can't be more specific as I truly wish somebody can tell me what these things are so I can have an explanation. ((ADDENDUM BY SAME ANONYMOUS WITNESS)) I just wrote about the 2 sightings of the green meteor-type things with the long green tails and I wanted to add something else. They were low in altitude (definitely lower than any plane would fly) and they were flying straight across in a slight arch. The ball in front was a definite sphere shape and the tail was very green like the ball. Both times they just disappeared. Not sure if a fizzle-out would look the same as it just disappearing, either way it died within eyesight. Also, the first sighting the green sphere w/ tail was heading away from LAX which making it North or North/East in direction if that means anything as the second sighting was also East with a slight North direction. The first sighting was very close to the ocean (just blocks away) and the second was a few miles from the shoreline. Again, not sure if this is significant. But the stand-out characteristics both times was the low altitude, the large sphere that was clearly a round sphere in front, the neon green tint to both the spheres and the long tails behind them. Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM))",,33.9454,-118.4398

I'm telling it now because I was afraid to say anything back then because people would have thought we were crazy.  It all happened so fast that it was totally startling, to say the least.   We were outside playing in the street in our neighborhood subdivision as most young kids do when we began to hear a loud sound approaching us.  The sound was coming straight for us.  All of us stopped playing and just looked around but did not see anything like an airplane or helicopter etc.  The sound was getting extremely loud by now after only a few seconds.   All of a sudden a very powerful bright light descended down straight upon us from somewhere and practically paralyzed and engulfed us.  Then, before we knew it, the strange sound was directly overhead of us also, and was still producing an extremely bright light.  This sound stayed over us too for four minutes or longer.  The light was so bright that my cousins and I could not see each other for four minutes or so as this thing hovered and flew directly over us.   We began to shout to try to find each other in the blinding light and noise but couldn't.  Everyone was totally blinded by this light.  The roaring and swishing sound was so loud that it too was startling, so we all blocked our eardrums.  But the noise was still extremely loud and mind-bogling.  Needless to say, we were all extremely frightened and screeming for help.  Whatever that thing was that flew over us that day had to have been really huge and fast because of the noise it produced.  The noise was loud and screeching, and like nothing I have ever heard before.  It was a strange feeling.  I realize that this story is indeed strange, but it really happened.   After whatever it was had left, we just stood and stared at each other in amazement and tried to gather our senses.  It was no airplane or helicopter because of the hovering and blinding light.  Whatever ! we observed was indeed strange.   Thanks for hearing my TRUE strange story! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) ADDITION FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION FOR JUNE 1, 1965  BLIDING LIGHT HOVERING ABOVE US   This is a follow-up report on me and my three cousin's frightening and true ufo encounter on June 1, 1965 while living in the White Plains-Scottsville, Kentucky area as a young kid.  We still talk about this case among ourselves quite often, and have shockingly discovered some addition information we know is related to this UFO encounter.  It is unbelievable to say the least.   My only hope is that people will believe what I am about to tell you.  I am no liar or scam artist.  As earlier reported, the huge UFO hovered straight above our heads, and we were blinded by the bright yellow light which was shining down upon us.   We tried to look up but the light was blinding us, and the noise was deafning as well.  The large object made a hissing-swishing sound with a very loud roar to it.   Now, the new information I am disclosing to you is mysterious, and we are left to wonder what happened to us, and why.   We all now believe we were indeed abducted by the UFO, and! lost track of our time.  We also have the ""Evidence"" to prove it.   A few short weeks or so after the UFO encounter we were all in our White Plains Elementary School one day having our classes as usual.   All of a sudden the principal sent out a loud message over the intercom telling us that ""all"" of us kids in the entire school (close to where the UFO-abduction took place) were going to be inoculated for some flu disease or something etc.  It was in the summetime?   We were to go class after class until everybody was done inthe entire school.   When my class time came my cousin R. was with me and we both went to the front of the school with our other clasmates in the middle isle, stood in line, and waited our turn.   The funny thing was that the doctors, or whoever they really were, hid their faces behind white masks and wore white uniforms and gloves.  I proceeded up to receive my shot and then it got really strange.  A person took out a large machine, like a huge staple gun, held it to my & ""forehead"" between my eyes and stamped me and said it was done.  It was a ""diamond"" imprint placed right between my eyes, and I still have the strange diamond imprint to this very day.  My cousin R. got a circle imprint placed between her eyes on her forehead just like I did, and hers is still there today too.  Why were we not given shots in the arm or buttocks like normal?    When I got home and told my father what had happened he said, ""What do you mean you got a mark put on your forehead"";  I showed the diamond mark to him and he got very upset and angry.  Then after he contacted the school the next day he never mentioned it again, and I found this strange as well.  I told my current physician a couple of years ago about the incident, and she told me that shots were ""never"" given in the forehead, and when I showed it to her she was dumbfounded.  We all cannot find any information on getting shots in the forehead anywhere.  Why were we marked?  Why the diamond-circle s! hapes?  We do strongly now feel that these unusual shots-markings had something sinister to do with our neightborhood UFO encounter.  This additional material is ""ABSOLUTELY TRUE.""   As stated earlier, we have the proof to prove it, especially R. and I.  I look at my mark today on my forehead &lt;&gt; turned the other way, and it baffles and concerns me.  Today at times I know I am beng watched, and have heard radio chatter outside my bedroom at night.  I hear strange ""clicks"" in my house occasionally too.  Sometimes I even fear for my safety because ""they"" know that I know the truth about UFOs and Extraterrestrials.  They are indeed real.  Who are we?  Why were we marked?  Lastly, what does these strange symbols on our foreheads mean for our future?  Are we being monitored for some strange reason or another?  I must remain ananymous about my identity because I feel I might be in danger.  My cousin R. feels the same way.  My story is true, and a! s a Christian I take my honesty and integrity very seriously. ! I now w ork handling U.S. Government material, and trust me; The UFOs Are Real, and I have the material to prove it.""

We were aboard a US Navy destroyer in the India Ocean. It was a warm, clear, moonless night, with a few clouds on the horizon opposite our direction of movement. We were steaming at a steady rate of approximately 5-7 knots; seas were calm, visibility approximately 12-15 nautical miles.  A group of us was standing on the ""flight deck"" just forward of the fantail. Although it was quite dark, our eyes had become accustomed to the night from the light of the stars. We were facing aft, watching the wake of the ship slip toward the horizon, making small talk, when suddenly, out of nowhere, a very bright light appeared just above the wake, and looked to be approximately half-way between the ship and the horizon. There were clouds on that horizon so we knew it was between the clouds and the ship, but we couldn’t determine much more about it.  Because of the conditions, it was virtually impossible to tell how big it was or how far away it was. (If I had to make a guess as to its size, maybe a pea held at arm’s length.) We couldn't discern any shape due to its brightness. It was brighter than Venus ever appears, almost brilliant but not blinding, and at first it seemed to be stationary. It was silent, as far as we could tell. But as we watched, it began to move slowly across the ship's wake from our right to our left. When it had crossed the wake, it stopped and then proceeded to move back the other way, from our left to our right. It did this a few times and, during this time, we were shouting to each other the excitement we felt as we were trying to analyze this object and its movements. ""Was it moving closer to us as it traversed the ship's wake?"" ""Was it a solid object or just a ball of light?"" ""Where did it come from?"" ""How did it get to where it first appeared without anyone seeing it?"" ""Did the ship's RADAR pick it up?""  We watched in amazement for about three or four minutes, no longer. Abruptly, it stopped its movement altogether and appeared to just ""hover"" in place. Then, without warning or any change in its appearance (or sound) it shot directly straight up into the sky and within four or five seconds had apparently traveled out of sight, or it had dimmed out. But the general consensus at that time was that it appeared to diminish in brightness because it had traveled far enough away that it simply got too far for us to continue to observe it.  The following day we asked some of the guys in the RADAR room and they all said nothing peculiar was picked up on RADAR that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-07-08T00:00:00,,

My particular sighting occured outside of Scottsville, Kentucky during the fishing season in the spring of 1976.  This is the closest to the exact date as I can remember.  I am a Christian and I do have an open mind about many things.  But I still haven't figured out exactly what me and a friend of mine saw that one particular night back in 1976.  We had been on a fishing trip to the Barren River Lake area, and was returning home late one night-around 1:00 AM if I remember correctly.  Anyway, as we were driving back home to the Scottsville area we had to pass by an old abandoned oil well in a wooded area.  We had taken this route many times before.  As we were driving along we spotted something very odd sitting beside the abandoned oil well in the woods and it was very bright.  We decided to stop the pickup truck and get a closer look.  When we stopped we saw a solid mass of bright red light in the woods beside the well.  The light was perfectly round and circular in appearance and sitting on the ground.  It was as big as our pickup truck we were riding in, and just sitting there in the woods glowing.  There was no noise at all to be heard, and we had both never seen anything like this thing before.  The light was bright red, and it did appear as though it was a part of something of a solid mass-an object of some sorts.  Why it was near an oil well I do not know.  I must say that the night was really dark, and there was practically no moon shining at all.  Although I do realize that there might be a practical explanation as to what we observed that night, I cannot think of what it might be.  Believe me, we were not out UFO hunting or anything like that-it just happened.  We both know what we saw.  The Scottsville-Franklin, Kentucky areas has had many strange sightings over the years like this and it makes one wonder!  Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There we would observe several balls of fire streaking across the sky. Sometimes the lights would follow one another, they would combine to make one seemingly larger object, the lights would sometimes seem to hover and then take off into many different directions. The lights were not bound to any certain direction or mode of flight. They would move across the sky in a vertical, horizontal and diagonal direction. The objects were bright orange resembling a fire ball and that is what we called them. The light show usually lasted for approximately 30 to 90 minutes.

On October 7, 1979, 4 of us had a UFO encounter with a saucer shaped craft.  I was 7 years old, my brother was 6 and my baby brother was 9 months old. My 14 year old cousin was babysitting us while my mother was out for the evening.  We lived off the lake in Wabasca, AB, Canada.  It was dark outside and I recall seeing many colorful lights hitting the inside of the trailer walls. I found that quite odd because from the direction of the lights, there was no street lights--just the lake and part of my grandmother's property.  This was a very secluded town, no street lights or airport.  I remember walking over to the window, at the same time I can hear a strange high/low noise.  It was getting louder and louder.  As I looked outside I couldn't see the stars. I saw a huge black circular craft hovering right above us, approximately 30 feet off the ground--tree top level.  The size of the craft covered my granmother's house and our trailer--and most of her land. As I looked up and saw the underside of the craft, I recall it being black on the under side--and the colors shining outward were coming from the edges of the craft.  My cousin screamed.  We all panicked and screamed and cried.  I recall the intense noise, it was ear piercing..nothing I did would block the sound that was hurting my ears.  My brother recalls vividly the trailer shaking violently.  He said that this is what scared him the most.  He recalls things falling off the table and shelves.  I recall my cousin running back and forth, and hearing my baby brother crying hard in his walker. I tried to block the sound with a pillow from the couch.  The next thing I recall is my cousin screaming for my brother.  I looked around for him and he was gone.  The trailer door was open.  I looked outside again and saw him standing right under it--in between my grandmother's home and our trailer.  He looked frozen.  My cousin was screaming his name--he didn't hear her.  The next thing I remember is sitting on the couch looking out the window--! this time the craft was hoving above the lake about 100 feet in front of my grandmothers property.  I can see it clearly.  It was saucer shaped with a belt of colored lights/rays circling the mid-section of the craft.  The lights were a rectangular shape and they circled in a slow/fast motion.  At the same time there were 3 white beams shining from the underside of the craft.  (at the age of 7 I thought it was landing on the lake). Moments later, my mother walked in.  I thought she saw the UFO and came home early--it was too early for her to be home, but it was the scheduled time she was to be home--approx. 10:30.  (I remember being confused because I thought time had sped up---for many years I thought this, until I learned about missing time.)  My cousin was curled up in a ball at the corner of the trailer and my mom was angry and said 'whats going on here?  Why is your baby brother crying so hard?'.  She picked him up to console him, but as his scared cries started to slow down, he started to gasp for breathe.  My mom said 'whats wrong?, whats going on here?'  We were all still crying and my baby brother's eyes rolled up and he had a major convultion.  He shook violently and his eyes were white, and we all screamed again.  We scared my mom and she kept calling out my baby brother's name.  Then he stopped breathing.  My mom cryed and I covered my head with my pillow.  She tried CPR and nothing happened and then my grandmother came over and she couldn't do anything. We all ran to my grandmother's house and they layed my baby brother on the kitchen table.  My aunt entered the room and she managed to revive him, but, she said that she first had to scoop out a thick white foam from his mouth.  Being a nurse, she said 'it wasn't the usual or typical foam that people have when they have convultions or seizures."". After nearly 5 minutes he was fine.  However he did suffer some minor brain damage due to the lack of oxygen to his brain. That night, he was admitted to the Slave Lake Hospital and the admission date was Oct. 7, 1979.  The explaination the doctor gave to my aunt was 'maybe he had a bad reaction to asprin'.  Yet he was not sick and didn't have asprin that night. My cousin has no memory of the encounter, but remembers vividly the events of my brother's near death.  My brother recalls a few chopped things. After doing interviews with people from the area, I found out that there were over 50 people who witnessed this event--and the hundreds of other sightings and ufo landing spots. The RCMP were called out to my grandma's house and a train of vehicles followed. I tried to contact the RCMP and get information about this but no one responded to my call and email request. In the interviews I found there are hundreds of unreported sightings, experiences with other paranormal events (related and unrelated to UFO's and abductions), ufo landing spots. In fact, when I was 9 or 10 years old I remember walking through a field of high grass close the the edge of the lake.  I remember coming to a clearing of burned grass--in a perfect circle.  I remember saying 'wow, who did this? how did they burn it in a perfect circle?'  I was told that a UFO landed there as well as dozens of other spots in the community--one being my great aunt's property.  A year later, I walked over the same spot and found the large dead area.  Nothing grew in that spot again. It was a dead area.  The other landing spots had the same dead spot.  There are still some of these landing spots today.",2004-07-08T00:00:00,,

Slightly before 9:15, I stepped out into the back yard of our house.  Looking at the clear night sky, I noticed a bright flashing light low in the western sky; given the date, I was more attentive than usual.  Since we see a lot of air traffic out of Mercer County Airport (not far to our west) and elsewhere in the NY-PA area, I first assumed it was a plane, but glancing back once or twice I noticed that it didn't appear to be moving.  I guessed it was a trick of perspective, but after five or ten minutes I felt something must be amiss, so I went to grab my only -- and unfortunately low-resolution -- pair of binoculars.  It was larger than a star and flashed much more rapidly, again, like an airplane, and in multiple colors as well.  All that I was able to make out was a stationary object emitting a bright white light accompanied by intermittent red and blue flashes.  My wife confirmed this sighting and feels as clueless about it as I.  I checked on its status repeatedly, and the object continued to hover for well over an hour, although the last few times I checked it appeared to have lowered imperceptibly toward the western horizon until, between 10:30 and 10:45, it had sunk out of my viewing area behind trees and houses.  There was frequent air traffic in the area, and a few planes even seemed to pass close by the object without any change of course.  My eye isn't well-trained enough to get any sense of how far away the object may have been; west of here is, again, the airport, and not far beyond that the Delaware River and Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  Honestly, I don't know a thing about UFOs, but typing the search terms ""red blue flashing object"" into Google turned up a multitude of sightings, which is why I decided to submit this report.  If anyone else in the area saw this bizarre object, I'd love to hear about it.  Many thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have observed the quite bright star in the western sky.

At 2:55AM on Sunday Morning September 12 I was on the my computer listening to late night talk shows.  My 2 dogs started to scratch at the door rather aggressively, which is unlike them (Lhasa Apso is a small, long-haired dog).  I assumed they wanted to go outside to the bathroom. So I gathered their leashes, and walked them outside of my condo.  As the dogs did their business I stood by the side of the entrance way to my condo, I scanned the sky as I always do every chance I get.  I have seen several UFOs since November 18, 2001.  I have seen Boomerangs, Flying Triangles, and Orbs.  They seem to fly by every November during the Leonid Meteor Showers, and if you want to check for your self, just do an Internet Search for the phrase: Leonid Meteor Showers Boomerang UFOS .  I was conciously thinking about the fact that I do not have my video camera with me, and what I would do if a UFO appeared in the sky. Just as I completed my thought a LARGE Triangle swooshed from behind the Condo and sort of stopped mid air as it was traveeling North.  I have seen Triangles before, but this one appeared to ""Fall out of the Sky"" as if I was seeing a Triangle Constellation of Stars just fall from the sky and sort of ""Bounce"" in mid air.  This Triangle pulsated and changed size aproximately 3 times..... It pulsated and got bigger, and then bigger, and then back to it's ""Original"" size......  and then each ""point of light"" seperated from the Triangle Formation and became indpendent lights in the sky.  At this point the almost looked like they could be 3 Big Birds or something in the sky playing tricks/dancing... and then Swooooosh..... off they went.... Heading North till they were out of sight, and just disappeared.  It wasn't so much the sighting of this event that is worthy of note.  I seem to live in a major hotspot in direct path to the Stanford University Sattellite Dish.  I am about 10 Miles north of Moffett Field (NASA/USAF BASE).  What made this sighting unique (to me) was the surreal feeling of observing it.  I have been having lots of dreams of UFOs lately and look for them whenever I venture outside at night.  To be thinking about a UFO and then see it swoosh over you is a very un-real feeling dream like feeling.  Especially since I have seen them several times before, and have been having surreal/lucid dreams of ""flying triangles"".  I know what I know, and if you take the time to research the phenomena of these ""Boomerang"" and Triangle Craft appearing during the Leonid Meteor Showers you will to.  I have this overwhelming urge to encourage people to look up in the sky during this years Leonid Meteor Showers if they want to see that UFOs are real.  This sighting lasted no more than 10 seconds.  As the disappeared from my site, I ran inside to get me wife, (who has witnessed several sightings of Boomerangs, and Triangles with me Since November 18, 2001).  We both are having recurring dreams of Triangle Crafts, and other anomalies.  My wife came outside for a few minutes to see if the craft would re-appear, but no such luck.  She went back inside, I stayed outside for another 30 minutes or so. I did observe 2 ""Shooting Stars"" , and what appeared to be strange looking clouds and/or chemtrails in the sky where I saw the Triangle Craft.  However, I cant be sure they were Chemtrails or just partly cloudy.  It is a clear and beautiful night tonight.

I was outside my apartment toward the parking lot smoking a cigarette with my husband.  My 2 children (9 & 1) were there as well.  Over the neighboring apartment complex I saw what I at first thought was a very bright star.  I noticed that it was slowly moving so my next inclination was to think that it was a plane as we live only a few miles froma small airport.  But it was moving much too slowly to be a plane so close to us.  I called my husband's attention to it.  It would stop moving then move a little and so on.  Then it SHOT off....gone just like that.  It was gone so quickly that I thought it had to have been covered up by a fast moving cloud.  But I looked around at the sky and there were no clouds.  It was weird.

Hey, my name is ((deleted)), I live in North Providence, RI USA.  I was travelling home with three of my friends who all like in the same town.  Were coming from another friend's house in Coventry, RI.  We were travelling in two cars, I was in the passenger seat of my friend Joe's '85 Firebird.  My friends John and Domenic were right behind us in Domenic's '72 Nova (so no slouch cars, they come up later).  We merged onto Route 95 North from exit 6 in Rhode Island.  We travelled about a mile and a half when I saw to the East Southeast something flying North and the exact same speed as we were travelling.  The craft was just above the tree line, it had sort of a bulky saucer shape and it had six yellow lights that were extremely dim and barely visible.  It looked very large, but I couldn't tell how far it was from us yet.  We called our friends travelling next to us in the lane to our left.  We coordinated between the two cars (using cellphones) to slow down and speed up together, and the craft sped up and slowed down with us with virtually no delay, it was moving with us.  I knew there was no was this was a plane, there was no sound, it was flying too low, even though we were only several miles from the state airport in Warwick.  So we continued travelling North, and we coordinated a maneuver to see how the craft would react.  When the highway split to 295 North and 95 North, Domenic and John in the Nova swerved behind us and sped up 95 while Joe and I in the Firebird sped up Route 295, as soon as Domenic and John were just out of our sight in the other car, the craft took a 90 Degree turn towards the East and shot so fast out of sight that if you blinked you would have missed it.  This thing took off faster than the supersonic jets at the air show, I've never seen any plane do anything like this before, it was amazing.  It was at that last moment that I finally got an idea how far away it was because the tree line had started to clear and a hotel that I know was about 1/2-3/4 miles away was i! n the foreground just before the craft shot out of sight.  So most likely it was no more than a mile away.  It seemed to be moving up a little bit as it took off, but it happened so quickly I really could not tell.  The most amazing part of the whole encounter was that the craft made no noise and it changed speeds as we did with no delays or jerky movements, it was all very fluid in terms of movement.  I really wish I had a camera because I got some great looks at this thing, it was a clear night, relatively quiet and the moon was fairly bright.  I might be off on the date, I don't remember the exact date. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-04-27T00:00:00,,

Received: April 9, 2004. It was about midnight that I went outside for a smoke, and right outside my door and above me, (I am about 15 km due North of Vernon) looked like a giant spotlight in the sky, with no source and no obvious end.  It seemed to skirt the horizon above me, but also seemed to hang low...however, it was hard to distinguish the distance/height of it, it was just so big. I kind of shook my head and squinted my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things, because it was completely out of place/abnormal. I thought at first it was a cloud, illuminated by the moon, but there was no moon visible, and it was not a typical, random cloud-shape. My second thought was northern lights, but it clearly wasn't them, either, as it did not move, change shape, or have any colour to it, aside from a while glow, which seemed to actually give off a good amount of light, similar to a full moon. It was shaped like a tube, perfectly smooth and round with well defined edges, but no real substance (I briefly wondered if it was some sort of UFO, but the lack of substance to it convinced me it was not). I hope this helps, I can't think of anything more to add, but will update you if I do. Keep up the good work!  My many thanks to the witness for their report.

The sky was clear with no clouds on the background.   The color of the object was crystalline with definite structure lines that seemed to be silver.   It was close enough to tell that it was not a weather balloon or something like that.   It was clearly rigid with a defined structure and did not waver back and forth like a balloon would.   The object seemed to float steadily and then descended to the ground after several seconds but did not descend all the way to the surface.   Rather, it seemed to lower itself below the tree line so that we could not view it anymore. My friend and I were utterly mystified at to what this object was yet we did not feel threatened at any time.

I was out surfing and it was a weekend day. Often airplanes will fly fairly low over the surfers just to check us out on the weekends.  I was at a surf spot called ""sharks"" which is near the ""Hook"" a surf spot that is directly at the end of 41st avenue which runs from Highway 1 to the cliffs at the Pacific.  We were sitting there and we looked up because there was a twin engine conventional aircraft approaching at about 1,000 feet and below it and moving much slower was a triangular craft small at about 500 feet and approximately the size of a hang-glider except that it had firm trailing edges and there was no bow in the wing as there is in hang-gliders.  Additionally this craft was completely silent and about 2-3 feet thick. It looked too thin to have held a human and there was no landing gear. This craft had 2 props located approximately 3 feet from the left and right tips of the triangle. It was white with no other markings.  It flew directly overhead and the continued to go at the same altitude directly over the land. At this point the twin engine conventional craft banked off to its left to avoid going over the land at a low altitude. Before and after the conventional craft came and went the triangle traveled at about 30 miles per hour and was completely quiet.  One surfer said to me ""what the hell was that?"" I replied that it looked like and unmanned aerial vehicle.  The other two surfers said nothing.  Most of the time us surfers prefer not to talk to each other at all.  It is not like a friendly atmosphere with other surfers as we are basically competing for the best waves and there is more hostility out there than friendliness if any conversation at all. A few days later I called the nearest airport which I believe was in Monterey and I spoke with an air traffic controller.  I questioned him about the legal altitudes for aircraft over water and I believe he said that it is 100 ft. over the water and 300 ft. over the land but I am not sure of those numbers.  The reason I asked this question is because of the fact that the twin engine banked off when the craft went inland.  It looked to me that the twin engine had seen the craft and was buzzing it from above to see what it was.  The air traffic controller said that he had not recieved any other reports but asked me to report to him if I saw it again.  As an important side note; my brother-in-laws father worked at Lockheed Missiles and space in Silicon Valley and also in L.a.  In L.A. he worked at the skunkworks as a purchasing agent and he was buying wooden hand made props for  unmanned aerial vehicles that he said were powered by chainsaw engines that had exhaust systems installed to make them perfectly quiet.  He said they used wood props because they were only 2 feet long and made by some obscure small time person who could shape them the way they needed to be effective and also quiet.  The craft I saw looked too thin to hold a human although if the human was lying down in the prone position perhaps he could fit inside.  What amazes me is that the military would fly such a craft over heavily populated areas on a weekend in Monterey Bay and over land too. It was interesting but looked very much man-made.-((name deleted))",2004-12-14T00:00:00,36.9752,-121.9533

Her amazing story never changed every time she told people about it either.  My Grandmother back then was still in good mind too, and was very good in details.  She had just gotten out of the hospital several weeks before from having had heart surgery, and was trying to sleep that dark night back in 2002.  As Grandma tells it, late that particular night she got up out of bed to get her a glass of water in the kitchen when she noticed something strange directly outside of her house low up in the sky.  Something seemed to be glowing outside directly above the treetops in her front yard.  When she looked outside the side living room window into the treetops she saw what appeared to be a cluster of glowing lights of some sort.  She said that they were moving around in every direction, were several different colors, and that there were many of them too.  They all glowed tremendously bright.  We both later agreed that they all could have been part of a very large object that was hovering directly over her house.  She did tell us that that she never heard any type of noise at all during this sighting, and that she did watch these mysterious objects (lights) for over an hour moving around in the same location.  My Grandmother back earlier in her life had a somewhat similar experience she always told us about too.  Back in 1962 or so she had seen a large jet plane being followed or shadowed by a small flying disk.  She could clearly make out the disk and the airplane in the Scottsville sky that day.  They appeared to be far away.  Anyway, I must tell you that my late Grandmother was always a devout Christian her entire life.  Grandma would never lie or make up a story such as this just for fun either.  I believe her strange story, and I thought that you might like to read it.  By the way, your Web site is spectacular and very informative.  The story that I have just told you IS true-not fiction.  Evidently, it seems that there are many people throughout the world that are believers in UFO's now because of their own encounters.  I can honestly tell you that I have seen them too, and that they are real-whatever they are.  Something strange is going on across our world that defies our own human logic or explanation.

When I used to live in Maple Valley Washington me and some good friends would spend a couple nights camping a few miles up some logging roads in a town known as cumberland. I believe the locals call it huckleberry hill its a left turn a bit passed kanaskat palmer state park, the gravel road winds its way up to a rock quarry where we usually stay. Around sunset a strange green meteor came from the east headed west and faded out around the olympic mountain range passed the puget sound. I thought that was strange but of course not strange enough to think twice about. We camped late into the night since none of us could sleep until around 3 to 3:30 am when oddly enough I became adventerous and bothered everyone to drive up further than we ever had into cumberland hills.  We drove a nissan sentra datsun wagon up there so it wasnt in the best shape after climbing the 5 miles yet we agreed to to go anyway, about 1 more mile up and arrived where we now know as huckleberry point. More cities could be seen than before to the west, and to the south mt rainier stood with all of its valley. We all jumped out pretty excited that we had found such a spectacular view. we all had stood around for a couple of minutes when three lights appeared to the lower left side of Rainier. At first glance I mentioned that they were fast moving semis on a long straight gravel road because of the way they appeared. until the back 2 lights as though connected by a piece of elastic, sort of swung themselves passed the leading light and reformed into a straight line. they had to have been moving in excess of 400mph to move ahead of the other lights like that. They appeared to be a little brighter than any stars in the sky but looked like stars nonetheless. The lights traveled all the way across to the right side of the mountain and moved into position to form a triangle. the triangle as a whole then shifted to reveal two more lights and a half diamond shape was revealed, it tilted as a complete object that looked geometrically perfect so the poin of the shape faced the mountain, the light then flared bright red and all the lights seperated. the top light that turned red morphed into 2 lights, and the bottom sets of 2 stayed together....they acted fixed like a pair of eyes, and as they would wander around looking back and forth one eye would dissapear before the other as though they were giant  black heads with glowing eyes. One of the pair of lights then dissapeared behind a hill about 300 feet away and about 150 feet tall so the thing was close.  What appeared over the hill still to this day makes me question reality. What we all described as a jelly-fish or octupuss the size of a blimp that was clear like glass with small lights running down along the tentacles and very bright lights for eyes. I became very frightened but calmed down as it just seemed to wander up check us out and float away. it sort of bobbed around as though it was propelling itself through water. after that all the lights pretty much appeared far away near the mountain moving from place to place, morphing into pairs of 1, 2 ,and 3 and then combining again.we watched them all night until  the sun came up all the lights returned to where the original diamond shape had first appeared and landed on a small hill that had been logged away. they appeared like little white dots in the day time occasionally catching the sun and shimmering like a s signal mirror. We all went down with plans to come up the next night with cameras and video tapes which we all had but none of them seemed to work. all we had was a disposable camera in which we snapped a few shots with of the lights the next night when they came out and wandered around again but all the pictures came out completely black with stripes of light going completely across the picture where a dot of light should have been.  we kept going up for many months until it eventually became expensive to keep doing so but we all had many encounters with these entity's.  I now live in california, this all took place last summer of 2004. Though I recently went camping with a buddy and around 2 am a bright light appeared on the side of a hill about a mile away, seperated into 2, and they both started wandering around until they reconnected and dissapeared. Seems as though they remembered me as I do them.  Anyway this is all very true and I have read of many similar sightings especially a place called sattva sanctuary. they have videos of some of the EXACT things I saw during all my visits  P.S.  we found out there is a highway running through where we witnessed the sighting and after a few days could destinguish cars running along the highway with these things floating above them as though they were chasing them. At times what we thought were planes because of the way they moved steady and blinked with colored lights but either vanished in thin air or moved right towards the lights and dissapeared into them. we had flashlights and tried to signal them by turning them off and on in timed patterns which seemed to catch their attention and other times not. The flashlights would always have trouble turning on and off even with new batteries. And most importantly one thing we did Notice whenever we screamed EX: ""Hey over here!"" the entity's would follow our echoes as we heard them bouncing through the valley. Everytime we all screamed loud enough for their to be a good echo all the lights would stop what they were doing and all move toward the sound. Its been awhile since the even and I saw so much of them its hard to distinguish everything properly I believe I have submitted these encounters before closer to when they happened.   EVENTS THAT SEEM SIGNIFICANT BUT MAY OR MAY NOT BE ATACHED TO THE DEFINATE SIGHTINGS.  I remember after the meteor appeared, I found a old piece of card board paper around midnight at the edge of the campsite I picked it up thinking how odd it was to find litter and the the two M&M's guys were standing on one side of a rainbow and a pot of candy at the end. and below it read ""See you on the other side,"" which meant nothing at the time but the next day I kept thinking about how that was some sort of subliminal invitation. Though I accept that this could be my own delusional thoughts after witnessing something so profound.  Also when the lights first made a half diamond and pointed the tip towards the mountain I said ""the mountain is gonna explode?"" and then the top light flared red. this could also be coincidence but is worth mentioning.  I remember having a thought in connection with the idea that the mountain was going to explode and the top of the half diamond flaring red. They appeared to be jelly fish with intentions to imply that the mountains eruption would go all the way to puget sound and extend it all the way to Mt. Rainier. This could be my own rationalization as to what happened since the idea of real floating jelly fish seemed impossible even staring right at them.  The Next morning when we were driving down, we saw a total of 8 red identicle ford rangers heading up towards where we camped. All the fords had a logo of a road with a leaf on it, I think it stands for custom built or something. that was more cars then we had ever seen heading up to cumberland at one time.  Also I noticed Weyerhaeuser has a very unusual method of cutting timber unusually close to the northern base of Rainier. Somebody mentioned that weyerhaeser cuts trees in triangular patches so the wildlife can run to the strips of trees inbetween the triangular gaps. This also is possibly coincidental but there were literally hundreds triangles spread across the valley.   During the day where the lights had landed me and one other may have seen a white dot dodging in and out of the treeline but it was too far away to tell.   we brought groups of people up during the months we saw these things they didnt seem to act up as much with larger groups of about 10 or so but I think it was an equal shyness between the people and the UFO's but they always managed to show off a little.  It seemed as though the ufos were alive with emotion and curiosity attemtping to mimick things they saw and interact with us. at times they come very close but appear very small. and sit and hover for hours rocking back and fourth atleast 100 yards away.  One of the original 4 people claimed that when the big jelly-fish peered over the hill for the first time the first night what he claims to be a floating fish with fins all the way down its sides and no fins ontop or bottom like an eel passed right through him. I remember him saying it happened and having trouble breathing but none of us saw it and were standing right next to him so that is also inconclusive.  Many months before this event happened and had never driven passed the quarry because we assumed it was the highest campable place to drive to without a truck.  Late that night what appeared to be infrared goggles clicked on and off over one of the side of the quarry, we all ran up to investigate and when we did someone had run by with a what looked like a potatoe sack with no markings full of sand and slit it open over the fire. when we all looked back the fire was out and we could hear several people moving around the campsite. they also managed to collapse the tent puncture every single can of soda and water we had and slit the rim of the tire so it exploded about 4 minutes after we passed kanaskat state palmer. 2 days later we drove back up with guns because we we all scrambled out of there leaving my friends 6 person tent which was strung up perfectly even though it was torn down when we left also all the small trees that were around the outside of the quarry were cut down and replanted around the tent. we looked around and what appeared to be body sized holes with caps made of woven brush and mud. My mother says before I was born she used to camp with my dad up in the same area when he went hunting and one night a bunch of people with night goggles circles the camp and put out the fire and tore all their gear apart. She filed a report about it and the police said there had been a few cases of what seemed to be secret army operatives playing war games on unsuspecting campers. Supposedly their is a ranger base around where we camped and saw the sighting. All I know is this even was too strange to not mention since it only happened a few months before the sighting.    ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE PASSED OFF AS MY OWN COMMENTARY AND CONCLUSIONS,     NOT CONCRETE DETAILS OF THE ACTUAL EVENTS. I HOPE THIS EVENT BRINGS LIGHT TO THOSE WHO GAVE WITNESS TO SIMILAR EVENTS BUT DIDNT WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF BEING A FOOL. OF COURSE AFTER MY OWN PERSONAL TIME SPENT WITH THESE BEINGS I NOW KNOW THE ONES WHO DONT BELIEVE ARE THE FOOLS. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-12-14T00:00:00,,

Being a reporter I felt, that I had to report it to some 'professionals', and I've tried that, but learned the hard lesson that nobody really cares. On the first of October 2002 on the isle of Folegandros, which is situated in the south-western Cyclades, I observed a strange aircraft while I was lying on my back on some coastal rocks a little south of Karavostasi. It moved south at a relatively slow speed at an altitude of about 3000 feet. The craft was completely transparent. I want to point out, that I have often seen how aircrafts under certain weather conditions seem to blend into the sky - even a clear blue one. However, living in cold Denmark you go out and splay yourself in the sun as often as you can during summer. The beach I use is one mile from the Int. airport of Copenhagen, so I've studied aircrafts a lot lying on my back.  I first noticed this one as it ploughed through a lowhanging white cloud. I was puzzled by it's shape, which I could see as a shadow on the 'belly' of the cloud. It looked like a big fat cross, the nose and wings round like the shape of a trefoil and the body rather plump and short.  I thought it might be some kind of veteran aeroplane, so I waited for it to emerge from the cloud. When it did, the 'mouth' of the cloud seemed to start whirling like a washing machine, and I was shocked to see, that the 'thing' coming out was completely look-through or invisible apart from a tiny blurry outline much like that of a soap-bubble. The background sky was blue with fleecy clouds, and I could see these clouds right through the plane. As it passed over me, and I was struggling to keep my eyes on the ghostly thing, it cast a shadow on me too. After a very short period I simply couldn't see it anymore. And when I say 'see' I mean the blurry outline. And other comparison I could make would be to the entity in the movie 'Predator'- it was that kind of effect. I think I might have seen a socalled black project craft.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,,

To assist state, local and federal elements in their efforts, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has begun using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are both an important part of the smarter border strategy and an essential element of the Arizona Border Control Initiative. The UAVs permit greater border coverage and quicker response times in rugged, desolate areas of the southwest border.  This is the first non-military use of UAVs for border protection. The Hermes 450 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) will supplement ground security efforts with a live video feed of potential illegal smuggling as it occurs.  The use of UAVs will complement the other intrusion detection and intelligence gathering components of the border surveillance network to meet the mission of stopping the illegal entry of terrorists, smugglers and others into the United States.  UAVs equipped with sophisticated on-board sensors have the potential to provide unparalleled surveillance capability.  This capability will provide CBP Border Patrol agents a ""birds eye view"" of smuggling and allow them to quickly refocus resources to apprehend people illegally entering the country. UAVs will also contribute to enforcement effectiveness and officer safety by providing communications links for coordinating multiple units on the ground is important in remote border operating areas.  UAVs provide long-range surveillance. As a result, they are especially effective force-multipliers because they have the capacity to remain on station much longer than other airborne assets, and are particularly useful for monitoring remote land border areas where patrols cannot easily travel and infrastructure is difficult or impossible to build.  Aviation/Technology  The UAV is equipped with electro-optic sensors and communications payloads providing day and night imagery. It is equipped with a communication capability used by ground control stations to communicate, which is a law enforcement officer safety and a communications/coordination requirement. The Hermes 450 is a single engine system with advanced composite structure and optimized aerodynamics. Advanced avionics enable autonomous flights and precise GPS navigation. The UAV is equipped with sophisticated communication systems transferring imagery in real-time to ground control stations.  Specifications  Up to 20 hours of flight endurance Reaches ceiling of 18,000 feet (operating at approximately 9,500 feet) Maximum air speed: 95 knots (125 miles per hour) Cruise speed:  70 knots (91 miles per hour) Built as a high wing, V-tail optimal aerodynamic configuration Light composite structure Redundant flight computer avionics and power supply Fully autonomous flight with in-flight redirection  (GOVERNMENT DOC - OK TO COPY) ((NUFORC Note:  At first, we decided not to post this report, when it first arrived, thinking that it might be a commercial advertisement for the drone described.  However, the information appears on the Homeland Security website, (http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/display?content=3786), so we have decided to share it.  Frankly, we doubt that the shape of the drone would cause many people to think that they were looking at a UFO, although if it were in the extreme distance, and generated a glint of sunlight, some might think that the reflection might have been caused by a genuine UFO.

They were in the vicinity of the Sooke Hills - Sooke Basin area (close to the Strait of Juan de Fuca). I was viewing them from Victoria, at least 16km- (10-miles) away. I have been interested in astronomy and aviation for most of my life and I am familiar with observing the night sky and aircraft at night. I can state with certainty that the lights were not astronomical bodies (they were not planets, stars, meteors, bollides, etc.) nor artificial satellites. The lights did not exceed a height of approximately 610-metre (2000-feet) above sea level. The flight characteristics (speeds and motions) of the two lights were not beyond those achievable by a conventional aircraft that is capable of stationary and/or very slow flight (to appear as if stationary), and forward flight at moderate speeds. A helicopter obviously comes to mind. However, my observations (I viewed the lights for 15-minutes over a 20-minute period) were not consistent with that of aircraft lighting: neither the red and green navigation lights, the red anti-collision beacon, nor the white anti-collision lights were visible at any time (I specifically looked for these lights). Additionally, the lights I did see were always visible and constant in brightness, never flickering, wavering, nor being lost from my view as they moved approximately 14° across my line of sight. They appeared to be omni-directional lights and not the uni-directional lights I associate with an aircraft's approach-lighting. The lights, seven minutes apart, descended from my view behind the hills. The first light to descend may have been associated with a condensation-like cloud trail (a natural patch of cloud is also a possibility). It lit this up from below when it was behind the ridge lines, out of my direct view. Despite having spent a considerable amount of my time viewing the sky (in one form or another related to my interests), this is the first time I have observed lights in the sky that I cannot identify nor confidently explain. They were certainly not astronomical in nature, and they were certainly local to the Sooke Hills area. My observations were inconsistent with my previous experiences of conventional aircraft activity; sufficiently anomalous to warrant my writing a detailed report about my sighting. However, I cannot, at this time, rule out aircraft activity with certainty.  My complete, detailed report with annotated maps has been published on the UFO*BC web site, http://www.ufobc.ca/History/2000/sookehills2004report.htm  I would be interested in reading reports of any other aerial activity (identified or not) that may relate to my sighting, whether around the date of my sighting or not.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,,

I and my 2 year-old son had gone shopping at K-MART.Upon leaving the shopping center i approached and stopped at a stop light.While waiting for the light to change,i observed a round red light approximately 100 feet above and behind the stop light.While looking at the light,it instantly became three red lights,which seemed to ""dance""(for lack of a better word)around one another.The 'dance' seeemed to be well choreographed,one red light was stationary in a center position while two lights manouvered up,down,around,behind and in front of the center light.Then the two 'dancing' lights merged with the central light and were gone.That's it gone,no sudden taking off,no streaking of lights, just POOF, gone. All this seemed to occur within a 30 to 45 second time span,as the light changed from red to green.However,my observace of this spectacle, in my mind,was at least 3 to 5 minutes. As i recovered my senses,taking off from the light,i had an inner dialogue with myself, trying to reconcile what i knew i saw to what i thought could not be.Although i lived just one mile from K-MART,i passed up my house and went to my parent's home fifteen miles away.I didn't know why, i only knew i did not want to be alone.I was wired,i mean i was so up,so jittery,so energetic i could not be still. Once i was seated with Mom,i was immediately calm,even mellow.I had not recounted my sighting,but as we chatted,a replay of my sighting was constantly going through my mind,sort of like background music.I wanted and intended to tell Mom what i had experienced,however,i never did .I don't know why,it was an eerie feeling,my sighting being foremost on my mind and not speaking of it.Why was that????????

I let them off their leashes and let them run.  I stood under a group of eucalyptus trees and looked northeasy admiring the sky.  In the distance there are mountains (not high).  Between the mountains came what looked like the lights of an airplane in the distance.  I was just idly watching waiting for the dogs to be finished so I could go back to the house, as there are normally many planes on this part of the sky.  However, the plane lights seemed to be heading right where I was standing and considerably lower than normal.  I was hypnotized by the brightness and then realized that it might be going to crash.  I called the dogs to me and they came running and I felt I would not be able to escape the crash.  The dogs were frightened.  Suddenly, a large cloud, swirling and brilliant appeared.  The sky had been clear as a bell.  I awaited by seconds the crash and the plane to come through the cloud.  In another second it was again clear as a bell and no plane , no lights nothing.  It was very dark and soundless.  I gathered the very excited, scared dogs and went back to my house and told my husband and l3 year old daughter what had happened.

Additional REPORT INFORMATION ..It has been so long ago that i gave you An Approximate Date..I am sure it was either 1976 or 1975..I can remember that within a Year of Our Experience..I read a Story in Newsweek or some other National Publication about Dozens of UFO Sightings over Military and Nuclear Weapon Storage Facilitys all across the United States and the story included a Map of the United States that was covered with sighting locations and Most had occured during the same approximate time we had Our Experience Near Mt.

IT WAS MOVING EXTREMELY SLOWLY,  JUDGING BY THE SOUND, PROBABLY NO MORE THAN A FEW MILES AN HOUR, AND SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING I WOULD CONSIDER A STEALTH-TYPE AIRCRAFT ((FLIGHT)).  4. The Most Incredible thing was the SOUND it made which was an AUDIBLE HUMMING SOUND..which also seem to make the ground around us Vibrate as it Passed Directly Overhead.. The Best way i can describe it is if You Have ever gone into a Hydro-electric Dam to the Gemerator Room and Heard that Sound and Felt the Vibrations those Generators Make..That is the EXACT Closest Sound I Can Relate This to.. 5. It was NOT like any Conventional Aircraft Engine I have Heard..We could not Hear it off in the Distance as You can a Combustion Engine Approaching.. We Only Became aware of it Just BEFORE it Very slowly Passed Directly overhead..and for a short time after it continued down the Valley..I doubt if you were any distance away you would even be aware of it Flying Nearby.. 6. The Weather conditions were Good, No Rain, But VERY Dark, No Moon or Illumination..I could Not see any Lights on this Craft at all. 7. We Both sensed that it was a Pretty Large Craft, just by the Sound of It passing overhead, You got the impression of something BIG.. 8. For some Reason we Both sat there afterward somewhat shocked,and had uneasy feelings of Vunerability..We Both immediately agreed that what ever flew over us was No Conventional Airplane and the Only thing that could Have Made those Sounds was some type of UFO..and still Believe so today..It was definately SOME TYPE of  Unconventional Flying Aircraft..

It was dusk and we heading South around Milan, MI, just talking about a directional antenna that we were working on.  I turned to the left to speak to my companion, ""Tom"", and saw (5) white lights in the distance.  I made mention to Tom, and he saw them too, about 315 degrees from our direction of travel (South). We watched them for about 30 seconds, and could tell that their travel was to the west.  We called the control tower for Toledo Express and asked if he had travel ((traffic??)) in the area.  Toledo said no.  Another 30 seconds later we called again, and Toledo responded by saying, ""sir, we have no traffic and nothing on radar"". By this time they were about 340 degrees and growing larger, which to me indicated that  were closing on the object. Just then another pilot who was in Fulton County (Ohio) came on the radio and said, ""I see those lights too.  I'm heading toward Metcalf (SE of Toledo), and they are 10-O'Clock to me.""  Toledo Express then came back on the air and said, ""Gentlemen, we don't have any traffic in the area.""  Tom and looked at each other, and he said, ""let's chase it.""   I suggested that it would not be wise not knowing what it was, or if it was military, and deviated from our flight plan to waste some time and put some distance between each other.  See the dots. After we landed we talked about it, but felt that any pursuit of the story could lead to jeopardy of our pilots license. The five lights were in a formation, and it was a clear night and at it's closest I could see clouds between the objects which appeared to be about 2,000 higher than we were.  We were around 5,000 feet.  At our closest they were probably between 4 to 6 miles off our right wing.  The formation was not in any pattern that would resemble lights on an aircraft.

We saw how bright the moon was, we layed there for a couple of minutes all of a sudden it moved in a certain pattern, we watched for about fifteen minutes, he said he had to go to work, so I watched, then, three objects came out of the left top and flew down , then the big moon object moved the same pattern as the first time and it left like a blink of eye. It stayed up there a long time in between all this. there is a lot more to this, so much happened at the time and after I strongly feel like more happened, I can't believe that no one has reported this as I have checked alot of stories in that time and nowhere is this mentioned I can't for the world think we were the only ones that seen this event!

A weekend in late August 1980 is one, which three of us in the group will never forget. It was our second and final night camping in the Guadalupe National Park near Pine Springs, Texas with part of our Boy Scout Troop from Midland, Texas. I was an Assistant Scout Master at the time and I worked as a News Reporter/Anchor at a radio station in Midland. There were 4 adults and approximately 15 scouts camping out under the open sky on cots and open pick-up truck beds. Two Scouts, about to become Eagle rank, and myself had settled in the back of a pick-up truck bed staring at the clear Eastern sky full of stars.  Best as I recall it was on August 16th close to 23:30 hours. I suddenly saw what appeared to be a ""Falling Star"" drop down in the Northeast. It came in at a fairly moderate speed and I thought how great it was to see such a bright falling meteorite approximately two to three miles away and guessed its circumference at 100 feet. This size of the ball of light seemed too large for a meteorite.  I was a little alarmed that there was not a trailing light tail and its brightness was not decreasing which would indicate burn out. I was even more alarmed when it dead stopped approximately a thousand feet above the horizon.  It then begin to move South, stopping then moving North a little then moving South as well as changing some in elevation. This jerking motion occurred over 5 times until it dead stopped for a few seconds approximately 4 to 5 miles South of where its point of entry had been. The light remained the same size whiteness and intensity the entire time. There was no sound heard. It began its same jerking motion back toward the North where it dead stopped a few seconds at the point it had stopped after entry. Suddenly it went straight up at a speed that only recently I can barely compare to the Stealth airplane going straight up at an air show. But this ball of light did this from a dead stop! The white ball of light accelerated straight up at seemingly impossible speed and disappeared out of sight in approximately 4 seconds.  During this observation I heard myself say,” What the heck,,, is,,, that?"" One Boy Scout said, ""I dunno?!!"" and the other Boy Scout said, I dunno either but lets not tell anyone cause no one will ever believe us!""  The next morning I ask if anyone had seen anything unusual in the sky and not one of the others said they had. When they ask why I ask, I just said, ""Oh, just wondering.""  I considered our observation a personal experience and never reported it on the air as news and never told a soul until the past couple of years, this now being 2004. I never saw a UFO before that night and I have not seen any since. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))",2004-06-18T00:00:00,,

I was the passenger in a car that crossed the Franklin D. Roosevelt Mid-Hudson Bridge to Poughkeepsie, NY at about 9:15PM. As we wended our day at about 25 mph (speed limit) down the serpentine on-ramp from the toll booths, both bridge stanchions were visible directly ahead of us. For less than 30 seconds, they were blocked from view as the road took us through blasted out rock. When we took a left turn out of the rocks and onto the bridge, an immense object was directly ahead of us, hovering just above the bridge(less than 100 feet). Though no surface was visible on the object, it's outline was traced by thousands of multi-colored lights, many in motion. My friend and I simultaneously shouted, ""holy shit,"" as we drove across the span, which the bridge authority later told me was about 3,000 feet. Parked at our end of the bridge, it's length extended 2/3rds+ of the way across it, or approximately 2000 feet, and certainly no less than 1500. As we drove across the span, it was visible out of every window in the car for most of our crossing.  About halfway across, I rolled the window down and looked directly up at it, as my friend white-knuckled the steering wheel, repeatedly uttering, ""I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping."" It was completely silent, and many of the lights underneath were apparently rotating around a central axis at speeds that were changing often. The strange thing is that they didn't appear to accelerate or decelerate, but were instantly going different speeds, like the speeds were quantized. Some of the lights were detached from the main object and rotating around the central point at some distance. A glowing spherical orb of an orangish color was about 25 feet from my head, just beyond the bridge girders, moving with us. About a half mile south of the bridge, a smaller lighted object was hovering above the river channel, which may have been the more commonly seen-then and there-chevron shaped UFO seen edge on. As we got across the bridge, to the top of the hill, at Market! street, I turned and saw that it was still there, in the same position it had been. Note that this immense object had to have silently moved out of nowhere to just above the bridge in the 30 seconds that it was not in our line of sight. The night of this sighting, the local radio stated that 1500 people reported seeing it, including numerous police, doctors and nurses at Vassar Hospital.

I was this in the sky in North Hollywood Ca. This happen during the early 1980's  In 2001, I lived in La Mesa California and resided in a 2 bedroom apt in a upstairs unit. I remember lying in my bedroom on the bed, and the room was brightly lit. I felt tired, and I asked my live-in boyfriend to go to a nearby taco shop for Mexican food. After he left I dosed off and feel asleep. The next thing know is my boyfriend returns and as he is entering my bedroom, he says very load ""wake up! The food is here"" as I opened my eyes I saw a gray like creature do a spin and disappear near my bedroom window. The first thought that ran through my mind was that after I feel asleep something was in the room with me. I didn’t tell my boyfriend for fear that he would think I was nuts. So, I didn't a word to anyone about what I had seen.  THE NEXT NIGHT: I had been on my computer most of the night. I then told my boyfriend that I was going to bed early, he stopped watching T.V and joined to go to bed. As we got into to bed I turned the lights off, but the room was lit from a light outside attached to the building. So, the bedroom wasn't completely dark. My boyfriend and I feel asleep after talking for a little while. In the middle of the night I woke up sweating, for some reason I was very hot. I got up from the bed and walked to my right to the corner of the room to wipe my face from sweat with one of the clean towels that I had in a laundry basket on the floor. As leaned down I grabbed the towel and wiped my face, and as I was wiping my face I notice something behind me that seemed to be small quickly run past me I turn to my left and looked to the floor and saw nothing. Then as I laid I dropped the towel, again I saw something moved. I turned to the right side of myself and looked toward the floor and saw nothing, and just as though I am seeing things. I notice something behind me to the left side. I quickly turn and looked and saw this small creature hovelling down to the floor. It had lizard type skin; it was mixed of colors of Black, dark green, dark gray. The little creature stood up and stretched his arms that had attached skin that appeared to be broken wings. The eyes were black and the feet looked liked hoof of a pig or horse. When the little creature aroused up it stood about 8 ft. tall, and it moved in a slow jerking move jerking manner. It stepped across the bed in one step, while it was stepped across the bed boyfriend woke up and tried to yell there was no sound he was only moving in the bed in fear. After the little creature stepped across the bed it turn toward me backing up it's back up away from the bed then it stopped with it's arm and body in a hunch, and sat still. I look at it and wonder how it be so small again, boyfriend was trying to turn on the bedroom light and hear him asking me ""what the HELL is that thing?"" I was speechless and never said a word because the small creature was still in the room looking straight through me. I look down at toward the floor to wonder where its long legs had gone. I notice that was another creature sitting next to it with its head hunched down to fit in the room. This creature was enormous in size. It had I long face with black eyes, it sat like a dog sitting straight up. I notice that it had two horns attached to its head that went straight back, it had the same colors as the little creature, but the feet were different. I so afraid because it was so BIG! That is when began to shake all over. Suddenly, I though about all of the people that said they were abducted and not believed. Then suddenly in a (psychic way) for a quick moment I saw a far away planet, where many humans were and not returned to earth. I was these many of the same type of creatures in a militant stance. They seemed to be angry, and then it all went away. I saw the two creatures standing in the room again. I thought of my children, and thought that I would never see them again. Suddenly I hear the large creature say with an angry tone ""LOOK AT THOSE HUMANS"", that's is when I quickly jump onto the bed and buried my head into the blankets and began praying, I quickly yelled TURN ON THE LIGHT! I don't why I said that. My boyfriend said I'm trying, I'm trying it won't come on. Then suddenly the light comes on, and I jumped toward him, and we look at the direction of the creatures and they were gone.  All of this seemed like it took place in 5 mins but it was really hours, because I ran out of the room to called my family and noticed the time and it was almost 5:00AM in the morning.  I don't think that I have ever been that scared in my life. To this day I wonder if anyone else had seen anything like that. I have looked on the Internet and have never come across an event like my boyfriend’s and mine. I do believe that what I saw in that brief vision like moment was these creatures preparing to attack us.  I am not concerned if this is believe by others and many may say that, but I only wanted to share my story with others just in case they have had experienced the same thing as I did.

I had gone to buy a new mattress with my friend. She wanted the new mattress. we bought the mattress which was loaded into the back of the car and my friend said she wanted me to stop at the big supermarket in wednesfield. I decided i would stay in the car and make sure the new mattress was not stolen. my friend went into the supermarket. I lit up a cigarette and was just sitting there bored when i got 'The Feeling' ( i add at this point that i have seen many ufo's on occaision and always either get a feeling like that one percieved when there is going to be a storm or i get what i can only describe as 'a thought/voice telling me to go outside and observe.) back to the incident. I looked out of the car window to my right (i was in the driving seat) and i could see in the very far distance of the sky, 2 # jets leaving a vapour trail. |The jets were so far away and tiny that it took a long time b4 they were in the front windscreen view about halfway up the windscreen. The whole of the sky was a clear blue and there were no clouds nor was there any mist cloud. because i had not seen anything 'abnormal i was beginning to think that 'the Feeling' was rubbish and coincidental to the other sightings I have had when the UFO's came into view. This was the definitive proof for me that all the other sightings i have had were legitimate and that now i can relax and evolve spiritually. I now understand and accept that we are not alone. The jets that i had mentioned were flying one above the other and one was slightly behind the other approximate distance would be a little finger nailif i held my hand outstretched in front of me. above the jets and one by 1 four UFO's descended and hovered above the Jets. all four were motionless and just hung in the sky for approximately 5-10 mins. I was totally amased at what i could see and thought to look around at other people to see if they were seeing what i was but they were just going about their every day lives and quite frankly no-one was even looking up into the sky. I watched in amasement as i was beginning to think perhaps the Jets had 'let off' some flares when 2 of the objects ( I think it was the 1st and third one that came down, went back up through the atmosphere and out of view. the two remaining UFO's stayed above the Jets. it was then that the 1st UFO came back down.  Just then my friend came out of the supermarket and i had got myself out of the car. she asked me what I was doing and in order not to prompt her and to see if she could see the same thing as I, I asked the question "" X, what can u see in the distance""? I also pointed in the direction that the incident was happening. X replied ""I can see 2 planes in the sky"" I then said ""ok. what can you see above the Jets""? X replied "" there are some stars..so what? you can see stars in the daytime sometimes""! I then asked her ""what are the 'Stars' doing""? and X said ""They are moving up"" (it was at this point that either my friend was scared or didn't want to aknowledge what we were observing when she sternly said "" so f*****g what! lets go - I dont want to be here"" I really wanted to stay but i had no way of recording the incident and reluctantly got in the car and drove us home. The description of the UFO's are as my freind said, it was like watching stars come out of the blueness of the sky and hover above the Jets and the would then after a few minutes go back up to where they had come from.

We had been having some spectacular sunsets leading up to my recent sighting. This is my sixth to date. I was watching the sun set at 5pm. It had just set below the horizon and the sky was another painted masterpiece! Looking west from my house I can see the golf course and Airport on the hill. I suddenly noticed what I though at first was a meteor just right of the airport about 500m. It looked like a fireball. This object was hovering at tree level. When I realised that this was no meteor I grabbed my binoculars for a better look. Apon viewing the craft I was literally numb with shock. Then an amazing adrenalin rush took over.  The craft was huge. I estimate about 80/100m in length. It was shaped like a saucer but more cigar shaped. It was fluctuating between a whitish silver and the most amazing intense orange. Almost like a colour that I have never seen before (if that makes sense). It also had this strange shimmering effect, abit like heatwaves on the road. This part is hard to explain...... The craft appeared to be surrounded by what looked like a cloud.  The only way to explain it is to say, to me, it was a hole or a tear in space-time-reality and this object had sorta popped in for a look! I found this really hard to comprehend. I winessed something they don't teach us in science. The object suddenly began to move very slowly to the north still above tree level. About 10 minutes into the sighting the craft split into 2 objects. The both remained side by side for about 30 seconds and then joined as one again. I witnessed to object for about 15-20 minutes all up before it drifted behind a mountain and I lost sight of it. During the sighting I called a friend who has a video camera. Unfortunately due to the geography he couldn't see the craft. I have spoken to several people including a helicopter pilot who was working at the airport that day, but no one saw it. During the sighting I also observed 2 small aircraft fly near the object and land at the airport. I also got this sensation that it was showing itself to me, and me only!",2004-08-11T00:00:00,,

Mazarron, Murcia, Spain.  Between 13.45 and 14.00. Hot day, temperatures in high 20&#8217;s C, light breeze, enough to stir the leaves, clear blue skies. No clouds to the north, east or south, Clouds forming to the south west, up and over the distant hills, and moving to the west. These hills start at about four miles south, and run down the coast southward.  Walking the dog up the road, in a northwest direction I noticed a bright white cloud ahead. It caught my notice, as there were no other clouds visible in the sky. I walked to within 150 yards of the end of this road, where at the end there are a line of trees, all about 40 to 50 feet high. This cloud seemed to be very close behind the trees and low. Half of it was below the top quarter of the trees, the remainder in clear view. It was swirling like clouds do, changing shape and forming tails that broke off into small pieces of cloud, move away, and seemed to go back into the main cloud. Then the cloud seemed to evaporate a little and re build itsself again. I watched for two or so minutes, and it disappeared totally. I turned back to home, but glanced back about 15 seconds later and the cloud was back again in the same spot. On reaching home, I took my binoculars and went up onto the roof of the block of apartments. I estimate the deck to be about 65 feet high. There are three blocks in a row all of about the same size from the roof you can only see the roof of the next block. There sure enough was the cloud, but it must have been higher than it&#8217;s original position as it appeared to be a few feel higher then the top of the roof of the next block. Photo !. Shows the roof from where I first observed it, point A on the map, behind the left of the two chimney like stacks, and extending midway between the two. It was doing as I previously described, shrinking, fading enlarging and disappearing. It did not drift in any direction, but remained in roughly the same spot, suddenly to vanish completely. There were no other clouds in the sky remember. Suddenly a round cloud, appeared over the top of the hill to the west, a mile from here, marked B on the map, in line with the two palm trees in the centre of the photograph. It was about half an inch across, remained stationary there for about a minute, then vanished. The cloud at point A reappeared within seconds of this. The cloud evaporated again, and the round cloud appeared over the same hill slightly to the right and lower than before. It changed shape, ending up seeming to stand on end in a curved line, and just vanished. It reappeared over the hills at point C on the map, over the end of the line of hills three miles away to the north, remaining stationary. It did not appear to change shape, and seemed a little bigger than when it was closer. I then noticed a large cloud appearing from behind the line of hills to the north, in direct line with the round cloud. It came slowly in a straight line, stopping a distance away from the round cloud, point D on the map. Neither moved as I watched for about a minute. When I glanced back in the to centre of the valley to my amazement there were ten or more small clouds over various parts to the west of the valley, some below and some above the top line of the hills to the north. These cloudlets changed shapes, evaporated or grew larger, some starting with a small dot of white, and developing into small clouds about the size of my little finger. The cloud in the original position (A) was back there. Photo B. Is taken from the point I moved back too, to get out of the sun. I was able to see points C and D, and across the valley to the east. I became aware of a large cloud coming over the hills to the east, eight miles or more from here, the highest hill to the right of the photograph, and it slowly came in a straight line across the middle of the valley, followed by an identical cloud some 15 seconds later, on the course as the first. They were travelling at the same speed. The first one at its closest point was between me and the hills to the north east, and there was about two inches of sky between its bottom edge and the tops of the hills. It seemed to be about four inches long. It stopped at a point just before the cream wall in the photograph. Both of them stopped, at points E and F on the map, and began to evaporate, and I looked at the two other clouds at C and D and they too were fading. There was not a cloud to be seen. After a few minutes the original cloud re appeared. I had to leave at this point. Sighting lasted 25 mins. On the roof At 18.00 hours I had to go out, and the cloud was once again over the trees at the end of the road. I did not have time to observe it, and it was gone when I returned an hour later. There were no other clouds in the sky anywhere. I have drawn the clouds as best I can. They were like no clouds I have ever seen, in formation, movement across the sky and lack of movement within itsself.  This area is semi arid, with the valley floor covered with plastic greenhouses, but no industry. I checked for a fire as the possible source of the clouds, but there were none. I Thought maybe the local climate could have caused this effect, however this is unlikely, as we have had a week of similar weather conditions, some days with clouds, all of them very high in the sky, and all of them behaving as one would expect clouds to behave. They were unlike any clouds I have ever seen, (both from above and below  clouds).  I have a map and three location photographs.

The next day, 7/8/04, I decided to lounge on the patio during the afternoonto read magazines and scan the sky periodically for another sighting.  It took awhile to be rewarded for the wait, but at 5.55 PM I saw what appeared to be the same object from the day before, again, in nearly the idential eastern placement in the sky.  Again, through binocs, it was a single sphere, apparently reflecting the sun, but not glinting.  I watched it as it very slowly moved toward the south, passing BEHIND one small cloud which itself was drifting generally northward.  (The local online weather details indicated a north wind in Denver, though I'm not sure at what time or altitude that stat was documented).  As previously, this object gradually faded out of sight, though it was visible for about 10 minutes total, until 6.05, during which time it had moved only a few degrees.  NOTABLY:  Less than 1/2 hour later, the same or a similar object AGAIN appeared, but several degrees north of the location where the earlier one had disappeared, and once again it very slowly headed to the south/perhaps SE as it gradually faded in intensity.  Second event lasted from 6.30 to 6.38 PM.  Using Occam's razor, I started thinking about these 4 sightings which had occurred in a 30-hour period, and there are several things worth noting:  1) I did not change the focus on the binoculars from the time I saw the distant, near-stationary object SUDDENLY accelerate during yesterday's sighting, indicating it was the same object and not the result of an unintentional, split second ""blink of the eye"" viewfinder adjustment to something closer to me (for instance, cotton from a cottonwood tree)and besides, the speeding object looked identical in size and shape to the steady object, 2) in addition, this time of year there is no cotton drifting in the air,  3) the object was relatively stationary and steady in intensity -- rather unlike a balloon might appear if drifti! ng in upper level winds, and 4) the object moved slowly southward while the clouds at apparently a similar altitude were drifting northward.  I am going to continue watching for this type of object and would encourage other Denver-area skywatchers to keep their eyes peeled for this recurrent daytime object in the eastern sky!

Totally unlike anything I have ever seen. I first noticed a bright light in the sky, looking like a very large, very bright star. I then thought it was a planet, although it looked a little large. Then I became aware of a red light to the side of it and realized that the object was moving closer to my position. At this point I decided it was a helicopter, as police helicopters routinely fly by this location. I waited to hear the familiar sound of a helicopter in flight, but the sound never came. As it drew closer it looked very much like a big car in the sky was headed towards me. By this I mean that the most noticeable thing was two big lights, on what was presumably the front of the aircraft, looking very much like car headlights in the sky. There was a third, smaller light between these two. All these lights were rather standard looking lights, although very bright. I'll note here that these lights were constant, not flashing. The object wasn't moving very quickly, but it was moving in what I consider to be a normal manner for an aircraft. As it drew closer I began to wonder why I still couldn't hear the noise of the helicopter's rotars, it seemed as though it was close enough that I should be able to hear it. When I did finally hear it it sounded like a jet airplane rather than a helicopter, though it was still moving at a speed that I associate with helicopters, not airplanes. The sound was also remarkably quiet. I am familiar with passenger airlines flying by with a deafening roar, this was nothing like that even as it passed almost directly over me. Now, as it got very close I began to notice the bizarre shape of the craft. It was night, so most of my impression of the shape came from the positioning of the lights, but I also got a general feel of an outline of the thing. It looked essentially like a big cross or letter 'x'. The 'headlights' I had seen before were still visible, and I now noticed that they also extended under the object at what I assume to be the front, reminding me somehow of a cockpit although I make no! assumption that is what I was looking at. This was approximately at where the branches of the 'x' join. On each branch there was a light near the end, plain white light on three but a red light on one, as best as I could tell. It is hard to be sure because the general impression I got was that I was looking at something the likes of which I had never seen before, so that added to the darkness made it hard to draw any 100% conclusions. I immediately called my friend who I know to be interested in this kind of thing. When I explained to him what I saw and told him the direction it was travelling in he informed me that it was heading directly towards Forbes Field. Interestingly, he had noticed a lot of military aircraft flying here lately, I had seen one or two myself while out with him. Also, almost immediately after I saw this UFO I noticed a helicopter circling the area for a few minutes. While my friend was here with me we actually noticed several aircraft flying by. It seemed like a lot more than usual, but it's not like I usually pay much attention to be honest.  Background information of the observer:  I'm 22 years old, currently unemployed. I'm English but I have been here in Kansas for 3 years. I'm not sure what background information anyone would find useful. I did very well in high school, followed by a couple of years in college in which I didn't do so well for personal reasons. In that time I did get an AS level in psychology though. I'm fascinated by anything unusual, but anyone would tell you I'm also a very down to earth guy. I have seen unusual things in the sky before but I have never made a report because I always had doubt. The general populace already mocks the study of UFO's enough without vague reports adding to it. This time I am positive I saw something highly unusual, an aircraft of a design that I am totally unfamiliar with. I am sure background information is meant to supply credibility for the observer. I can't think what to say to increase my credibility, but I assure you I am a sensible person, fascinated by the unusual but if anything I tend towards cynicism. I do not make this report lightly, and I have not embellished or jumped to any conclusions. I make this report because I feel it is the duty of credible witnesses with honest experiences to make a report.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,39.03386902439024,-95.75722975609757

What my wife and I saw this morning was something other than a ""craft"", I suspect, yet it was quite bizarre.  It involved a 'something' shaped exactly like a vertically oriented Greek letter omega, complete with the small 'wing' out to each side at the bottom.  The 'thing' seemed composed of a very solid-looking tube with pointed ends that was of a bright white, opaque-looking, and highly coherent 'vapor' (or something else). It subtended about four full moons or two degrees in height (somewhat less in width), as measured objectively by my wife using fingers at arm's length, and by me, independently.  The Omega-like thing hovered at about 42 degrees elevation in our north-northwestern sky while a brand-new-looking (very clean, bright paint) blue and white helicopter circled several times between us and it at only a couple of hundred feet (maybe 300-400 maximum) just to the east and southeast of the 'thing', until the thing suddenly began to disintegrate or dissolve as a white vapor that was quickly carried away to the east on low-level winds that were the same as at ground level. Then, the helicopter flew off.  It was the extraordinarily noise of the low-level, circling (in a N-S oval) helicopter (that had just flown into the area) that caused my wife and me to look up in its direction and, as a result, see the bizarre omega-shaped thing hovering what seemed, subjectively, no more that a thousand feet to the northwest of the elliptical path of the helicopter.  The helicopter departed once the 'omega' began to disintegrate, after having completed several traverses of its elliptical path.  I have subsequently learned the identity of the helicopter and the name of its pilot, plus the phone number were I should be able to reach him early in the morning (Saturday). Anything I learn from the pilot will be relayed to you.  I would stress that this definitely was not a jet aircraft's condensation wake, nor was it an ordinary low-level cloud, by any stretch of the imagination.  Whatever it might have been, it gave the impression of being of artificial, and at least to us, anomalous in origin.  We live just inside the northern edge of the Washington, D.C. Beltway (I 495), and a short drive west of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.  I ran inside to get the camera but could not locate it, so I ran back out while my wife (who had watched in the interim of my absence)went in and found the camera and came back outside with it.  By that time, the object had disintegrated, with the residue drifting east.  I took several photos of the vapor drifting east along with small clouds and trees for reference, in order to show that the residue was drifting on the lower-level wind and not with the atmosphere higher up where jets fly.  The observation was not frightening, but it seemed quite bizarre, that impression enhanced by the elliptically circling helicopter just to the omega's east and southeast, and only while the object was there.  It will be interesting to learn whether the pilot saw the phenomenon, and I have learned the pilot was ""on a photo mission"", so he might even have gotten photos.  I shall not hold my breath, though, because the pilot and anyone else aboard may have been distracted downward because it was a photo mission. If not the observed phenomenon, I wonder what they were trying to photograph in that area.  The photo objective may have been something prosaic, however, although I can't help but hope they saw the phenomenon and took photos.  Within six minutes after the observation, I checked the ELF magnetic environment with one of our instruments, but found nothing magnetically anomalous in the monitored range.  I would judge, subjectively, that the vertically oriented (at least from our view, and seemingly relative to the ground) 'omega' was located approximately over the intersection of the northern side of the D.C. Beltway (I 495) with I 95, going north and south toward and from Baltimore.  It was so windy this morning that I am confident the 'omega' was not 'skywriting', and, furthermore, being just north of D.C. within its beltway, we are in a highly FLIGHT CONTROLLED zone. A skywriting aircraft would have been attacked by the Air Force, immediately.  Furthermore, sky writing would not have hovered in the sky, as did this phenomenon before its 'disintegration'.  I hope no one tries to read anything into the fact that the phenomenon was omega-shaped, even though I could think of some political commentary.  :)",2004-07-25T00:00:00,38.995773529411764,-76.93307647058825

I awoke a 3:30 a.m., it was Saturday, May 15, 2004. A light was shining at me through the east window.  I didn't think much of it but it woke me up, so, I flipped over in bed and looked out of the window behind my head, (South Facing) and I thought I saw a plane but after a few seconds I realized it wasn't a plane because it was large and triangular with two flashing lights on each tip. My mind was trying to convince me that maybe its a new type of plane or something but a couple of seconds later an orb came our of the top of it and went straight up into the sky. It scared the crap out of me. I have always believed there were other life forms out there but to actually see it is pretty disconcerting. Just wondering if anyone else reported a sighting that night. Please respond.  Thank you to the person for the report.

Traffic was at a halt and I had plenty of opportunity to watch. It seemed like a party balloon but was moving /revolving really slowly in clockwise rotation in what was a pretty good wind / breeze. Not sure which way wind was traveling. The ""Balloon"" was orange and black and appeared to have 3 or four glowing dots on one side that were distinctive from orange and black two tone body color. It just very slowly, in the strong breeze, seemed to rotate up towards the clouds.  It gets better!  I got off the freeway and was stopped at light so I peered at the object spinning slowly up then I said to myself there must be something else up in the sky. I turned my head further up towards the silvery blue thin clould blanketed L.A. sky and then saw the glowing light flying in a straight line from west to east! As itwas flying I said ""come on no way I'm seeing a Mexico City Style orb"" to myself then it stopped moving straight and cut a 90 degree turn down towards the ground and kinda zig zaged for a few seconds then stopped in Place near or above clouds! The street light turned green, nobody honked and I moved to quickly park! and view  I pulled my car into a McDonald's parking lot at Vermont around Santa Monica or Melrose and parked next too of all things a trailer filled with Horses. Wild! I backered my car up and was able to view both objects. My sunroof, which is huge, offered a great tinted view of light orb, foo fighter. The ""Balloon"" now stopped rotating and showed me the side with the three or four glowing dots as it moved slowly in a straight line up and away towards the north / clouds. When I turned back towards orb it had changed shape and position slightly more east and had become a white ""I"" shape standing tall against clouds. I watched both objects for about five minutes as the ""balloon slowly faded and blink of eye disappeared way before clouds. And the white ""I"" stayed in a stationary position for a few minutes after Balloon had disappeared, then poof it was gone!  Another interesting point was that the horses didn't seem to pleased, maybe the heat or traveling but they seemed in snyc with what was happening above, making some annoyed gruf sounds.

We stopped by a friend’s work during her lunch break and then continued on our bike ride down towards the Steel Bridge.  We went under the Burnside Bridge on the bike/walk dock and neighbor stopped suddenly on her bike in front of me.  I thought that something was wrong with her bike at first because she stopped so abruptly.  I came to a stop behind her and looked up to where she was looking.  We both saw what seemed to be a huge metallic pipe floating in the sky.  The sky was covered with very low clouds and scattered light showers.  The pipe was moving slowly from the north in and out of the clouds and then began moving south parallel with I-5, but more so above the east side of Portland. During the bike ride I was in the process of photographing Portland’s bridges for my grandfather who is a retired civil engineer.  I remembered that I had my digital camera with and scrambled to pull it out of my bike bag.  I began to photograph the object in the sky (between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm on 5/ 15/ 04).  Once I started taking pictures the object leveled out, flattened, and moved slowly towards us.  I took the picture and looked around to see if anyone else noticed this thing.  I was surprised when I realized that virtually no one else was out on the dock that afternoon.  There was one runner, a woman that glanced up and over her shoulder when she ran by to see what we were staring at.  She did not stop to look and I doubt that she saw the object from the angle at which she turned her head.  We did not say anything to the runner because we were completely stunned by what we thought we were experiencing.  The object remained flat and continued to hover above us.  I took a couple more pictures and then I got a really weird feeling that I should not be taking these photos.  I put my camera down out of respect for the object (I don’t know why).  Neighbor and I just stared at the pipe/ or disk (looked more like a pipe-disk the closer it came because I could see a slight bend at each corner).  I can not tell if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or the pipe emanating energy towards us.  It looked like a shifting aura or something that was pulsing towards us.  Something like a light or small sun beams that break through clouds, but it was not very bright and rather bluish-white-grayish. I then decided to us my video mode on digital camera because I knew my other friend would not believe what I had seen if I did not have moving footage.  Unfortunately I cannot zoom in on video mode like I am able to with still shots, but I worked with what I had.  I began to film the object and it began to move away from us heading east.  I filmed the I-5 and then back to the sky to put the event in perspective.  The object continued to move away and then turned slightly to the left/ north.  It began to move further away and I stopped filming because I was frightened.  When the object was close I was not scared but more so in awe of the event, however, when the object moved away I began to panic because I felt I had seen something I should not have (don’t know why again).  I felt that the object was still watching us even though now behind the clouds. I also felt that the object could hear us or knew what we were thinking.  I then turned to neighbor and made her promise that we would not tell anyone, out of respect towards whatever that was.  We expressly agreed with a hand shake (in my head I figured that they needed to see this) and got back on our bikes and headed north towards the steel bridge slowly.  We could still see the object but I just wanted to get out there.  The object dipped back down out of the clouds and then went up and slightly towards to north out of sight. While we were riding away I checked to see if neighbor was all right.  I felt funky through my entire body and pretty confused (not to the point of disorientation though).  She asked me why I wanted to know if she was all right, I did not answer her and continued to ride across the bridge.  We barely said a word to each other for the rest of the ride, only a “what the hell was that” every now and then.  When I got home I put the pictures in my computer and I was surprised to see that the camera picked up the object on video.  I showed neighbor and we really didn’t talk about it much until later that night after we had a couple beers.  We totally broke our earlier agreement because the excitement of what had happened earlier hit us after a few beers.  We decided to show the photos only to people that we thought could appreciate them.  The more we showed the photos, the more we wanted to continue to show the photos.  Many of our friends say that they got chills when they viewed the pictures on my computer.  It really was exciting for everyone and I am glad to a certain extent that we broke the agreement to not tell anyone. I have not contacted this web page sooner than today because I am fearful of the ramifications.  I am fearful of the secrecies within government and I am ignorant to whatever it was that was looking back at us on the dock.  I hope that by sharing this story and pictures with everyone will help in some way.  I don’t know how it will help but I know that it was one of the most amazing things I have seen occur in the sky.  The next day I went to the ocean for a friend’s birthday and took a picture of my first whale.  This little camera is the best investment I have made this year.  Thanks for listening, there are few more post sighting experiences that I have not included because I do not know if they are relevant…I don’t even know what I experienced.  I would like to talk with someone in person before I share any of that.  All we have is a moment",2004-06-04T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

Full Description of event/sighting: At dusk (approx 7:50-8:00 pm) on May 15 2004, from my home in East Scarborough near Lake Ontario, looking south towards the lake, some moving lights in the sky caught my attention.  They were confined to a fairly small area of the *sky* and seemed to be at about cloud level. My guess is the lights were moving about perhaps a few miles off our shoreline, and would likely have been high enough and far enough over the lake to also have been visible from the US side of the lake. It had been an overcast day and the sky at this time was clearing. It wasn't nearly dark enough yet to observe any stars.  At first I saw one small pink-red light at cloud level traveling parallel to the ground and in a straight line moving from east to west at about the same rate as I'd expect to see planes travel. This light flashed on and off with a regular rhythm like an aircraft and was about the same size as an aircraft light seen at such a distance. It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, then traveled west for perhaps 5 seconds and disappeared. I thought I had seen and then lost sight of a plane.  Suddenly from the very same place in the sky that the light originally appeared, and only seconds after the first light vanished, another light appeared. It was the same colour and behaved exactly like the first light, even traveling in the very same line. It too disappeared in the same manner as the first light. This behavior of a light appearing, traveling for a few seconds across the sky and then disappearing repeated 6-10 times. After a few passes the reappearing light ceased flashing as it moved across the sky. It glowed a reddish pink colour and without blinking as it moved.  The behavior of the light then changed. Suddenly the light was moving from west to east and towards the end of the sighting it seemed that there might have been more than one light in play. Just as one vanished another appeared. The direction of flight changed to a sweeping arc. The flight started parallel to the ground and then curved steeply upwards and seemed to accelerate just before disappearing. There seemed to be a distinct repetitive pattern to the flight of the light(s). As one light moved from east to west, arcing at the end of its flight, another light mirrored that pattern by flying west to east and then arced upwards at the end. The area the lights were ""playing"" in the sky drifted higher and a little to the east as the sighting continued. It also seemed that the activity of the lights became more intense towards the end. They appeared and disappeared more quickly and the flight pattern became more energetic. The best thought that comes to mind is it appeared that they were growing increasingly excited about something as the activity became quite hectic towards the end. The display of these lights lasted about 5 minutes and was witnessed by a friend with me at the time. His impression was that the lights were chasing each other, as in a dogfight.  The flight pattern reminded me of when you see a powerful spot light beamed in the sky circling and moving about, starting and finishing its routine in the same place every time. These lights were a lot like what you see when you use a red laser pointer, except the colour of the lights in the sky were less intense red than a laser, rather being an almost pink sort of colour. Since the cloud cover was quite thin at this time it's unlikely that some sort of laser was beaming around on the cloud cover (If it was an extremely powerful laser I would have seen the lights fade in and out as the beam struck thin patches of clouds. The lights I saw held intensity as they flew across the sky before vanishing suddenly.)  There was no sound accompanying this sighting and I think the flight behavior was too radical for normal aircraft. The speed and turns were not something I've ever seen planes capable of doing, particularly without making sound. The regular flashing of the lights in the beginning was aircraft-like, but the reddish-pink colour was unusual. I got the feeling while watching the lights that I was seeing glowing objects, something without mass (like the spot made by a laser) rather than a solid aircraft.  In such an urban area as this I can't imagine that my friend and I were the only two people to have seen this blatant display of something quite unusual right out in the open and in daylight. Surely our beaches and boardwalks, which provide a perfect view of the southern sky, were busy on Saturday after dinner and many people could have seen this event. I've checked into all the major local news sources, newspapers, radio and local TV news and haven't seen a mention of this event. I hope to learn what it was that we saw, or at least hear accounts from other witnesses.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

We also noticed the large amount of military and/or commercial air traffic in the area at the time. We are relatively close to several military installations, and not far off from at least three international airports, so large amounts of air traffic are not unusual. Suddenly, upon gazing up into the sky at one point, I noticed two conventional aircraft that appeared to be flying in the same direction relatively close together, almost as if flying in formation. I advised my friend of this, who noted it as well. What we both also noted, however, that just off the right - tail of the aircraft on the right, matching its speed, was a solid white light - almost an orb. It was bright and appeared almost as if a star was moving accross the sky. It appeared to be following the jet on the right. The jet on the left began moving in a more norternly direction while the jet on the right continued moving more on a due east track. The white light appeared to follow the jet on the right for an additional brief period of time. Eventually, the white light appeared to track on an even more easternly direction, thus no longer following the plane. We watched this white as it continued all the way out into the distance where it was no longer visible. That strange thing is that this light had no strobes or flashing lights or anything you would expect to be on a normal aircraft. It was simply a steady white light. Very odd. And the fact that it was so close to a larger jet aircraft was even more odd. I wish I had thermal imaging gear or even a pair of standard binoculars so that I could have made out the aircrafts structure. For all I know, it was a plane. It did not take any actions or manuvers that were out of this world. It did not change color or shape. It just simply moved at roughly the same speed as two aircraft which were lighted in such a way that one could identify ! them as aircraft.

This comet like tail made a large arc towards the ground and disappeared long before it would have hit the ground. It should be noted that when the light became a comet like tail, it accelerated to what I would estimate, based on seeing high altitude airlines flying at what I assume is 500 mph, to be moving at 4000+ mph. I think this may have been a decaying satelite but the white light especially the super white light with the tunnel effect has me wondering.",2004-06-04T00:00:00,42.729672473867595,-87.82800069686411

My husband was sitting in the window seat and I was sitting in the aisle seat (no one in between) on the left side of the plane in row 6 or 7 (before the wing).  I saw what looked like two dark brown sticks or poles sticking out of the clouds on a 45% angle (again I am not exact).  I was so stunned to see something sticking out of the clouds that I sat there running all the different things it could be through my mind (and coming up with nothing).  I finally said to my husband what is that - he tried to see what I was seeing and blocked my vision for a moment or two.  I then heard my daughter in the seat in front of me say, what is that?  By the time my husband moved out of the way, all I could see was a dark line like a shadow moving or gliding over the clouds away from the plane until we couldn't see it anymore because of the wing.

Also, the lights were moving too slow to be meteorite(less than mach 3 for sure).  As it was moving, I noticed a trail of smaller lights launching from the cluster, but in the opposite direction.

I kept thinking about that event.

It was totally silent and so close I could have hit it with a rock. I cannot remember the exact date, it was late August or early September around 1985. The date can be correlated to a day when a Russian satellite fell from orbit and crashed in Lake Superior. That was the explanation that was given by the radio station in North Bay the next morning, as the reason for the lights that were seen and reported by multiple people from the previous night.  My brother-in-law and I had a much closer encounter with this craft. Hunting season had begun and in deference to the hunter's, we would go riding our ATV's late at night. We had been riding about three hours this night on trails in the Almaguin Highlands, about 20 miles south of North Bay, Ontario. This is Crown land and as such there are no buildings of any kind for many miles. We stopped on a ridge and shut off our machines (altitude 1400' - we checked on a topographical map on our return) for a ""pee"" break. It was a beautiful, clear starry night with not a whisper of wind. We could see from the ridge the darkness that represented Lake Nippising and the lights of North Bay, some twenty miles distant. While taking our break I could hear a dog barking, perhaps five miles away in the valley below. I only mention that to emphasize how incredibly quiet it was where we stood. My brother-in-law asks me, ""Did you see that flash of light?"" I replied that it must be the red flashing light from the radio tower in North Bay. Twenty seconds later he asks again, ""Did you see that flash of light?"" I turned to my left to face him and over the ridge top behind us, about twenty-five feet above the trees, came this craft with glowing lights on it's edge, the lights going yellow, red, orange, blue, green along the length of the craft. My brother-in-law saw my face and turned to see it as well. It was approximately 100 feet in length. It moved slowly from our left to right, following the ridge line and staying twenty feet above the trees. Suddenly it gave off a flash of light, like a camera flash, only it lit up the entire area around us. I could clearly see every tree, bush and rock, when moments before it had been totally dark. The craft and the flash made absolutely no sound. It was so close I could have easily thrown a rock and hit it. I whispered to Ron, ""Do you see it?"", not believing my eyes, but also not wanting to be heard by it. I'm not kidding - it was that quiet, so much so that I was afraid to raise my voice. It kept moving to the right and let off another flash. The brightness was ruining my ability to distinguish any features other than the glowing lights and general shape, much the same way a flashbulb causes you to see spots before your eyes. It started to drop away, following the contours of the land, staying the same distance above the trees. As it passed us to the right, the 30 - 40 foot pine trees in front of us, started blowing about madly, buffeted by the strong winds generated as the craft passed, much the same as the wake of a boat hits the shoreline. As it dropped out of view, the winds calmed and everything returned to the stillness of before. In my mind I thought, ""You can't fool mother nature!"" What I mean by that is, I may not believe what I'm seeing, but the violent wind proved that something huge had just passed by, causing the disturbance. We took compass headings for the next ten minutes, as we watched the craft move down the valley. It flashed the bright light approx. every twenty seconds, lighting up acres of land below it. I was in the Canadian Air Force for two years, working around jets and helicopters and there is nothing, other than a glider, that can fly without making a sound. Even then you would probably hear the wind pass over the wings. I would like to say I was brave and unmoved by this event, but the truth is, it was so unearthly that my first instinct was to want to hide under a rock. I was terrified and it took me twenty minutes to calm down enough to get back on the ATV and ride. The next morning there were multiple reports to the local radio station, from people claiming to have seen a UFO. The explanation was that it was the Soviet satellite crashing into Lake Superior. The craft we saw was flying, not crashing and Lake Superior was approx. 600 miles west of where we were. I've told this story to many people over the years, mostly met with skepticism. After reading many of the sightings on your site, I felt compelled to contribute my story.",2004-07-08T00:00:00,46.32244210526316,-79.52831520467836

But, as it got closer we noticed it hadn't been blinking nor did it make a sound (we had seen dozens of planes that night and this was not one).  When it reached us, moving maybe 10 miles an hour (jogging pace) we could see a shape but no real body to it, kind of like a shadow but you could not see through it at all but yet you couldn't see it, if that makes any sense? We noticed it seemed to be following the streets we lived on hovering just above the treetops. Being a football fan I can better measure distance in yardage, and I would say that the craft was flying no more then sixty yards above us and it had a triangle shape that was maybe fifty yards from point to point to point and each point was lit with a large bright white circle but it didn't hurt at all to look at them. The three of us walked and jumped under it yelling and waving at it as it turned down my street.  I ran to my house and woke my mother who came out to see it as it slowly drifted upwards and further down the street until it reached a certain hight, then took off faster then anything I have seen since, making crazy zig zags as it disapeared into the sky. The strange thing about the whole thing is that none of us were frightened of this object.  Infact I had the impression it was playing with us... ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Wayne Indiana and in Dayton Ohio on the same night in 1987 I was working on a master's degree in music ((deleted)) at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  I was going home to Dayton, Ohio for the week-end so it was probably a Friday. I am not sure of the date-it was cold outside and I think in late fall when this occurred.  I wish I had written down the date. I had traveled the same route at least 50 times since I was married and tried to get back to Dayton every other week-end.  I was coming out of Ft. Wayne around midnight on Rt. 30 (33?).  There is a long stretch there where there is a McDonalds.  Up ahead of me I saw a huge bright white light that was about the height of lights at a football stadium.  I wondered what it could be since I had never seen it before traveling this route.  It came closer and closer moving slowly.  I pulled off of the road into the McDonald's parking lot and got out of my van and stood watching it.  It appeared to be very large with the white light on the front and it had a green, a red and a purple light on the body of it.  It was large and flew slow and silently.  I know this sounds weird but I could not make out the shape of the craft even as close as I was to it.  I could only see the lights and from the spacing of the lights I knew it was very large.  It flew slowly towards Ft. Wayne and then disappeared out of sight.  I looked all the way back to Dayton that night hoping to see another but did not. My husband and I owned a Book Store in Dayton called Aragon Bookshop.  I went with my husband the next day to work in the store.  Around noon a woman came into the bookstore and asked excitedly if we had a UFO section of books.  I said yes and got up to show her where the books were.  I asked her if she was interested in UFOs and she said ""not until last night.""  I asked her what had sparked her interested the night before.  She said that her and a friend had seen a lot of UFO's late at night.  She said that they were driving near Wright State University when they saw them.  When I asked where she said they were near where all the construction was going on near Colonel Glenn Highway.  She said her and her friend observed them for several hours.  She said that they were afraid to leave to go tell someone as they thoug ht they might not be there when they came back.  She said they had a bright white light on the front and that they had a green, a red and a purple light on them.  She said they would hover and move slowly and then they would zoom off and disappear out of sight traveling at a high rate of speed.  She said there were a lot of them.  She said that the next day she called her relative who was a Colonel at Wright Patterson Air Force Base which is close by where she saw the UFOs'  She described the crafts and he said that there was nothing that the military had that could do what these UFOs did as she described it to him. I relayed my sighting to her of the night before in Ft. Wayne, Indiana.  We marveled at the coincidence of seeing the same type of craft in 2 distant locations on the same night. She bought some UFO books and left.  I often wished I had gotten her name and address so that I could contact her again. One other little tidbit of information: When I was 19 years old in 1967 and attending Wright State University I lived off of Linden Ave. with a nice lady who let me stay there in exchange for taking care of her children from time to time.  There was a little store on Linden Ave. that I frequented to buy food, stamps and etc.  There was a young man who worked there who I became friendly with.  One time he asked me if I would like to go see the aliens that were at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  He said that his father was a higher up in the military there(I think he said a Colonel) and that his father had taken him to see them before since he had a security clearance to where they were being kept.  he said he could get me in if I wanted to see them.  I was scared to go and declined his offer.  I have regretted that many times since then. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-07-08T00:00:00,41.09336991071429,-85.1455725

My friend and I were sitting in her van in the left hand turn lane going from Northbound Beach Blvd. to Westbound Ellis Ave. waiting for the light to turn green.  It was a clear day with no clouds in the sky, very bright, around 2:00 pm.  I looked up in the sky to watch a bird fly across the street from my left (East) to my right (West), when I saw two objects high in the sky to the Northwest.  They appeared to be giant balls of burning magnesium so bright that they made the rest of the sky seem suddenly dark.  I would approximate their size as about the size of my house, but judging size in the sky is tricky to say the least. I would place their location over Terry Park in Huntington Beach, approximately a half mile above sea level.  They remained motionless in position for about 30 seconds, the larger one on the left, and the smaller one on the right. Then I saw 2 helicopters rise toward them, a Huntington Beach Police Department helicopter and an Orange County News helicopter.  My friend and I sat through the left hand turn light watching this, and I believe there were many people who witnessed this because no one honked at us to go when the light changed.  I knew the light had changed because I could see in my peripherial vision the cars going Eastbound on Ellis and Southbound on Beach who would not have seen the objects because they were behind those cars.  This is why I believe the sighting lasted one to two minutes, but I was so amazed by the objects that it seemed like an hour to me.  The helicopters got approximately halfway to the objects, then the objects suddenly moved horizontally to the North and were gone in less than a second.  As soon as I got home I called the Huntington Beach Police Station and asked what the helicopter had seen.  I was told that no helicopter had been sent up that day.  I called OCN (the news network) and asked what their helicopter had seen.  I was told that their helicopters had not been over Huntington Beach that day.  I asked my friend (now ex friend) to relate the story a few days later, and she denied having seen them or the helicopters, even though she was driving and sat through the turn signal to watch them.

I could see the blinking navigation lights and just hear the engine noise faintly.

It moved in total silence for a bit, then executed several high speed zig zags across the sky. Hard to tell how far but way beyond the capabilites of any aircraft I know. It then proceeded at the same slow pace as before briefly before accelerating extremely fast up into the sky while dimming to total black. I caught one or two glimpses as it shot up into the sky as it cut off the light of a couple of stars. Then I lost it.

The craft was large and I thought to myself it couldn't be as close as it looks - it was just because of it's large size that it looked so close.  It was a silver metallic object with lights underneath.  It hovered for about 1/2 hour or so until the sun started to come up.  At that time, it took off swiftly at an angle and within seconds disappeared.  Later that summer, while at the beach one night with friends, we spotted three mysterious lights in the sky that seemed to be following us and then in an instant they too took off at an angle and disappeared.

Yes we did!  Why my parents never reported it, I don't know or whether they ever mentioned it to anyone else, I don't know.

It ""shot"" 3 bursts of light at our car, hitting it with loud booms but no feelin It was a warm summer evening.  In Wisconsin the sky stays light until quite latein the summertime.  My mother was driving our Volkswagen bug, with 3 of my sisters (in their late teens and early twenties, also in the car.  I was still small enough to fit into the ""way-back"" that ""Bugs"" still had in those days.  We were driving from Madison to our home in Stoughton, along Highway 51.  Just outside of Stoughton there was a National Guard armory on the left, then a big bend in the road, with a gravel pit on the left.  As we drove past the gravel pit, we saw a huge, very bright light among the hills of gravel.  It was about the size of a small house.  The light was white and very, very bright, but it did not illuminate the surrounding area or make much of a glow in the sky.  We were all in awe and my mother slowed the car almost to a halt as we starred at the light.  Then, as we watched, the light ""shot"" at us, three balls of light in quick succession.  As each one hit the front of the car, we heard it make a boom sound on impact.  The car jerked with each impact, but I later learned from my mother that there actually was no impact, the jerks were her frightened reaction to the sight and sound of the impacts.  Although the ""shots"" made a big noise as they hit our car, they did not jerk the car at all!  My mother sped away and we drove the rest of the way, (only 1-2 miles) into Stoughton.  We stopped at a gas station that was on the right side of the road in those days, almost right accross from the A&W root beer stand.  We all scrambled out and looked at the car.  There were no marks of any kind, nothing to show that it had been hit by those balls of light.  We were all shaking and drove home.  We told my father and the rest of the family there what had happened.  To the best of my knowledge, no one ever reported the incident to the police or anyone.  It was simply too fantastic.  No one would have believed it.  I have always been very sorry that my parents did not alert the authorities at once.  Perhaps someone else could have seen it too.  Throughout the years since then, my sisters and I will recount those events to each other from time to time; just to make sure it isn't something we dreamed.  My mother too(now dead), always remembered it just the way I have recorded it here.  It was not, strickly speaking, a UFO.  It did not fly when we saw it.  But, all these years later (it is now October 2004), I still have no better understanding of what it was then we had at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,42.9252,-89.1562

Only two people out of four actually viewed the object, as the other two were not in a good spot to see it.

All I can say is that I am not a person who makes things up. I think I am a very careful observer and I can only tell you what I saw.  On Sunday, Sept. 12 I went out on my porch to look at the sky. It was about 8:00 P.M.. My 2nd floor apartment faces Southeast. I looked to my right (Southwest) and saw a bright, large, white light approaching at low altitude. This looked very similar to the object I reported on the 7th. Only this time the object appeared much lower in the sky. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I would estimate the object was only 1000 feet up or so. This time I did not hesitate. I ran inside and grabbed my pair of 7 X 35 binoculors. As I came back out the object was just beginning to pass over my head. It was moving in a straight Southwest to Northwest direction. I estimate the speed at somewhere between 100-150 MPH. Looking at the object did not change much. It still appeared to be a solid ball of white light. I tried to stabilize the binoculars on one of the porch columns to get a steady view. At one time I thought I might have seen a small dark (almost black) triangle leading this light, but I am not completely sure of this. It made absolutely no sound whatsover. It passed by me and continued it's steady course. As it got to the Northeast it took on a reddish hue. I thought this might be from haze. It then dimmed and seemed to blink out. I couldn't help but think it was turning off it's lights as it would be approaching Bradley Airport just north of Hartford. I looked carefully, at no time were there any other lights other than the one solid white light. This object appeared the same from every perspective. It was a ball of light.  About one minute later a small private plane flew by travelling at about the same altitude and direction. However this small plane was a greater distance away from me. I could hear the small plane clearly and also see directional lights as well. The small plane was travelling about the same speed as the object. I watched the small plane as it flew off in the Northeast. It never dimmed and I could see it's lights until it flew over the treeline in the distance. So much for the haze.  Maybe 5 minutes later I saw a bright white light coming from the Northeast. I thought the object might be returning. But looking with binoculars I could see 2 small white lights in the center, and the red and green directional lights on the wings. This was an airliner which I see many of every night. One thing occured to me. As this airliner flew by I could no longer see the white lights on the front. I could also hear it clearly and it was at a much higher altitude than the object I observed.",2004-09-29T00:00:00,41.8394,-73.1255

As I crossed the McCullough Bridge heading north on hwy 101, I happened to look to the North East and spotted a low flying object which seemed to be coming from the Haynes inlet area traveling in a South westerly direction. It was brightly lit with many flashing lights. I thought it must be a low flying plane of some sort or even a helicopter but it just didn't look quite right. It was flying slow and low over an area of homes just above the tree line. I than lost site of it as I continued North. I noticed it again as I passed Marine Lane on my right, which leads up to an area of nice homes. It was coming back into view as it passed over the tree covered hill heading for the dunes and ocean. As I was passing Spruce road (approx. 400 feet North of Marine Lane on the left) it emerged and passed over the highway directly over my car. A strange shape, maybe wedge shaped? It was dark but I could see a large circular shape with spokes on the bottom of it. It wasn't a helicopter for sure, and if it was a plane, it was not like any I have seen. It was flying very slow and it was quiet, no sound. I am reluctant to talk about this because I would think many people would have seen it - it was so visible, but there have been no reports of anything strange. It was very near the North Bend Airport, yet it was not in any flight path to land, it was headed toward the ocean. If anyone else saw this, please post it.

The sky was finally clear after the rain and overcast for the most part of the weekend.  I was outside of my girlfriends parents’ house having a cigarette and enjoying the peacefulness of the evening before heading off to bed.   After leaving the side-door of their house, I turned North (left) to go to the back yard.  Before I got all the way into the back yard, I paused and lit my smoke.  I then went to the fire pit (about 15 steps from door) and sat down on a bench.  I noticed that there were an extraordinary amount of stars in the sky and I couldn’t help but look, however, I could not get the glare from a near by streetlight out of my eyes so I went and stood in the shadow of a big willow tree directly behind the house to gain a better view. It only took about 30 seconds of me being in the shadows until I seen this thing.   I was standing with my body facing North, North-West.  From where I was standing, to my left was a wooden fence found in most residential areas and to my right was a large willow tree.  Now, also from where I was, I could not see the horizon.  I could see the roof of the neighbors 2 car garage directly in front of me, behind the fence, and a row of 4-5, 50 foot Pine trees in the neighbors yard across the alley to the north. Now, as I was looking up, out of the north I heard a whooshing sound like a light breeze going through the tops of the trees or light winds blowing through taller grass.  I turned my head right and to my astonishment I seen flying from behind the trees a black triangle with 3 dimly lit orange lights on the base of it.  It moved from North to South West.  It did not make any noise.  I could see this was a 3-Dimentional object as it flew across the sky because the tail of the triangle looked like it had depth, it had what looked like columns that extended up from the base (at different angles to create X's or Diamonds) to a lip and what I would think is another surface (the top of the craft).  As it flew from my right to left I could not see depth in the 'nose' as it was too dark and I feel the color of the craft may have blended with the night sky but I feel it could have depth as well.  As it was in front of me, I could make out a distinct triangular shape by the light reflecting off the bottom of the craft from either the lights on the ground or the 3 orange lights on its base.  As it moved farther to my left, that’s when I could make out the tail-end and suggest that it is, in fact, 3-D.  The triangle flew like an arrow head with a point in the front. It took about 10 seconds to cover what I would estimate to be about 150KM of sky. I could only see it as it came out from behind the trees until I lost it in front of the neighbor’s house.  I wanted to go to the front and keep an eye on it but I was petrified, literally scared stiff.  I could not move. The craft seemed to be darker in color, possibly a dark grey/black, or a charcoal color but stood out from the color of the clear night sky once a person got a bead on it. I would think it was the size of an average house but am not sure as it was some distance away (the tail-end suggested the size of a Greyhound bus).   It also seemed to be distinctly blurry or hazy compared to the sky when it was moving.  I had to ‘catch-up’ to it with my eyes at least 2 times. At an arms length away, it was about the size of a book of matches and quite similar looking if you were to look at one moving from right to left at an arms length. I have made a few sketches for memory but it was quite an interesting experience I do not suspect I will forget this night for a long, long time.",2004-09-29T00:00:00,54.150176470588235,-113.86855294117646

I was returning with my two sons, ages 8 and 5, from Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument shortly after dark when I stopped for gas at Why, Arizona. Through my windshield while fueling I noticed an extremely bright, gold ""star"" at about 45 degrees to the slight northwest. I exclaimed ""Hello..."" and before I could point it out to my boys, it winked out. I am aware that the area to the north and west is the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range, so I attributed it to that. We then began on our way to Tucson east on AZ rt 86 through the Tohono O'Odahm reservation. About 10 miles down the road from Why, my oldest son, riding in the passenger seat, excitedly exclaimed that he saw it, as did my youngest from the back seat. As I turned to look up and out the front right (south), I also caught just a glimpse before it again disappeared. This was a crystal clear desert night, so it was not obscured by clouds, nor was it by the mountains as it was again at about 45 degrees. They asked me if it was a ufo. I said yes, as it certainly was flying and unidentified, either ours or ""Theirs"". To tickle their fancy, you know. It gets better. A moment later, there now appeared four bright gold ""stars"" on a 45 degree diagonal, top right, bottom left, and equally spaced, at the same position. The angle of my view made it difficult for me to see them without leaning forward. I was now rather nervous and wished only to get back to the city lights, so I continued without stopping. My son then informed me that the objects began to ""wink out"" one by one. This action repeated itself two more times, with me viewing only sporadicly. This was diificult at seventy mph if I wished not to drive off the road! We were all a little ""creeped"" by this, and it was only when I was satisfied that this would be only an encounter of the ""first kind"", that I stopped, as planned, to view the magnificent milky way and star field indigenous to the area, as we are from the brightly lit mid- Atlantic region...

They moved so smoothly and quickly through the sky it was amazing and flashed the whole time.  I know dying stars tend to flicker and sometimes seemed to be shooting stars but after every movement, north or south, they would return to their original position over the city.  From the time of this sighting and the location being the over Manhattan on the last day of the RNC, it is my guess that this was not alien but US military related in origin.  Whatever their origin, this was an amazing display of aviation.  I eventually became bored and went to bed with the objects still doing their thing in the night sky.  I don't drink or do any drugs so this was seen with amazinglly clear suprised eyes.  One of the coolest things I have ever witnessed.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,40.7696,-74.0204

On two occasions, I've sighted a similar object in the same general area that exhibited similar flight characteristics. For the sake of brevity, I'm only describing the most recent incident here. In the month of October 2004, I was traveling west on I-40 near Pottsville, AR at approximately 2000hrs when I noticed a white, non-blinking light west of my location at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. The light was moving from south to north. I estimated its speed as comparable to a small fixed-wing aircraft. As, I neared the eastern city limits of Russellville, I realized that the object was directly over the eastern part of Russellville at an approximate altitude of 1500 ft. At this time, I reasoned that the object was the landing light of a small aircraft inbound to the Russellville municipal airport. However, an actual small aircraft moving north to south passed beneath the light and continued to descend towards the airport. I estimate the closest distance between the object and the aircraft to be less than 1000 feet as the two passed. The object continued to move to the north until it was approximately 1/2-3/4 mile north of I-40, at which time it made a slow turn towards the south and followed its original path back the way it had came across I-40. As I neared Russellville, I crossed beneath the object's flight path. At this point, the object was directly south of my location. I exited I-40 at exit 82 and stopped at a gas station at the top of the exit ramp to attempt a better observation of the object. Unfortuntately, by this time the object had moved well to the south and was difficult to observe. While standing in the gas station parking lot, I was able to note that the object was indeed moving to the south and was not a star or planet. I lost sight of the object shortly after that.

A 747 was flying near by, leaving a long contrail and heading south parallel to the UFO. The UFO didn’t make any sound as it passed over. The UFO was round and bright and gleamed like the suns rays were bouncing off of it. As it flew over I could see that some type of white mass was protruding from all around the UFO in a clockwise position at a very slow spin compared to its speed. The UFO was too high to determine if it was shedding the white material or not. It was hard to believe what I saw until I got my October issue of UFO magazine a few days after the sighting.

I work at Meadowood Mall and went out to my car in the west parking lot. When I got into my car and looked west, I noticed a thick, white irregular rope-like plume in the sky. It was low in the sky and I thought it might be a stunt plane spewing out a trail. It was moving west to east about a half mile away maybe, and to the north of my position. It move slowly. As it approached closer going towards the Reno airport it was obviously not the smoke coming out of a plane, but two strange objects connected by this snake-like white plume. The substance was not whispy like smoke, but thick and shiny white. This object is a little hard to describe. The best I can explain the the rope-like substance is if a can of shaving cream was shot into a basin of water and then ""froze"". The object became more vertical, with an ovoid object on top that appeared to be moving a little back and forth as if creating the plume, with the plume in the middle and an orb-like object on the bottom. One of the dock people was dumping garbage in a big dumpster in the parking lot and I got out of my car and brought his attention to it. We both watched and commented on the sheer strangeness of the thing. The object was passing north of us now, and a couple of customers in the parking lot were noticing it too. As the thing headed east, the plume began to tighten up, and become more ""straight"". I decided to get a couple of employees to come out after watching it for about 10 minutes. When they came outside, the object had attained a higher altitude and was sitting south of the airport close to Rattlesnake Mountain. As we all continued to watch it, an older woman stopped her car by us and asked ""what is that thing?"" We said it looked like a ufo. She smiled and drove on. By this time I was MIA at the store, so I had to go back inside. I took every opportunity to go back outside  and observe the object, which had now turned into a white orb. At 3:30 pm I took my hour lunch, and watched the object for an hour with a friend of mine who popped into work to see me. It moved west of its position south of the airport and closer to us. It appeared to change shape sometimes from an orb to a rod, then back into an orb in a blink of an eye. We saw four or five planes fly near or over the object. They appeared to be taking an interest in the object. At 4:25 or so I had to go back inside. A couple of young guys had stopped thier truck near us and asked what it was we were looking at. As I walked back to the store they were still looking at it. The next day more people at work said they had seen the strange thing also. It is now 12/11/04 and once again I went to my car around 3:15 pm to take a break and saw another white orb-like object to the north east moving south west towards my position. It moved in a slightly zig-zag way, and sometimes appeared to have a small tail. It looked like it was swimming through the air. It stopped and headed north east then, getting smaller and smaller until it was out of sight. It was a warm still day with few clouds and good visibility. Well, it is after this sighting that I decided to put my two cents in. To be fair, I have had several sightings of these things in Sparks where I live. My unit is almost directly above the flght paths of the commercial airlines. These sightings always happen on clear still days. What they are is anyone's guess, but they seem intelligent and ""alive"" When people ask me why I have had sightings and they have not, my advise is ""look up""!",2004-12-14T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

I said that isn't far enough away to be a shooting star and you can hear the damn thing.  As it got close we could immediately see it in several pieces spreading out.  We about 1/8 to a 1/4 mile away we watched a trasformer blow up into pieces.  Then seconds later we heard a distant crash noise.  We went home and told our friends and family.  We were listened to -politely, but not taken seriously because the MIR had broken up at the same time and landed in water.  Well, Wes and I believe that there is more to the MIR then meets the eye, and that more than one piece came down, multiple pieces came down.  We went back and looked around the desert where we thought the bigger piece(s) came down.  It was like looking for a needle in the hay stack.  As a matter of fact we figured it had fallen within a mile and a half from Weaver's Needle (a rock formation were gold is suppose to be hidden long ago).

I was about 12 or 13 years old at the time, and my friend was travelling with me, my mother and her boyfriend back from town.  He was staying over at my house that night celebrating our birthdays and being a warm night, decided to sleep outside in the camper.  Being in a rather darkened area, travelling down route 209 from Parrsboro to Kirkhill, I regularily star gazed.  It was an extremely clear night with the sky lit up with stars.  I focused on approximately 8 - 12 objects in the air, about the distance of a plane but no flashing lights.  They were just lit objects in the air.  They travelled in and out of formation quite a bit, travelling much faster than any plane I had ever seen.  We watched them all the way home for approx. 3 miles.  Once arriving home, we never really thought about them again and went into the house.  We then shortly went outside to the camper, and with the power connection began playing nintendo.  We were concentrating on the game and talking when we noticed what seemed to be a ""silent"" engine get louder and louder (I say silent because it got louder so gradually that it was hardly noticable).  We looked outside at one point, towards the north above the ""mountain"" side.  Being such a clear night, we could see a shape in the sky that blacked out the stars around it, above the trees.  It seems almost surreal as when we were looking, it was as if it sensed us and backed over the trees and mountain.  This happened several times over the next hour.  We weren't really afraid, more intrigued.  At one point we fell asleep, not knowing if it happened again throughout the night.  I just remember it being very large, blocking out starlight, (10-15 meters wide, 75-100 meters long), and having such a strange engine sound to almost not have a sound.  Just wanted to share one of my experiences in this area. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))",2004-06-18T00:00:00,45.3603,-64.3192

I at spotting one at the 10 o'clock sky position through the right-side passanger window.I add this as enhanced ESP during UFO activity is often experienced,as well.  Leo suggested we visit a nearby ranch if we wished,for odd sky events had often been seen there many times,so we went. Knowing that ETs for some reason found punnish humor funny, I noted with interest that we spotted an ""erratic"" star at 10 PM at the 11 o'clock position in the sky,not out of the right-side window,but the left. Then from lower left in the sky a softly glowing orb was seen moving toward the ""erratic"" star in a jerky stop and go way. It made a 90 degree turn and merged with the other. A bit later it came out again, moving from our left to right until it stopped directly in front of us at an 11 o'clock sky position as seen through the windshield It made another 90 degree turn and hovered directly above us over the open moon roof for about a minute or so,then continued on in a straight line till out of sight. Was not a satellite that moves in an arc, nor jerkily unless inebriated.  The whole event took about 10 to 15 minutes,after which,I looked for the Mars/Venus/Jupiter alignment scheduled that night so not to be accussed of mistaking it for a UFO. It was over our right shoulders to the rear. Opposite to where the sighting had taken place.  It was probably what one would call a minor sighting today, but I heard you say you'd be interested in older reports when on with Noory last. Both my friend and I had earlier sightings.

I was surprised to see a completely separate, smaller metallic aircraft positioned just under the commercial jet at the rear section.   I have never seen any other aircraft with this craft's design.  Its design revealed an obviously high level of precision, with no visible windows, and some sort of short, swept back wingspan.

One thing to keep in mind is, the airport we live next to is south of us, and the aircraft must fly low to land or takeoff. For the airport is so small. And this craft must have been at least 2000 feet in the air. It went behind small clouds, and it soon disappeared. I know alot about aircraft, and the distance it took for the craft to get as high as it did, is most almost impossible if not dangerous for the crew and passengers. The craft made small puffs of smoke every 15 seconds or so. Airplanes leave longer trails. Also, dogs won't bark at airplanes high in the air. Then why did they when this thing flew over.

We were on our way to the pub. We had been walking North on MacKenzie Street and made for the steps between the Connaught Building and the United States Embassy. As I was walking down the steps, I noticed what looked like a hot air balloon in the sky straight ahead of us, i.e. looking East and down George Street. (Note: it is quite common to see hot air balloons over the Ottawa sky. It would be unusual to see them at that time of day however. They usually appear around 6:00 or 6:30 p.m.)  When I glanced back at it a few seconds later – now having crossed Sussex Drive and walking on the North sidewalk of George St., I noticed the object’s strange behaviour: changing shape, which a hot air balloon does not do.  I tried to get (name withheld) to check it out but by the time I got him to look up, it had disappeared from view behind some buildings. I then figured out why its shape was changing: it was a saucer-like object that was slowly turning on its side, tipping one way then returning to an upright position only to tip on its other side. It was possibly 10 to 20 meters in diameter and perhaps 3-5 meters in height. It was red and dull-grey steel. I think the centre dome-part was red and the rest of it was dull-grey. When I first saw the object, it was about 500-600 meters away and at an altitude of about 150-200 meters. It made no noise, had no blinking lights and did not leave any type of trail in the sky.  When we rounded the corner of Williams Street, we both saw the object in the sky moving due North at a relatively low speed that I would estimate to be between 50-70 km/h. BY then it was about 1 kilometer away.

Knowing that this might be a little late to report, but I never really thought about reporting it. Last fall I was with a friend of mine who works at Goddard Space Center. He and his supervisor were giving a seminar on LIDAR, and how it is used to record meteorological data. They brought with them a trailer that houses the LIDAR, among other equipment.  The next evening my friend invited me to see the trailer. He hooked up an infrared camera located at the rear of the trailer. We were able to observe the density of clouds with the camera that was connected to a black and white monitor inside. The sky was generally clear with a few high cirrus clouds.  As my friend was working, I was watching the monitor. I began to see small points of light zip through the field of view. I told him to take a look, but he said I was just seeing things. Only after he happened to see one of these points of light did he believe me.  We watched for more points for several minutes on the monitor, and more came into view. Whatever we were seeing was going in a perfectly straight line from upper left to lower right. After we saw several more of these, we came to a concensus that what we were seeing were nothing more than satellites in orbit.  A few moments had passed and we both looked at the monitor, and observed another point of light. However, this one came about halfway into the field of view, paused, and went back into the direction from which it came. My friend and I both looked at each other, kind of nervously laughed, and said to each other, ""I did NOT just see that!""  My friend put a tape into the VCR which was connected to the monitor, but unfortunately, it was a time-lapse tape. We watched for another hour or so, and more points of light came into view, but no other point made a retrograde motion like the one mentioned.  Satellites do not retrograde, and while I thought that this might be a bird, I remember that ALL of these objects came from the exact same direction. I would consent to a return e-mail or phone call.

One thing to keep in mind is, the airport we live next to is south of us, and the aircraft must fly low to land or takeoff. For the airport is so small. And this craft must have been at least 2000 feet in the air. It went behind small clouds, and it soon disappeared. I know alot about aircraft, and the distance it took for the craft to get as high as it did, is most almost impossible if not dangerous for the crew and passengers. Also, dogs won't bark at airplanes high int he air. Then why did they when this thing flew over. THEY WENT CRAZY. Please e-mail me if there has been anything else like this. Thank You.

I slowed my truck and the object passed just behind me making no discernable noise.

We were driving at the time, making it difficult to determine speed of the lights. Never the less, they moved faster than commercial aircraft viewed at similar distances.

It looked like it was moving higher and getting smaller.  I ran to get my video camera.

I thought it was moving, but thought also that it could be because of the airplane taking off...they were pretty close. As the plane left sight, I noticed that this little white dot was still moving.  As I watched it heading south (in my direction), this little non blinking light lit up into this huge red light.  As it still was heading south, this red light split into two red lights...and from the second red light, it split again...totaling 3 red lights. These lights did not twinkle or have any glare. As I watched and called for everyone to come out to see...these 3 red lights split again becoming 6. Each one of the 6 had red and white lights moving in a circular pattern...and not always consistant. We all (5 adults, one child) watched as these lights cruised around the valley and I noticed that my neighbor was outside and went over and I showed them to her and watched them with her for about 5 minutes. Heading west to Slide mountain area, then south, then east, Virginia City area and Fallon area. At one point there was a HUGE red glow over my neighbors house. We couldn't tell how large or how high it was because the house hid part of it. As I went to go get my camera...it disappered.  From across the street, what we could see was approximatley as wide as a chimney would be.  So it makes me wonder how big it really was.  My husband was watching it through a small telescope and said it wasn't just one large light, but many lights.....and big! He could see the lights and a slight outline of the craft.  We continued to watch the others going all over the sky. I was trying to take a picture, but was having a difficult time trying to focus on any of the lights.  Out of the six frames I took, I did manage to get one with the red glow.  The show/event lasted for approximatley 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The last ones that we seen were heading east.  For the next two days, we also had seen other objects in the sky...mostly in the daylight.  The main one was the following day about 13:00.  Looking south, I was watching a grocery bag that was floating across the sky and as I watched it, something behind it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was one of those high flying planes, but it did not move...it was stationary.  The color was non-reflective and about the same color as a nickle...more dark gray than glowing silver, longated or cigar shape. I watched it for approx 5 min, then went to grab the binoculars and turned around...and it was gone.  Busy skies! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I noticed an airliner approaching from west to east, and as it neared the area by the lights, they turned a reddish color and appeared to fade much like the smaller light had done.

I work as a litigation paralegal for a law firm on the east side of the upper floors of the Bank of America Tower in downtown Seattle.

The objects appeared to be either directly over the Cascade Range or to the east of the Cascade Range. These three objects were cigar-shaped and hovered in a straight line, side by side like three dashes, and remained in that position for several minutes.  I did not detect any movement from the objects, and I asked two other paralegals to come look. None of us had a camera or camcorder. We located a pair of binoculars and I was the first to look.  I observed that the objects were gray/silver metallic in nature and I think that I am correct in saying that they were reflecting the sun, and thus appeared bright.  The object on the far right moved upwards slightly, and as it moved in those one or two seconds, it did not gleam.  I suspect it was at such an angle as to not reflect the sunlight.  As it took its new position slightly above and diagonally to the right of the others, a fourth gleaming object came out from behind the object on the far left, and lined up with the other objects.  It looked similar to these dashes:    _ _ _ -  I asked the paralegal with me if she had just seen what had happened.  She said, ""Do you mean that the one on the right blinked and a fourth one came out on the left?""  She took a turn looking with the binoculars. The objects just held the same position.  By now, it was approximately 8:25 a.m.  Although none of us were able to continually watch (I, for one, had a noon filing to prepare for the court), one paralegal and I were able to see these objects in their same pattern until at least 8:40.  With the sun changing position, the reflection disappeared, and it was difficult to see the objects anymore.  I cannot say exactly when the objects were no longer there.

The intervals between blinks was about 3 or 4 seconds. I thought it might be a plane at first (planes and helicopters are always flying above where I live). I was thinking that maybe the blinking was actually a plane headlight and the light was bouncing back from some thick clouds or smog which would give me the illusion that it was a blinking light. But the light never moved the whole time I watched and it was completely quiet and clear outside. No sound of a plane at all. It stayed in the original point I first found it in the entire time. When it stopped blinking I couldn't help but stare intently at the location it had been in. I stared for what was probably 20 seconds at that exact spot. Then, from exactly that point in the sky, I saw the largest, brightest most colorful shooting stars I have ever seen. The trail covered 1/3 of the sky as it shot past and the head of this thing was bright reddish colored and the red color appeared to be lining the sides of the outer edge of the front of the trail. It was stunning. I admit that this blinking light could have been anything and the shooting star could just be a tremendous coincendence.

Sure enought moving at what seemed a slow rate of speed was a light in the night sky (it would have looked like a star if it had not been moving). As the light moved from the northeast to the southwest, another scout shouted look there's another one. Looking to the southwest we saw a second light which appeared to be a copy of the first moving from the southwest to the northeast on a collision couse with the first.  Although they were very far apart and moving slow, over the next 20 to 30 min.s they had come within approximatly an inch of one another.

I ran inside and grabbed binoculars, what I saw was slightly diamond shaped I think (it was blurred a bit) with flashing lights in blue, red, green, yellow, and white. It seemed to be moving back and forth very slowly.I woke up my parents and told them to get outside and look. I said I wanted a witness so they couldn't call me crazy. They both looked and saw what I had seen. I then saw what appeared to be an airplane with the usual red light flashing fly towards the lights. I lost sight of it when I noticed another set of blinking changing lights towards the north. This one was moving towards the west in the direction of the other object. We came inside and 5 minutes later I went back outside and they were gone. I know there is a chance I saw ""weather balloons"" but what I can't account for is how uncomfortable I felt as I watched them. Not scared but just not right.

When I came out of the house for some reason I walked over to the end of the proch (about 5 feet from the door) and out of the corner of my eye I saw this bight object a few hundred feet it appeard in the sky... i thought oh a plane so i turned to look at it because I like seeing planes at night they are kinda neat... but i thought to myself as i saw it out of the corner of my eye... wait somethings not right its not blinking... how planes usually blink diffrent colors on their wings and such... and it was just hovering there... so i turned twards it to look (this is about a span of 10 seconds) and when i turned to look at it about 5 seconds into the stare at it hover it was like it knew i was looking at it... and suddenly it droped straight down behind the hill (there is a hill off in the distance about half a mile and it has trees all over it) i got a little scared at that point because that was just wierd... i knew it couldnt of been a helicopter because they dont move a few hundred feet in half a second straight down unless they are crashing and yet that is still fast at that point... so i turned away for some reason and it poped back up like it was plaing hide and seek with me... i got freaked out and went back in our house... i looked out the front window and it was there again hovering... but once agian when i looked at it... it droped down behind the hill and trees.. i stood there in shock for aboug 5 minutes then all the sudden it quickly poped back up in the air and the strangest thing happend... it grew from a relatively big spot of white to this bright yellow/orange fast flickering oval shape about 20x as big... and as it did that i got this sudden head ache that lasted from when it got big to about 30 seconds after... whic! h when it stoped it just disappeared like vanished in air...i dont know what happened... so i ran to wake up my parents (im at their house) my sister and her boy friend.. we all stood there stareing... they started making jokes i was seeing things then all the sudden about 10 minutes into the state out the window it appeared again.. this time we all saw it.. it did the same thing agian hovered and hid.. but the wierd thing.. this time when it came back it kinda snuck back from behind the hill and hid in the trees... we could see it behind the trees hovering (keep in mind this is about half a mile away) we stood there shocked for a while and it disappeared again... i called the state police and reported it the said another person just reported a similar thing in the same area when i was talking to them... then the odd thing that happend all the sudden it showed up agian but this time this trail showed up behind it kinda like a firework trail looks like as it flys up in the air.. but this trail just stayed there for about 10 seconds then just vanished.. we were really confused at that point... the last time we saw it tonight while stareing my mother and I saw it jet off in a diagonal pattern (before this it was just up and down) and it vanished... we stood there for about 30 minutes after and nothing...  I must admit I am scared as heck... and not much scares me...

We were laying on the hood of my car and I noticed a light moving very slowly across the sky. At first I thought it was a satellite but then I saw a second light moving parrallel with it. I pointed at the lights and asked my girlfiend if she saw them and she said ""What that triangle?"" Thats when I saw the third light following behind forming a triangle. It looked like 3 stars moving about 5 miles per hour but they stayed exactly the same distance apart. We couldn't see the craft, but the stars couldn't been seen within the area of the lights, so it was more like watching a black triangular void with a star at each point slowly moving across the sky.

We got my binoculars and observed it for about 15 more minutes as it got further away.

Appeared just above summit and disappeared above the bottom of the ski run. Time was 21:30 still quite a bit of light in the sky. 21:52 - Camera picked up a white light moving east just over Seymour, I assumed it was a small plane but was unable to see it with either pair of binoculars. I zoomed in with the camera but was unable to see any fuselage behind the light even though it was still fairly light and I should have been able to see something. 22:03 - Camera picked up what appeared to be a similar light approaching  Seymour Mtn. light stopped just above the summit. Unable to see it through binoculars. I zoomed in with the camera and it looked like those other mysterious lights. Object began moving slowly eastward just above mountains in half and hour it was over Indian Arm and at one hour over Heritage Mountain north of Port Moody. I stopped tracking at that point.  02:00 - Was just scanning the sky with the camera, came across what looked like three stars in perfect triangle all equal in size and brightness. I tried zooming in on each of them and they all appeared to look like luminous slowly pulsing pearls, quite pretty actually. They didn't appear to be very far away as they filled the screen right away while the starts around them were hardly magnified at all. I don't know if they were connected to anything as I couldn't see anything except blackness around them. I could see faint stars all around but nothing showed between them. They were about 80 degrees overhead and just slightly to the NW of my location. Was looking at a star chart and Virgo looks somewhat similar but does not appear to be quite the same shape.

I thought you might like to have my illustrated report of a UFO I saw yesterday, October 6, in Greenbelt, MD, 13:02 to 13:06 hours.  At first it was only the white sphere (very clearly outlined), and then , it seemingly suddenly (See below.) 'generated' the strange (seemingly high-speed pulsing at maybe 10-12 Hz) column beneath it.  There was no wobble, pendulation, pitch, or roll that I could detect.  It remained perfectly stable and vertical at all times, while traveling at about ninety degrees to the rather brisk wind.  It made a sharp and substantial change (but a bit less than ninety degrees) in course, suddenly, at about 40% up the vertical component of its course.  It disappeared due to altitude at about 80 degrees elevation in my ~ south-east.  Sphere became brighter as it sped up and with distance, but the electric blue column seemed to keep a constant light level.  Attached are, (1), how it looked before extending the column, and, (2), a version of how the object looked after the electric blue column was extended.  One comment: That drawing of the sphere, alone, does not show the thing nearly as clearly as the actual view I had of it.  The edges were very sharp, and clear as could be -- much sharper than the moon's edge on the clearest of days, because it was so close.  Until the object climbed very high (almost vertically), it was of sufficient angular size as to be seen quite sharply and distinctly.  The white, spherical object had NO COLUMN WHATSOEVER until I took my eyes off it for a moment because a car in the parking lot honked near me, and when I looked back up after only a couple of seconds, the strange column was there!  No camera with me. :(    I'd have gotten some spectacular, sharp  images, otherwise.  At closest, the sphere, per se, subtended at least half a degree (moon or sun angular  size), but as you can see, the electric blue column made its vertically subtended arc larger.  The initial sighting location was a few blocks W-SW of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and would guess the object made its direction change when it was approximately right over the space flight center. Come to think about it, that would possibly have been what it was over when the electric blue tube beneath the object appeared, but I would caution against any undue speculation about what, if anything, it might have been doing over Goddard.  Of one thing I am certain, it did not come from there, because I am quite familiar Goddard.  I waited, overnight, to report this until the drawings were complete, wanting to make the drawings while while what I saw was very fresh on my mind.

I looked up in the sky, the sky was clear,but looked like down 10 miles down by Palos Hills there were a few small clouds and one 150 foot cloud looked as if a hoving disk drove thru the cloud twice on each end side going up or down on the right and left side of this 150 foot looking cloud. The burnout hoving marks on the left and right side of the 150 foot cloud had the same length width and height of 35 feet. Making the hoving burnout look as if it strach the cloud on each side. I seened these marks on this cloud thats why Iwas looking up in the sky. The cloud looked as if the cloud was the length of 150 feet from left to right,by width on 60 feet going up and down,the girth of the cloud seemed to be 270 feet. As I was driving still down 95st looking at the cloud for 15 seconds while glancing up and down trying to not get in no car accident maintaining the 30mph I stoped at a red light glancing back at the cloud I watched a polish waxed silver 1950's looking u.f.o disk smaller than the ufo hoving type cloud streching burnout marks I saw, it looked like a real small version of the 1950's looking u.f.o. it was so far looked to be at least 5 to 10 feet in height and 7 to 13 in length from right to left. When I was at the red light I watch the disk 30 feet from the right side of the cloud driving in a straight line from right to left enter the 150 foot cloud then disappeared in cloud at speeds of 100 miles per hour in the middle of the cloud I seened it in the middle of the cloud still moving in the same 100 mph speeds for 2 seconds still driving left. The light turned green,I continued to drive expecting to see the disk agian,thinking at 100 mph it would of been out of the 150 foot length cloud by now,glanced and stared at the cloud for 15 minutes on the way to work and the disk never cam out of the cloud from the left side as I was driving. This is the 3rd time I seened something,but this is my 1st I reported.

It was 4:00 pm and a clear, sunny day.  My dad (age 61) was across the street from his house with two neighbor girls (both under the age of five years old) and they were looking up in the sky eastward.  My dad had his binoculars and I thought he was looking at a plane or a bird.  As I got out of my car he called for me to come over and take a look at what he was seeing.  There was a jet passing overhead that was quite high in the sky, and I initially thought he was looking at the plane with the two neighbor kids.  He told me to look up toward the plane, and I did, thinking the plane was the object we were focusing on.  In actuality, it wasn't the plane, but what looked like three twinkling stars in the area of the plane.  At first I thought the plane had dropped something and that the three objects were just debris falling from the plane.  But one twinkling object was higher in the sky than the plane.  I looked through my dad's binoculars and the objects were still tiny to my eyes, but they were still twinkling exceptionally bright in the sunny daytime.  To me they each looked like a tumbling shiny polygon of some sort.  They must have been much higher in the sky than the plane because even looking through the binoculars the objects were not more than ""twinkling stars"".  They seemed to be reflecting light, not creating their own luminescence.  My dad said something to the effect that he thought they looked like they were tumbling down to earth, and I agreed.  Shortly thereafter, we lost sight of one object (the plane was now long gone) but the higher of the two remaining objects descended an was now holding it's place in the sky diagonally down from the other object.  Both objects which had seemed to be tumbling stopped in this position for about 45 seconds.  Then one object disappeared under the tree line (my parents live in a neighborhood with tall trees everywhere).   At this point the girls' mother came out and my dad pointed out the twinkling lights to her. A few minutes later the mother took the girls inside for whatever reason.  I lost sight of the objects but my dad said he could still see one.  Since I didn't see anything anymore, I went in and got my photos and came back outside.  My dad said the last object drifted under the tree line.  He told me the objects had started out directly above him minutes before I arrived, then becan travelling slightly to the norteast (more east than north I'd say).  Since I live about a mile east of my parents, I went home hoping to see the objects lower in the sky as there are few trees in my neighborhood.  It took me about 2 minutes to get home, but I saw no more of the twinkling lights.  If I were to learn that these objects were some sort of falling high altitude debris, I could certainly believe that.  However, I would be very surprised to find out they were some kind of common man-made flying machine due to their shape, their incredible brightness in a sunny sky, the odd ""tumbling polygon"" look they had, their strange movement, and the fact that they left no exhaust or trails.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,40.528067407407406,-88.98023259259259

It never moved for about 10 minutes.  All of a sudden, it started to move very slowly, very far up, slower than the planes that passed it.  All of a sudden, it quickly moved down just over top of my car and just hoovered.  The shape was more triangular, but I could tell it wasn't a plane.  It had bright yellowish lights.  I heard no sounds as you do a plane.  It left lightning fast high into the sky and a second craft did the same.  I really had no idea what it was and figured it was just some new military craft.  There were about 4 other cars on intersecting streets, but I did not hear anything else about it.  The next day at midnight, I was out at a charity dinner and on my way home. I saw the same two lights in the sky.  They didn't seem to be moving at all.  Planes passed high above them.  All of a sudden, they both started  moving slowly.

At about 20:30 some of our classmates noticed what appeared at first like a satellite in the sky.  My attention was drawn in the direction of the object and  I began to observe the object through my binoculars thinking as well that we were looking at a satellite. It was travelling at a high rate of speed . At first it did not raise any suspicion because that is what one expects from a satellite. But very soon this changed due to the fact that it was tracing a somewhat erratic flightpath as it crossed the sky from about where  sagitarius was at that time of the night (which was at a relatively low angle)up to the region in the sky where the constellation andromeda was located.  I would say that it accomplished this  in about 25 seconds max. A strobing light sometimes emitted from this object which appeared to be at such a distance that not even my 10*50mm binoculars could resolve some discernable shape.  Additionally, the object emitted a greenish light. The object made no sound of any kind.  Now as it reached andromeda, it suddenly made a tight turn and at that moment I noticed that a second object came into view.  It appeared to be racing to meet the 1st object and as it gained on the first object, I noticed that they both began to decelerate at a very steady rate until both were flying at the same speed.  Suddenly the first object began to rapidly accelerate and as this occured, the angular distance between the two increased and at that point I could only follow one of the objects.  I continued following what I identify as the first object as it headed due north now when suddenly the second object closed in on the first as it came into my field of view in the binoculars.  About 2 seconds passed when abruptly I noticed that a third object had now come into my field of view.  The 3 then continued on this norhterly course together until they disappeared behind a hill and I could follow them no more.  Now I want to say a few things regarding this ""potential"" sighting. Firstlly, I have been fascinated with aircraft all of my life since I can remember being alive.  I go to airshows several times a year and have seen many different types of military aircraft in action. Military aircraft are to my knowledge very noisy vehicles.  The vehicles that I witnessed this night made absolutely no sound whatsoever. Secondly to bolster my 1st point, I would like to state that the objects accelerated rapidly at least twice that I can remember and not once was there any sound nor the appearance of the prominent flame that I could associate with that which is emitted when jet aircraft engage their afterburners in order to command the  impresive rate of acceleration that these vehicles displayed.  Thirdly, we live in the San Francisco   Bay area.  It is very active with air traffic given the two major airports which are  located so close in proximity from one another (literally right across the bay from one another)  The notion that the military would conduct such risky maneuvers in such an area of the sky that is already rife with civilian air traffic is in my opinion not viable unless one is willing to accept that the military does not take the issue of civilian air traffic safety seriously.  If we are to then accept that maybe these objects were military jets flying well above the civilian air traffic corridor, let us say perhaps above 20,000 feet, then these jets would have had to fly at the speed of sound at the very least in order to cover the aforementioned area of the sky  and they would have surely generated a sonic boom.  But as  I say, not a peep eminated from these vehicles.  conversely, if they had been flying at a lower altitude which is the only other explanation that could explain the large sky coverage executed by these vehicles in short a short period of time, then surely, unless these are military jets with a sophisticated new propulsion technology, they would have definitely made a lot of noise.  I cannot definitely say that what I saw were craft from another world, but they sure did not behave in any way that I could attribute to modern military jet aircraft.  If you have any feed back for me regarding this event i.e. any new propulsion technologies that you may have heard of, please drop me a line.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,37.80316672771673,-122.2309960927961

I got out of my car at about 8:30 PM, and looked up to the south to see a very bright light. It was about the size of a star (maybe a little bigger), but it had a brightness almost that of the moon. At first I thought it might be a meteor or something, so I stood to watch it. I realized it was moving toward me, and as it did, the one bright light became smaller lights. There was also a flashing red light. It continued to get closer, and I thought it was a very low flying airplane. However, I suddenly realized it was making no noise at all, and I found this very odd. I am nearly positive that it stopped and hovered, although I cannot be entirely sure. As it did, I could make out the outline of it. It appeared to be about the shape of a bowler hat. The lights were around what would appear to be the brim, and the dome part was dark, but I could make out the silouette against the night sky. I suppose this dome part could have been my imagination, but I'm almost positive of what I saw. Before this, I was still under the impression that it was an airplane. I certainly was not expecting to see this shape, and it instantly gave me chills. Suddenly, the object made a sharp 90 degree turn and took off to the south. This, to me, confirms it was no aircraft that I've ever seen before. The way it turned, it was so smooth, and very quick. Before, as it came towards me, I could not see the speed with which it moved, but after the turn, I could tell that it moved very quickly. I walked toward my back yard so i could see it through the neighboring houses, and I watched it dissapear over the tree line to the south. Something that may have just been coincidence: I could hear several dogs barking off to the south, which I thought sounded like what I had heard about other UFO sightings. The thing about all this is, before tonight, I really did not believe in UFOs that much. I thought people who saw them were crazy. Tonight left serious doubt in my mind. I'm writing this less than an hour after the event, so it's still completely fresh in my mind. I will swear on anything that I'm not making this up. Coming from someone who thought people who saw UFOs were crazy, I would say that what I saw was most definantly a UFO, no question about it.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,,

I was driving east from Russellville to Bowling Green on 68-80 (Russellville Rd.)after  working late in October of 2001. As I approached the Rockfield Elementary School area I noticed a glowing yellow-white oval shape ahead of me. I judged it to be close to the Natcher Parkway overpass (approx.6 miles ahead) and about the size of my thumb with my arm stretched out in front of me. The oval shape was bright, but hazy and was slowly moving south toward Hwy 31-W. I watched it continuously as I drove toward town amazed at the size it must be and noting that I couldn't see any discernible object or craft in the oval light. The attack of 9-11 was still fresh and I was surprised to be seeing anything in the air. If it were a military helicopter searching for something, I thought I should be seeing a beam of light streaming to the ground or moving around, but there was none. As I neared Memphis Junction Rd. just a little before the Natcher overpass, I judged the object to be over Hwy 31-W (which at this point runs almost parallel to 68-80, aprox. 3 miles apart). Suddenly, the oval light changed into 5 separate white lights! They were in the formation of a triangle. It was very odd in that it wasn't a flat triangle. There were three lights forming the bottom base, a light at the top point, and the fifth was on the right side of the triangle closer to the base. It moved upright. (If you form a triangle with your thumbs and index fingers a few inches in front of your face and then extend your arms out still holding the triangle, that is how the lights moved.) I was watching this triangle of lights travel slowly beyond 31-W when they just disappeared!  I didn't report it thinking the original oval light was so big that others probably had already called. I checked the local news sources for the next few days hoping for some mention with an explanation, but never heard anything about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I braced myself against the corner of my house and took a picture of it with my digital camera with a telephoto lens at the maximum.  When I viewed the image it didn't really present change from the way I viewed it with the naked eye.  So, I decided to download to my computer and then digitally magnify it.  As I magnified it started taking on a shape up 200X before it became distorted.  It definitely was metallic and was saucer shape.  It appears that a light is on top but may be a reflection of the sun.  I thought maybe this could be a satellite but it remained stationary and didn't move for approx. 2 hours.  I, like most people didn't report it because of the possible stigmas attached to the person reporting such things.  I feel though that it is an important picture for those concerned.

I was at my parents house in Mexico. I was just looking outside a big window on the second floor. Infront of our house like about 3 miles away there is a small like mountain or huge hill. On the right side of the mountain I see this circle white kind of gray object. Its slowly moving around. I stare for about 4 seconds and i call my mom. The suddenly it goes around the mountain to the other side and dissapears. It was super fast. It was like a white pill. It accelerated at an amazing almost impossible speed. That was all i saw. I clearly remember this moment. Everytime i tell someone they dont believe me. But other people from the same city say they have also had sightings like mine. They say long ago they saw a craft very low to the ground. it had bright lights. It then left into the sky. But i never saw that so i dont know if its true. But i know that what i saw is true.,2004-07-08T00:00:00,,

It was a clear day, the heat was reflecting off the object, no writing on the object and it was not moving it appeared. I was trying to look while I was driving but started to go off the road so I turned right into the dennis the menace park so I could turn around and drive into the grave yard (took about 10 seconds) when I got into the graveyard I could not find anything in the sky (there were no clouds) if it were a blimp it could not have went out of view that quickly. I work for the government and was in the Airforce always lived near airports and never believed about UFO's but this was definately strange. Well about a year later I was talking to a friend and the subject came up of UFO's and I mentioned it to him and he told me that another friend of his told him of the day he was working in the baseball field at Dennis the Menace park and thought he saw a UFO. My friend couldn't believe two simarlar stories from two different people who don't know each other happening at the same place and probably around the same time. He said he wants me to meet his friend so we can go over our accounts. Someday soon I'm planning on doing that. The sight I saw seems to be burned in my mind. The thing that stood out is how still it was and the heatwaves relecting off. It gave me an eeiry feeling after the sighting. The object looked metallic greyish/silverish, the heat reflecting off really made it stand out to me. It was on my mind so I thought I would report it now. Unfortunately I don't have a specific date but I know it was about three to three and a half years ago. I should of wrote everything down then.

I could clearly see the black silhouette of a saucer against the orange glow of the night sky.  It was a slightly cloudy night which, sometimes caused the sky to be orange at night rather than black.  Anyways, this disk had 3 flashing lights on the bottom, but each time one of the lights flashed the light was a different color.  The Disc also appeared to be flying fairly low, being that we saw it against the clouds from below supports this.  The really strange thing is that neither of us heard a thing, not the whine of a jet engine, or pulsing of a helicopter rotor, so it definately was not a plane or a helicopter.  My friend and I couldn't help but watch as this object silently flew out of site in a matter of minutes, and being in Saskatchewan it had to go a long way before it is out of site.

I was born and raised in Honolulu, and have spent a lot of time outdoors looking at the night sky.  I am sober; I don't use any drugs and seldom drink.  Over the years I have seen a quite a few things I could not explain in the skies above Oahu. I'm glad to have a place to share them here.  At the times these things happened I was either alone, or with one person and it was wierd not to be able to talk about them.  ABOUT THE TIMES AND DATES, THE FORM HERE DOESN'T FIT.  THESE THINGS OCCURED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 1994 AND THE PRESENT AND VARIOUS TIMES AND LOCATIONS ON OAHU.  MOST WERE ONLY WITNESSED BY ME BUT ONE OR TWO WERE WITNESSED BY OTHERS.  First of all the most recent thing was in the ocean outside Waikiki.  This occured approximately around 2002 or 2003.  On more than one occasion, I saw lights I could not explain in the ocean outside of Waikiki.  I saw these from Kaimana beach on the eastern end of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Head.  There were yellow lights.  They did not behave either like airplaces or boats.  They were above the water. If I remember correctly they looked like flares (Although they were much larger, larger and brighter than stars or airplanes).  Their movements made no sense.  If I remember correctly, they burned brightly in one place and then sank slowly and disappeared before they hit the water.  They were perhaps a mile or more out to sea, seemingly directly out from Kaimana.  I saw these bright yellow lights on more than on occasion.  If I remember correctly there were more than one in a row.  My friend, a social worker, also saw then and we were freaked out.  Perhaps around 1994 I saw the most spectacular thing.  It was twilight at Queen's surf in Waikiki.  To the West, out to sea from Makakilo and Waianae, hundreds of feet up in the sky, I saw a spectacular display.  Fluorescent green squiggles appeared high in the sky, one after another.  They would fade and more would appear.  This went on for a while.  It looked like someone air brushing designs on a T-shirt.  This was NOT the ""green flash"" people sometimes see in Hawaii after the sunset.  In spite of the fact that thousands of people should have seen this, I found no mention of it in the media, and I checked. I think I also checked somewhere like Bishop Museum which has astronomers and people like that.  No one else reported it.  One friend speculated that it must have been was rockets or missiles launched from the military base on Kauai [which would probably be Barking Sands].  This occurance was spectacular,unmistakeable, distinct and went on for a while.  At other times, I've seen lights in the night sky that seem to behave in odd ways if they were to be aircraft.  This could be their movement, or brightness.  Most of these I've seen from Kahala or near Sandy Beach.  Perhaps some from Waikiki.  I don't remember the details that much now, just thinking, that light isn't moving correctly for an airplane, or it looks too big.  If I remember correctly most were yellow light, or perhaps white.  Somewhere in the early or mid nineties, I saw the most incredible sights at Waimanalo beach in eastern Oahu.  These may well all be natural.  I just thought they were spectacular.  On this particular day, I saw an awesome rainbow coming straight down from a cloud to the sea.  About sunset, which was taking place on the other side of a mountain range, a sight appeared in the eastern sky about where the sun rises.  This on the horizon was over the water.  Black rays emanated from this spot, like a reverse sunset.  Lots of people saw it, they just looked transfixed, but no one said anything, strangely. Combined with the rainbow and something else I've forgotten, the energy was intense that day.  It was special.  I would be grateful to know what that was, if anyone knows.  Then, between about 2000 and 2002, I saw one more thing.  I was near Punchbowl.  It was probably between about 3 and 5 in the afternoon.  This cloud came overhead, but it was not like any cloud I have ever seen.  It seemed unusually radiant and important.  It resembled a city in the sky.  I was transfixed by it.  I remember I wanted to call an aquaintance who is spiritually sensitive and religious because I thought she too would understand that something was afoot.  I don't think that was an ordinary ""cloud.""  I've wondered in it concealed a UFO, or something else.  That's all I can specifically remember at this time.  I've noticed other reports on this site of strange lights over the ocean outside of Waikiki that are like my stories.",2004-11-02T00:00:00,21.32260015003751,-157.84012865716429

Then as he parked the car I became enthralled at the full moon overhead, hidden behind the clouds, and I began starring at it intently.  All, the while I'm watching the moon I'm thinking how big, bright, and beautiful it is. Also, where did these clouds come from?  Then it suddenly occured to me that the ""real"" moon was located in that exact spot probably 5 hours prior - ""how could this be the moon?"", I think to myself, as I'm standing on the sidewalk musing to myself.  No sooner did this thought materialize when the object (as if it heard my thoughts)jetted off to the west then stopped.  It was no longer overhead but slightly west of my location at this time.

These new lights (ever changing numbers - up to 22 or so) then began a ""dance"" of sorts.  They arranged themselves in 2 crescent shape lines of 5 or so, mirroring each other, with 6 or so others flanking their sides.  Then they would ""scramble"" and rearrange themselves in a similar fashion - just slightly different than the last - then scramble again. They appeared as children - playing in the rain.   This went on for 30 minutes or so.  All the while I am watching this I'm strangely calm which is not my nature really.  I wanted very badly to run in the house for the camera but was afraid I'd miss the opportunity of a lifetime for want of proof.  This is my first ever time to report this publicly and I only do so now because I've recently been haunted by the fact that that damned light actually ""read"" my mind!  I dont like that thought and everytime I look at a full moon I'm afraid they're back to suck my mind.  I keep a careful watch on where the moon is whenever I'm ouside.  I am a simple housewife - I am not a scientist nor do I have a college degree.  My background is that of waitress and picture framer.  My husband is a truck driver/mechanic.  I'm not prone to fabricating stories for attention.  In fact you'll notice I didnt even report this right away nor did I even discuss it with my husband til recent years.  That fact is still puzzling to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-11-02T00:00:00,33.8722,-117.8703

To her side, and behind her was a bulletin board with the words: ""800 unknowns tracked last year"", or words very close to that.  I've tried to contact KWGN in Denver, but to no avail. I don't know if they knew the camera was on that bulletin board or not, but, for just a few seconds (maybe 20 to 30) were the words that haunt me.  NORAD tracks ALL debris, aircraft, spacecraft, spacejunk, anything that flys or is in orbit around the planet. For those words to be where they were, is paramount to saying the AIR FORCE admits they can NOT identify at least 800 bogies in a year. That says a LOT. Although it is not proof positive of ""FLYING SAUCERS"", it is a far cry from the hardline statements that UFO's are ""swamp gas, clouds, meteors, or imagination"".  Hope maybe you could dig deeper and find out if they still have the tape of that special on Cheyenne Mountain. It aired in May of 1995 as I recall. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I started to remove my son from his car seat I looked up again, and still wondered what star I was seeing. I started to talk to my son who was now out of his car seat and moving out of the truck, when it caught my attention again as it started to move. At first it moved slowly for a short distance, but then accelerated rapidly before coming to a complete stop. I then noticed the strobe lights of two aircraft, and the object started to move again in the direction of the aircraft. I was then able to determine it was much lower in altitude than the aircraft, and it had no strobe lights of its own. The object zigged and zagged several times before moving very rapidly and vanishing.  Given the fact that it was stationary, then moving in a controlled manner several times over the three to four minutes this lasted, I determined it could not have been a meteor disintegrating.

At approximately 22:15 I went outside my house to smoke a cigarette.  As I glanced up at the sky I saw a light that appeared to float across the sky.  At first I thought it may be a plane, but it's brightness dimmed and the object turned sharply and shot across in a different direction and dissapeared.  Immediately after, two more objects came into view and seemed to fly in tandem and then they circled and shot away.  As I kept on watching these objects seemed to dance in the sky in the same general area.  It was cloudy, so I thought they may have been birds, but the more I watched, I could tell they were flying in front and behind the clouds while illuminating brightly and then dimly.  Some appeared to be triangular in shape, but only when at their brightest.  I watched for a couple of more minutes and saw up to five of these objects dancing around the sky.  I was facing north west from my home and distance was very hard to judge, but it appeared they were in the proximity of the DFW airport.  I did not want to be alone in the sighting, so I called to my wife to look, she was asleep, but I still called to her to look.  It took her a couple of minutes to shake away the sleep, but the objects were still there.  After she began to see what I pointed to, she was asking if they were planes.  I saw a plane flying and pointed out that the plane was moving at about 1/3 of the speed of these objects and that the objects flight patterns were erratic at best.  What amazed me even more was that the intensity of the brightness seem to come in phases.  It was difficult looking through the clouds, but there were definitely five at one time that appeared, danced around each other and moved at high speeds away from each other and together.  I watched with my wife for about another 10 minutes until I decided to get my digital camera.  It was dark, so nothing came out, but I wanted to try anyway.  We watched for a total of about 20 minutes until I was positive that what I had seen was not an illusion or my imagination.

After passing behind the trees these lights were even more scattered, flying at the same pace and same brightness (still not blinking or changing colors).

While fying a kite, I noticed what appeared to be 3 silver objects that were in the shape of discs.  They were at such a high altitude (25,000 ft.?)it is difficult to describe them in detail.  Imagine a commercial airliner flying at 35,000 feet without a contrail.  But instead of travelling in a linear path, these 3 objects were hovering and occasionally rotated around each other (changing positions).  During their movement, they would also align themselves in a triangular formation.  I pointed out the objects to the person with me, who also witnessed the UFOs.  After about 5 minutes of observing the UFOs, they disappeared.  I am not sure how the UFOs departed, but when I looked away and tried to refocus my eyes on the objects, they were no longer there.

The more southern of the two was perhaps (estimate) 20 or 30 full size passenger plane lengths ahead of the other.

I also kept looking between the two discs to see if they were connected by anything visible, but again, nothing but the cloud above them was seen.  I could hear various air traffic above me that evening but not see any airplanes as the clouds were quite low, yet these objects were beneath the cloud cover.

I noticed a yellow search light or clearance light rotating on what I assumed was on the top of a tractor on a not to distance hill between me and the lake.  There are two hills creating a spill way or overflow for the lake.   In the dark I could not figure out if it was on the close hill (1/8th of a mile) or the far hill (1/4th of a mile).  The object seemed to glide up the hill and sit there for 40 seconds and then go back down the hill.   I was in complete amazement as to why a tractor with no headlights and only a yellow revolving light on top would be out on restricted government land closed to gas vehicles.   I then noticed no sounds, not even country noises from bugs and related night noises.  As the object went behind the hill again I realized I was seeing the bottom of something as the yellow revolving lights were on the grass and trees without a shadow of the object.  This realization made me want the safety of my home and bed (I am 47 but the little boy inside me was not going to make the walk to the lake in the dark and figure it out).     In my mind I now know I saw something off the ground as the area is too steep with trees for a land vehicle; also the lights were below the object.  The object glowed bright yellow from the bottom.  One revolving light did a 360 degree turn every second or so and appeared to be scanning the ground for something.   The spillway is rather long and isolated from the half dozen or so houses near by.  It could be used as a landing strip for a small plane.  Very wide and flat and a half mile long .  I heard nothing and have heard or seen nothing since.  The next day I asked the neighbor if he heard or saw anything the night before, but he did not.

He asked if I would like to see some photos of an unusual mark he has on his back. He added his phone number in his letter and I called the man straight away and had a nice talk with him.  The fellow told me when he was around 9 -12 years old a large scoop mark appeared out of nowhere at the base of his spine. The gentleman said at that young age (9 - 12) he was literally plagued with vivid dreams which were very real to him.  When the mark appeared out of nowhere on his back he was seen by a physician who told them that it looked as if ""someone"" had taken a chunk out of his back. The man said there was never any pain associated with it and no scaring. The fellow explained that there is a thin layer of skin which is covering the indentation and nerves in his back. The nerves are sensitive to the touch.  The scoop mark focused around a very detailed dream of hearing a strange chatter. In his vivid dream he found himself standing in front of his father's property, which is located in the Creston, B.C. Approximately 40 feet in front of him was a craft which was hovering about 6 to 10 inches off of the ground. It was spherical in shape but flat on the bottom, a dull aluminum in color and had no distinguishing markings on it. He said there was a green glow (a vapor cloud) which surrounded the craft. It made no sound but he did feel an odd vibration the craft emitted. (His example was, if you took your hand and placed it on running equipment and felt the vibrations from it) He didn't find all of this disturbing at all. The fellow never saw any kind of creatures of any sort.  Also the man was in a state of paralyses and all the time hearing this strange chattering sound. He went on to say that he eventually work up laying on the floor in a pile of laundry and to find his socks were wet from what he believed was from the morning dew outside. There were also was small twigs and a little soil laying about the floor. The fellow told me he is still wondering what actually happened that night many years ago. Also he wanted me to know that this was a one time experience.  Thank you to the person for the report and photos. More photos are being taken and will be sent along to me.

Stopped when vehicle stopped and appeared to hover.  There was only one object. It was similar to an egg silver in color with what appeared to be a orange stripe on the side. It would stop when the cars occupants stopped and speed up when they came to wooded areas so that it appeared the object was trying to beat them to the clearing.It was ""similar to a blimp but a lot smaller minus the passenger area."" One witness thought she saw what appeared to be green writing on the side.  *****----my experience was so similar, my husband and I are a bit freaked now. It was Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving this year 2004. My husband and I were driving our kids to his sisters house for her to watch them while we tried our hand at Black Friday shopping. It was about 4:30/5 in the morning. We were traveling south east on route 20 in Sussex County Delaware. I noticed this bright ‘star’ on the left side of the road above the woods. My husband commented about how bright it was. I said yeah…it must be the north star…but no that wouldn’t make sense since we were traveling south east. I’m VERY interested in the stars and the sky and UFO’s and such so I kept staring at it because it was so bright…then it crossed the road and was on the right side of the road…I said to my husband “Um…its on this side now…” (I was in the passenger seat) We kept traveling on route 20 towards Millsboro and it was following us. I made the comment as such. It would seem to stop in the sky…then speed up to keep up with us…it stayed in view of my passenger side window the entire time on 20. It was very high in the sky, so that all we could see was like a round..ball of bright light. When we came to the 113 junction to make a right, the object was going straight and made a sharp right, like a 90 degree turn to stay with us. This scared me a bit. I said to my husband “Holy sh*t, its seriously following us…” We were a bit uneasy…but continued on 113 for a bit then turned into the old Acme parking lot to get to his mothers development, on Mitchell Rd. The object was now above a wooded area near the railroad tracks behind the development…to the right of her home. We took our kids in and we came out and I observed the object was still there. I said to my husband “Its hovering over the woods there”…we left making our way down by the bowling alley on Mitchell Rd in town in Millsboro. I looked back and sure enough there it was, following us again. I exclaimed to my husband, “Its following us! Atleast we know its not after the kids (relief)” We turned onto route 24, going from Millsboro to Long Neck to Rehoboth. The object  followed us the entire way, doing that stop in the sky, speed up thing as if to keep up with us, but not pass us. There were just a few other cars on the road near Mountaire in Millsboro, I told my husband I didn’t care how fast he had to go, he had to keep up with another car…I didn’t want to be the only car on the road for fear of giving whatever was following us an opportunity to perhaps ‘beam us up’ We stopped at a stoplight and then my husband accelerated very fast  to see if the object would do the same, it did. Near the volunteer fire company on 24, I could see the object a little clearer. It was soo bright that it like ‘twinkled’ blue and red but so so bright..like the florescent blue light, bright. I noticed as we passed the new high school and nursing school that it would dim, them brighten..then dim..then brighten…I peered close and it reminded me of a lighthouse light..turning…like it was TURNING, the light would dissipate then come back as if it made a full circle. It was too high in the sky to be a helicopter, there was no noise and a normal aircraft would NOT follow our path to Kmart at about 5:30ish in the morning as it was. When we made our right turn onto rt 1, again, the object made a sharp right turn to keep up with us but now it was visible in my husbands driver side window. We went to Kmart and the light stopped right over Kmart. I don’t know if anyone else noticed this since everyone was so preoccupied with getting in line for holiday shopping but I wonder if anyone else traveling the road DID notice. Though it was kind of frightening it was absolutely fascinating to me. And now since reading such a similar story in the same vicinity, whoa, its mind blowing.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,38.632,-75.5901

As it passed over i could clearly see a single triangle shaped aircraft with a white light on each corner and a red blinking light on the right tip.A green blinking light on the leftThe more i think about the aircraft at malakoff, if you took two of the single aircraft and connected them where there should be some kind of thrust output,then turned it sideways that would be exactly what i saw at the roadside park.I stated that the malakoff aircraft had 4 white lights, all the others had 3 lights, maybe when they docked with each other two of the lights on the rear are covered up by something.Then again maybe the single triangle aircraft were usaf stealth fighters following the aircraft i described at malakoff,tx.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,32.14889047619048,-95.88033809523809

It didnt do or have either.... It was wierd because if you didnt look up you wouldnt notice it since the lights were very dimly lit or they kinda reminded me of reflectors and the Craft itself was almost transluscent although you can tell it was like matted black color.

It was still light out and i was able to see the shape which was like a ""V""... with lights under it or reflectors.  It was going at a speed as a plane then it speeded up ... before it disappeared it tumbled (like a fighter jet pilot would do for fun) then POOF... it disappeared into thin air.

Cal. I live in Riverside/Norco California.  I have been closely observing the skies over these two cities since Nov 2003.  At that time i observed (on 11/16/03)a very large and bright and beautiful ""star"" in the eastern sky.  It was a sight to behold! It didn't just twinkle, it was a light show all by its self!!  Red, green. blue,gold and purple beams of light shooting out from it!! and as I cont. to watch it, I realized that this ""star"" was actually moving horizontally back and fourth as if it was flying! Well needless to say, the night skies captivated my full attention from that day on and I was hooked on astronomy and the possibility of UFO's in the skies over Norco California!!  Well, I did some investigating and the awesome star I saw I believe is Serius. The brightest star above earth.  It becomes visible to So. Cal in November through around March or so.  And although I know Serius IS a star...I have to say that I have never seen a star with the likes of this star in my 48 years on earth.  I know Serius has been around for probally millions of years, but I never noticed it before that Nov 2003 night.  How i missed it, I don't know.  And what makes it appear to be flying in the sky,I don't know either. Well anyways, I have had my eye on the sky ever since, and let me tell you, that I have seen many unexplainable as well as unbelieveable ""strange"" flying ""stars"" in our skies over So. Cal. First of all, when you look up in the sky just after dark, there are 3 bright lights in the sky that always stay in a triangle formation.  They look just like bright stars,but if you've got a bit of patience, just sit down in a chair in a dark area,free from city lights, and watch those ""stars""  Before long you're gunna notice that they are actually flying around in the sky.  They almost always stay within a certain radius from their original resting place, I've never seen them just take off and jam across the sky.  It's as if they have a certain area to guard and they stay within that area.  I've seen beams of light shoot out from these ""stars"" across the night sky for miles. Lately they have taken on a strange flouresent green hue, and when they ""fly"" they will luminize the whole sky around them which also turns flouresent green. Actually they are surrounded by vapor clouds and that's what lights up in the sky.  These clouds materalize and evaporate with the movement of these objects. The flying stars were observed all throughout this year. The color change took place in the middle of Nov. Will some of you see if you can see the same such mysterous objects in the sky over your own cities?? If you do, write a short discription of what YOU see here at this web site.  It'll be very interesting to hear other peoples stories about the ""flying stars"" and what YOU think they really are.  Thank You!!",2004-12-14T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

We had a camp fire going and we had been getting ready to put it out when we decided to just let it burn itself out instead. One of the three of us commented on how clear it was for once, since it had been overcast for the last few days. We then started picking out the names of constalations that we were able to point out. Thats when we saw what we think was a UFO. There was a slight haze or light glow around the object. At first it seemed more like a distand planet but after a while we noticed it was more than that. It was actually moving, slowly moving but moving. The first thing that came to mind was that it was a plane, except planes dont just stay around one spot. Then we thought about a helicopter or something of that sort, but there is no reason a chopper should be floating arount there, nor did it really look like one. It was hard to tell the shape of the object be cause the glow caused the object to look blurred. We discussed our new topic of intrest for a while, wondering what it could be. We had gotten away from gazing dumbfoundedly at it for a while only to look back and notice a second glow. At first it seemed unreal, but after the two moved in diffrent patterns and stayed relatively close, we knew it wasnt anything normal. We decided that we would go on with our night as we planned but the happening stayed in the back of our minds all night. We didnt watch them until they went away but the time that we did spend watching them lasted about 10 to fifteen minutes, not including the time spent discussing the objects between the time the first one and second one appeared.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,39.96327543160691,-76.71886879150067

Although I am very unsure on the dates, I felt compelled to file this report because I know, along with the people who witnessed this with me, that we saw something unexplained. On a summer night in 1995 or 1996 I was outside of my house (parents' house) along with some friends of mine as we did often. At about 9 PM (2100) I jumped up on a transformer box that was outside of many of the homes in that area. From that vantage point, I was able to look over the roof of my house and at that particular time I was looking to the south. Many miles away I could see what were 6 -7 lights yellow in appearance. The lights were in somewhat of a pattern in that they were one behind the other. Miami International Airport is South-South West of were we lived then so my first thoughts were that they were aircraft. After a few minutes I realized that wasn't possible because not only were they too close to each other, but they were standing still. As I continued to look I called over my friends to ask them what they thought that could be, they had no idea. As we watched some lights would disappear, and appear again only many miles forward (or ahead) of the first lights. Then some others would disappear, and reappear in the same locations. It was the first and only time I saw something that I could not explain in the sky. Years later I saw those same exact lights on television, they were calling them the Arizona lights. I have since learned that Homestead Air Base is also south of us, however I cannot confirm any operations because it was just too long ago, and I have no exact dates. I have seen flares launched from aircraft before, but I cannot say that they were what I saw that night. I am now a private pilot, and can confirm that there was nothing usual about what we saw.

There were four witnesses to this sighting. Myself, my father-in-law,his friend and his friend's grandson. We were returning home from a Phillies-Cardinals baseball game. We were traveling south on I 95 approximately 2-3 miles before the I 476 interchange (known locally as the ""Blue Route"").  As we were traveling south on I 95 we all noticed a very bright light directly ahead of us on the horizon. Because of our proximity to the Philadelphia International airport, I believe we all assumed it was plane approaching for a landing at the airport. After about thirty seconds I remember thinking to myself,why hasn't the incoming plane closed in distance on us? It seemed we weren't closing the gap. (which I found strange because we were heading directly toward it. And it initally appeared to be coming toward us.) About 15-20 seconds later the gap between us seemed like it was finally closing. I then commented to the child in the group, ""look here comes a plane in for a landing"". Right after that the object shot off to left at an incredible speed on an approximate 60 degree angle. It was totally out of sight in a second or two. We all imediately rolled down our windows and looked up to try and track it. However, it was gone. One of the other witnesses said, ""Did you see that? It was like it was yanked on a string! That isn't anything from this world!""   I also remember was thinking to myself how bright the light was compared to what I remember normal landing lights on a plane to be. It was a brighter and whiter glow than you would normally see.  A final observation. There is a Boeing facility within a mile or two of where the sighting occurred. Was this some sort of experimental craft? I don't know... If it was, I can't rationalize why they would be testing it in such a densely populated area over heavily traveled interstate highway.

Now, as I was out there every night taking my breaks, I used to watch the 707's and DC-8's coming in for their landings at burbank airport. I saw hundreds of planes come down from there. I know how fast they glide along the sky on their descent to the runway. This Ball of Light crossed the sky, at least, 10 times faster than those planes come in.

During the late 1990's, I was on active duty in the Air Force, stationed at Whiteman AFB.  On the evening of July 26, 1997 I was washing my car at a self-serve car wash on the north east side of Warrensburg Mo. next to highway 50.  The sky was clear and there were still a couple of hours until sunset.  I noticed 2 dark objects hovering over the south-central side of town, about 2 miles away, at an altitude of about 1500 feet AGL.  The objects were identical, each consisting of an equilateral triangle with a sphere at each corner.  The thickness of the triangular portion was approximately one quarter of the objects' length, with the spherical sections' diameter about twice the thickness of the triangular section.  They appeared to be about 100 to 150 feet long.  The objects were flat black in color with no visible markings, intake/exhaust ports, or windows.  I could not hear any sounds from the objects.  The southern most object did not move at all, watching it was like staring at a photograph.  The northern most object only occasionally yawed from left to right about 60 degrees in each direction.  Its position in relation to the unmoving object never changed.  After about 45 minutes, I turned away to insert more coins in the car wash, and when I turned back, the objects were gone.  Less than a minute after the objects disappeared, three A-10 attack aircraft from Whiteman AFB flew over me less than 200 feet up, they were heading west, paralleling highway 50.  I could see that the only ordinance they were carrying were sidewinder air to air missiles.  The A-10s turned south and flew over the center of Warrensburg, towards the previous location of the objects.  At that location, they broke formation and continued south along slightly different vectors.  For the remainder of my Air Force career, I did not report my sighting, nor even tell anyone about it.",2004-06-18T00:00:00,38.7862,-93.7239

She could not give me an exact date, but it was around 1997-1998. At the time she was living in a 13 story apt building. The windows of her apartment face north and you can see the Empire State Building and the Hudson River directly to the right.  At around 6am or so in the morning she awoke to the noises of car horns going off at street level, so she went to the living room to look through the window to see what the commotion was all about. She noticed, directly in front of the apartment complex, three disk shaped objects hovering at maybe 300 feet or so in the air! She described the objects looking like a wheel with spokes that connected to a disc or sphere in the middle. The area between the spokes, or bars, was open space. The crafts, she said, rather looked like an old fashion horse drawn carriage wheel.  They were completely still in the air in a vertical position. She noticed people out in the street where also looking up at these objects and other people becoming aware of what was going on since it was very early and people were leaving for work. She had been observing the objects for 15 minutes or so when two helicopters arrived. The choppers stayed hovering in place for a while, and then began moving closer to the objects. The crafts started tilting into a horizontal position and then slowly moved up and away from the area while gaining speed till they where no longer visible. The helicopters pursued but could not keep up. The entire event lasted about 30 minutes or so, probably longer.  My grandmother immediately turned on the TV to see if there was any breaking news about the sighting, but nothing was reported. For the entire week, she followed the news, including the newspapers, but nothing ever came up about the event. I’m sure that whoever was in the helicopters must have been recording the event with video or something. Needless to say, it was an incredible event for my grandmother to witness!

He said that he believed he was overly tired and had worked too many hours in the days preceding what he believed was the missing hour.  I asked if any other abnormal events took place prior to the missing hour such as seeing a UFO or anything out of the ordinary and his response was no. The gentlman sounded sincere in his answers but felt that nothing our of the ordinary had happened except that time just got away fom him without his knowledge due to being tired.

At about 6:45PM PST on 5/17/04 I observed a moving light flying from the east foothills of San Jose, CA toward the southwest.  The light, first estimated to be about 2500ft altitude and 3 mile distance, drew my attention because it appeared to have the intensity and quality of a bright aircraft landing light as observed in the night time.  The initial velocity was considerably faster than aircraft often observed flying at that altitude and range.  The object flew at relatively constant velocity and altitude for the first 30 sec. and then came to a gradual stand-still during the next 15 seconds with the light dimming and finally appearing as a white circular diffuse object with relatively sharp edges.  I retrieved my binoculars (7X35 power)within 30 seconds and viewed the object which appeared more like a bell jar shape (1:1 aspect ratio)with an occasional sliver of black at the bottom observed.  The object seemed to move slightly up and down and sideways hovering just below one of the white cumulus clouds (elevation 3205 ft per local meteorological report).  I continued to view the object through binoculars for an additional minute until it disappeared upward into the cloud.  The object never reappeared during an additional 15 minutes of observation.  No sound was heard from the object. Initial AZ and EL angles were later estimated using a protractor jig.  Using these angles plus the flight time and cloud height, a set of latitude and longitude angles were derived using MS Street Finder application.  The calculated date is given below.

I was ""sky watching"" in my front yard in west Flagstaff around 2115 hours, Monday, July 5th, 2004.  I spotted five satellites in less than five minutes.  All exhibited the ""basic"" characteristics of satellites regarding speed, distance, and size.  Soon after spotting the last one of these, I noticed another coming from the south and moving towards the area of the night sky near the ""handle"" of the Big Dipper constellation.  I immediately tried sighting it through my binoculars (10x50) using the normal technique of aiming in ""front"" of the object (ahead of it along its apparent trajectory), assuming it had a straight line trajectory as satellites do.  I noticed also that it seemed slightly brighter than the other satellites I'd seen that evening (about twice as bright) and that it was moving about 1/3 to 1/2 less than the speed of the previously spotted satellites.  I couldn't see it through my binoculars, and lowered them.  I could see it easily with the naked eye however, yet each time I lifted the binoculars to the area where it should have been travelling, I couldn't find it.  I kept lowering the binoculars, recapturing it with my unaided eyesight, then lifting the binoculars again, only to lose sight of the object.  After four or five attempts, I gave up trying to spot it with the binoculars and just ""eyeballed"" it.  Then I discovered why the object was hard to track.  As it was travelling toward the north, it was also turning slightly to the right (east).  When the object reached the point in the sky where its apparent position was between the two outermost stars which make up the ""handle"" of the Big Dipper, it began a slow but tighter turn toward the east.  It completed this turn after a course change of about 180 degrees, and then continued heading back toward the south.  The object completed this 180 degree turn when it reached the point in the sky where its apparent position placed it in between the four stars which make up the ""scoop"" or dipper part of the Big Dipper.  Thus, the apparent diameter of this 180 curve ascribed by this object was the apparent distance from in between the first and second stars of the Big Dipper's handle to the middle of the Big Dipper's scoop.

This object made no sound that I could hear. I was 1 mile off the main highway and I can assure you, it was dead still outside. I pulled over in the drive of a cow field and watched it. It moved like it was hovering over something. The two white lights would get dim and then insanely bright for no reason. The object got closer to me as I watched it. I could make out a triangle-type outline to it and noticed it had 3 white circular lights on each ""point"" of the triangle. It seemed to zig-zag in the sky very slowly and would ""hover"" or stop completely at times.

I pulled over and got out to see what the heck this was all about and it was absolutely silent. No sound from the City, no barking dogs, not any noise. It was wierd, so quiet. I thought what can that be? Is it a large light that the carnivals used to use to shine a light beam up into the sky to attract people? As I studied this light, it rose above the horizon of the mountain top and I could see stars below it, so I know it was not a land based object. After a few minutes, it receded back to itself and vanished. All that remained in that location of the nite sky was a bit of fog looking stuff which slowly disipated.

Certainly not the speed of light. I am reporting this because I just ran across your site for the first time and never knew there was a place to report the incidence. I am having chill bumps just reliving the experience. What ever that thing was, it controlled sound and was silent itself.The light beam that it projected was a different light than I have ever seen, it was thick and intensly luminous even though it source had to have been at least two or more miles away. I observed it from a side view, it never shone on me, but I could see what it was illuminating at a great distance. Thanks for a place to finally tell of my encounter after 30 years.

I walked down a dirt track towards the cemetary, there was a large alfalfa field to my left forming a gradual downward slope. It was still dark, just a hint of light on the horizon. I sensed, or heard something, like a strong breeze moving the trees in the woodline to my left, as I turned to the left, looking downhill, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Feeling spooked, I turned to keep walking. A dark moving shape came from my left side, rising quickly, traveling to the right. I saw it best when it was about at my ten o'clock high position. It looked like a Huey helicopter, with a similar style windscreen, towards the front, the rest of the craft reminded me most of a Star Trek shuttle craft, but it was very dark in color, and I only caught a glimpse. It hung in the air with a nose down attitude, like a helicopter taking off, then, was gone. I saw it only for in instant, it made absolutely no sound. I didn't really see it fly in any direction. It was just there for an instant, then gone.It just seemed to ""flash"" away, although it emitted no light. My heart was racing, though I did not feel afraid, just excited.

We had the hunting dogs chasing a racoon trail and everything was going fine. Until we looked off to the east i believe and saw a HUGE object entering the earths atmosphere. You could see the steady streak of flames it was leaving behind. At the time it hit the ground there was a very bright White light that filled the whole sky, you could not see your own hand if u held it in front of your face. It made no sound as it crashed to the ground. We really have no idea of what it was until a few days later the local news station said nasa had reported it as space debrie that landed in Austrailia! which i find really hard to believe since the object was so big. This is not even the strange part of the night. As the night continued the hunting dogs that we had takin with us were not responding to a call. These are very expirenced hunting dogs that have worked together for several years. About 30 mintutes later we heard one of the dogs barking about a mile and a half down the road we picked it up with our truck, but the other dog was no where to be found. These dogs have never split up when they are hunting so we found this odd. About 15 min later we finally heard the other dog its bark was very distant from where we were standing. We walked into a field in the general direction we heard the dog. The field was very open and directly infront of us about half a mile down in the field was a bunch of tree's so we figured the dog mush have a racoon tree'd. We headed off in that direction and when me and my uncle were in the middle of the field a huge round object appeared and was heading directly towards us. My uncle and I at first thought it was a plane and listend for the sound, as it slowly made it almost directly under us. The object had made no sound what so ever it just hovered. There was lights in the middle of the object that were evenly spaced and you could tell it went around the whole spacecraft. I was scared an asked my uncle if it was a plane, and he said no it had way to many lights to be a plane. I got really nervous and was shaking all over my heart was pounding so fast. Then the object went by us and wasnt seen again. After the object had disappered from site we heard the dog barking(again) this time very loud and very near from where we thought it once was. We picked up the dog and left the area immediatly not knowing exactly why the object had appeared or why the dogs were seperated and found about 1 mile away from each other.

It was the summer of 2001 and I lived in San Diego.  Once or twice a week I would come down to the Imperial Valley and hang out with mith my friends and family.  There is a Navy base there and an airport, so we're all used to seeing plains in the sky.  That summer though there seem to be this big influx of activity.  It would always occur between 10pm and 1:30am sometimes later.  We were big smokers and chatter bugs, so we'd be out all night long smoking at chatting away.  My budy and I had seen our share of ""UFO's"" before; living near a Navy base.  Anyway, It all started one night when we happened to a small white light seemingly drop straight down into the sky off to the east of his house.  It stopped for a second and then shot off south and dissapeared.  Then another did the same thing only it appeared further south and shot off north.  Then the eastern sky was repeatedly being adorned with these small white lights dropping in and then shooting off.  Three, four, and five at a time, and in different directions.  We started getting all excited and I went in to grab my camcorder.  I pointed the camera at the occurance and hoped.  It was very dark and the lights seemed far away.  I also shot a plain, a helicopter, and a planet that was in the sky that night for brightness reference.  After about thirty mins or so the event died down.  I remember thinking to myself ""I wonder if they are directly above us too."" I looked up and sure enough one drooped in right over my head and then shot away.  It was the last one we saw that night.  Apon later review of the tape everything showed up except for the stange lights.  There seemed to be an awful lot of static in the picture as well.  This dance of objects went on durring many of my trips.  Never quite as dramatic as the first night, but we came to regard it as ""The Show""  We would show other of our friends when they's hang out with us.  Sometimes when coming down the mountains from San Diego I'd be able to see them, and I'd call my friend in the Imperial Valley.  We'd both watch them from either side. Telling eachother what we were seeing as sometimes one of us would lose sight of it or them.  The other major one we saw was very similar sounding to some that I've read on this sight.  We were out one night waiting for ""The Show,"" and dissapointed we disided to go inside.  My friend even coaxed ""them"" by saying out load in a humoring tone ""We are going inside now!""  And took large exagerated steps towards the door.  He then realized that he had to put out the trash.  As he rolled then trash container out to the street I looked back at him to see his jaw drop.  ""What?"" I asked.  ""Come here"" he said, ""look at this.""  I walked slowly over to him, expecting that what-ever he had seen would be gone by the time I got there.  But to my surprise he pointed out a rather large seeming reddish orange glowing object moving extreemly slow and low off in the distance.  It appeared to be on the other (west) side of the city.  We followed it as it traveld north east.  It was strange, seeming to grow and shrink, or rather brighten and dim.  Being night time that's all I could gather of the shape.  It would even stop at times, and then continue.  It also would blink out and then reapear about 10 to 20 degrees further north east.  As it was now dirrectly north of us we gaged it to be somewhere between Imperial and El Centro.  It began flashing more quickly now, and seem to drop a couple glowing balls of light that seemed to float down like a flare or feather, waivering back and forth and getting dimmer the lower they went blacking out completely at 50-100 feet. It began blinking faster and faster and dopping more and objects until it just kind of went out looking like when you throw a cigarette out the window of a car and it hits the ground.  Just a bunch of light fading embers, then nothing.  I'm sure I wrote too much, but this is a collection of UFO sightings right?  I wish I had more specific dates for you.  I'm going to check my old tapes, and see if I can figure it out. I was 19 at the time going to Comunnity college in San Diego, and managing three stores.  My friend was a pizza delivery boy 26 and going to Community college in Imperial. ((NUFORC Note:  Dates are approximate.  PD))",2004-09-01T00:00:00,32.77397551020408,-115.60140204081631

It looked like a light from a jet plane. The light appeared over the Ocean north, north-east and was very low over the water. There were no other boats or planes in the area that I could see, but it was still dark at this time in the morning. I immediately got a bad feeling about the light when it did not move like an aircraft it hovered over the ocean. I wanted to think it was a hellicopter, but the light was so big, so bright and low to the water. I have seen several hellicopters from the medical flight copters, life guard, coast guard to some aircraft choppers that come out of Jacksonville Navy base, and this was like none I had ever seen. I know there is a military copter that can hover but it has a forceful airflow beneath it and it makes a great deal of noise. I believe if it was that type of aircraft, I could of heard the sound or seen water being forced up from the ocean, but it did neither. When I made a turn off A1A onto state road 100 (going west) the light moved over the ocean to the side of my car just above the tree line and stayed directly to the side of my car past I-95 through the city of Bunnell about ten miles from where I turned off A1A. In Bunnell state road 100 turns to the north north-west and when I made this turn it again aligned up with the right side of my car, and fallowed me again. I lost sight of it behind some trees about 3 miles after the turn. Given the events of that day I did nothing to follow up on it. But, about three weeks later while driving home I heard the Rush Limbaugh show and he mentioned seeing a huge bright light in the sky about 1/2 hour after I first seen the light. He, I believe, lives about 6 hours by car south of where I live. I wrote into his show, but never got a reply. And, until I found the UFO reporting center, I never mentioned it to anyone else, but would love to know what it was I saw and if anyone else seen the same light.",2004-09-01T00:00:00,,

Sighting Date:  Saturday, July 10, 2004 Time:  Approximately 12:05 PM Sky Condition:  Had been totally cloud covered early but was clearing west to east. By noon only a few small widely scattered clouds to west and overhead, still cloud covered to east.  I had been working in the garden and decided to go into the house for a drink of water.  The garden is about 150 feet east of the house.  As I walked I looked up at the sky above the roofline of house. There was an object making an erratic motion, almost like a piece of paper drifting on a wind.  As I watched and it came closer I could see it was making small circles and I thought it was a turkey buzzard riding a thermal.  I live in western New York near the shore of Lake Ontario and this is a common sight on warm, sunny days. My wife was with me and I commented to her that it looked awfully high.  At about this time the object disappeared behind a small cirrus cloud.  I then knew it was not a buzzard and ran into the house a got binoculars.  By the time I got back outside the object was directly above me. My initial thought looking at it with the glasses was that it was a bald eagle because the color was right and had what appeared to be a white head.  After watching it make a few circles I could see that it was a circular craft and when it banked with top facing sun there was a bright metalic shine like stainless steel.  It traveled slowly across the sky from west to east continualy making circles. After five minutes it was east at about forty degrees to horizon and approaching solid cloud cover. I wondered if it was still visible without the binoculars and attemped to locate it without them. Just as I spotted it, it suddenly changed direction, looping north over the lake and headed west at blazing speed.  I said to my wife ""look at that sucker go"" and just that quick it was gone.  Went in house and checked time, 12:10 PM.  Object's shape:  Circular with portion missing, like a clock face with portion between 5 and 7 cut away. This missing section extended to center of craft and always faced to the outside of the loops it was flying.  It looped counterclockwise.  Object's size:  Hard to determine not knowing its altitude.  I checked local weather information on the internet and clould cover in region was listed at 20,000 feet.  It was above the clouds. As stated before I thought it was a turkey buzzard soaring.  Color:  Brownish to light black on bottom.  Top portion visible only when banked facing sun was very shiny, like polished stainless steel.  At certain points in the loop it shone like a mirror reflecting sunshine.  My conclusion:  I think this craft was purposely drawing attention to it by its pecuilar motion.  If it had been traveling in straight flight I would not have noticed it.  Anyone looking to the west as it approached could not have missed seeing it.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,43.2891,-77.8278

Daytime. On Saturday afternoon 7/9/04 at approx. 4:45pm, I was standing in my front yard watering my grass and I looked up into the cloudless sky as I often do. I clearly saw what looked like a star towards the south. I noticed the light was very bright and was moving very slowly towards the south. At first I was a bit excited, but I thought quickly that someone else should see this because I could not belive it. I knew I didnt have any film for my camera but I did have a monoscope with 25x sight. I raced into my house, got the monoscope and told my daughter and my friend inside to come out. We all saw what looked like the type of light one would see on the front of a plane coming in for a landing however when I looked through the monoscope, I could see no visible body nor could I see any type of wing, balloon or rotor. What I did see was 2 lights, 1 red on top and 1 light on the bottom whith nothing between them. There seemed to be a faint pink glow around it only visible through the monoscope. This was very exciting to me. We watched for another 7-8 minutes while this light moved very slowly away from us towards the south. I noticed while we watched 3 airplanes come into view with one in close proximaty the this light. The light was noticeably higher that the plane which seemed to be at about 8000 - 10000 ft and asscending eastward. We have John Wayne Airport at about 15 miles to the west with aircraft flying over all the time. This took place in the afternoon in a beautiful cloudless sky. Visibility was high. The light did not appear to be a reflection of the afternoon sun. It ws much brighter. I took about 10- 12 minutes to move approximatly 25 degrees in the sky until visiblity was lost over the canyon wall where I live. One interesting note is there is nuclear power plant approx. 25 miles to the south of where I live. I have never seen anything like this before and I thought very much before writing this report. I am eager to see if anyone else saw what we saw. I am truly regretful I didnt! have any film. I wont be with out again.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,33.7551,-117.6307

However, it quickly came to my attention that this light was not connected to a tower of any kind; it was in fact, floating freely. As we left inner-Batesville, heading up Ramsey Mountain to the South, I lost sight of it. However, as soon as we crested the hill, I re-acquired view of the object, only to learn that it was MUCH higher than I had previously thought. It was still very bright, and it pulsated in a very regular pattern. It reminded me of a heartbeat, it was so rhythmic. It would be interesting to see if anyone else has seen anything like this.  For those interested, the object appeared to be no bigger than a medium orangeish-yellow dot. It reminded me of a radio tower light immediately, but like I said before, that wasn't anywhere near to the truth. There weren't any other mysterious craft nearby, but I did notice a couple of airplanes flying in relatively close proximity to the craft (remember now, this is in the sky; references are hard to come by up there), and within half an hour of having lost sight of the object for the last time, I heard two loud airplanes flying overhead. They could have been passenger jets or military craft, I couldn't say which though. While I was viewing the object, it seemed to stay in one place, moving very little; just pulsating like  crazy. I realized just how high it was when the clouds began to mess up my view of it.  Please, anyone else that has seen this light, please come forward to tell me anything you might know about it.

Apparently, they were making all sorts of strange rapid and sporadic movements in the sky - most were blinking.  On May 17th, we had returned from dinner and were outside swimming in the pool looking at the stars when I noticed a strange light that was very high up, moving side to side.  The airport is closed to air traffic at that time, and there were no other planes or moving lights in the sky, so we watched it carefully. It blinked white and red from what we could make out and it would zig zag slightly from side to side.  There was no pattern to the pulsating and there was no pattern to the movement.  We did notice what we thought was a falling star near to it during the course of watching it. For a long time it was stationary, just hanging in the sky, except for the slight back and forth movements.

Three large oval shaped lights moving very fast in the sky. I do not believe in aliens and ""space ships"" but I cannot explain what I saw the other night at my home in Doncaster in the UK.  Since I saw the unidentified flying objects I have been scanning the web trying to find pictures of something similar.  As yet, I have not found anything that matches what I saw. I was sat in my living room playing on my games console when I saw a light in the sky out of the corner of my eye, I hit the pause button on my game and stared through the window at the lights in the sky.  There was a big oval ring of light with two smaller lights near it moving across the sky.  They were not round, but oval and not in perfect triangular formation.  They were very high up in the sky, higher than you would typically see planes and the jet stream from planes and it was very bright.  The lights were a white/light yellow colour - I couldn't work out whether there was a haze around the lights or whether the lights were that bright that it just looked like a haze.  The main ring of light was very large - I guess maybe 5 to 10 times larger than a medium sized plane. It all happened very quickly, but as I started to look at the lights they suddenly just sped off in to the distance very very quickly.  I don't believe there is anything that could travel that fast - there is no jet or missile that could travel that quickly. The whole thing lasted for no more than a couple of seconds. My logical brain quickly thought it might be a light reflection in the glass of the window pane or a new type of plane, but I could see it in the sky so I know it wasn't a reflection and this light was so big and so fast that there is no way it could be a plane. Before you ask, no I hadn't been drinking or taking any drugs. I don't know what I saw and I only wish I had evidence to show you. I have done a drawing (which is not my best subject) to give you an idea as to what it looked like.",2004-06-04T00:00:00,,

Hi Brian  Monday May 17 night at 10 pm I saw a globe ""star"" about the brightness of Jupiter and similar in size fly over Vernon from the west to the east. I could not tell exactly how high it was but it appeared to be as high as the jets are maybe 20,000 ft. I had also noticed ""satelites"" gold in color flying south to north but disappearing at a place in a constellation following Leo and Jupiter in the sky and I could not track them further.  Tuesday night I was on my balcony from 11 pm until 3:30 am. I noticed the same satellites. One followed the other by five minutes heading north. Then one went back on the same direction heading south or the opposite direction from where they had been. They seemed to appear from where they disappeared in the sky. They move at the similar speed to a satelite. They are gold in color.  The next event was a globe flying over Vernon the same as the night before from the west. It turned orange and disappeared high over my building. I saw another globe from the same place in the west heading toward the north. My eye was then turned to a bright flaring of super white light high in the sky and this gold globe headed north. My eye caught another flare high in the wnw sky but this one flickered then flared and strobed white light as it headed in a north direction. Another one flared in the nw sky and flew in the direction of the other strobing one.  At about 3 am I noticed two satelites on the same trajectory as first sighted. They were close together seemed to slow down and one proceeded south while the other one headed east. The last sighting was at 3:30 am when a white gold globe flared high directly over head in the sky turned orange and vanished.

These jets were at a high altitude and left contrails that changed the sky from clear and bright blue to an almost uniform white haze.

They remained in one place almost directly overhead, moved quickly from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, and disappeared and reappeared.  These objects were round and ivory-colored with a metallic appearance.  We did not see wings or evidence of propulsion, and we heard no sounds.  The objects were below the haze but seemed to be at a high altitude and small in size.  At any given time, the length of time that we could see the objects was about 1-3 minutes before they would disappear and then reappear in another part of the sky.

I then went into my apartment to grab my camcorder, stepped outside, and started taping.  This entire process took about 4 minutes.

A Huey heliocopter was making passes from SW to NE and NE to SW back and forth and trending in a southerly direction as a farmer would spray or plough a field. the direction between the parrallel rows I estimated to be about one and one quarter mile. The heliocopter caught my attention when he made an easterly pass to the north of my position, because he was flying way too low to be in compliance with FAA rules and he was moving very slowly. About 15 minutes later the helicopter returned on its return pass with a southwesterly heading. It was hard to make a visual sighting of the heliocopter at first because of his extremely low flight elevation.  I could hear the helicopter for a couple of minutes before I could see him.  Now keep in mind that at the time I was busy unloading my van at my business partners/friends house and I wasn't really focusing all of my attention on the heliocopter.  I have seen many helicopters many times and they are no big deal to me. The reason I was paying attention to this one was because I was curious about the incredibly low elevation it was flying at and I wanted to see if it was private or military.  When it finally came into view at a distance of about 950-1100 yards, something caught my eye in front of it.  I blinked because I didn't really see anything other than the heliocopter at first glance but as it got closer, maybe 800 yards away, I suddenly realized what had caught my attention. The sky was very bright that night and as I looked to the north towards the town of Ceres at low angles you could easily see the outlines of utility poles because they were very dark against a light sky that was glowing orange.  What had caught my attention was the light of stars being blocked out by an object that was proceeding immediately in front of the Heliocopter.  I was awestruck as the object and the helicopter passed overhead about 200 yards to my north and at an elevation of no more than 100 yards, probably lower.  At the closeest approach I could easily see that outline of this craft or object as it was completely and totally black.  It was immense in size it must have been 8 to ten times as long as the Huey helicopter that was following it.  I would estimate that the speed was no more than 35 miles per hours.  The shape  of the craft was clean and aerodynamic at the leading edge, perhaps like the front of a jet but fatter or I should say it widened at a greater angle than any aircraft I had ever seen.  About 100 feet or more back from the leading edge the objects shape got very complicated.  There was a tremnedous appendage that was somewhat akin to a giant irregular keel that hung down towards the ground and was probably no more than 150 feet above the ground.  The sides and top of the rear half of the object had a large number of what appeard to be angular protuberances of many different shapes sticking out from the craft.  I must reiterate that the craft emitted absolutely no light whatsoever and I could only see it by its outline against a lighter sky.  Needless to say I was rather excited and I yelled loudly several times for my friend Tom Copeland to come out of his house quickly.  By the time he did it was too late for him see much of anything except for the departing helicopter.  The object seemed to either adsorb light or it had an albedo of zero.  This was brought home by the fact that the Huey was shining a tremendously bright light at the object.  Either the heliocopter was making small side to side movements or they were moving the light from side to side.  When the light didn't intercept the object, you could see its beam for over a half mile in the air.  When the light did intercept the object it was extinguished at the point of contact.  You could see nothing on the surface of the object nor was any light reflected.  There was a sound I heard that I don't know the source of that can be described as something like the ping sound that a sonar unit makes on a submarine.  I don't know if it emanated from the object or the Huey.  I have thought about the way the heliocopter was acting and I have come up with a couple of ideas.  Maybe the flight crew was moving the spotlight back and forth because they couldn't really see the object either and this helped them to ""see"" it by watching the beam of light extinguis! h just as I was watching it.  I don't know if they were picking it up on their onboard radar or not and perhaps they were afraid of running into it.  This constitutes the bulk of my sighting information.",2004-07-08T00:00:00,37.5949,-120.95769999999999

I was concerned because he was gone a long time and rarely gets up in the middle of the night.  I had opened my eyes and was about to head downstairs when i saw a very bright flash coming through the small window above my head.  I waited to hear a car backing up as i assumed it had driven in our driveway.  There was NO NOISE and it was eerily quiet.  I instinctively looked at the clock which read 2:40 am which is very out of character for me.  IN my head i heard that its important to note the time.  Then i started getting worried because i thought of an alien ship and my boyfriends previous encounters with things unexplained.  So i raced downstairs half expecting him not to be there.  He was at the foot of the stairs which made me jump.  I asked him if he saw the light and he said yes. Then we both heard a rumble and he exclaimed that it was probably thunder and lightening. I didn't believe that it was lightening since it was too bright.  Intuitively i felt that it was much more than a meteor when i heard about it the next day.  Inexplicably i have been trying to find out more information which would satisfy me...i have become rather obsessed i'm afraid.

The colors were rotating from green, red, dark orange, to white. On the top of the object above the rotating light was a very bright white. The object was hovering then it moved to the left but not straight, it was in an angle, then to the right It stood there for a few minutes then it started to move northwest direction and it looked like it was moving up in elevation the color of the object was like a yellow. As the object left to the northwest it arched downward not straight like a airplane. My older son told me it was a rounded triangle shape. We all saw the same thing. The strange thing about this was that military planes have flight patterns through here every evening or night, and when we were looking at the object the military were flying to right of the object at a northwest direction and they were flying on the left of the object going at a southeast direction. The object was much brighter, and much bigger and much higher than the military planes.

I seen a fireball type falling star, which started above me out of view but I happened to catch it once in it came over the vehicle and in view through the windshield. It followed the line of the road directly overhead. I thought I was watching a shooting start. It was blue in color and left a nice long blue tail as it streak down the sky. I would almost describe as a typical falling start, fireball blue with blue tail. I wasn't surprised at all since I have seen many fireballs over the years. I even began making a wish when out of my amazement the falling star had stopped falling and actually shot horizontily across the sky. When first observed, it was approx 90degrees overhead (directly overhead, very high like a typical shooting star)traveling from north to south. I was facing south with my vehicle. Apporx right in front of me (south) at about 30 degrees ahead of me the object shot due east and out of sight over the tree line. It never stopped but moved continusely. Like I said I was making a wish like you typically due when you see a shooting star and as I was near the end of my wish is when this star? just shot east. I am very confused as what I saw and never have seen anything like this before. I know what time it was exactly because the gate was supposed to be closed at a certain time. The duration of this lasted about 4-7seconds. I never heard anyhting but the crickets in the woods.",2004-04-27T00:00:00,35.9743,-84.28936000000002

Full Description of event/sighting: I was facing east, the full moon was above and to my right. From my left, overhead, a large bluish-white light was passing over me. It was beautiful! It moved rather sedately, and slowly seemed to rock to the left and right as it flew over.  It passed right in front of the full moon and kept going towards the north. Object was in sight for over three minutes. Other aircraft (definitely planes with FAA mandated blinking lights) were flying in the area just east of the object. They definitely were higher in the air than the object. It seemed no more than two football fields-length from me. The light was very, very large. It looked to be dime-sized. I can't imagine how big it would have been if it had been closer!  Thank you to the witness for their report.  Dear Brian,  I just sent a UFO report to your website. It happened about an hour ago.  Photos of the marks on the man's body can be found at:  Also, last night my brother had new marks on his back. Pictures attached, as well as a mark or scar behind his left ear. He has NO memory of getting them. No nausea, no pain, he was looking in the mirror when he noticed them. They're are more on his back now. If you compare the pictures I sent you before, you will see the difference. I don't know why they would focus on my brother's spine, but he was in a motor bike accident when he was sixteen. He is now 22 this month. He swerved to avoid a dog and hit a tree. He wasn't wearing his helmet and ended up in a coma for two months. He has mobility in his left leg, but not much control over it. His left hand still spasms. He had nerve damage. He walks with a pronounced limp. I wonder what they are doing to him. It is frustrating! He says that he doesn't mind if you use his pictures.

The date was Sunday April 4th 2004, at exactly 10pm (23:00). I can be sure of the time because the news had just started on the television and it was time to let my Irish setter outside to do his job. One thing I want to point out here, is that my wife and I live just south of South Bend, Indiana city limits and We have a completely unabstructed veiw of the horrizon to the south. I had no sooner hooked the dog chain up, when my Irish Setter lunged out the door and started barking up in the air at an object flying over our backyard and off into the distance. I stood tranfixed on the sight.  The object was a bright orange-red color like somthing on fire but with no actual flames or tail coming from it. It appeared to be a sphirical shape. It made no sound at all. The object was not falling to the ground, but rather on a level flight path. The night ski was pretty much clear that night. Judging the size would be to much of a guess but if I were being pressed, I would say that it had to be nearly 150 feet or more in diamiter and seemed to be traveling at a very high speed. The object took a direct path due south. I stood outside on my back porch and watched the object until I could no longer see it beyond the horizon. The whole episode took maybe 15 seconds. I see airplanes and gliders and such all the time out my backyard view and I can tell you that this was non of these. I am a well known Business owner in the community and well respected. I am a Buddhist LAma, I have several Degrees and am not prone to flights of fancy. If the truth be known, I would have just forgot about this, but after seeing other reports a few weeks later in the same area, I thought that this should be reported to someone.  (I would like to add, that 25 years ago while driving south toward Odessa texas, I and at least 5 other drivers saw this EXACT SAME OBJECT FLY OVER US. aT LEAST FIVE OTHER CARS AND TRUCTS ALL PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND GOT OUT TO ASK IF WE HAD ALL JUST SEEN THAT OBJECT.

Also an hour before the sighting i was listening to wtam 1100 am to the mike trivisanno show and he said along with another caller that he seen a ufo about the same shape earlier that day.

Typically I see these triangles over my home in Tracy Ca as they are the ones flying the lowest, quietest, and slowest over the town, usually in groups of two to three, one after another, in the same path.  Friday nights view was the best I've ever had.  First I see up above, a standard plane, similar to a U2, with no lights on.  It had a red and green light, and no others.  About two minutes later, as I scan ahead of us, all of a sudden there it was.  It appeared out of no where. Nowhere was it in front of us until, I must have blinked, and there were two lights ahead and sllight right of us, about 1-2 miles from us.  Freeway is packed and as we pass to the left of the craft, it was no more than 500 yards to my right and 250 yards up.   I saw a perfect triangle with three big lights in each corner.  Center was a tiny light and between each big light and the center light was a medium light.  This was by far the best vision of this triangle I've ever seen.   I rolled down my window pointing and my buddy didnt get to see it all lit up, sort of hovering to the right like I did.  Traffic was heavy.  Often these planes come in and appear to land or hover about the Sunol grade area, just before the 84 exit.

The three lights would pulse at the same moment.  At that point, I realized there was the vague outline of a mass connecting these three red lights.  Then I watched as four or five other lights pulsed along the outer edge of the triangle, with more lights being on the western edge of the object.

I might add here that when I observed the rockets, they all appeared to travel due north for approximately 20 seconds, then accelerate east at a fast rate until out of sight.  I watched the light, it traveled due north at 45 degrees for approximately 20 seconds.  At that point the light appeared to stop in place.  At the same instant, a circle of light of the same brightness appeared to surround the small starlight.  The light circle started out at approximately twice the size of the starlight.  It immediately enlarged within less than a second to three or four times the size of the starlight.  At that instant the light circle collapsed back onto the starlight.  The starlight then appeared to head due east, away from Florida.  But this occurred at incredible speed, nearly instantly, it vanished more than flew east.

I was staring out over the Bay when I noticed a bright light just above me.  I worked in a factory that was located by the airport in Toronto, and because the location was almost directly underneath the flight path for large planes that were landing. At night when they were close enough the lights were very bright, and that is what I thought I was observing on this night. Then it dawned on me, hey there are no airports within at least 150KM., large enough for planes that size.  What I thought I saw was something entering our atmosphere(like a meteor that gets brighter as it burns up on entry), but what I saw was like the total opposite. Instead of getting brighter, it started to grow dimmer and smaller until it was the size of a star that you would see on any night. Then it started to move in a west to east direction moving faster than anything I've ever observed in the sky(be it a plane, or a sattelite). At that time I reached for my binoculars, but by the time I grabbed them, and looked back at the sky I could no longer find this object.

At the time of our sighting (Approx. 21:30) were heading west on I-8 in Arizona about half-way between Dateland and Welton.  I have since found out the Goldwater AFB runs right along the freeway there.  I was driving.  I looked in my rear-view mirror and saw one very bright amber orb of light behind, to the SE of us.  I watched it for about a minute until it just blinked out.  We drove another couple of minutes and didn't think to much of it, it could have been anything.  A couple of minutes later, due South, I saw three amber orbs lined up vertically, perfectly equidistant from each other.  They were at about a 100 degree angle from our car (to my left and just a little bit behind the car).  I would guess they were only 1-200ft from the south side of the east-bound freeway.  The bottom light maybe 100ft from the ground, putting the top light maybe 400ft from the ground.  The lights faded on and off for about a minute.  They seemed to be following the same dirrection of our car and the exact same speed.  We were a little scared to think we might be being followed, for this reason we never did pull over.  When the lights were at their brightest the middle light split into two seperate lights now with a total of four lights in a diamond shape, roughly 300ft hight x 100ft wide.  At one point I rolled down my window to see if they were making any sound.  I could hear our car and the other few cars but no sound otherwise.  They were still pulsating and moving along the same path as the car.  They were not moving any further north towards us but going west with us.  It didn't actually appear as though they were moving but they weren't getting any further away and we were traveling about 75mph.  Another couple of minutes and the two outside lights each split into three seperate lights making a total of eight.  They maintained perfect formation and never broke their equidistance.  I couldn't see an actual structure holding them t! ogether but I couldn't make out the horizon behind them whereas I could on either side.  The light was completely self contained and shed no light on the surroundings.  Another couple of minutes and they seemed to stop following the same path and were either going a lot slower or stopped and we kept going.  The lights eventually dimmed out all together.  I kept looking up and saw a few more unusual flashes high up in the sky but the latter lights could very well have been some known aircraft, shooting stars, or a meteor shower.  I have educated myself on the appearance of flares.  These WERE NOT FLARES.  There was no smoke, the lights never once descended.  They were amber not white and did not flicker what-so-ever.",2004-06-18T00:00:00,,

From a mile away, it looked to be about a size somewhere between a large seagull and the front-end of a compact-car. It had an amazing brilliance--shimmering like a white diamond that was being spun in all directions (though it had a distinct round-shape, as an outer-""shell,"" that was almost transparent).  It moved slowly and steadily but occasionally seemed to ""down-shift"" (veering slightly off it's otherwise straight-trajectory as if ""studying"" the surrounding area).  It seemed to be intelligently guided (with spinning internal-parts) and did not resemble those metallic party-balloons (that occasionally float around Hollywood).

As was our habit, we had been fishing from sundown and intended to fish until dawn.  At around 2330 hrs. we both noticed what appeared to be a single bright light in the area of Kimberling City which at that time was about 2 miles south and east of us.  We both assumed it was a medical helicopter based out of Springfield, Mo.  We had seen the helicopter on other nights and went about our fishing.  During the next few minutes we noticed the light didn’t move from the area we originally spotted it.  In an effort to get a better view we motored up the James River Arm which would allow us to see a lower altitude in the area of the light.  After moving 2 miles upstream (away from Kimberling City) we stopped, turned and noted that there was actually more than one light.  We actually counted at this time 4 lights in what appeared close proximity with each other.  The lights were moving slowly in our direction (north-northwest) at a slow rate of speed.  Occasionally 3 of the 4 lights would hold position as one light went forward.  The separation appeared to be as much as 500-750 yards.  It would ""hover"" as the other 3 lights caught-up.  Then the same light would again scout forward, as if scouting for something.  At that time I owned a new Ranger Bass Boar equipped with a 200 HP outboard engine.  It had a top speed of around 75-MPH.  As we continued watching and noticing the way the formation was progressing we figured it might be time to vacate the area.  I tried to start the engine and while it would crank, it failed to fire.  I used the electric trolling motor to move toward an adjacent boat dock in an attempt avoid a direct overflight of the boat by the formation.  After moving about 35 yards the trolling motor began to slow.  Then it also stopped working.  There is no reasonable explanation as both the electric motor and the afore mentioned 200 HP motor later started without effort or adjustment by my friend or myself.  By now the formation was 500 or so yards away from our location and what I was referring as the Scout Craft was no more than 60 yards away.  What was really remakabke was the total lack of any noise from any helicopter rotors.  The next thing I know it was almost daylight and my friend and I were in my bass boat 15 miles        up river in the area of Galena, MO.  That time of year the sun rises at around 0625 hrs.

My eyes immediatly made contact with the only thing in the night sky hovering about 2 telephone poles high- if one were to guess- aproximately 100 yards from me.  I counted three port-hole type lights glowing.  I could see a vague outline of a craft above the lights.  I also noticed beams of light shining down from each individual ""porthole.""  I was fear stricken because I have never seen anything like this before and I was alone.  I got in my car and headed for town.  I immediatly called my husband on my cell phone who was working. As I turned the corner,  I noticed it appeared to follow me.  As I passed the neighbors house on down the road, I saw it hover about 10 feet from their roof at which point the craft's lights turned a quick blue/red then a spinning purple all the while tilting at an odd angle.  I observed it all the way to town and it transformed back into the way I first witnessed it with the clear lights.  The craft made no sound that I could hear and also noted my cell phone nearly impossible to hold a connection with my husband.  That has never happoned since  I have talked to another individual who reports nearly the same sighting 15 miles from our home the next night about the same time.",2004-08-11T00:00:00,34.0096,-98.8901

My parents live on a busy road but their house is set back from the road and the church is about a football field away. It was bright red inside the triangle with an outlining of yellow/orange. It was moving very slow, there were no sounds except for crickets and the sound of a light breeze through the trees. It was dark except for a few street lights across the street and the sky was clear as a bell. It also had like a white tail coming from the lower left hand corner but it wasn't attatched. I whispered into the phone, oh my god, oh my god, hon, there is something weird in the sky, he laughed and said why are you whispering, I just said I don't know this is really weird. Then the triangle began to get smaller where you could only see a little bit of the red part and the yellow/orange outside. It was still moving slowly up into the sky at an angle towards the Big Dipper. It then began to slowly get bigger again and I saw a red dot fly out of the lower left hand corner and disappear. Then seconds later there were 3 more balls of red. One came out the bottom center, the other to the right of that one and the third came out from the right hand corner, all disappeared in a flash. The triangle stayed at that size and was still slowly moving up into the sky. Moments later I heard an airplane coming from behind me, I turned around and it was going at a high rate of speed towards the triangle. I'm not good with distances but if you out strecthed your arms this is about how far the plane was from the triangle, then the triangle suddenly just disappeared! Then out of the corner of my eye I saw 2 more airplanes coming in the same direction as the first plane. I looked and saw the first plane had turned around coming back towards me.

I saw what I thought was a satellite and pointed it out to my boyfrined. We watched it float across the sky slowly in a very straight line. We were faceing the ocean(East)and it was moving from North to South across the sky. After a few seconds it suddenly slowed down then moved BACKWARDS VERY VERY QUICKLY! From there it started moving very fast and erratically. Most satallites that I have seen in the past move in a very linear pattern at a semi slow and constant speed. This however would shoot across the sky, stop and make a 180 degree turn and shoot diagonally throughout it's random motion. We both kept asking each other if we were seeing the same thing, not quite beliveing our eyes. Whatever it was it gave me chills. Both my boyfriend are avid outdoor types.

Very clear bi-convex disc instantly reverses direction at 15' from observers.,College Park,MD,2004-08-12T21:20:00,disk,12 seconds,"Occurred : 8/12/2004 21:20  (Entered as : 08/12/1904 21:20) Reported: 8/14/2004 5:54:00 PM 17:54 Posted: 8/24/2004 Location: College Park, MD Shape: Disk Duration:12 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38659.html,"Very clear bi-convex disc instantly reverses direction at 15' from observers. While slowly driving east through a residential area in route to a restaurant for a late dinner, my wife (who has a very responsible position in the US space program and is an experienced amateur astronomer who has ground her own telescope mirrors, etc.)and I (thousands of hours experience-in-the-field with sophisticated cameras and electronic instruments tracking anomalous aerial objects and investigating AAO reports)were astonished when a very clear bi-convex disc (about 6"" in diameter and about 1.5"" thick) with interesting surface details visible, suddenly appeared very low above the wet street (it had been raining and a few drops were still falling, but the air was neither misty nor foggy)and moved across the street traveling at a 90-degree angle from the curb.  The street was wet, but there was no standing or pooled water in the area, no lightening, and very little wind at that time.  The object did not appear to be self-luminous (which was probably good, because we could see surface details that could have been concealed by lights) but was very well lighted not only by my car's headlights but by a street light which was directly above the general area.  The bi-convex disc (a color illustration is provided, but it only shows the object edge-on)looked to be made of maybe some hybrid type material that reminded me of nothing so much as tan rock with light gray coloration on the flat top of the disc, which disc also has a flange on both sides, but a flat bottom.  The flange on the top was thicker than that on the bottom.  On both the top and bottom flanges, one could see distinct and slightly inset grooves, evenly spaced like approximately 1/8-inch successive layers of a geological substrate, as if the thing were either constructed in layers or else had some kind of coils (one above the other)upon or just beneath the surface! I have pretty effectively illustrated these in the rendering provided, but have not attempted to illustrate the peripheral planes of successive small, dark 'dots' that actually looked somewhat recessed, in various planes around the thing.  The reason I have not tried to render those dots in the illustration is because I am not absolutely sure whether those recessed dots were between the recessed peripheral grooves (which are illustrated) or actually within them.  I think the later was the case, but just am not sure,  because it all happened so fast.  Anyhow, once the disc (which traveled only about 1/4 to 1/2 inch above the street in a most wonderfully smooth gliding motion resembling an ice hockey puck sliding on ice) came to what may have been the exact middle of the street, and without slowing down (just as the 'textbook' UFO), it immediately was suddenly going the same speed in the opposite direction(!), taking it right back across in front of our car (which was stopped or nearly stopped at that point)for a second-chance view.  When the bi-convex disc reached the curb (at the same place it had suddenly appeared), it just as suddenly vanished right before our eyes!  So, I accelerated up to the nearby intersection, made a fast U turn, and went back, to see if we could see the thing again, or some trace of it, but nothing was found.  No cars with occupants were seen in the area just before, during, or just after the encounter,  but that is not surprising in that residential neighborhood on a rather rainy night.  We heard no sound that we associated with the object.  We felt no electrical sensations or unusual heat or cold, either.  The car engine did not fail, and there was no missing time.  The whole thing was so bizarre that we are still in wonderment about the nature of what was observed.  I do not expect to ever figure that one out.  Whatever it was, it just should not have been there. Was it flying?  Well, yes, incredibly smoothly and close to the street.  The thing showed no pitch, yaw, or roll, whatsoever.  It would not be so troubling had we not seen it so very clearly, in good lighting from our headlights and the street lamp.  I refuse to believe that the thing was a government spy drone of any type, because I doubt we have technology that sophisticated, or even a spy drone that is disc shaped and only six inches in diameter.  I later parked the car in the street and adjusted the position of a white six-inch  ruler laid on the street until it was the same observational elevation above the edge of my car's hood as the bi-convex disc had been, and the six-inch ruler looked the same angular width as the disc when at 15 feet from the car.

Its trajectory was north to south at an altitude of about 1000 feet AGL.  The object was flying level straight in open sky and was approaching a cloudbank.  Just before it reached the clouds it morphed instantly from a 'dome' shape into a 'diamond wedge' and seem to become more transparent, disappearing into the clouds all together.  This was no rogue cloud caught in a fluke wind stream; it flew with a purpose and sense of stealth.  Its flight path was directly under Sky Harbor's approach route and a commercial airliner flew over a few minutes later.  I estimated the size of the object to be that of 2- 3 jumbo jets in length and height.  My girlfriend also witnessed the object and was as stunned as I. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS--MAY 03, 2010.)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Almost 5 years ago I filed a report with NUFORC concerning a cloud shaped/textured object over Phoenix.  Tonight I had some free time and thought I would (after all these years) go back and visit my report.  I was shocked to see that it had been labeled a 'HOAX.'  I can't tell you what I saw that night, but myself and my wife DID see something very strange as described in the report.   In the spirit of truth and disclosure I would please ask you remove the 'HOAX' tag, as this was an honest and accurate report.

As we stood looking, I looked up and noticed a white fuzzy light above us traveling in an oval shaped pattern, and each time it revolved at the right end it sort of ""flashed"" slightly and without stopping, continued it's revolution.  I mentioned it to my husband as it looked to be part of the low cloud coverage (it was very cloudy that evening)....or ""above"" and in the cloud itself.  He thought it was caused by party/search lights, but there was no line of light source to this moving light.  I watched it circle above me, and it appeared to cover about 60 feet from where I stood...I do not know how low it was..and that is strange because the clouds were low, but...it was as high as the cloud....I am a skywatcher, and it just gets me that hardly anyone looks up at the sky.

I never mentioned it to anyone at the club because they would probably laugh at me....but when we were on the ""dock"" patio...the people out there were just dancing or drinking or talking and not paying attention.  It seemed strange that no one would look up...anyway...I cannot figure this one out...My rational mind is trying to reason it out...but this light had an intelligence about it.

I did not want to write about an experience that happened two years ago, but I keep wondering about it and thought if I wrote it down maybe the wondering would go away if someone else said ""hey, that happened to me.""  I do not recall the exact date, but it was September near midnight and the hot summer weather was changing.  It was a full moon and I stepped out on my cement patio to feel the cool air. My dogs were up along the fence making their usual last leg lift before coming inside to sleep. They sleep inside because there are coyotes in the neighborhood. I live 15 miles north and a little east of town.  It was bright out and while reaching for a chair I looked down on the white cement and noticed a shadow.  It was round.  I looked up and there was nothing up there to be its cause.  I looked on the roof -- perhaps a round object was up there that I didn't know about and it was casting a shadow down on the cement.  Nothing on the roof. I looked in the black Locust tree, maybe there was a round nest up there and it was casting a shadow. All I saw was the shape of the tree and a little light coming through branches. It was bright out and I looked up a little to the left of the only tree in my yard.  The moon was there a minute ago and it wasn't. There was no moon -- In the strangeness of the moment, I didn't put that piece into the puzzle until it was all over.  I was not frightened.  I looked back down at the round shadow on the patio.  Still there and it was about ten feet in diameter.  I know because after the event I ran into the house and got a tape measure. But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Again I tried to find an overhead cause for the shadow on the patio and I was looking up and around and I noticed one of my dogs was watching something up in the sky.  Every so often he would jump into the air like he was trying to catch something. I walked around looking up and I walked into the shadow and watching my shadow emerge when I stepped back out.  I stood quietly for maybe 45 seconds and I kept my eyes on it.  I watched the shadow as it started to move across the patio.  The one older dog, laying near my feet, jumped up and ran into the house and the other dog ""followed"" the shadow across the yard -- jumping up and down barking. I remember looking all around when it starte to move and I remember seeing the moon, and the shadow slowly moved off the patio down to the ground and the black circle moved slowly across the light colored sand.  I was walking behind it and I could see my shadow to my left - on the left side of the shadow.  The silent invisible round what-ever picked up speed, a perfect circle was right there to see and follow and I would have, but I was stopped by my fence.  I watched it grow larger as it slithered across the yard and into the street.  It was heading west north west.  And then my dog stopped barking and leaping into the air and the shadow that had been on my patio for no more than two or three minutes had moved up and away.  Obviously when I first looked up at the full moon it wasn't there because the invisible round craft was between eleven and twelve o'clock position in the night sky and it was blocking my direct line of sight.  It blocked the shape of the moon but the object in front of the moon gave itself away by casting a shadow on my patio.  And I think it was close, maybe 50- 80 feet over my head (?) and that is why my dog was leaping into the air trying to catch it --- it was close enough to his senses to ""leap up and catch.""  I saw nothing but a round shadow on the ground and I saw nothing to be the cause. The sky looked bright and normal for a full moon out in the country.  No light pollution.   There was no sound except my dog barking and just one other thing.  When I went inside to get the tape measure, I noticed my five Koi were racing around their pond. As usual their covered porch, shades drawn, was in the dark and they should have been sleeping.  How did they know there was a noiseless invisible, shadow casting, intruder?  And why were they, and one dog upset, and I wasn't?",2004-09-01T00:00:00,39.0152,-119.7506

After 30 minutes, i grew curous that it had not stopped, and went outside in the garden to look for this mystery 'helecopter' type sound. I stepped through the garden on to the street and looked.. what i saw i will not forget. There was a dark triangle drifting around the sky at fairly fast speeds and acceleraton, seemingly scanning the area i live in.  It was triangular with lights on the tips and was spinning slowly, and was turning at speeds that were impossible. It seemed that i had only just got to the end of my garden pat when the thing turned and converged over where i was. I ran inside and after about 15 minutes, the sound stopped. I asked my mother about it the next day, and she said the sound had awoken her and that she had seen it from her window. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

April 21st, 2004. It was around 2:45 - 3:00 AM when the event took place.  I had recently come home from a friend's house around 2:30 AM, after playing guitar and drinking coffee. Everyone at my house was in bed sleeping and I was all by myself. I realized that there was a storm brewing up in the sky, and being an avid storm watcher, I decided to stay up even later in hopes of seeing a few good bolts of lightning. I sat on my front porch watching for about 10 minutes and there wasn't much lightning except for one miniscule bolt. The sky looked as though it was full of energy. Greenish grey clouds were to my left and pinkish grey clouds to my right; the sky was completely overcast with no stars.  I sat there longer hoping the best was yet to come for the thunderstorm. Wihtin another minute or two, out of nowhere, a tremendous bolt of lightning shot down from the sky, one of the biggest I think I've ever seen, lighting up everything around me for a split second. Deafening thunder crashed across the sky almost immediately after the lightning struck down probably only a couple of KMs south of my porch, and south of the town. I sat on the porch very excitedly and didn't take my eyes off the sky.  Within a minute or two of the lightning, something else caught my attention in the sky. In my periphereal vison I spotted what first appeared to be a couple of shooting stars, falling into my view from behind the roof of the porch. As I looked on, I was able to focus on the falling objects as they suddenly started to slow down to a near halt. I quickly realized that I wasn't quite looking at shooting stars anymore, I was looking at two orange, horizontal ovals, both with noticeable dark oval rings that contained more orange within. The orange was dull and dark looking, as the objects appeared to be flying through the cloud cover. After the objects slowed down from falling straight down into view, they began to change direction at impressive speeds and impossible angles. At this point though, I couldn't quite tell if I was looking at two separate objects or just one. Both ovals flew perfectly side by side and in sync and the long sides of the ovals always stayed horizontal, even when making hairpin turns. After a couple of impressive turns, the ovals both made a sudden turn at a crazy angle and started to head Eastward to where the lightning had bolted down. As the ovals raced accross the sky, they drifted apart from one another and I  knew then for sure that I was watching 2 separate craft. After splitting up, one changed direction mid way and started to travel upward, while the other continued on an angle accross the sky and upward. As the one went straight up, the other climbed to a higher altitude on an angle and quickly made a sharp inverted angle turn back towards his companion (West). Just like they had it timed to the milisecond, the two objects intecepted one another and the object flying upward made a 90 degree turn on a dime and at the exact moment it intercepted its friend. Both objects then continued back in tandem, West accross the sky at very quick speeds and made one last turn-on-a-dime, zig-zag pattern turn before they decided it was time to bolt back North over the top of my house. The objects flew away at an fast speed and in a straight line. Before they disappeared the objects made a very loud, very shrill, hawk-like squeal, immediately after which, they picked up immense speed.  Other than this squeal noise, the objects made no other noises whatsoever. The objects maintained the same colour and shape and didn't have any blinking lights. They flew like nothing I've ever seen before. The objects appeared very shortly after the lightning had struck and seemed to fly around the perimiter of appriximately where it had struck. Not to mention the energy emitted from a bolt of lightning as big as I saw would surely be able to attract something's attention from miles away. The event lasted approximately 30 - 45 seconds. All details and drawings are as I documented directly after event took place, as I couldn't sleep too well after that.

I can't possibly imagine that the light was caused by advertising lasers as there would be absolutely no way to determine where the advertiser was located on the ground (hence not a very effective means of advertising).....also, there was no light trail leading to a spot on the ground like a traditional advertising spot light would have (either the single oscillating beam kind or the newer 4 -beam type that makes the ""figure-8's"" in the sky).  Also, when I saw the light, it was in the early AM when all retail would be closed.  While brighter than a star, it really wouldn't have been all that noticable unless you looked up into that exact area of the sky and you realized it wasn't the ""normal"" red color of an airplane wing light and that it was stationary (in other words, it didn't appear to be anything designed to attract the attention of peo ple on the ground).  Lastly, the area I saw it over contains warehouses, some residential subdivisions and vacant fields but no retail or late night places such as bars or all-night restraunts.  Here's a thought - The Tweeter Center (the Chicago area's main outdoor music amphitheater) isn't far away from the area in Tinley Park where I saw the light....could they possibly have a laser projection system that was pointed upward instead of towards the stage???  I've been to Tweeter in the past however and I think all of their lighting and projection stuff is under a pavilion roof so it wouldn't have exposure to the sky...also I don't recall any clouds the evening I saw the light that a laser would bounce off of....it just seemed to be hovering mid-air in a clear sky (but no indication of anything solid attached to, or behind the light).  Also, I think 4/24 was too early in the season for Tweeter to be having concerts and even if they were, the event  would have been long over at the time I passed the area.  Anyone else have thoughts on the mystery?? ((NUFORC Note:  Please see original report, submitted on April 24, 2004, which has this addendum posted to it.

At 16:45 hours, I was sitting by the pool at the Autumn Park Apartments in Charlotte, NC, watching a De Havilland Dash 8 banking on a final approach to the Charlotte Douglas Airport, I observed a chevron shaped craft that looked at my vantage point to almost collide with the Dash 8. It seemed to come out of nowhere. It flew into my field of vision so quickly that it took me a second to focus on it. At first I thought the black chevron was a turkey vulture, but soon realized that it was flying too fast and dead straight, SW to NE. We were facing NE.  My wife has a compass on her key chain. The object was flying with a purpose. It made no noise. It took my wife awhile to see the object and by that time it was a black dot in the sky, heading in to the horizon. She thought it had to be a military or business jet because of the speed and the manner it was flying, but what I saw was too small and not shaped like any aircraft I know of and I can identify any type plane flying. The Dash 8 was about an inch long in the sky with my hand outstretched and my fingers apart. The object was about 1/8 to a ¼ inch. It never deviated from its flight path and it seemed to me that it passed very close to the Dash 8. The sky was partly cloudy with two different cloud decks. The object and the airliner were both below the lowest cloud deck. I do not know the altitude the planes fly at that point from the airport. The distance is 12.5 miles due SW.

Late in the afternoon, I saw something that looked to be a dark spot on the sun. I pulled over and got out my binoculars. The sun was too bright, so I waited till the sun started to set. Soon, the dust from the earth allowed my binoculars to see what cannot be anything but UFO’s.  First there was the large round ship that I could see with my naked eye and gave me the reason to pull over, (thinking it was a sunspot). When I looked below the large ship, I saw six smaller ships lined up three in a row, like on a dice, all at 45 degree angles. Next to these “dots” was a long dark bar (like a pencil) that was twice the length of the large sun spot ship. All these items were stationary is space between earth and the sun. I did an experiment to see if I was just seeing things. I positioned myself in front of distant telephone poles and placed the UFO’s directly behind them.  I watched as the group slowly dropped at the same rate as the sun. They started above the telephone wires and as the sun set they ended up below the telephone wires till they all sunk into the horizon.

I was driving home from school for Christmas break and I was in the middle on the countryside between Savannah and Warner Robins Air Force Base, but slightly south, if you were to draw a line. It was a clear night and the sky was filled with stars. I noticed there were several cars pulled to the side of the road in front of me. There was no other traffic and they still had lights on etc. People were standing by their cars and looking southeast over a field and above a pine forest. When I looked I saw a triangular shape that was indescribably huge. It was defined by colored lights. I think they were red blue and green, and I think they were in the corners and maybe along the edge of the triangle. It was hovering not far above the trees at a distance of maybe a couple or three hundred yards from yhe road. Even at this distance it was enormous, as if a football stadium had taken flight. Of course, as things go, this is all I can remember. I didn't even remember this for a long time and even then I wasn't sure it was real until I heard someone describing the same thing on Coast to Coast with Art Bell. The memory loss I can not explain but I understand that it is not entirely uncommon, although these days more people seem to be seeing these things. I can't imagine that it was man made...we are simply not that scientifically advanced. It was huge, motionless, and silent.",2004-09-09T00:00:00,32.02970094086022,-81.13525336021505

Full Description of event/sighting: The witness to this sighting sent an email to me informing me of what he saw and asked if I would be able to call him as it was a little hard to explain what was observed. I did call him the next evening and took the report which is below.  The man told me that he is the type of fellow who watches the night sky as he has a really interest in astronomy and mentioned that he also had found me through the Jeff Rense website.  The fellow went outside to have a cigarette when he first saw the light/object. At first the man thought it was a satellite. The object was as bright as the planet Venus and heading in a northerly direction traveling from the south on a straight line. As the object moved across the sky another two lights/objects shot out of it, one light heading to the east and the other towards the west. Both of the lights that shot off together went at the exact same time. Also they were not as bright and allot smaller than the main light. The main light never lost it's brightness as it moved across the sky. The witness believes the object he was observing was at a very high altitude. The object was visible to the fellow for approx: 30 to 40 seconds before it finally disappeared. All of the object were white in color and no tail or trail was seen following behind each of them.

I saw lots of things since my childhood but yesterday was quite remarkable. I went to get my son in the South East of Ottawa and saw a big light, low above the city, lower than a jet a bit higher than a Cessna. I thought it was a star but when I parked my car, I then realized it was too low and moving in a up and down motion going toward NW.  I watched it from my car trough small trees with my binocular, I did not get out of the car being in a parking lot, I did not want to get too much attention... After ten to 15 minutes my son arrived. I showed him the light and told him we would follow it. I was drawn by this thing.  Needless to say that my son was too. I drove North, trying not to loose it. We got on Industrial blvd direction West , We could see it going lower and further away. We decided that the best lookout was the Rockcliffe (Higher point to look over Hull and Gatineau) one since this thing was going to cross the river. Trying to get there fast, we ended up wasting time trying to find a shortcut to get to the lookout. From the lookout, using binocular 35X 7-21, we watched it for at least ten minutes. It must have been around 10:30 at the time.  The ""Light"" was over the city of Gatineau still moving in a NW direction. It was not perfectly round, it looked like a pinkish/orange crescent from where we were. We stayed there for about another ten minutes and we decided to pursue it . We got onto the Mc Donald Cartier bridge and followed the 50 direction Montréal. We could not see it for a few minutes and then we realized it was gone. After a few minutes of driving on the 50, we saw (Not sure if this is the same light or if these were two different thing?!) a pale orange light low over Ottawa in a South East direction, kind of where we were standing before crossing the river!!! I decided to take blvd de l'aéroport exit and drove south toward Maloney blvd. The light was getting bigger, coming toward us from Ottawa over the river. My son started to freak out, I did not since we were now heading toward the core of Gatineau.  I turned on Maloney direction West and I could see it coming from the West now, heading toward us. I drove for a minute then got in a parking lot( Small Shopping Centre). The traffic on the road for that time was usual. I jumped out of the car and saw the big light turning bright white, as it got closer. There was a bigger light in the middle of two small lights, one on each side. No green or red lights like regular planes and no flashing light either. To add to the mystery, no noise at all. I don't know if it was the city noises burying it's sound but if a regular plane would have been there at the same place, we would have heard something !? We live close to the Ottawa Airport so we are very familiar with usual civil planes... It crossed the blvd going in a South East direction and as it turned it's side to cross over the street, my son kept yelling this is not a plane!  He was spooked! I was totally fascinated, I had my hair standing up all over my body and I taught it was wonderful, it (I know this will sound weird) seemed to change shape as it was crossing over the blvd, I could not see the shape very definitely but it was kind of weird, a red light appeared and we could see a small white light trailing this massive black shape unfolding in front of our eyes. I vaguely saw that it was very huge and still can't tell the exact shape of the side. It was so close that it seemed unreal to see this. It was, I think within one Km from us flying toward the ground, like in approach for landing. The only airport close by in this direction was the Museum of aviation on the other side of the river. I can't tell if it was really over it or not but it seemed really close. Then as it was now going toward the ground, it turned straight for us in a slow wide turn revealing it's top and then it's front. At that moment, I yelled too! This was no civil plane, no doubt, we saw a V shape. My legs began to soften as my brain was analyzing and concluding we might not be safe there... The V was flat and wide, and I could see on each branch a row of white lights.  I can't really say how many, I think it was five or six on each side, they looked like fluorescent tubes side by side, except that these were separated so it looked like tiny rectangles aligned side by side in a black frame. I don't remember seeing the thickness of the shape, at that moment, I taught this might be what people call a ""Black Triangle"" Then it slowly continued it's turn toward west and we lost it because it was too low. I decided to get out of there. For a second, I did not believed, it was unreal and at the same time too real and way too close! As I drove West on Maloney, I think I saw it kind of hovering close to the ground near a wooded area in the back of a big Industry, aligned with Kettle Island and with the Museum of Aviation on the other side of the river. At that point, it was very overwhelming for both of us. I should have called the police, I know, but I was afraid to do so. We drove home in Ottawa South and did not see anything after that but planes. I wish I had a camera, this would have been a heck of a footage!  Thank you to the person for the report.

We took the scope and went to the park by our house where it was clear from any other houses and trees. When we got there at about 23:00 hours we could see three of them come from the west to the east. They seemed to stop over the Superstition Mountians. They stopped in mid air and then went to the south and then very fast up to the east. They would stop and hover and go up and down and left and right. Then all at once there was a larger one that seemed to come up in front of us (we were facing the east) it was larger and brighter than the others.It went to the right and then stopped.It looked to both of us like a deep v.

I waited for my dog to do it's business and happened to glance up in a SE direction at the skies directly above my neighbor's tree, and happened to notice a series of lights floating or hovering at at pproximately 3500 ft, tor possibly higher, the shape of the object seemed to change from spherical to triangular.

There seemed to be a aura or haze around the lights, but I did'nt have my glasses on so it could have been my eyes.

Portage la Prairie is approximately 5-8 miles from an ex military base which was converted to a private flight training  facility for training of  military pilots back in late 90s.

I went to look for a disposbale digital camera but they were expired.  I went to use my video camera but my battery was dead.   There was no noise associated with the lights, helicopters from the base are usually audible from where I live when flying at that approximate altitutde,  I came back every so often to check if the lights were still there, at approximately 4:10am they had either moved off into the distance or were gone as I did not seem them as clearly as I had when I first noticed them.

Approx. 9 pm on Sunday night, my friend and I (we're both college students, both in our twenties) happened to notice 4 bright lights perfectly aligned in the sky, brighter than stars and seemingly in some sort of formation. We found it odd and began to drive further out into the country to get a better look. As we drove, the objects began to break formation, one even shot fairly quickly straight up into the sky. This left 2 of the objects, which had begun to blink red, green and white lights, remaining in the formation while the other two headed off in opposite directions. Even more intrigued, we drove out to a country road and parked the car, fascinated by what we were now seeing... the 2 crafts that had taken off were now inexplicably back, as well as a few more... all in all we believe there were at least 8 of these at varying points in every direction of the sky. At this time, they were all blinking, hovering (sometimes flying) and spaced at intervals, yet didn't appear to be much bigger than what an airplane flying by may seem to be.  Also at this time we were still trying to convince ourselves that perhaps these were some sort of strange airplanes or military crafts (though I've never seen an airplane that could shoot straight up into the air, and there's no reason why 8 of these blinking objects would be patrolling the sky)... This continued for approx. one and half hours, at which time one of the objects which was low in the sky began all of a sudden to increase greatly in size, and took the appearance of a large ball of white light (Much bigger than a planet, and definitely in our atmosphere). It began to move quickly directly toward where we were sitting in our car on the side of the road, and as it approached it was very low, about tree line. There wasn't any noise except for a sort of low chugging sound, no emissions from the craft and no seeming way to propel it. It flew directly over our car and I got a good look at the underside of the craft, which I can only describe as a sort of rectangular shape with 3 bright white lights in a row (much like a large traffic light flying over the car, except all 3 lights were white.) Also on one side of the craft was a small blinking red light, and a green one on the other. After this craft flew over us and continued on, the other crafts began to blink sporadically and almost resembled faint strobe lights. *It should be noted,too, that during these few hours all of the crafts were alternating between hovering in the sky and flying around, so that at times some seemed to be dangling from strings in the sky, some seemed stationary, and some had no pattern at all other than to fly back and forth.* Awed by this sight, we decided to go out the next night (last night) as well and look for these objects, and sure enough they were there again. This time, though none of them came down to our level or flew over our car, 3 seperate crafts at about half hour intervals went from being small, blinking things to the large white lights that we first saw the day before. Each time this happened, the object would go from being small and blinking, to large and glaring, and then fade back to blinking and ascend straight up into the sky. All three were in the North-Northeast sky.",2004-10-27T00:00:00,40.74201321839081,-82.54685747126437

Honestly it was like no metal I have ever seen.  It had no wheels on it.

It had a full faced helmet on, but not like a motorcycle helmet.  It only had a small black oval at the eye area for it to see out of.  Neither of us saw any kind of skin what-so-ever. Every inch of it's body was covered.  Now it was a very hot night.  There is no way it was a person sitting on a bicycle completely covered including gloves and boots, it just doesn't make sense.

The photos that I am sending to Washington are extremely controversial. I shot them on June 5th 2004 in Sacramento at the State Capitol. The photos are historical for several reasons. June 5th 2004 is the day an American President died. Secondly the photos show that the flags at the State Capitol are flying at half mast. Thirdly…the photos are rare in that only less than a handful were shot between 8PM through 9PM on the date specified (6/5/2004). Although I losely use the term that less than three people  were shooting photos on the north side of the Capitol. This is not an assumption on my part. This is a fact. History will demonstrate that fact. A UFO perhaps a mile above ground level hovered over the state capitol while I was aiming up at the dome, or rotunda. I've got GREAT digital photos of the event. These photos are HISTORICAL! ((NUFORC Note:  We have not received the photo yet.  We will assess their merits, when they arrive at our Center.

I was taking out the garbage very late last night. I glanced up and saw a fairly dim shape, like the wings of an old-style plane, rectangular and wide, moving overhead, but without a nose or a tail. The size was approximate to that of a plane flying over head, the hieght it would be when approaching a nearby airport, but it seemed MUCH higher than that. I couldn't hear an engine of any type, and it was moving FAST, over head and gone in the distance in under 15-20 seconds, disappearing into the haze on the horizon.  It was moving east/south-east. I am in Woodland hills, and it was almost directly overhead, a bit to the north, and passed the length of the San Fernando Valley, then out over what I assume would be East L.A., maybe Glendale and then over San Bernardino. The color was a pale greenish-blue, but NOT glowing - a faint color.  The thing that set me off was that there were no running lights of any kind, no identifying shape.  I always look up at the sky when I go out at night, to look at the stars, the moon, and when I saw this, I kept waiting for it to become recognizable, something I could explain. I still can't explain this. My gut reaction is that it was some very large orbital object, perhaps the international space station, but it seemed far to large for that.

Craft Description: from out of my office window I observed what I thought to be a large bed sheet (king sized) caught in the wind about 300 yards away and approximately 150 yards off the ground. I thought it peculiar so continued watching. After approximately 15-20 seconds I observed that the motion of the bed sheet was very odd. The only way to describe what I was viewing at this point of the encounter, is to say that I was looking at a large bed sheet that was caught in a rising thermal and being tossed around as it rose. However, the bed sheet was traveling across my field of vision in a perfect horizontal path. As it approached, instead of the bedsheet being swirled around in a random pattern, I could see that it was revolving with some regularity around an unseen object and traveling in a deliberate path. When the ""bed sheet"" got to within 100 yards from me I could CLEARLY make out the ""object"". What I saw was a 3D cube floating above the ground oriented standing on end. I dont believe that it was rotating. The only way to describe the outer surface of the object is to say that if you took video footage of a large sheet caught in a rising thermal (the sheet fully spread out and tossing in the thermal) and projected that footage on the outside of the 3D cube... that is what I saw. I watched this object for some 2 minutes and saw it very easily. It moved from NW to SE and my guess to speed would be 100 - 175 MPH. It was slow enough that I could see it plainly and watch it as it finally went out of site over the south easterly foothills outside my office window. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The objects vary in speed shape and formation. My family lives in Montville, Ohio.( Geauga County ) We moved to this rural area 8 years ago from Cleveland. We thought UFO's were a joke. Boy were we ever wrong. My sons and daughter all have seen strange sightings across the street in a cow pasture.We have seen things that were not planes hovering in 1 space or things darting back and forth very fast. We have seen somthing like a fire ball pass over us. I was driving home from work on route 528 going north when something very large and slow stopped over my car. It was lower that trees so I knew it could not be a plane. When I arrived home, my daughter ran to the car and told me I wouldn't believe her but this strange object flew very low over the house. Her estimated time was close to when I too saw the object. My 13 year old son watches out the window every night for activities in the sky. He watches in disbelief. The most amazing sight I would never forget is when my husband left for work ( 11:00pm). He pulled out of the driveway and down the street.( I always watch him drive away) He could not have been more than 1 or 2 houses away when we noticed ( my three children and myself ) a strange thing in the pasture very close to the road. It was like red and white lights rotating in a circle very very fast. It looked as if it was a few feet above the ground. We watched in amazement. There is no explantation. It could not be kids doing a prank because the movement was too fast. My daughter had a strange experiance 2 weeks ago. She was driving home from Chardon. She said this green light appeared over her car.Her car stopped. Everything in the car stopped working. She said it looked like the other cars on the road stopped too. My son is reading this and is commenting on the different size and colors. He stated that he saw some split into more than one object. My husband has never seen anything and he thinks we are nuts. When I tell people that we see stuff in the sky we get strange looks. We do not report it to officals or sherriff because! we would be laughed at. I am hoping that you read this and take the time to talk with my son. I told my mother about some of the sightings a few years back. She did not say anything. She was quiet. And then she told me a story about her brother. He lived in Ashtabula county. He said he saw something in the sky that looked like a spaceship. He was not drinking. He ran into the house to tell his wife to look. By the time they went back out it was gone. My mother thinks he called and reported it. All the townsfolks laughed at him. His family thought he was nuts. This happened over 40 years ago. My mother never thought of this story until I told her. She was worried if I told others that I would be laughed at too. The information I gave above is not correct because I do not know the exact days or times. The objects vary in size, color and shape. The pasture that most of the sightings happen at was to be an indain burial mound. Do you think this has anything to do with the sightings ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we doubt that the Indian burial ground has anything to do with their sightings.

Well i was driving back to college and was right outside of Zanesville (or 50 minutes east of columbus)and i was on the phone with my girlfriend while i was driving. She was headed in the opposite direction and was right outside of dayton at the time. There is about 100 miles between us at this point. Its at about 11:30 at night and it is a completely clear night and it was very dark when all of the sudden the shy ahead of me lit up bright blue and took over the whole sky and lasted for a few seconds and quickly faded out. At first i suspected lightning but there was something different about it because it was all around me. Right as it faded out my girl friend said on the phone ""did you just see something?"" and i said ""the whole sky just turned blue"" and she said it just happened here too. I know that lightning can travel but this was not lightning because it rose from the horizon and over took the sky and at the same moment it happened 100 miles away. What do you think that this could possibly be? I check all the news and internet for anything that could have given an indication of some even in the state that could explain it but i found nothing.

I looked up to see only a few stars in the sky; it was the very end of twilight. I then noticed a very faint star that had just appeared. Then I noticed it was moving, but it seemed very high in altitude. I thought perhaps it was a satellite, but there was so much light pollution and so few stars visible, it didn't seem possible that a such a small object would or could be seen and tracked. Then, suddenly, the extremely faint object (it was white, no colors that might indicate an aircraft) grew quite bright. I would call it a 'Flare up' in intensity, but it wasn't flickering like fire might. It radiated a bright, pure white light for about 2-3 seconds. Then the object dimmed to it's original faintness. Then it disappeared altogether. My eyes were strained trying to follow it. A few seconds later the object appeared, moving in a dirction at a perfect right angle to where it had been traveling. Then it dimmed and disappeared. This was not an aircraft I'm familar with. It was far to high for a helicopter, and no sound was heard. I'm not really into UFO reporting, but I am into the truth. And this was high enough on the strange meter that I figured somebody ought to know. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the ""flare"" from an Iridium satellite.

Two rows of lights each row having two lights of the same size and shape.  The horizontal distance between the top two lights were about twice that of the horizontal distance between the bottom two lights which were centered under the top two lights. The vertical distance between the top and bottom rows were about the same as the horizontal distance of the bottom two lights. As we moved closer to the Hwy the treeline blocked our view of the object. I then backed up for a second look and my wife and I once again clearly saw it through the opening in the tree line. It had not moved away and was still in the same position. We heard military aircraft flying close by  (this is a military operations area and they practice here nearly every day). Directly across the highway is a county road where I once lived as a farm boy and the area is very familiar to me. My wife and I proceeded down the road to get a closer look at this object but never saw it again.

When I focused my binoculars on the ones that didn't belong, it was very difficult to estimate the altitude.  If I were to guess, I'd say it hovered at about 500' - 1000'.  The object was not obviously solid, and appeared nearly the same color as the sky.  As it went overhead it had a more discernable shape, a ""dim"" triangle with a light at each point and one light in the center. It appeared slightly darker, but remained a close match to the sky color.  After about 5 minutes of watching, the craft quickly accelerated from it's position directly over Bedichek Middle School at William Cannon and South 1st to what was probably about 500 mph or faster and didn't appear to change altitude - it was observable for another 5 to 6 seconds, and traveled directly over my house in a West (slightly SW) direction.

They were sort of low (below the clouds and well below an airplane that was passing very high in the sky at that time.  They moved counterclockwise incredibly fast and then moved in, toward each other and then away-almost like a dosedo in a square-dance. There was no sound. I then noticed another set of lights over my neighbors house about one hundred and fifty feet away.  Those four lights were doing exactly the same thing.  I thought it must be some reflection of some gizmo on the ground.  But I live on 11 acres.  My neighbor has ten acres.  My neighbor on the other side has 55 acres.  And behind us in a 30 acre preserve.  I could see nothing that would be causing this phenomenon. I began to drive down my road-which is a private road about two-tenths of a mile in distance to my house.  I noticed the left set of lights seemed to be following right above my car. I was in a panic and quickly turned around and sped back to the top of the driveway.  I tried to dial the police on my cell phone but I was not able to get it to work.  My cell phone always works at my property.  I used to have AT&T wireless and switched to Verizon because it always works where I live.  In fact, before I had stopped to get the mail, I had just been on the cell phone.  I didn't know what else to do, so I went to my neighbor who also had those lights above her house, but whose driveway was much closer to the main road.  I skeed her to come outside and asked her if she knew what those lights could be.  She was freaked out and in disbelief.  I want you to know that my neighbor and I are both lawyers, and neither of us are prone to believing anything other than hard evidence.  We chatted for awhile both agreeing that there was nothing we could think of that could explain what we were seeing.  I joked that if I get beamed up, she would at least be able to explain my disappearance to my husband.  I finally got up the nerve to race down my driveway and into my garage, and I thought, that was the end of that.  I have absolutely no knowledge or experience with UFO's.  But the next day, my cell phone would not work..anywhere.  I finally removed the battery and waited an hour.  When I replaced it, the phone worked.

Last evening (November 18)  at approximately 8:45, I began to hear, over the sound of a radio broadcast on my computer, a wierd, deep, almost physical, 'thrumming' noise.  I muted the computer and could hear it somewhat better.  I stepped out onto the back porch to see if I could locate where it was coming from or see anything.  My dog stepped out with me.  It seemed to be receeding as we stepped out,  but it was coming from somewhere overhead. My dog, who was hoping that she was going to get to run off a racoon, stopped mid-stride and immediately assumed a 'Down' poslture.  She looked straight up, however, from this position.  She appeared  afraid to move for a few moments. My husband stepped out onto the porch but the sound had faded away by then.  I and my dog are the only ones that heard it but it was very strange.  It had the same sort of pressure/air pushing  sound that a Chinook helicopter makes when you hear it coming off in the distance.  However, it was very much slower than the sound of rotor blades. And, it was different from a Chinook sound in that it seemed much, much, bigger.  It actually scared me a little and I'm not a fearful person.It was a clear night but, from my vantage point, at least, there was nothing to be seen.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,48.0656,-123.0613

(If I were to hold up a pea as high as I could and look directly at it.) It was a clear night but was still dark out. With no clouds to use as a reference, it was difficult to tell how far up in the sky this object was relative to where I was standing. I assumed at first it was a low flying aircraft on it's approach to the airport coming from the EAST. I thought this was an aircraft possibly in trouble due to the speed and angle of descent compared to most other aircraft that are approaching Orlando's airport. This object came to a sudden halt without making noise and hovered for about 3 seconds before separating into 3 pieces. It was more like the original object kept its size and shape,, but 2 objects broke off the sides of the sphere at the same time. The movement of both side objects was very symmetrical. These 2 objects left a weird trial of what seemed like smoke but was hard to tell. The larger original object never seemed to emit any trail or make any noise. What reminded me of booster rockets off of a shuttle or a multi staged rocket left me to believe at first that this was some sort of secret launch that went awry or a secret shuttle mission that launched however, I knew that all shuttle launches during take off execute a pitch and roll immediately out into the Atlantic so as to be far from land in the event of an emergency. Keep in mind,, I still don't know how far the object was in the sky relative to where I was. Even know I can see the shuttle burn from a day or night time launch from Orlando, the distance would be too far from the cape to see individual rocket boosters fall off. These 2 objects that broke off did not emit any light but the light from the Original object was enough to see these two objects separate from the original at the same time and leave a trail of what looked like white smoke. So far still no noise. Then, 3 seconds after the 2 mini objects broke off,,, a light so bright started to shine everywhere. It wasn't blinding like the sun,, however, it shined brighter. It lit up the whole sky and the neighborhood, brighter than the 12'oclock sun. I stood still and was able to continue looking at the source of the light. The object was still in the same spot in the sky. I thought this was a nuclear blast of the air burst type however, the light kept shining for about 35 to 40 seconds. This light wasn't vibrating or sporadic,,, like you would see in fireworks,, or a flare or a meteorite in the sky. It maintained a constant candlepower without the strobing effect. I remember looking all around to see if this light was concentrated in a specific area. The whole sky and everywhere I looked,, this light was shinning. If it wasn't for me knowing where the object was in the sky,, it would of been hard to tell where the light source was coming from directionally since it appeared to be coming from everywhere. After what seemed like 40 seconds,, this light shrinked back to its source in the sky. The strange thing was that the brightness of the light remained the same while the area it was covering started to shrink back to the object. It took about 5 seconds from when it started shrinking, until all you saw was the object still hovering in the same spot in the sky. Then within a second, this object shot right back up into the atmosphere at what appeared like light speed. It left in the opposite direction, not directly up, more like up and eastward at an angle. The trail it left didn't appear to be smoke. It was more like the trail you would see if you waved a kem-lite in front of your face in the dark from left to right as fast as you can. It took off so fast without noise that it left a light trail for about 2 seconds. According to local radio stations and the local CBS TV affiliate, (www.local6news.com) hundreds of people in Orlando that were traveling to work or on the road reported the blinding light. Most witnesses said it lasted between 30 to 50 seconds. Some drivers were running through traffic lights because they couldn't tell if the lights were green or red. A meteor scientist from Brevard county on the east coast said he witnessed the object that morning and gave coordinates that put the object directly above OIA.

As I often do, I put on our TV in our room which helps me to get to sleep. As I watched a National Geographic special I became groggy. Knowing that keeping the TV on all night bothers my wife, I grabbed the remote and switchd off the TV and quickly fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed an instant after doing so, I was awakend by my wife who questioned me as to ""where I was"". My immediate response was ""in our bed"".  My wife then explained to me that she awoke because she sensed that I was not in bed with her. She then stated that she searched the whole house and even walked to the guard house in her pajamas of our community to see if anybody had been permitted to drive to our residence to pick me up. She was told nobody had come into the community.  Upon her return, she burst into the room and found me in our bed. She stated that my car was in our driveway, and that my walllet, cell phone and money was just as I had left it in our kitchen when we went upstairs, which further upset her. She knows me well enough to know that if in fact I left our home for some reason, I would have taken these items with me. We do not live near any stores or establishments that one could walk to.  As I awoke, she further explained that the covers in our bed on my side looked exactly as if I had pushed them down and left the bed. Realizing that she was not kidding, I informed her that I just turned off the TV and fell asleep. She then reconfirmed that she searched our entire residence and that I was not physically present.  I glanced at the clock and it was about 2:30 am when she stormed into our bedroom and awoke me with this shocking news.  I tried to comfort and console her at this point and confirmd that to my knowledge I had not left our bed, not even to use the bathrooom.  Not really sure what had happened, we went back to bed. When I awoke, I asked her to confirm what had happened and that either her nor I were dreaming. She confirmed it.  Somehow, I do not think either of us actually accepted this event as reality because we awoke and did not talk about it. As a believer, I felt that I needed to let soembody know and help me to understand what might have happened. So I searched the web and found this site to report incidents. I called and was instructed to file this report as I am.  I consider myself of sane and sound mind and am a local business owner.  I was also instructed to have my wife file an incident report which will be done first in the am. I am aslo willing to have this event scrutinized by any means required to validate it including onsite investigation, cameras, lie detectors anything.  It almost seems like something out of the Twilight Zone and I feel more confused than anything.  I am not sure what really happened, the evidence has it that I was some how physicaaly missing form my home for 45-60 minutes without my knowledge.  I was told to examine myself for any marks, and did not find any. However, from the base of my throat to the middle of my chest it is mildly red, as if I had been exposed to the sun. I can tell because when I press teh area, a brief mark apears such as when one gets a sunburn and presses the afected area with a finger. The rest of my body is unaffected.  I welcome any comments and or suggestions.

Before going, we had a little chat. I looked up at him and suddenly noticed a black object which was hovering close by.  I immediately saw it because I'm a bird-watcher, I thought it was an eagle at first. Unfortunately I was shocked when I realized it was not a bird. It is an aircraft and a weird one which I never have witnessed before.  I saw that it is a black disc-shaped object, so the first thing that came to my mind is that this is a UFO. I hoped that it was actually a flattened balloon slowly dropping down, but it wasn't. It floated at the same attitude going forward.  I realized that it is nothing I ever seen. I quickly told my friend to look at it to see if he saw it or not, and whether he knew what the heck it was. He looked back at me after he watched for a while. I could see the same curious look on his face. He thought it was the so-called UFO too. We looked carefully at it as it slowly hovered, just like what helicopters does. I estimated it to be about 100 meters from ground and about the size of a car. As we are living on the 5th and 6th floor we should have heard a sound coming from it, if it had of been a helicopter at that altitude.  The disc flew in a very unique way, it flew like something injured, because it sloped 45 degree to the left then right then left again as it traveled along. If it was flown by humans, they would easily be affected by nausea in such aircraft. I noticed a red light flashing at the back of the craft. Since it is still bright outside, I could barely tell whether it was glowing or not, but I saw the atmosphere near it was a little lighter than normal, maybe it is due to the contrast or maybe it is shimmering. It disappeared in the distance.  We noticed that no one each from our hostel actually saw the object. I'm still in shock and still try my best to understand what it was I saw!

Hi, I went out to my car on Thursday night to get my bookbag, so I could do some homework.  It was a pretty clear night, and often if I am outside and the sky is clear, I will look up at the stars for long periods of time. Well, I looked up while I was taking my bookbag out of my car, and I saw that SOMETHING up there was moving because I could see that motion of stars disappearing and reappearing.  It was larger than a normal plane probably because it flew closer to the ground, I would say about helicopter level.  As it flew northeast from southwest, it flew above my head.  I noticed it was going at a medium pace, and that it was triangle shaped, but also had an indentation at it's base, like a boomerang.  I was stunned because I noticed that craft had no lights whatsoever!!! I had thought that all aircraft were required to have lights!!  I tilted my ear up to the air to listen for sound but there was none.  The bottom of the craft (on the bottom corners) seemed to have a faded dark grey circle.  I could tell it was lighter than the black craft, but I can't say it was light because it was so dark! If I hadn't looked up to see the stars move and realize there was an object I would of never known it was there...completely silent and dark.  It never hesistated, it just flew over me in the course I indicated earlier.  As it flew more Northeast, I tried to spot it, but I could not longer see it. This is my very first unidentified aircraft sighting, even though I have been looking for a very long time!!  I was pretty excited, but not scared. But...when I woke up the next day I realized I felt sick.  I developed a cold.  I don't know if the craft had anything to do with it, but I am getting better now.  I went on the internet to see what I could find about crafts.  Believe me, I was SHOCKED to find out many people have had experiences with black triangles and no sounds!!

While heading eastbound on State Road 26 at around 8:30 pm, give or take about 15 minutes, an orange burst of light caught my attention in my peripheral vision. The night was clear, there were no clouds. I saw an orange light, at first like a dim star, which grew in size or intensity to about four times the size and brightness of Venus. Then another light seemed to grow near this one in the same manner, at about 10 o'clock the original objects position. Then the first object faded out followed by the second. This took place over a 10-20 second period. After this happened, I noticed two objects remaining equidistant circle the area. From my position facing east, they started at the eleven o'clock position and moved to the two o'clock position, and then back again, from left to right. Vertically, if the ground is at  90 degrees and straight up is zero degrees, they were at about 50 degrees up. I have no experience judging distance so this is the only way I can relate it, I hop it helps! Once these two objects returned to the position I originally noticed them, I noticed several other objects, three, I believe. They converged in one central area of the sky.  At this point I pulled off the road to watch them more closely at the state road 26 and state road 29 intersection. I observed the same appearance of the orange lights that I described earlier. Each time I witnessed that, I observed another object. They totalled seven at this point. They were flying in all directions in the sky, but circling to the north of 26. They were about one half the brightness of venus. At some times they were flying quickly while others seemed to maintain position.  The objects themselves flashed white, but intermittently. This is why I was so interested in them, never seeing an airplane like that. The two objects that were keeping the same distance between them as I described earlier seemed to be flashing at eachother. One would flash several times, for different durations, a quick flash followed by a long, at a seemingly random interval. Then the other would start flashing just as the original ended. It reminded me of the lights on a broadband modem, when the computer is connecting to the internet. Once there were seven objects all flying in random directions one flew directly over my position. I can't judge the altitude of it, but it wasn't as high as those jet liners that are seen at night... probably not helping. it was about the size of venus in the sky, but not as bright. The object that flew over me appeared to by triangular, although that was hard to judge. It had three red areas, that looked like the tips of a triangle. the outer points were the brightest, fading into black at the center. It resembled a peice of metal when a torch is held on one side until it gets red hot, fading into the opposite, cooler edge.  The objects maintained their seemingly random flight paths and then fell in line heading southwest at an incredible rate of speed from my position at the intersection . They would have bursts of light that became more uniform in interval instead of the random flashes from earlier, and then accelerated across the sky. I phoned my brother to look outside at home (romney, indiana) to look outside to see if he could see them. He looked east from our house half a mile from US 231 and he saw them. He reported that they were moving at an unbelievable speed and reported that he saw one start flashing really quick and take off. They headed south out of sight.",2004-12-14T00:00:00,40.4803,-86.3947

I parked my car in the drive way blocking the side walk. I just happend to turn my head as I was closing the door and I say this cigar shaped flying craft with fire coming out the back.  My first thought was this plane is going to crash.  It was low and close.  I expected a crash and burn, but it kept going until it disapeared in the horizon.  In the mid 70's my brother and I were driving home one night at about 22:30 hours and we saw this strange light, light up the ground close to us.  It caused us and another vehicle to swerve off the road.  Since then I have not had any sightings.  I just retired from government service.  I was a top level manager so I couldn't bring this up.  Not a good career move. I'm retired now and don't have to worry about this. My question is, what am I suppose to do about this?  What did all this mean?

I said to my son, ""Look, what is that?"" The aircraft seemed to be at least as big as half of a football field. I was traveling about 35 mph and was passing this thing. It made no noise and just was hovering there above the houses. I slowed down to get a better look. It was dark gray. It was triangular shaped and I could see a white light at the end of the wing on the underside. It was so low and large that I couldn't see the other wing. I remember a red light in the middle of it. It was so close to me that I could see the square panels and what looked like the rivets that held it together. I drove to the shopping center on the corner of Margarit Wallace Road about 1/4 a mile down the road and pulled in to wait for it to fly over. It never did. I wanted to drive back but my kids were frightened so I went home. I never called the police or anyone to report it. I didn't think anyone would believe me.

Upon closer examination I noticed the officer walking back to his car and saw him looking towards the sky near a grocery store.  I looked towards that direction and saw a huge black rectangle with large windows on the side.  The interior of the object was light up well enough that I could tell the mass of the object was very large.  I would estimate the object to be as wide as a five lane highway or at least 100 yards wide.  I seem to remember seeing other hyper bright ( xeon or blueish in color like the new BMW cars headlights ) lights on the exterior of the object.  The object passed about 200 feet off the ground nearly directly over the Schnucks store flew over hwy 67 and out of my sight.  The object made no sound as it flew overhead.  As it passed I noticed movement inside of the back windows of the object and thought I saw someone move from the interior portion of the craft to look out the window ( perhaps to see the lights of the police car ).  My immediate impression was that this was some sort of military stealth blimp.  I do recall other colored lights on the exterior of the object, but can’t be certain of the configuration or more specifics because my attention was diverted to the large window and the movement I discussed.  The next day I told my friends I had visited that evening and my then girlfriend about my experience.  I hadn’t reported it to anyone else initially until I saw a documentary on the police officers who followed a similar object on the exact same night.  This year I contacted Darryl Barker (a local producer who has a website on the incident) here in St. Louis and spoke with him about my sighting.

Interviewed NUFORC case witness by UFOMIG.com investigator Brian Adams for Missouri sighting on Dec. 27, 2002 near Roby, MO. Witness name responds> Since there are many questions, I will answer them in Q/A format one at a time to the best of my memory, for less confusion. What first made you aware of the object(s) when you were traveling? Since we live in a big city here, I'm absolutely facinated by the dark country skies to which every star in the sky can be seen, so as usual I was looking up at the stars through the front windshield and passenger window while my husband was driving. I immediately became aware when I saw the red flashing lights out of the corner of my eye.  You know those Christmas lights they call ""chasers"" that you can set the speed of the flashing by a remote near the plug-in?  That's what these lights looked like, very fast and rotating around the the circular perimeter, it was hard to miss.  With my mouth wide open in complete awe, I grabbed my husbands arm and said ""LOOK at that!"" What direction in the sky were they sighted? We were traveling North, and the lights were moving from east to west. Did you use any binoculars or use eyeglasses to view them? No sir, I don't wear glasses and we didn't have any binoculars unfortunately. How were the lights strobing like quick short flashes, random around the circular perimeter? They were flashing rapidly (red)in a rotating fashion (like the lights were chasing each other) around the circular perimeter. I'm not sure if my eyes weren't just getting blurry from staring so long at these things, but I thought I might have seen them change colors once or twice, to the color of white, very quickly as well. Did you stop and get out of your vehicle to watch at all? Unfortunately no.  I wanted to but there were 16 inches of snow on the ground (there were no place to pull over because of the snow drifts from the plows)and it was 9 degrees out that night, and we were late getting to our next destination.  We just drove very slowly observing them from the windshield of our mini-van. Have you seen any ufos before this sighting? Yes, but these two were very different from the other time.  The first time was about 1993 in Kokomo, IN. My mother and I were getting some groceries out of the trunk of her car (sometime around 9PM I suppose, it was over 10 years ago) when a triangular object with 3 big red lights on each point of the triangle (the lights weren't flashing) passed low in the sky right over our heads.  It was about the size of a football field and moved silently. It was made out of some kind of black metal and had some kind of groovy patterns on the underside. It flew just above the trees and was so low that we could see these patterns. I don't remember much about being 15, but I'll never forget that.  It was my curiousity in researching if anyone else had any similar experiences with both of these types of craft that led me to your website. Did you tell anybody you visited about the sighting? No. We were travelling with our roomate and her 5yr old son at the time to visit my husbands grandmother. My roomate and her son were asleep in the backseat of the van, and I didn't want to scare them. Did they tell you if they have seen or heard about any ufos in their area in the past several years? My husband's grandfather used to watch them from the front porch of the same house we were staying at when my husband was about 10yrs old (he's 24 now).  Oddly, every Tuesday or Wednesday (it was one day a week at relatively the same time at night, around 9PM) it would appear in the same place in the sky.  The front door of the house faces to the east and the craft could be seen from just above the trees.  He passed away in 1995, and has been known to watch this thing once a week for years while he was alive. I heard this directly from my husband. Are you or your husband from Missouri? I'm originally from Indiana, and my husband and I live in Virginia Beach due to him being stationed here in the Navy.  He's from Nebraska. My husbands family is from Missouri though, and his grandmother still lives there, whom we were staying with for the holidays. One more thing to add....  They were stationary when I first noticed them, then they began circling around each other very rapidly while moving from east to west and west to east again across the sky...sort of like they were playing or dancing. There were no other aircraft in the sky, and it was around midnight at the time.  There were no other cars on the road at the time either. We watched them for approx. 10 minutes, then they began to dim, or maybe get farther up into the sky so that they appeared to be dimmer I'm not sure, but then they just vanished. I would like to thank you for sharing your similar story with me.  I'm glad there is someone out there who saw the same thing and I know Im not crazy now. I've never shared either of these experiences with anyone else, besides my mother and my husband out of fear that they would think I'd lost it.  But I know in my heart these were not aircraft I was seeing, planes and jets just don't move like that.  It helps to know that people like you are out there investigating, and bringing some comfort to those like me, in knowing we are not alone. There IS something going on out there.

We crossed over a railroad crossing and I noticed a bright light that I had never seen before shining through the trees.  We came to a clearing and saw an aircraft gliding through the sky very quickly.  I stopped the car to watch.  The craft was at the height of a low flying helicopter and didn't make a sound.  At one point it was hovering almost directly ontop of us, as if it was watching us as we were watching it.  We continued to watch the craft for approximately 3-5 minutes.  A car was coming behind us so we decided to leave as the UFO began to glide out of sight. We continued south on the same road for about 30 seconds when we saw another one.  It was so far away that it looked like a bright star but it gradually came closer to where it glided directly ontop of us again.  I parked the car one last time to watch.  We stayed for about two minutes because we were freaked out and because it seemed that the craft lowered in the trees behind us. We stopped at a stop light about a half mile away from the incident.  At the same time my friend and I heard a noise that I can't describe in writing.  All I can say is that it sounded like sound a UFO made on the cartoon Scooby-Doo.  Trust me it wasn't the stop light either.  We heard the sound one more time about another half mile away. It was really dark out that night so it was hard to say what the exact shape of the craft was.  A disk or saucer shape is the closest comparision I can make.  There were white lights around the outside and about three blue lights in the center.  I would say that both crafts had the same description.  We had a better view with the first.

It did not appear to be moving and my first thought was that it could be the hospital helicoptor however there was no noise. I watched for a few minutes and it seemed to get slightly brighter and I still could not identify it. I grabbed my digital camera and am now embarrassed to admit I did not feel comfortable stepping outdoors to get the photo. I took the photo through the screen door. I quickly enlarged the photo on the tiny camera screen and was still unable to identify what I was looking at. As I prepared to take another photo the bright light disappeared. It was as if someone had turned off a light switch. This experience has nagged at my brain since as I have not been able to think of a reasonable explanation.

Out of nowhere it seems(though I believe it flew from the north) this giant, swirling mass of light appeared in the sky. It was no particular shape, but was more like an egg in a frying pan, or an amoeba.  It changed its shape, and its size as well. It appeared to go farther away, then closer, then farther, this could explain the apparent size change.  We watched it pulsing there for at least 30 minutes, my wife wanted to call the police but I assured her that it would not help. All of a sudden, the white, bright thing began to change colors, first to a reddish brown, then to a dark cobalt blue, and finally it culminated(and stayed) at a dark steel gray color, that was still as visible as the original object(for it shined so).  This color transformation took perhaps 10 minutes. Then the craft began an ascent, higher and higher it went as it spiraled around, and then at the end of our time watching it, it came down, very, very quickly. It came so close to our house and the trees around us that the trees actually shook, and the grass waved.  My kids were scared and I admit, I was also, my wife ran inside, and you could feel the heat from the thing. Then there was a sudden coolness, calmness, and just a general feeling of peace about the place as we watched it inch towards us. It took on a more readily noticeable shape, something like a circle, and shot into the sky, disappearing on its way up.

I quickly glanced up and saw three very bright metallic spheres moving about in no particular formation or pattern. I ran into the house and grabbed my ziess binocs and viewed these objects for several minutes before one broke away at tremendous speed from the other two and disappeared in a matter of seconds. The other two seemed to circle each other until they appeared to be one object (could have been an elevation issue) and then the two were clearly present again as two objects. The spheres were at a very high altitude behind a very bright blue sky with a setting sun. The objects were above what I consider cirrus or cirrus stratus clouds. Those skinny almost transluscent clouds. Other than those clouds, the sky was totally clear and blue. The two remaining spheres simply disappeared while watching them.

It was way off. I was on the east side of Albuquerque, and this thing looked to be to the extreme west, southwest end of Albuquerque, or even possibly a little farther out over the mountains. It was maybe 10,000 feet up. I regularly observe Venus, and Mars, and know exactly what both look like, and where to find them in the sky. This object was way brighter than Venus, or any star, and it was still broad daylight. I stopped passing the ball and just stared at it. One of the kids (ab out 10 years old) asked what I was looking at, and I said I didn't know. The kid laughed and said it was a UFO. I ruled out a Hot Air Baloon, Venus, a helicopter, and it obviously wasn't a plane because this object hovered there for more than an hour and a half. I should note that it's position in reference to Earth never changed. During this 100 minutes, any celestial object would have disappeared over the horizon, but this one remained at the same relative position over the horizon the whole time. After we finished playing catch, me and my son drove down to Target, still watching this object hovering in the same spot. By this time I was fairly sure it was a UFO. Now here's how I know this wasn't venus, because if you do your homework, you'll probably conclude that I was looking at Venus, especially as bright as it is right now, but this was August of 2003. Venus wasn't unusually bright then, like it is now. This is how I judged how far off and how high it was. Because as the Sun went down over the western horizon, and the western sky turned red, this object also went from glowing a bright white, to turning red as the sky turned red. And when the sky went from red to dark, the object went from reddish, to disappearing in the darkness. So my conclusion is that it was in fact not Venus, it was in the atmosphere, it turned red as the sunl! ight weakened, and disappeared in the dark because it's glow was actually the sunlight reflecting off of it. I should also note that about a month later, someone sent George Noory a photo of a UFO over arizona within a month of my sighting, and it looked like the same thing I had seen. So two similar sightings within a month, one in New Mexico, and one in Arizona. The other thing I found totally suspicious was that this thing had to be on Kirtland Air Force Base's radar. It was within a few miles of the base, but no aircraft ever approached it the whole time it was there. I should also note that it hovered not to far from where air traffic comes in to the Albuquerque Sunport. However, I never saw any commercial flights coming in in that vicinity all during the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

There was a bright object moving across the sky.  It wasn’t a shooting star, It was moving slow.  It wasn’t a satellite either, It was much brighter and moving much faster than a satellite would,  most likely in a much lower earth orbit. I have seen many satellites in the night sky and this was not one. And it sure wasn’t an airplane. There were no running lights blinking away.  I watched it disappear over the horizon and then turned back to look at Mars.  It was gone.  Where there once was a bright star,  there was nothing.  My Girlfriend then told me that while I was inside,  she saw the object begin to move from its stationary spot in the sky before she pointed it out to me.  A while later, I saw the true Mars rising.

I was riding with a friend Friday night, driving from San Diego, California, to the San Jose area up near San Francisco. We were driving through the San Joanquin Valley area when I started to spot some lights in the sky off to the East side of the highway. What caught my attention was that I saw 4 white lights rise up, almost in a straight line, then angle off, turn, and seem to dim. Then the aircraft apparently turned to face the highway again and I saw the four lights level off and look real bright. It looked like a plane coming into land at an airport. I watched it land, but right after it came in close to the ground, it turned, and rose straight up off the ground again vertically. That's what made me think it was a helicopter.  I thought it was strange and mentioned it to my friend. I looked back over my shoulder to watch it some more and it continued making odd ariel manuevers. We kept driving, however. I thought that would be it, but we kept driving, and further up, I spotted it again. This time I was able to point it out to my friend. Just like before, these lights made the same odd pattern. They rose up in a straight line, banks, and flew around over more crops.  I don't know how many their were, but I spotted three at one time, so, I know it wasn't the same aircraft, and I saw at least one land. This luckily happened closer to the highway than the other lights and I could make out more. There was a flashing light at the top of the aircraft, which, everything about it seemed to say helicopter to me, but I couldn't see it's shape, just lights. When this helicopter landed, it was facing a vehicle that was parked in a field at the edge of some tall crop. The vehicle had lights on, maybe a door open with interior lights on as well, but I couldn't see anyone. The helicopter sat there on the ground for a bit, then lifted back up, circled, and then turned on a spotlight. It actually flashed across the highway for a moment as he began flying over the crops again.  All this occurred between Kettleman City and Los Banos along the I-5. I saw more of this  towards Kettleman City than Los Banos. The number of lights and their frequency tapered off as we drove further north.  Now, I know that these aren't exactly black triangles I'm reporting and I'm not native to that area, but this just seemed really odd to me. Is this normal for the San Joanquin Valley? It's just crops out there, no really large townsthat I could see. I find it hard to believe that each farmer out there has his own private helicopter to crop his fields with at night, and I doubt I watched a half dozen police helicopter look for someone.  What did I see? Is there some explanation for this? Maybe someone who lives in the area can help me out.",2004-08-11T00:00:00,,

It was able to change directions so quickly there was no possible way it could have been a helicopter or an airplane.  It was about this time that my friend Josh said ""WHOA, UFO!"" and pointed out in the direction of the light I was observing.  It seemed like it was on cue, but as soon as Josh spotted the same fast moving light that I was looking at, the object either appeared to change shape, or some lights were turned on that emitted about 8 or 10 beams that completely lit up the desert below the craft.  The source of the lights were clearly visible and they almost had an orange or purple tint to them.  There was a row of lights on the bottom part of the craft, shining down on to the desert floor and I could also see slighly dimmer lights around the edge of the craft, above the spot lights.

The light appeared to be traveling slowly south-southwest. I initially thought it was a planet, but it was clearly moving. I then assumed it was an aircraft. However, I could see no other lights and no flashing on the craft. As I turned east onto Mullen Rd I noticed that the light had turned red and appeared elongated. This change prompted me to pull into a parking lot to get a better look. At the same moment I noticed two smaller starlike objects in the same area of the sky. They flashed like strobe lights, and appeared to jump up and down as they continued on their trajectories. There was also an easily identified airplane flying east of the objects, apparently at the same altitude. The objects eventually went behind some tall trees and I lost sight of them.  My conclusions: the red object may have been a blimp or some kind of personal craft. I suspect the craft had a yellow headlight or spotlight, which ceased to be visible as I traveled north and as the craft passed me moving south. The starlike objects could have been very high altitude jets passing over the region coincidentally. Because of the flashing of the starlike objects, it was hard to tell their flight paths. One or both of them may have changed direction, but I am not certain of this.  The main reason I'm reporting this incident is that others in the region may have seen it and may be able to provide more information.

[The reason we see satellites is they are far enough out in the earths orbit, that the sunlight hits them and reflects back to earth] When it started flashing red I followed it even more intensely, when it suddenly slowed down. I had now reasoned that it was not a satellite due to the blinking and slowing down. I figured thus it must be an airplane that’s just at an extremely high altitude. But two things got in the way. A: Why didn’t I see the red flashes of light earlier and B: How could it slow down to almost a complete halt. To top it off, the object took a 90-degree turn and sped up and the red flashing got brighter and more rapid.

Brother reports a bright light in the middle of the night, like a bright full moon. We had the following strange experience while camping in the Laurel Ridge State Park at the route 653 adirondacks on 8/13/04-8/14/04.  I was camping with my brother and his two sons. It was their first campout. We stayed up until about 00:00 8/14/04. Between the hours of 00:00 and 03:00 I had a strange dream. I have alot of strange dreams, nothing new.  I dream of a red-ish light shinning from outside the adirondak and a high pitch pentrating noise associated with it. The light and sound were paralising me and forcing me to sleep. I dreamed I was fighting to stay awake, trying to get to my pistol. I dreamed I had the pistol in my sleeping bag.  At three in the morning I awoke and heard owls. I looked for my pistol in my sleeping bag were I was sure I had put it.It was however outside the bag were I had left it when I went to sleep. I said to my brother, ""Are You Awake?"" He said Yes. I said ""Do you hear those owls?"" He said,""They sound like little kids playing."" We were all awake, each one of us. At 0300 in the morning. I got up and put more wood on the fire with the help of my younger nephew. At 0335 we all tried to go back to sleep, but the kids kept screwing around. So my brother got up at 0410, and we all got up. I knew I'd had a few wierd dreams and told about them, but I held back the dream of the paralizing light. I didn't want to scare the kids. I knew it was an alien encounter kind of a dream. What was really strange, what prompted me to send this e-mail, and what has me thinking about this whole campout, is what my brother said that morning. He said that ""Sometime after we went to sleep, after 00:00, he had looked out of the adirondack and the woods were all lit-up like a full moon. He describe how the leaves on the trees had reflected the moonlight. Well there was barely a moon on the night of 8/13/04, with the new moon on 8/16/04.

From my porch, I saw a triangle of 3 white/silver balls/cones in the sky between two tall pines. My first reaction when I saw it was: "" What the hell is THAT"" !! The 'interior' of the triangular object seemed to be almost invisible from my viewpoint. I saw it at about a 45 degree angle, not directly up, therefore the 3 'balls' or 'cones'were close together and it was difficult to judge thickness of the body. The left and right ball/cone was toward me, the center one, the middle one, a bit more forward on the object. There were distinct lines on these balls/cones, perhaps like on booster rockets or similar to propulsion engines. The object could have been fairly close, not too far away, or it could have been higher in the sky from another viewpoint and then perhaps much larger. Don't know how to draw the body shape at the angle I observed it at.... (Sending photo of the trees/sky where the object was seen.My drawing is not good, but this is how I saw it with the approximate color and size. Photo was taken after the sighting so I could draw the object in while fresh in my memory.) Hard to say if the left and right tips were rounded or not, my minds memory says they were rounded, nothing protruding out from over the balls/cones. The 'object' didn't change in its shape, just 'floated' for close to 1 minute. Suddenly it turned left (north) (behind the left pine tree in the photo) in a perfect triangular shape. I was perplexed. Got my camera and continued looking up at the sky from my porch. About 20 min. later, a silent triangular object flew high in the sky at a much faster speed than an aircraft. No sound. It went right overhead, reflecting a light orange/amber hue through a thin mist or haze.....on what looked like a metallic body. There was not a cloud anywhere in the sky and many hours till the sun would set; the orange/amber hue must have come from the object itself. I took 3 pictures, all had bright blue sky, no mist or clouds around. The object went over too fast to capture on my Sony digital camera.

Some friends and I were all at a backyard barbeque and one of the guys there asked if I had seen the UFO yet.  I was puzzled and he explained that on WCCO they had reported a white floating thing that hadn't moved for hours.  We all went outside and watched it for a good for hours while we cooked up our food.  The neighbors in the next door yard had a pair of 7x35 binoculars they were using to look at the object and let us take a look.  I saw what appeared to be a pale white orb that was a bit stretched out on the top side.  Like a blunted teardrop, kind of.  The object appeared to be stationary but during the course of our BBQ, it appeared to have moved from 12 o'clock to about 10 o'clock at a uniform height of 2.5 handspans (arms extended) above the horizon. A dime held at arms length completely obscured the object. I believe that even a popcorn kernel held at arm's length would have covered it.  3 of the 8 of us had about 3 beers apiece over the course of the 4 hours.  As to our credibility, we are all of sound mind.  I am a military veteran, one of the guys there is a Mennonite/Quaker type guy, one lady is a research biologist, and another works in a health diagnostic lab.  The remainder were college students. Everyone there was of a rational mindset.  In summary -- 8 of us saw something in the sky that we can't quite explain.  The idea of a balloon was (forgive the pun) floated but the object was far too stationary for that to be true.  Also, it should be noted that as the sun set, the object, suspended above the western horizon, remained consistently luminous -- a large white ""circloid"" with no noticable shading.  To be honest, we got bored with it after a while and ceased to pay attention to it.  Prior to this we noted it had been drifting relative to the trees.  Left to right, facing west.  When we wondered about it's position around 2100 hours, we weren't able to find it.

Odd, you'd think that folks would be interested in knowing what the heck was just floating stationary for such a long period of time.  Most folks just dismissed it with ""weather balloon"".

While travelling south on Interstate-5 in the central valley of California, at about 10:15 pm, we encountered the I-5 UFO phenomenon that has been reported to NUFORC several times since at least the year 2000.  It was a triangular aircraft flying a repetitive aerobatic pattern over the interstate and swooping down very low over traffic, creating a hazard to all who were driving. We saw it as we approached from 2 to 3 miles away, and were amazed at it's agility and audacity right from the start.  It occurred 28 miles north of Highway 198 at the intersection of I-5 and the overpass of Manning Avenue.  The aircraft's maneuvers were incredible, but not beyond human capability.  The craft flew a fast, distinct, unchanging pattern over the interstate and overpass, swooping down to an unbelievably low level over the freeway traffic.  We and every other vehicle around us slowed down to observe it, and once underneath it, we hoped we wouldn't get hit.  We drove past the overpass, which was remote and had no exit/entrance ramps and then parked on the shoulder about 100 yards south of it, right below the pattern that the aircraft was flying.  My wife and I tried hard to get a good look, but it was very dark; no moon and no city lights anywhere near us. The craft seemed to be triangular, yet not an equilateral triangle.  It was shaped more like a Vulcan bomber; the wings formed a wide delta, yet their leading edge intersected the fuselage well behind the nose.  I could not make out the profile of the nose, yet I could see the profile of a vertical tail fin.  The vertical height of the fuselage seemed thin, but not too thin for a human pilot.  It's lights were completely unconventional; no strobe, no red and green position lights, no navigation light.  It just had 3 big bright circular halogen white lights, about 12""-18"" in diameter; one under the nose, and one at each wingtip.  The nose light would turn off and then turn back on.  They all shined down and forward about 45 degrees, and were built into the body; they weren't fixtures hanging down.  They put out an ambient glow onto the fuselage, which was a very pale tan or grey.  There were no other markings and no landing gear visible.  Unlike previous reports of this phenomenon to NUFORC, which described a silent craft, (and I don't discount them), this craft made a lot of noise.  In fact, it sounded like it had a single jet engine.  As it approached, it made a whining, hissing sound, which turned into a roar as it passed, yet not as loud or fast as a corporate or fighter jet.  The craft maintained a speed of about 80 to 100 mph throughout it's maneuvers.  A high-performance engine might explain how it made steep climbs and 90 degree banking turns without stalling or losing speed. It flew a repetitive kidney-bean shaped pattern above the freeway intersection with the overpass.  It dived down and flew 15'-20' above the I-5 traffic, climbed up, hung a U-turn, then dove down to the field on the east side of the interstate, and flew an amazing 2-3 feet above the ground for about 100 yards until it approached the embankment of the overpass, then pulled up and climbed at about 45 degrees without slowing down to about 200 feet above ground, hung a sharp U-turn banking at 90 degrees to the ground,then dove down again at the interstate, and repeated this pattern over and over.  Whether the pilot was an off-hours yahoo cropduster or an alien, he was out of his mind.  While parked on the shoulder, we watched the aircraft fly the pattern right over us several times before driving off (my 6 year-old daughter was getting scared). I wish I could provide a more definitive identification of the aircraft, but it was very dark that night and the craft was constantly making sharp moves: banking, climbing, and diving.  My best guess is that this was a powerful, unconventional, yet terrestrial airplane, but the pilot was performing maneuvers that weren't just bold, but crazy and malicious toward the traffic on I-5.  Everything about the aircraft's actions and lighting was illegal. I called the California Highway Patrol after driving away, and the dispatcher shrugged it off, saying, ""I'll put out a bulletin, but there's not much we can do.  You might want to try the FAA.""  I'll forward this report to the FAA in the hopes that they might look into it, being that this incident constitutes crimes being committed with an aircraft.  Either this is some rogue cropduster that hasn't been caught yet, or this area along I-5 is definitely a UFO hotspot.

The light would continue to repeat itself in 2 second intervals. But the light was bright enough to light up the sky as thunder does. There are only farms and fields in that area that I know of and no tall towers or offices.

At about 12:35 last night, while I was sitting at my computer, which sits in front of a second-story east facing window, I noticed a glowing object in the sky.  It was about 75 degrees from the horizon and moving from North to South.  I turned off my computer monitor, as it was the only light in the room, and stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object as it passed nearly over my position.  The object was 3 or 4 times the size of a star and glowed dimly but steadily.  Unlike the many planes and helicopters that can be viewed from the sweeping views of my east-facing windows, this object had no blinking lights from any visible angle and made no sound. It did not twinkle, like a star and was far too large to be a satellite.  It was about 1/3 the size of my pinky nail held at arms length.  It did not really emit light, but rather had just a dim luminosity. The roundish shape of the object and its glow appeared the same as it approached my position from the north, passed over and continued on toward the south.  Before passing out of my line of sight to the south, the object made a sweeping curve toward the west appearing to gain elevation during the curve.  As it proceeded west it appeared to descend a bit, then it paused for a second and then continued on toward the west.  This event took about 30 seconds from start to finish.",2004-07-25T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Hello Brian  I live in an apartment facing west so I only have a 180 degree view which means that I do not know what happens behind me to the east. Last night I had my pen and paper ready to record the times of sightings. These UFOs have a pattern of some sort.If they are at a really high altitude they move as gold globes. They appear at a lower altitude as a white moving ""star"". Then as they move they brighten and/or dim to gold or orange globes before they seem to vanish. A couple of times I have also seen after the ""star"" that they become spiky white light and as they move they start to strobe before they become the gold globe and disappear. The sightings last from 3 to 10 seconds and they cover about (approx) five miles, if they are low.  The sky had clouds around the horizon.  10:30 globe appeared white just below and north of Leo in west sky, flared 3 times heading north,dimmed to gold  10:35 another one appeared from same place, flashed,strobed,as it flew into the horizon cloud heading north, appeared to be higher altitude from the first one  10:45 gold globe appeared from same place did not flare,headed north  10:55 another flared low in the west sky,dimmed as it headed north  11:00 another gold globe appeared coming from the south flying directly overhead under the big dipper heading north  11:01 white ""star"" big and bright as Jupiter appeared low in west and flew directly over my building heading east, I guess approx. under 20,000 ft,staying white  11:15 white globe heading south directly overhead. In south became spiky white light and I saw some color flashes,of red and blue, my view became obstructed.  11:20 gold globe flying by Jupiter heading north  11:40 gold globe changing to orange appeared flying south above Jupiter These sightings are silent, no apparent contrails or burn off.  11:45 a jet airliner flew west. This brought reality back as it made noise, was identifiable by flashing red and white lights surrounding a vehicle. I compared my sightings with the altitude and speed of this jet. The globes were way above and just below this height if the jet was at 20,000 ft. and they moved a little slower. The heavy clouds had by now covered most of the north western sky,and scattered cloud above.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

My boyfriend said when he first saw them, he too thought it was a shooting star but then realized that there were 3 star-like lights traveling in a straight line. He said they suddenly fell into the triangular formation, then spun and one of the side lights took lead of the triangle. A few seconds later they were gone.

It had a tail like a jet at first but the tail disappeared after it reached a certain altitude.  Initially the object was moving south west and when it reached the end of its path (behind a house) it was traveling southeast.

My coworker and I witnessed a group of four bright round objects travelling in a fixed random formation from southeast to northwest.  The objects appeared to be round/possibly spherical with one edge that appeared dark or fuzzy at times, and red at others.  The objects also appeared to change shape from time to time.  We watched the objects for 5-10 minutes when they stopped, still in formation.  Immediately we noticed another small bright object heading from north to south in the general direction of the group.  This object moved much more rapidly than the first four when another object appeared behind this object moving faster still.  Just as the two were about to converge they both made abrupt, instantaneous turns in different directions, then looped, curved, and zig-zagged until both slowed and stopped momentarily.  At this time the initial group of four began to move again.  One object headed off rapidly and disappeared towards the northwest.  The other three objects moved together in a constantly changing formation toward the south.  At this time a bright blue object appeared directly overhead, and as we wathched this one, another reddish-white object appeared approximately 1-2 degrees east of it.  We then watched as 3 of the initial 4 objects disappeared to the south.  The red and blue objects headed off in different directions but we did not notice where as at this time several objects appeared in rapid succession heading east to west very rapidly.  One of these objects appeared to have a long, maybe .5 degree line of very small and very bright objects trailing, leading, and then circling the central object.

There seem to be colored lights on it; red and white predominate; sometimes orange and green appearas well. The first night, it moved in tight little formations like a diamond or it would bounce up & down repeatedly.  It was in the western sky just above treeline at sea level. It has since become commonplace to us, almost like a benevolent presence.  We have seen it many times, and it is visible most nights.  I have seen it glide across the sky in the west, moving from south to north, gliding silently.  It seems mostly to hover and spin, and it makes no sound.  For the past month or so, it has been in the low north-northeast sky.  Several of us go outside to look at it regularly.  I have been wanting to report this for some time, because I find it fascinating; but I guess I felt foolish and tried to rationalize it as a balloon or a satellite, even though I know it is not.  I have seen it in outdoor events here where there were many people (outdoor parties and such).  I do not drink or do drugs; although had I seen this without other witnesses, I may have thought I was crazy.  It is always pretty low in the sky.

This light moved relatively fast and appeared to veer back off to the left before reaching the hovering light.  I'm not sure if I saw red and green aircraft warning lights on the bottom of the moving light, as it dissappeared behind the trees and I was focusing mainly on the hovering light.  I briefly walked away from the window to fully shut off the sink faucet in the bathroom across from my bedroom so as not to wake my parents up, and when I returned to the window the hovering light had appeared to have shifted to the left by a few degrees, although I could have been standing at a different portion of the window.

I took approx. 60 shots of the building.  On one series of shots, I shot four shots from the same angle, but varied them by zooming in and out.  The camera used is a Nikon D100, with a 17mm to 35mm lens.  This lens is one of Nikon's better zoom lenses.  In fact it's the top of the line.  It is not prone to flare.  The digital camera is a 6mp.  On the second of the four shots, there is an object in the sky over the building.  I did not see it at the time of photography, but only noticed it when reviewing the shots.  In fact, there are several objects in the frame, as well as the other frames, but they are so small you wouldn't notice them unless I pointed them out.  None of these objects appear in any other frame, either of this building on any other that I shot that day.   What makes this image so interesting is the fact that  the object  is sun lit at exactly the correct angle.  This is not a plane or bug etc.  I reviewed the info in the camera regarding this frame, and it revealed that the shutter was at a 60th and the f stop at f11.  There is a slight blur of the object, probably due to the slow shutter.  I'm am sending a jpeg to your e-mail address.  please respond.  I would like to know your opinion.

I happened to be taking a break from household chores and stood outside the back door to my home. I glanced upwards at the stars and, directly above me, I saw what I thought must be a satellite moving in a northerly direction, but much faster than any satellite I've seen previously, perhaps three or four times as fast as I would normally expect. It had the appearance of a star, in magnitude about halfway between the brightness of Venus and the dimmest naked eye star. I continued to watch it and, to my surprise, after about five seconds the object made an abrupt wide turn to the left, turning enough to reverse its course momentarily and then turned back again. The turns weren't particularly smooth and there seemed to be a variation in speed, although I'm no longer sure about that. The object resumed a straight course at an even speed (same speed as at first sighting taking greater distance into account) about ten degrees to the right of its original course. When it reached about forty five degrees above the horizon I lost it in the city haze. Had I seen it at that point I again would have assumed that it was a satellite. I know what high flying aircraft look like. I've seen high altitude weather balloons during the day. I've seen birds flying high with city lights reflecting off their wings. I see meteors periodically. This looked like a satellite, other than the movement and the speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-07-08T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

During a lull I started looking in the west-northwest sky and an object about the size and brightness of venus (maybe not quite as bright) caught my eye.  My initial thought was ""wow, that's a really hyper twinkling star"".  I kept my eye on it and noticing it was changing colour rapidly.  Almost ""pulsing"" you could say.  Seemed like there might be a pattern to it.  Then it suddenly stopped changing colours and stated sort of a blue-ish hue.  It suddenly zoomed over to a new location.  If you extend your arm, and hold your hand up to the sky and measure approx. 3 inches from your thumb to your pointing finger, that was the distance it moved in approx. 1 second.  It left a faint streak momentarily.  That move seemed to be straight towards the north.  Then it stopped and then moved again, same distance, but this time seemed to be going down, or possibly East.  It was hard to tell because it seems to be at a great distance.  I would not be surprised if it's not even in our atmosphere.

Strange round lights changing colors in the dark sky on the same day of the Lunar Eclipse.,Marysville,CA,2004-10-27T19:38:00,circle,Hour or longer,"Occurred : 10/27/2004 19:38  (Entered as : 10/27/2004 7:38) Reported: 10/28/2004 3:08:49 PM 15:08 Posted: 11/2/2004 Location: Marysville, CA Shape: Circle Duration:Hour or longer",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40014.html,"Strange round lights changing colors in the dark sky on the same day of the Lunar Eclipse. It was the night the lunar eclipse happened. I was recording the moon for obvious reasons. When my dad noticed a rather strange light that seemed to be flashing/changing colors to the left. It was above my neighbors house, but not close at all. From our eyes, we could only see it as a dot that was flashing. It didn't appear to be flying or moving in general. So we didnt think it was a airplane or a star because all of the other stars weren't flashing rapidly like that.(I dont think I have ever seen a star do that anyway). So I started to record it, I zoomed in as close as I could get and didnt mess with the zoom anymore. It was better on the video camera because we were able to see it bigger and a bit clearer. It appeared that the light was changing colors from blue,green,white. It looked as if it would double too and take the shape of a heart, but it mainly stayed in a circular shape. The thing that really got to us was the fact that it looked like there was some kind of electricity inside of the circle or at least going in front of it. Sometimes though it looked as if the electrical static went outside of the circle and above it, as if it were going nuts. As I said before, I did not mess with the zoom when I had it as close as I could get to it. I restate this because before we knew it, the circle seemed to enlarge as if it came closer, and suddenly shrink to a dot. It was amazing, I didn't think it was moving at all but it seemed to be moving forwards and backwards at random moments and fast. After a while there were more colors, including red,purple, and some goldish color. There aren't any big buildings in that direction or anything at all. So a flashing light from a room up high is ruled out also. Anyway, maybe an hour later I went back outside to film the rest of the moons transition, when I decided to check out the light to see if it was still there, and it was. The strange thing was, it was no longer in the same position it was before. As if it had moved off a bit farther n higher to the right. I stood at the same distance and place as I was before, and zoomed in again with the camera as close as I could, yet it never got as big as it did before, as if it had moved farther than before also. When I looked at it with my eye, I noticed there were 2 more on both sides of the one I was looking at. They were also much smaller, yet they were flashing/changing colors as rapidly as the first. I am not sure how long they stayed there, or how long they were there from the beginning, but from the time I was out there for a couple of hours or so they were there. My dad and I are very interested in the paranormal/supernatural. I have never seen anything like that before in the sky. I have no idea what that light was, but all I know is if it was nothing out of the ordinary then I still find it to be a pretty sight, at the same time I would like to hear how that was normal if at all. My dad has said that no one would believe me anyway that it had gotten smaller on its own, that they would assume I just zoomed it in and out fast. I do have statements behind that. First, the volume was on very high and the zoom buttons make a sound when u press them, even if you press them slowly, and when I was filming the moon and adjusting the zoom you could clearly hear me pressing the buttons. Second, I couldnt have zoomed it in and out that fast, because when I did try with filming the moon, it went blurry fast. I had to do it slowly to keep it focused. Last, I am not fond of liars, or hoaxes at all. I would never try and fake a thing like that, I have nothing to gain from it. I believe people who do that, give off a sense of them not being trustworthy, because if they would want to fool others and deny it, then who knows when they are being serious? Like that book, ""The boy who cried Wolf"". Anyway, I would certainly like to know what that was. Oh also, I am not sure how long it lasted, because I didn't stay there until it left.",2004-11-02T00:00:00,39.1587,-121.4726

When I turned around to face the moon, I saw a large gray mass moving as fast as a jet with no lights and no sound (like the trailing sound of a airplane engine).  We both watched it glide across the sky appearing and disappearing in the clouds until it finally got out of site.  The shape of it and the way it was gliding made me think that someone was on a hangglider at night.  But I couldn't see any body dangling from the object.  Then I thought, well maybe it's a plane, but again there was no sound from it.  The picture I keep replaying in my mind is that of a ""stelt boomer"" looking gray object with circles on the body of it.  The circles reminded me of cheese. It was so large that it had to be between 5 to 10 thousand feet up, well as low as the low moving clouds in the sky.  My son was not paying attention to either one of us until I started asking where's your dad; he needs to see this.  By then it was so far off in the distance that my son couldn't get his eyes fixed on it.

It was probably reflecting sunlight and it was flapping back and forth like a stiff flag in the wind.   I then tried to observe it in my 8 inch telescope, but was unable to find it due to its intermittent nature.  I scanned for about 2 minutes with the telescope, then looked with naked eyes again and it was no longer visible.   Because it did not change location relative to background stars, the only thing it could have been is a geostationary satellite; however, I am not sure that these types of satellites have any significant motion to cause the somewhat aggressive flashing and flapping that I saw.

In fact, I saw the same light in the northern sky, at 22:00 hourst tonight.  Same bright, color changing light, moving and swaying around and around.  These objects are of the first magnitude.  No sounds, electrical problems or other related phenomena. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was observing the very bright star, seen currently in the western sky during the evenings.

We were out at our farm house on the weekend of Sept. 17-19, 2004 like we do just about every other weekend.  Friday night the stars were just beautiful and bright, as usual on a clear night.  Saturday night we went outside and sat on the deck looking up at the stars then we went inside to get ready for bed.  My husband got up at around 3AM and went down to the kitchen and a few minutes later he was hollering at me to rush downstairs because there was something in the sky that wasn't there before, EVER. (My husband grew up on this farm so he is very familiar with all the surroundings).  I rushed downstairs into the kitchen and looked out our bay window, there in the sky, it seemed so close, a very bright luminating light.  I looked down at my watch and it read exactly 3:15AM.  It just stayed suspended in the sky getting brighter than it would slowly fade to where you could not see it all, but you could see a cloud or some sort of haze as to where it was, than all of sudden it would re-appear, stay very, very bright for about 15-20 min. than fade away and than you could see the haze for about 3 minutes than it would re-appear.  The same process over and over again.  Than off to the east my husband tells me to look left there is another one.  However, this showed multi-colors and was further away but it would fade and come back like the other.  Oh, also when we stood there very quietly there was this humming sound in the air like being at a power plant.  Another thing was, that our dogs would not go outside, but the dogs at the nearby farms were barking just a bit different than normal.  We went outside, got on the roof, walked down the driveway just watching both of them,  mainly the more luminated one because it seemed so darn close.  We watched the whole time until they even left.  The sun started to come up all the stars slowly started to disappear as they normally do, but these two lights stayed until 7 AM.  They slowing lifted into the sky, it took them approx. 1 hour to where they were completly out of our view.  The whole time we just kept saying ""I do not believe this,  I can not believe this.""  But once daylight hit and all the other stars left we knew we have seen something.  We told eachother that we wouldn't tell anybody because they would think we were nuts, but we told 2 people and they said ""Oh, you were probably still sleepy and didn't know what you saw.""  But we knew what we saw so I had to find a website to tell to somebody. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were observing celestial bodies.  PD))",2004-09-29T00:00:00,43.5872,-91.6241

There were 3 large red lights, one in each corner of the triangle as well as a slow pulsing white light on the bottom and I assume one on the top as it was very cloudy and when the light pulsed on the bottom the clouds directly over the object lit up white as well. There was something very unnerving about the object. I went out on the balcony to get a better look and there was no sound coming from it that I could here and it just seemed to glide across the sky from SE to WSW. I live about 20 minutes from the Philadelphia International airport so we see airplanes fly over all the time. This was nothing like I had ever seen. I immediately woke my wife to tell her about it.

ON 11-24-2004 AT AROUND 0200 HOURS MYSELF AND ANOTHER OFFICER WERE ON PATROL IN THE YUMA AREA TRAVELING EASTBOUND. WHILE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION THE DRIVING OFFICER STOPPED THE VEHICLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROADWAY AND ASKED ME TO LOOK TO THE NORTH AT A BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT THAT WAS APPEARING OVER THE YUMA AREA. AFTER REALIZING THAT WE HAD STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAODWAY WE DECIDED TO MOVE APPROX. 1/4 OF A MILE UP THE ROAD PAST AN INTERSECTION TO STOP AT A CIRLCE K. AS WE EXITED OUR VEHICLE WE WERE APPROACHED BY TWO MALES SUBJECTS ON BIKE'S ASKING WHAT THE FORMATION IN THE NIGHT SKY WAS. WHILE TRYING TO EXPLAIN OUR DISBELIEF SEVERAL OTHER WITNESSES INCLUDING THE CIRCLE K EMPLOYEE WALKED OUT AND OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A V-SHAPE OR CHEVERON SHAPE FORMATION IN THE NIGHT SKY. THE FORMATION APPEARED TO HAVE BRIGHT GLOWING CIRCLES FOLLOWING THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT. AS WE INVESTIGATED FURTHER THE OFFICER I WAS WITH ASKED OUR COMMUNICATION CENTER TO CALL OUR LOCAL MARINE STATION TO SEE IF THEY HAD AIRCRAFTS IN THE AIR. WE WERE ADVISED LATER THAT THE TOWERS WERE DOWN AND NOTHING WAS UP IN THE AIR, WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT NOTHING HAD APPEARED ON THERE RADAR SENSOR. THE OFFICER I WAS WITH IS A 22 YEAR RETIRED MARINE WHO HAS EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF AORCRAFT AND BY HIS OWN ADMISSION HE SAID THAT HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH TECHNOLOGY LIKE WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT. THE OFFICER AND MYSELF STILL IN DISBELIEF GRABBED A SET OF BINO'S. AFTER LOOKING AT THE OBJECT IT APPEARED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF VAPOR ADMITTING OUT OF IT. IT WAS LEAVING SOME SORT OF VAPOR TRAIL BEHIND THE OBJECT. AGAIN IT LOOKED TO BE V-SHAPED WITH BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS OUTLINING THE SHAPE. THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECT WAS BLANK, THERE WAS NO FORMATION ABOVE THE LIGHTS AROUND OR BELOW. IT LOOKED LIKE A V WITH LIGHTS. AFTER SEVERAL MOMENTS I REALIZED THAT I NEEDED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE OCCURANCE. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LOAD MY DIGITAL CAMERA THE OTHER OFFICER ADVISED ME THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AWAY FROM US AT A MODERATE RATE OF SPEED. AS I LOOKED BACK THE OBJECT WAS ALREADY OUT OF MY VIEW. THE OFFICER THAT HAD CONSISTANCE SURVAILANCE SAID THAT HE COULD STILL SEE IT. AFTER ABOUT A 30 SECOUND DELAY HE SAID IT WAS OUT OF HIS VIEW. IT WAS AN EVENT ETHER ONE OF US HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. THE SHAPE LIFTED STRAIGHT AWAY FROM US UNTIL OUT OF OUR VIEW. IS THERE TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE LIKE THAT? THE OTHER OFFICER DESCRIBED THE EVENT AS BEING ""IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, OR THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME "", HE WENT ON TO SAY "" WE JUST SEEN SOMETHING I DONT THINK WE WERE MEANT TO SEE"". WE ARE STILL UNSURE WHAT EXACTLY WE WERE LOOKING AT BUT THE EVENT IS SURE TO STAY WITH US A LONG TIME.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,32.7038626459144,-114.59088443579766

Its size and magnitude were 5 to 10 times greater than Venus, which is often visible in the eastern morning sky.  It was about 7:20 A.M. and I was between exits 59 and 55 (Shelbyville and Martin) when I viewed this light. It appeared to be lower than planes should fly. It remained stationary, apparently hovering. Within perhaps a minute I came parallel to it and passed it. Looking through my back window, I perceived its outline enough to know that it was the largest airborne object I've ever seen and quite close.  (I'm afraid that I'd subconsciously invent details if I tried to describe what I THOUGHT its shape could have been.  All I can say with certainty is that it was long and immense.)  I called my fiancé on my cell phone and described the object to him. He said to call him back if I found out any information about it.  I would have to imagine this object was seen by the other motorists on the highway with me. Realizing that my curiosity about this would probably be met with scorn or, at least, disinterest, I was hesitant to contact anyone. My curiosity bested me and I called Aeronautics in Lansing, but hung up in dismay over how to credibly word my inquiry. The next day I contacted the Allegan County Sheriff's Department. Their dispatcher said she had received no calls regarding this and suggested I call Dodgen Aircraft/Padgham Airfield. The gentleman I spoke to there also had no information.  My best guess is that it was some sort of military aircraft, although I have no idea why such a thing would be hovering over Allegan County. I have seen nothing about it on local news websites. Any information would be appreciated.",2004-12-03T00:00:00,42.5602,-85.8586

The object hovered in the sky for several minutes without movement and slowely left from right several times and in and out of the clouds all for about 30 minutes.   We observed the object through binoculars and the craft appeared to be a dull baby blue color and the materieal seamed to be plastic like.  It almost seemed fake as if  the whole thing was an object from a cartoon or something.  Up close it was not mettalic at all, only at far distances did it seem this way.  At first glimpse the object was boomerang shaped.  Then throughout the 30 or so minutes the object slowly moved around and flipped over several times.   At second glance  the object seemed to flip slowely and at one instance the object seemed to be shaped like a large ""L"" on its side.  The object moved further into the sky until it was no longer noticeable.  The whole scene was surreal as if it we couldnt believe our eyes.  There was no condesation or anything left behind, however the object floated and was solid colored with no lights or anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I took the US 40 exit east then at the light I went right instead of left (wrong turn) this headed me into a residental area which is bad for big trucks so I knew I had to turn around so I took the first right down the street and went 1 1/2 blocks and I saw a person?? walking a dog.  They had a gray hooded sweatshirt on pulled on their head and facing away from me.  I guess the truck startled her (I say her due to the body shape) and she turned around very quickly and i saw a face i have never seen before except in alien report drawings.   She was about 5 foot 1 in to 5 f 4 in had an oblong face with a sunken nose, creamy pale skin, very small mouth, and two very large all black eyes that just stared at me.  I was kind of shocked and didnt think to stop for a closer look till I was past her 1/2 a block, with curiousity getting the best of me.  I made a U-turn in the intersection to go back for a better look.
