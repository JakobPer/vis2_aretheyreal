It was approximately 6:35pm (18:35) CST. I glanced up because I saw movement, and was facing due north. I saw a commercial airliner, like a 737, that was flying eastward, from near the center of my field of view. I watched it fly for a second, following the vapor trail backwards. When I reached the end of the vapor trail, I noticed an egg-shaped object hovering, just to the left of center, and a little higher than the original flight path of the plane. The egg-shaped object had an aura, or shadow, or pulse, to or about it. Within a blink of an eye, 2 orbs (circular) appeared just to the right and higher of the egg-shaped object. The egg-shaped object had a grayish or metallic appearance, while the orbs had a brighter white glow. The egg-shaped object was larger than the commercial airliner. It was larger in diameter, and similar to the difference in size depicted in the picture. The orbs were very similar in scale to the picture, as is the jet. The main object began to move westward, and had erratic movement. In my excitement,  I evaluated everything in a brief second.  I did not have a quality video camera, and feared that a cell phone picture would provide poor quality, and little details.  I made a decision to go for binoculars, in hopes of being able to see the object better. I ran for the binoculars, returning and seeing all three objects.  The plane was gone by now. At that instant, the orbs disappeared.  I threw the binoculars up to my eyes, and was not able to immediately locate the object.  I pulled them down to re-gain a fix on its location again, found it with my naked eyes, and watched it enter into the clouds. If it appears on any radar, it would be very close to the Alabama Tennessee state line, at about 6:35pm, on Monday, July 29th, 2013. I have attempted to re-create what I saw.  The picture should explain the movement, location, and surrounding veiw point.  The picture is pretty close to what I saw. I tried to provide as much detail as possible.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,34.71265882352942,-86.75229705882353

I was driving north on US 63 towards Vienna driving about 65 MPH.  I glanced in my driver's door mirror when I saw a small, round red light traveling a few inches below mirror level in the opposite direction that I was driving.  From my best estimate, the object was about one or two feet away from my car.  I would guess the object to be about the size of a ""JFK"" half dollar or an Eisenhower dollar from my perspective. There were no other cars or motorcycles in sight in front or behind me so I ruled out a tail light reflection in the mirror or someone tossing a cigarette butt out of their car.

But I was curious so I kept watching it...It appeared to be heading towards my planes direction.   I remember noting the altitude of the  plane on the display screen on the seat ahead of me, which I had in map mode.  It became more and more evident as the object got closer that it wasnt a plane, as it got closer I noticed no smoke emissions coming from the object and it did not have any flashing indicator lightss which are required on all aircraft, civilian or military.  The object never got close enough for me to guage its exact shape but if i was willing to hazard a guess I would say it was rectangular in shape.  It was close enough for me to know it wasnt a propellor plane.  The object trailed off behind the plane and i craned my neck until I could no longer see it.  I don't think it got within a couple miles of the plane I was in. Let me remind you that it was a perfectly clear evening, not a cloud in the sky...absolutly perfect dusk with an ample amount of light left in the sky. Still staring out of my window it was 5 minutes after the sighting a military aircraft flew very close to the plane, im not a pilot by any stretch of the imagination but I know it was a fighter jet. It was possibly 700 m from the plane. In fact the pilot of the westjet flight lifted the wing on the side of the aircraft that i was on (which means he broke out of autopilot) as the jet passed. It couldnt have been because of the proximity because the jet was far enough away...The jet was heading directly in the direction of the craft that i had just seen. The jet had had a smoke trail behind it but not a th! ick one like a commercial jet...anyways i know I saw something!

I walked into my back yard to see if my new solar pond lights were working as it was now sufficiently dark.  There was cloud cover and a slight drizzle. I noticed a single orange light in the sky coming from the east.  At first I thought it was a plane but there were no other lights or strobes flashing.  It moved at a constant speed (about the speed you would expect from an aircraft). I thought it looked odd and so called to my daughter to hurry out and see it.  We both watched it continue over our heads and move towards the west. It made no noise.  The light whilst constant seemed to move occasionally like a flickering, but not like a flame. I thought of a Chinese lantern but I have seen these before and as the light passed over our head I would have expected to see evidence of this.  There was no wind that evening and the object seemed to have a purposeful flight direction, not floating in the way a Chinese lantern does. After we observed it flying for about two miles it stopped and changed direction and headed back towards us.  I ran inside to get my binoculars but as I came out to the yard my daughter said it had disappeared.

On the listed date and time, I was drawn to the outside by many dogs barking. Upon going out, I noticed a UFO.  I hurried to get my camera and attempted to shoot some video. It was dark and although the object was clearly visible, it did take some time to find it in the camera view finder and then slowly zoom it in to the cameras maximum zoom of 50X.  I edited 2 minutes out where I had lost sight of it in the camera lens.  I had to find it in the lens (small) and then slowly zoom it in while trying to keep it focused.  But I think there is some pretty good footage.  Because of the black sky in the background, there is no depth perception.  The object was very stable except trying to hold the camera steady and zoomed in to 50X makes it appear shaky. The object was not moving, just the camera. When I first observed the object, it was at about 45 degrees above the horizon and moving very slowly to the north, northwest at 340 degrees from north.  It appeared to either be slowly descending or because of its movement, dipping at the horizon.  I would suspect that at the current location, and based on the direction and speed it would have been visible for at least 20 minutes over my house, but I did not see it earlier.  It was approx. 2135 hours when I first observed it and watched it for nearly 15 minutes or until about 2150 hrs. when it slowly became blurry behind a tree.  I could still see it occasionally through the limbs.  I had a strong handheld bright flashlight.  When I would attempt to shine it on the object, it would move left or right horizontally for a few degrees as if to get out of the beam of light.  Although, the flashlight never illuminated the object. Distance, altitude and size are hard to judge as there was no reference. I would guess that based on my observations, it was 1-2 km distance and no more than a couple of thousand feet in altitude. If that were correct, I would guess the size to be several meters in diameter. As the object moved away, it would have been continuing out over the sea and over many fishing vessels. I live on an island and there are no aircraft anywhere close at night. I have never seen anything like this before. There are no unexplained objects in the sky here. Actually no objects at all! Although, I have observed satellites before and being a pilot, I know that this did not resemble any aircraft I have seen before. The object emitted no sound. It appeared triangular and had three steady bright lights. The lights were always on. No flashing. They appeared to be very bright white with a bluish glow around the peripheral. Although the lights appear mostly blue in the video. The actual triangle appeared to be oscillating left to right a few degrees as seen in the video. As the object oscillated, a fourth and fifth light would appear in the back of the object. Giving the impression that they were slightly out of view from me until the object revealed them while oscillating. All of the lights stayed at an even distance, giving the impression that they were all connected and it was one object. I initially took a little over 6 minutes of video, but later edited out 2 minutes of simply black screen when I was trying to reacquire the object in the view finder. Towards the end of the video, you will notice that the lights get blurry, because of the tree. I stopped filming at this point.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

I turned my truck off (it is a 5-speed and difficult to simply idle)and was struck by the deafening silence that surrounded me.  What had happened to the nightly frog and cricket orchestra that graced our country summers?  The two lights suddenly appeared to be so much closer (even though up until this point I had not seen them move).  They slowly advanced towards the road and within what seemed like a second were directly in front of me just a little above the tree line.  I said out loud ""oh my god, oh my god&q! uot;.  It was now evident that the two lights were connected by a long, dark 'body' which donned a row of small airplane-like lights of varying colors (red, blue, green).  The shape resembled a barbell with the lights being the weights.  It was about the size of a commercial airplane.  To be so humongous it was amazing that I heard NOTHING!  And the lights were so bright however my vision was unaffected. The vessel disappeared from my visual field once its entirety had crossed the road.

I was outside just after dark with my kids and noticed a strange round white light in the distance toward the small airport near my house(it would also be the direction toward NASA's Johnson Space Center but I have no idea how far they had traveled or if they were visible before I saw them).  The area where we live is just off FM 1093 heading west out of Katy, and although it is growing fast, it is still dark enough to see quite a few stars and some planets most nights. At first, I thought it was Venus but after a couple of minutes watching it, I realized it was much too large and bright. Around this time I first noticed it slowly moving.  The first thing I noticed was that it was moving way too slowly to be an airplane and it also seemed much lower than the planes we normally see.  Living next to an small local airport for the last six years, small planes above our house are quite commonplace as well as commercial jetliners out of Houston-Hobby. After it had moved closer, another orange light appeared some distance behind the first. As it came closer the bright white light on the first went out but was replaced by flashing colored lights on the left, rear, and right points of what at first I thought was a backwards triangle.  Around this same time the 2nd orange light turned into a white light exactly like the first. So now there is a black triangle/diamond(?) shaped craft, making no noise, tracking slowly across the sky heading NW.  At about the time the 1st passed over my neighborhood, the bright light on 2nd changed exactly as the 1st had changed.  There was also another hovering white light by this time in the original location and another seperate orange (4 craft total at this point). All were tracking the same straight path and were maybe 1/4 - 1/2 mile apart in the sky.  All went through the same sequence of ball-of-light to noiseless-black-triangle.  All moved much slower than a normal large jet out of hobby and they seemed to be much larger and lower to the ground than one of Hobby's jets as well. My 6 yr old son saw them and said that they were UFO's.  I told him they were probably military and I think I probably still believed this at the time. Around this time I noticed that my neighbor across the street was on his porch talking to another neighbor. I knew my wife would never believe me and I didn't think my cell phone would take very convincing pictures so the kids and I went across the street. There were several kids in their front yard that my son knew, so while he and his sister played with them, I asked them if they had seen the crazy lights. They said no and I realized that they couldn't see the bright white lights from their yard for my house.  Just as I was about to say the heck with it, one of the diamond/triangles came over exactly as the ones my son and I had seen.  I pointed at it and my neighbor immediately said, ""That's no plane, it's shaped like a diamond.' The angle from his yard or the lighting must have been different a little bit different because now I could clearly see that it did have four corners although the front corner did not have the same flashing lights as the other three corners.  Now I could also see a bulge in the center of the craft on the bottom and maybe the top had a bulge as well (thought I couldn't be sure). All three of us saw the exact same thing as another three craft went over.  All three of us were basically the same demographically: in our forties with kids about the same ages.  Two or three of the older kids also saw it.  One of my neighbors was convinced it was one of the drones that have been in the news lately.  I think they were far to big to be drones. We went home and I got the kids in bed.  My wife's brother called and i walked out into the backyard to talk to him.  At this time 3 more came along the same straight line(for a total of 10) exhibiting almost the same behavior as the first 7 with one exception.  Numbers 8 and 9, as they passed over my house, seemed to either speed up very rapidly just as they passed over my roof or perhaps they went dark.  Whatever the reason, I could not track them on the other side of my house as i had been able to with all the others. The last one was the slowest and lowest of them all.  Since 8 and 9 had disappeared, i ran into the front yard just as 10 was flying over and I watched it for several minutes until it was just a dot on the NW horizon. I have never seen anything like this before, although I have read several books and watched quite a few tv shows on the UFO phenomenon. I probably would have never posted this though, if it weren't for the fact that on Feb 4 of this year, here in Katy, someone else reported seeing 10 noiseless balls of light tracking in a straight line.  Maybe someone out there knows something about these sightings or another similiar one and will post something else. A couple more random observations: One of the objects might have had a low noise (nothing like a jet) and another of the objects while it was still a ball appeared to emit some sort of lighted hazy fog (electrical discharge?) right before it changed to the diamond-shape.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,29.775480377035134,-95.78561259640104

Red, yellow and blue lights were flashing from it as though it was a balled up rainbow. It would fade in and out of view. I ran to get binoculars and focusing in on it discovered there were two objects side by side. There was no moon shining at that time. I kept watching it by naked eye, then binoculars for approx. 5 minutes. I could barely make out the outline of a large fir tree so kept that in focus, as trees do not move. These objects kept moving.First  up and down then back and forth. They would also move away from ea! ch other, but always came back close again, Always colorful and flashing. They were very close together, but focusing on another star and keeping the binoculars very still, you could see them distance themselves then come back again closer to each other. At first they were to the left of the little dipper and the tree I had in focus. Then they gradually moved to the right of the little dipper and of the tree. I watched for over an hour till I called the local TV station. They recommended I videotape what I saw. My camcorder is broken so was not able to. They told me they would check it out.

I was standing in my driveway, looking up at the stars. I was facing northwest or possibly north-northwest.  No one was with me.  I believe this was there for at least 5 minutes, as I let one dog back in and then waited for the other one. There was an airplane moving in a southern direction off to my left (west) and directly in the sky in front of me was a large bright white light, about 45 degrees above the horizon. It was oval-shaped, but not perfectly oval, with a bright white center and then a bright white thick, fuzzy outer edge.  The area between the bright center and outer edge was darker and looked almost like you could see the sky behind it.  There were what looked like wisps of small thin clouds in this area. It was huge, huge, huge, there in the middle of the sky and very bright. (my guess would be twice the size of a full moon)  There was not a sharp edge to it, just fuzzy and bright.  It looked sort of like a giant eye staring at me.  My impression was that it was somehow electrified, like a neon sign in the sky.  It was stationary, not spinning, not pulsating, not changing in color, shape, or any other way. It was framed by two pine trees behind my house.  I looked around for the moon, so I could have some kind of reference point for what I had just seen, but I couldn’t find the moon.  The sky was clear and I could see lots of stars.  I am not sure how far away it was.  I was standing about 20 feet down my drive way and it was above and behind my garage. I was staring directly at it for just a second… or two, maybe three at the most; then it just vanished, with a streak of bright white light moving right to left (westerly direction) in an upward arc across the sky very, very fast. I would say as fast as a streak of lightening, only thicker and smoother.  The bright white streak was gone in about half a second, and then there was nothing.  The streak disappeared before reaching the rear of the airplane.  The plane, off to my left, was still in the sky, moving slowly, it seemed toward the airport. It sure seemed like a space ship just took off right in front of me, but it didn’t look like anything I would imagine a space ship to look like. I also did not hear any sound from the two airplanes high in the sky, or any other sound in the night sky. This has really shaken me up. I have never seen anything like this.  I would sure like to know if anyone else in Sammamish, WA saw this.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,47.604626589595384,-122.02597052023123

Looking straight up from our position, myself and another person spotted a round, disk object moving west to east. It was flying in a slightly erratic line, that is, the object did make several very fast movements to the north and south.  Each movement could be measured in yards. Actual movement of the disk was less than 200mph when first observed.  By the time we could focus on the disk, it quickly moved to the east and out of our view behind trees.  Altitude and size of the disk would be a guess, but it did appear to be below the scattered cloud layer and lower than the ""skywriter.""  There were at least 2-3 miles separating the two aircraft.

At ground level no wind whatsoever!  This data comes directly from the Brookhaven sounding station in Brookhaven NY.

I am sending Pete new videos one with increased brightness and one in negative. The smaller object is much more apparent.

The planes typically have a white light with blue and red flashing lights on the wings. As I was driving, I looked out of my car window to the north and there were three very bright orange objects in the sky.  The objects were traveling east to west, the opposite direction of the plane traffic.  They were at a lower altitude than the planes and were bunched together traveling in a line at the same speed.  They appeared to be very low flying planes, but they were too close to each other and not the right color to be planes.  After a few seconds the leading object changed direction and started moving in a northerly direction while the other two continued in the westerly direction.  When the first object changed direction it appeared to have fire coming out of it.  Within ten seconds they were out of my view after continuing on their respective paths (2 to the west and 1 to the north) at a high rate of speed.  I am not a trained eye, but the objects appeared to be airplane sized, traveled at low altitude and were moving at least as fast as the planes in the sky if! not faster. The lights were significant enough that the traffic in front of me on a very busy highway stopped to look at them nearly causing a traffic accident.  The skies here are very congested with planes flying into O’Hare and Midway, medical helicopters and private planes from several local airports, but these did not have any of the characteristics of a plane or helicopter and clearly stood out as people were stopping to look at them.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,41.761355311004785,-88.31528937799044

We witnessed an object which at first appeared to be a star very low in the sky, just above the treetops in the distance.  We watched the light/object for around 5 minutes. The object appeared to be flickering and flashing slightly.  We first noticed the object because we thought it was unusual to see a star that low in the sky and have had previous experiences seeing strange objects in the sky line while out on our balcony.  After watching the object for a few minutes, we felt a little uneasy and decided to go back inside.  I suggested to my brother that we use our telescope to look at the object with a better view.  My brother got the telescope and went back onto the balcony.  When he got back to the balcony, which was probably around 3 minutes later, the object was noticeably lower in the sky, closer to the treeline than it had been before.  He set up the telescope and tried to focus on the star-like object.  He got a decent unfocused glimpse of the object for around 10 seconds and noticed flashing lights and changing colors within the object.  He stated that the object almost seemed organic.  He watched the object slowly descend and straddle the treeline for a few seconds.  It then dipped below the treeline and stayed there for a few seconds, before popping back up for another few seconds.  It then slowly descended beneath the treeline and did not come back up.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,40.8079,-72.7577

Around the time mentioned I stepped out of my front door to get some air and the sky was clear and I I had a good view of the south an western area of it when I observed a rather bright red-orange light somewhat like a diamond shape but unable to be sure of its exact shape hovering in the south and coming closer to my location.  I first thought it was a plane or helicopter that police use but it had no  anti collision lights on it as per FAA regs and the whole thing seemed lit with up a strange light unlike a chopper.  It hovered in the area then veered west slightly and desended fairly fast almost looking like it landed not far away.  I was tempted to go and check it out but was too tired and it was too cold. It may just have been a kids toy remote controlled helicopter with a light on it but the light seemed rather bright for a toy. I guess its just Unidentified.,2013-05-15T00:00:00,43.05037092436975,-76.157063697479

I was jogging tonight when I looked off to the west and noticed two bright, twinkeling, amber colored lights which apeared to be hovering in the distance. I cannot say how far away they were or what size they actually were but they became smaller and unvisible shortly after I noticed them. A few minutes later I looked off into the same spot in the sky I had first seen the two lights and then there were three of them in a triangular formation. They were amber colored and twinkeling as before. I saw the lowest one actually moving upwards while the others stayed at about the same altitude but seemed to be moving horizontally so these were not flares. The lower light appeared larger than the others.  As the two upper lights dissipated the lower light remained and then later dissapated as well until it could no longer be seen. I have seen many aircraft at night so am familiar with what helicopters and planes look like in the night sky and sometimes they do look rather strange if you see them at the correct angle with there lights on. I have also seen metorites streeking across the sky numerous times.  These lights I saw tonight were markedly different from anything I have actually witnessed. I did not hear any engine noises accompanying these lights but since I did not know how far away they were I cannot say for sure that they were not helicopter pilots playing games with bright lights.

To my amazement there was colored lights in the air    following the path of 278  .  The first formation was a group of five which was scattered out and then they changed formation to two front lead craft with the other three making a then forming a straight line behind them.  They looked like upside down diamond shapes with the bottom of the craft being the darker part with the light becoming brighter and more translucent as it got to the  oval top of the craft. Each one was a different color, there was  reds, greens, blues, gold’s, purple.  All were glowing lights.  It was like watching a Christmas parade in the sky. Then right behind them was a formation of three more and then right behind them was one lone  last craft.  I was jumping up and down when this one came by yelling come see me land here, and it slowed down and stalled for a moment then went by.  They were probably  saying look at that crazy human.  But I really want to meet them in a conscious state. I  have  so many questions.   Not a whisper of a sound came from them,  I was very close to their  path, at the altitude they were at and as clear as I could see them they had to each have been about 50 to 60 feet in diameter . You could tell that they were intelligently controlled  as you watched them change directions.  The were not moving very fast possibly about 40 mph.

I ran to the front door and told my girlfriend to come outside quickly, which she did. The light was sill approaching our vantage point and moved almost directly overhead. The oject seemed to be moving parallel to the ground, on a flat trajectory. There is no wind tonight and the sky is cloudless. There were no aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. If I had to guess, I would say the object was about 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground. When it got just past us, at one point it kind of slowed for a couple of seconds and moved slightly towards the East, then sped up again and continued to travel South. It seemed to me to be traveling somewhat faster than a single engine civilian airplane would at that altitude. The light seem to fade an brighten very slightly at regular intervals. It faded out then disappeared completely as we watched it. The whole sighting probably lasted for two minutes, from about 21:12 to 21:14 hrs. We could not see any larger object surrounding the light, it was noiseless, moved at a constant speed and altitude, and was moving much to fast to be a Chinese lantern. To sum up the event, it was just very strange!  We live within about 5 miles of the Portland Airport, and constantly see commercial, military and private aircraft at all times of the day and night.

At 10:05pm, I walked out of my home and saw three very bright lights hovering low in the southern sky.  All three of these light objects were distinctly triangular in shape.  Each of the three objects were projecting bright orange light in the center surrounded by bright white light at the outer edges. The lights were extremely bright and were facing due north. The orange/white light of each was constant and did not blink or flicker. From my vantage point, they were visible slightly above the roof line and to the left of house across the street from mine. These three lights were hovering far lower than any aircraft I'd ever seen in the downtown Portland skyline . The lights were large enough in the sky that they appeared to be possibly fewer than several miles away in the distance.  I noticed all three of these shapes were slightly swaying in a back and forth  in a fluid horizontal motion but stayed the same size, and kept the same position in the sky. This lasted approximately 45 seconds after which time,  within three seconds, all three of the lights moved very close together without touching, rapidly decreased in size (but without out moving from their relative position in the sky) and then proceeded to completely vanish from the horizon. During this occurrence I also I observed that there were two aircraft with blinking red lights flying in the southern sky from east to west. The two aircraft were fl! ying much further off in the distance and appeared to be moving at a constant speed which I considered to be consistent with commercial aircraft. I heard distinct sound from the two aircraft in the distance but did not hear any discernible sound from the three other light objects that I witnessed.

Once again I saw something different than I've seen before and something I cannot explain.  While looking towad the South East a bright star like object appeared from no where and grew extremly bright then shot across the sky heading Northe West at an amazing speed.  It left a trail behind it as it went obver head.  It looked almost like a meteor only it was flying straight across the sky instead of travelling downward.  It kind of looked like it could be a missle almost since it travelled so fast but it made no sound whatsoever.  It lasted about 5-6 seconds before it dissapeared out of site.  It was NOT a falling star or a meteor so I am calling it a ufo.,2013-08-30T00:00:00,38.39446941580756,-121.37185910652921

It would flash once, then pause about 3 to 4 seconds, then flash again. When it flashed, I could partially make out it was a triangle.  The flash itself was a brilliant one looking like the flash you see during welding with a plasma cutter. We both counted at least 6 flashes and it was gone.

I immediately pulled to a side street. I got out of my vehicle and did the only thing that seemed natural and pulled out my iPhone and began shooting a video of what I was witnessing which I will describe in a moment. I saw a man outside of his house and I yelled to him ""look there up in the sky"" he kept watering his grass mysteriously and ignored my voice as if he did not even here me- or he may have mumbled something I can't remember, but I know that I was already video taping when I called to that man watering his grass, however what I found on my camera was quite shocking- let me describe for a moment what we witnessed. 7 amber orbs in formation appeared to be hovering and were shooting what appeared to be lasers at one another. The lasers were blue green and yellow.  The orbs stopped abruptly shooting lasers at one another as a commercial jet liner was flying into what I believe John wayne airport. The objects were relative in altitude of the jetliner from my perspective however the objects could have been further away from the coast giving the perception that they were the same alititude. In fact it appeared the jetliner flew right passed the orb formation.  The orbs began to rapidly fade and vanish first 2 at a time then 3 at a time then 1 then 1 so a total of 7 lights that I could see. These lights may have been attached to a bigger object however due to the darkness of space I could not be sure how many objects were in the sky vs how many lights may have come from the same source. Now back to my video that I believed had the smoking gun of my evidence.  The video that I shot ran for over 3 minutes, but when I played it back it only had 30 seconds  and the commercial jetliner was in view.  I did realize when I began to film that there was a street light making things more difficult to see the lights so I repositioned myself next to the guys house that was watering the grass. I remember getting back into my car and looking at the time thinking to myself did we lose time?  That could explain why my phone only recorded 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes.  And might also be the reason the guy ignored my yelling to look in the sky…  It's difficult to say what happened. My friend/passenger has become distant and depressed since the sighting,  I however have become charged with curiosity and am desperately looking for someone independant to digitally comb through the 30 second video for clarity.

It was a no breeze evening with stars in the night sky.  In the direction of Military Base Gagetown was a basketball size (bigger than a large setting sun) object.  It looked like a perfect, saucer shape -- large round bottom with a dome on the top - as one would see in a fifties Sci Fi film.  The lines were very crisp and defined.  But unlike the silver shapes in the films - this was as if it was a fire - - within the lines.  The fire like light was moving as it would within a fireplace - - but staying within the perfect lines of the object.  I would guess that it was several miles from where I saw it -- if it were over head it would be perhaps several football fields large.  There was absolutely no noise.  My dog was riveted looking towards the horizen where it hovered.  Finally - after twenty minutes it lowered towards the earth and then disappeared.  Normally with a fire - and I have seen a number in my life - there would be a connection between the horizon and the upper most part -- but it would be ""jagged"" shape.  In this case there was no connection between the object and the ground - there was an amount of black space beneath it till it went down.  I have seen balloons and lanterns - -this was not what this was as they are much smaller than this huge object.  I am not normally interested in this sort of phenomena - but could not take my eyes off of it - nor could the dog.  what was it?  I have no idea.  In college and with my family's Hollywood, special effects back ground I would say it could have been a Laser, 3-D projection????  Something the military was doing with Lasers?  But why would they be doing this?  My background is a Ph.D. in psychology, advanced nine years of work at an institute and privately training in Carl Jung's work - 40 years of formal meditation training and teaching formal meditation.  I have worked in Forensics, supervised psychiatrists - and feel I am a fairly good observer.  My mother, a skeptic on most things, claimed to have seen a large saucer in 1947 abouts - which was seen by half of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in the Pittsburgh papers.  My grandfather's close friend was Harry S. Truman, who on either side of my birth in July of 1952 had to assure the public that the UFOs over Washington were not something to be afraid of.  But I personally have not had interest in this - and when I had an opportunity in the early nineties to work with John Mack, M.D - and I did interview some of the contactee/abductees - - although I felt they had real, valid experiences - - I did not feel drawn to work with the phenomena as I was working with death and dying at the! time.  So this was a surprise - -and I kept saying to my dog - ""Well - it could not be a UFO - they are not golden, fire like this is - - - "" - - - It was only a few days later that I googled it and found that there are something called ""Plasma objects"" that I realized that might be what I saw.

PD)) SIGHTING #17 – August 2, 2013 – AMAZING – UP CLOSE SIGHTING OF A CYLINDRICAL UFO My “UFO hunting” friend, whom I've been calling “Carol,” called to tell me that she had seen what turned out to be a mostly cylindrical shaped UFO at 2:30 in the morning, while on her patio facing Clam Bayou (Carol is mentioned in many of my previous reports, and has many sightings, both with and without me).  This patio is on the third floor, and her house is on the northern end of Sanibel Island, Florida, USA.  She was on her patio because she could not sleep.  I went to interview her the next day, standing on the patio where she saw the UFO.  She pointed out where she first saw a bright light, primarily white, but with a bit of red in it, RIGHT WHERE WE NORMALLY SEE THE ‘UGO’S (Unidentified Glowing Objects)!  I have previously submitted maps of where we have seen both this glow and apparently landed craft see Summary of 10 UFO Sightings).  The UGO site is about a mile away and to the NNW of her house, just behind the tree line there.  She said that it was no more than two finger-widths above the seaward tree line of Clam Bayou, which would be around 80 to 100 feet above sea level.  What’s fascinatingly interesting here is that she said she became mesmerized with the light and watched it for approximately 15 minutes before it started coming toward her.  When I asked her if she was afraid, she actually had to think about it before saying no.  This is quite unlike Carol, who is 70 years old, and lives alone since her husband died less than a year ago.  She has become terribly frightened before by both the UFOs and UGOs we’ve seen before.  After 15 minutes it arrived directly in front of her house, stopped, and just hovered about two finger-widths above the tree line.  This tree line is exactly one half a mile away from her house, and is on a very narrow shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico. She said that the UFO was about the size that a 747 would have been at that distance, and in fact actually thought at first that it was a jet liner.  She said that the UFO was a bit swollen toward the middle, and that the object was not tapered at the ends, but blunt.  Carol was still mesmerized, maybe even more so, when the craft arrived, stopped, and then hovered motionless for 3 minutes at least.  She said that there was a red light toward the middle of the craft, possible on or near the top, which accounts for the redness she saw at a distance when she first spotted the craft.  The red light was not clearly defined with edges.  She also said that the craft was “edged” with a yellowish glow (see my following Sighting #22 for an important correlation).  She told me there was no sound whatsoever, but for whatever reason, did not seem to take this seriously, almost like that’s the way it should have been.  I asked her if she could see any windows, and she said “I wasn’t looking for windows…it was probably too bright to have seen any anyway.  I then asked her in a serious manner if she saw anyone inside the craft, waving hello or anything.  I said this both to perhaps jog or shock her memory, and also as a joke.  She took me seriously at first, thinking about it, before she said no, and then caught on.  She also said that it was very strange that there was no sound.  When asked about “missing time,” she said no, absolutely no (she looked at the clock when she went inside, and that’s how she knew it was 2:30).”  After the few minutes she was watching, it proceeded along it’s course, following the coast line to the SSE.  She said that the craft continued on it’s southerly course “at a very high rate of speed, and was gone in just a minute or two.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

But he realized it seemed REALLY bright so he took another look and realized quickly that the object wasn't moving at all.  He could see some high clouds moving behind it but the object itself was not moving.  We have two very tall trees in the backyard and the object was viewed in the space between.   He couldn't give much of an estimate on the altitude of the object but it appeared to be where a small local aircraft might be seen. He had trouble believing what he was seeing and he kind of closed his eyes and shook his head for a second and when he looked again it was gone. He moved about the yard to look past the two trees but it was nowhere to be found in the sky. He felt silly describing it because it sounded so cliche, but my husband is a huge skeptic so I believed him when he drew it out showing an oval/disc like shape either with windows or some kind of markings on the side. He said it was very bright, brighter than any reflection of sun would have been (on an airplane). When I came home from work he showed me where he had seen it.  I'm a lover of planes and flight patterns so I understand that planes may appear stationary for a few moments if they're flying directly towards or away from you but eventually you will see the movement.

Something in the sky caught our attention.  We looked up and saw about 5 lights above the cloud layer in a ""V"" shape flying south to north.  I thought they must have been military aircraft flying exceptionally high since we could not hear any noise, but the lights seemed to be just above the cloud layer.   We could see the glow of the lights through the cloud layer.  They were all white lights.  I thought it was probably military aircraft for about 55 years until I recently watched a UFO program on one of the cable channels.  They showed a few amateur photos and artist's renditions of what many people have seen in central Ohio for years.   What we saw that night was similar to what many folks in Ohio reportedly have been seeing for many years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1958 is approximate.

I also remember thinking it was one of the air force's old flying-wing aircraft.  But I was really puzzled that it made absolutely no sound.

Here goes Part One:  I was approximately 6 years old I believe,(not exactly sure) but it was the mid-late 1950's.  I resided in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan, with my family.   One night I was awakened by the sound of muffled panicked cries coming from the other side of my bedroom.  It was my brother Mickey who was a year younger than me, and I became immediately and fully terrified.  I was facing the wall away from him, and I knew there was no way I would look in his direction, because I knew something or someone was in the room and from the disturbing intensity of Mick's whimpering noises, I knew it was not Santa Claus.  I did not move a muscle or make a sound hoping that whatever IT was, would not know I was there.  So I literally played dead, as I desperately did not want the 'boogey man' to know I even existed.  My heart was pounding in my ears from fear, and my fears were not unfounded, as the next thing I hear is, “Look Out Jimmy!” , and I think Oh NO! He just told it I'm Here! Now folks, those words sent me crashing into a terror, that in a few moments would increase a thousand fold, for I am lying on my stomach and suddenly there is a long fingered claw/hand planted firmly on the middle of my back/spine, ( a witches claw?  An evil Monster?!, I was going to die for sure!! I am not kidding folks; this was Thee most frightening moment of my life. Suddenly I realize there is tremendous Heat coming thru its hand, so much so I could feel the heat coming clear thru my body, thru my chest/solar plexus area and onto the bed lying beneath me. And now shockingly, I am, without a doubt in my little boy’s brain, being stabbed to death with a knife as I felt the knife slowly 'corkscrew' deep into my body, though I never flinched or made a noise. That was my brave but useless way of hoping it might think I was already dead!  Accompanying this penetration is a deafening noise in my head, a hissing type noise which I took to be the monsters breathing over me! The sound was sort of “haaaaaaaa” which only intensified my terror.  Please note, that during these moments, I was unable to appreciate the fact that it actually was not painful. What I felt was more of a thick bluntness turning its way into me. Not long afterward, I felt the 'knife' come back out of me, I was shocked that I was still alive, though I did not want the 'invader! ' to know that. Then the heat stopped and its hand was removed from my back. And I Neither Made a Sound, nor Budged An Inch, Nor Opened My Eyes, Till The Sun Came Up!!  Before I finish this story, which is the second part. Let me make a few things clear. 1.  I Never for a moment forgot this experience, as it was clearly 'drilled' into my memory. 2.  For several days to a week, I snuck a knife from the kitchen that I was not supposed to have, and hid it under my pillow.  It was the only defense I could think of. But my mother soon found it, and took it away. 3.  I do not have any conscious remembrance of the following day or morning.  But I ‘feel’ like we were probably told, “you just had a bad dream”, by our parents.  It would also be reasonable to believe my parents may have checked my back, and saw nothing.  Or if they did, they never told me so. 4.  I Knew it Happened and I was Not sleeping, and it Was Not a dream. 5.  As life went on, and growing up, I Never discussed it At All with my brother Mickey, and as an adult, I totally assumed he would not remember that night. He was probably five or six at the time. I was wrong about that assumption, as you will see in Part Two of this story.  Part Two: Fast forward from about 1957 to about 1994 or so.  I am in my living room, here in Montana, with my wife (my beloved, who passed away in 2006), entertaining ourselves by sharing ghost stories and strange experiences, etc. and between my wife and I, we had lots of events to weave into the conservation. I had just finishing telling the above story, when one of the group asked if Mickey had ever said anything about that night.  I said “Well no, I am sure he won’t remember anything”. But suddenly, for the first time in my life, I thought, “why don't I ask him”? I have nothing to lose, but I hope he doesn’t think I am crazy. So right then and there, I pick up the phone and called him. He was living in Portland Oregon. The following is the basic conservation that took place minutes later in front of my wife and friends. “Hello Mick, hey, were telling scary stories and I am going out on a limb here, but Mick, do you remember a night, back on Dorchester......? (That’s the name of the street we lived on as children) Well folks, I swear, that's as far as I got in my question, when he interrupts me before I can say another word and says, “Yeah, I woke up to find what I thought was Casper the Ghost 'floating' over to the side of my bed and it was peering down into my face, with its hands held up in front and just above me. It had a big head and big black eyes, and I was completely terrified and totally freaking out. It just kept looking down at me and I was frantically crying or something, when finally it moved away from me, and went over to the crib that held Tim (my toddler age brother that slept in the room with us), and it raised its hand over the crib opening, and ITS Hand LIT UP!!! (I about fainted when I heard those words and the following: “Then it moved away from the crib and I saw it go over to you and I tried to warn you and I said “Look Out Jimmy!” as it bent all the way down over you and looked like it was touching you!!”  Well, I then told Mickey my end of the story (for the very first time), and of course the pieces of that puzzle now fit perfectly in my mind. He, however, remembered a few other details. He says he remembers some days/weeks afterwards, being taken to a doctor and having his brain x-rayed, because he said he was afraid to go to bed without the lights being left on, and he remembers night after night waking up shrieking with nightmares. I am sure my parents would have been very worried about him and he believes that for a period of time, he was under a great deal of stress, since mom and dad said “nothing happened, it was just a bad dream, and everything is ok”. All of which makes sense as to why I would have been sneaking a knife under my pillow. Mom and dad, of course, would naturally have been reassuring us that it was just “bad dreams”, but I (we), knew,  that night was No dream, so that, I am sure, left us feeling very Unprotected.  In summation, I am sure now that Casper the big head, big black eyed ghost, was a visiting ‘Grey’ alien. What I am unsure of is what did it do to me?? I figure that it either 'fixed' something in me, or, took DNA and /or left an implant, or all of the above? I suspect it left a tracking gizmo and took DNA, though of course, I don't know any of that for sure, but I since have had several uniquely close experiences with UFO's that occurred later in my adult life that lead me to believe we are connected somehow, for some purpose that I hope to understand perhaps sometime in the future? This is indeed a fascinating universe we journey upon. I thank you for your time. Sincerely james ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It also had some sort of protrusion at about 2 o'clock resembling an elongated ""Z"" like tail approx 1/10th the diameter of the body of the object.  I had not even heard of flying saucers at this point and told myself that it was a comet because a comet was the only thing like this I'd ever of which had a tail.  I saw what I believed to be a similar object 30 years later. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",,,

FIRST EXPERIENCE:  The year is 1962 and the month is June.  The location is rural southern Illinois within two miles of the Indiana state line. The time is 9:30 PM, within a few minutes of accuracy.  I am 16 yrs. of age; having become a licensed driver a couple of months previous, I had borrowed my mother’s car to visit girlfriends in a nearby town across the Indiana line.   I was subject to a 10:00 PM curfew, so I departed my friend’s home at about 9:20 knowing that the journey would take approximately 20 minutes to my home.  It was a mild summer evening of clear skies and slender crescent moon.  As there are no towns of any size within 70 miles, the sky was studded with stars.  The night was so beautiful I decided to put the top down on my mother’s convertible and take the old state road through the agriculture fields and drive leisurely rather than the new divided highway which ran parallel about a mile away.  I knew there was little likelihood of encountering other traffic as this stretch of road was mainly used by farm equipment during the day. The terrain in this area is very flat, and I would be traversing through about 8 miles of crop fields of mainly corn, wheat, and melons.  The road runs almost arrow straight and is very dark as no farm buildings or houses are near the road.  There are many small creeks, which meander and  crisscross through these fields.  When the fields were originally cleared for crops, ribbons of trees and shrubs along the creek edges, and sometimes just to divide fields in general were left intact.  None of these trees would be considered “giant”, the tallest in the range of 60 feet. After crossing the state line from Indiana and making a left turn on the farming road heading due west, I almost immediately saw a very large, bright glowing below the tree line just beyond the second creek crossing on the left.  My first thought was that it must be a large piece of farm equipment such as a combine, but I immediately dismissed this as it was too late for planting, and way too early for harvest, the corn being about one to two feet in height.  The light was so large and so startling that I reduced my speed to a crawl, turned off the headlights & radio.  This didn’t seem dangerous as I saw no traffic in either direction, and the light was definitely over a field and not something on the road. I continued to proceed at a snail's pace until I passed the second ribbon of trees along a creekbed and was directly in view of the light.  At this point I pulled over to the shoulder and parked.  I exited the car in a state of utter amazement & astonishment.  Hovering motionless and soundless about 25 feet in front of me and about 25 feet above the corn was an object.  It was glowing over its’ entire surface with diffuse white light.  The light was bright, but not so bright that it was painful to stare at, and clearly visible through the light was a silver metal craft that appeared to be elliptical in shape.  The field it was hovering over was approximately the size of a football field and this object was covering more than half of it. I walked to the other side of the road nearer to the object and as well a bit down the road to be sure my estimation of the shape and dimensions were accurate; and to see if I could discern any thing like windows or doors or markings, but I could not.  At this point I was wishing another car would come along as I was feeling a bit vulnerable and knew that no one would believe me if I told about it.  After a few minutes of captivated astonishment, I began to question myself as to whether I had the courage to walk into the field directly under it.  Intense curiosity was overtaking me, but I decided that walking under it might not be a good idea.  I then had the thought that I was trembling probably in fear, which caused me to actually pay attention to my body, and realized that I was not really afraid nor was I trembling.  The actual feeling in my body was as if every atom was slightly vibrating. After a few more minutes I decided to throw caution to the wind walk into the field. Just as I reached the corn and the edge under the craft, it began to rise slowly, smoothly and silently. At this point I began to back away onto the road.  When it reached and cleared the top of the trees, it accelerated and climbed rapidly in a southerly direction.  Within 3 to 4 seconds it was no longer visible.  As it departed it emitted a spray of multicolored sparkling particles that drifted down on top of the corn and dissipated.  At this point I was grateful that I wasn’t directly under when it departed.  I suspected those sparkling particles might have been dangerous/hazardous to my health and well being. I got back in the car and sat there a few more minutes in awe at what I had witnessed, and realized that I would probably never tell my family, friends, or anyone about this experience.  The entire event lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Prior to this experience I had heard of UFO sightings but in typical teenage fashion of the day I thought they were mainly reported by  uneducated people who lived in trailer parks and wore tin foil hats.  My main concerns at the time centered about clothes, hair, make-up & boys. It sounds like this is the end of the experience, but it isn’t.  My mother’s car at the time was late model 50’s and had neither a clock nor seatbelts.  I knew what time I had departed my friend’s house (9:20 PM) and despite the time spent on the event on the way home, I expected to still be on time for my curfew at 10:00 PM.  When I arrived home and glanced at the kitchen clock upon entering, I received a profound shock.  Something was wrong with time!  I was not missing time, but apparently had gained time.  I had arrived home in less than five minutes after departing my friends’ house.  I immediately checked this clock against others in the house and against TV programming and it appeared accurate.  I phoned my friend the following day to verify what time I had left her house.  To this day I cannot reconcile these facts. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the source of the report for her having taken the time to prepare such a lucid and detailed account of her experience.

I think the area is called Dowden Terrace, several streets back from Seminary Rd in the residential section. It was almost dusk I around 1965 or 64 early summer, I was at my cousin’s house, and she wasabout 7 or 8.  And as I just discovered about a year ago my little brother was there also, although we never talked about it until just recently.  I was shocked to hear him explain the same sighting.  Anyway we my cousin and I were playing in the front yard.  Our parents, my Aunt, my father, and I think my Uncle (not sure if he was there) were in the garage talking with it opened.  They were approx 100 to 125 feet away, just from the corner of the front yard to the garage. All of the sudden there zoomed in from the sky, (we were facing Chestnut Place road-looking towards John Adams school—I think that would have been looking almost northeast about 2:00 into the sky). This thing was saucer shaped silver with a smaller dome on the top.  I remember windows all the way around the dome, the bottom of it was circles of colored lights like a spinning top, like a child’s toy of red/green/blue/white.  And as it hovered over we went to the most corner of the yard to look up at this thing.  It did not make a sound and it moved fast and quick and then kind of moved closer to us all the time the lights were going like that toy does of blue/green/red…etc on the bottom of it. We (I only thought it was me and my cousin at the time) ran to the garage to get our parents, my aunt and my father.  We told them there was something in the sky come quick, come quick.  They finally came out and my cousin remembers my aunt saying “Jesus Chxxxst, what the hell is that?   It then kind of moved down a bit, in a kind of dipping jerky fast move, then, zoomed towards John Adams school area up into the sky, still those colors moving like a child’s spinning top, on the bottom of it and making not one bit of noise. My cousin and I have talked about this for years and my aunt, but it wasn’t until this past year that I found out my brother was there with us.  He would have been 3 years old if I was 5 and my cousin was about 7 or 8.  It has freaked me out since.  When I found out he was there it really freaked me out.  I know this was not our imagination especially when my brother began to say that he remembered that same thing that I was talking about.  I stopped talking, and asked him to describe what he saw, to see if he would say the same thing.  He did in fact; describe the exact same thing above. Has anyone else seen this around that timeframe and area?  I could be off in my years, I could have been 4 but then that would have been in 1964 early summer.  Someone surely had to have seen this too. I went to enter the info on the UFO page and I remembered two things because of 2 of the questions.  It definitely glowed like white haze around the whole thing and my cousin has always felt loss of time and she always felt we stood there much longer before we ran to get our parents and looked up at that thing in a trance like state, but I have never felt like that.  She was much older and I was only maybe 4 which would have made my brother 2 and her about 7.  Oh yea, my dad and aunt have already passed away only us three are here to confirm.

UFO REPORTING DOCUMENT  First, I was informed of your website by an older broadcast of Coast to Coast. Now this event happens many years ago, but I believe it is still note worthy. Now this was my first encounter but not my last. I had two more sightings about 10 and then 12 years later. But that is another story. Now a brief background on location and time frame.  Now the sighting.  It took place in late January or early February of 1968-or 1969.  I had just received a telescope for my birthday (01/18).  I don’t remember if it was my 12th or 13th birthday.  But at that time I had know knowledge of UFOS, and this memory has been burned into my brain for over 45 years.  You already know that I live in Dayton, Ohio.  At that time my house was as the crow flies about 5 miles from Wright Patterson Air force base.  Now this was the time when Wright Pat was still a SAC base.  We had B-52s Fly over the house every day.  It was there approach pattern for landing.  Sometimes so close off the deck you could see the rivets on the plane. The sighting took place between 11 pm and 1:00 am.  My friend and I were out in the backyard with my new Telescope.   Directly due east there was a very large, almost pure white saucer-shape craft.  It was hovering on the horizon at just above tree top level. That would place just east south East of Wright Pat.  It was moving very slowly, heading South East.  Now it was big, hard to judge size, but at least as long as a football field maybe bigger. It was as bright as the brightest full moon you have every seen.  Except three very light gray porthole looking discoloration marks on the bottom.  These were evenly spaced.  Now here is the kicker. Just as we saw this object, a B-52 comes flying over the house with its landing gears down.  It is on final approach, most likely not more than 1000 feet or so off the deck.  It just clears the house, landing gears go up and it powers up.  Let me tell you know it when a B-52 starts to accelerate.  Now there approach pattern was at a North East heading.  This B-52 banked hard and tried to get up behind the craft.  I don’t know how close it got maybe a mile or two.  The B-52 is behind the craft just as it disappears behind some trees.  We run down to the corner of the block, it appears the B-52 is closing! than ZIP the craft went almost straight up and out of sight in about 2 seconds. B-52 fly’s around for 15-20 Minutes.  Then it is gone from sight.  The next day in the Journal Herald news paper there was a small paragraph saying about 200 people reported an unidentified object in the sky.  I have never been able to find this report going over micro film.  But it is hard if you can’t nail down at least a pacific week or so.

There was no sound and the only thing left after the explosion was a green haze (the green ball had at the same time dissipated into a haze) and a slight whitish haze next to each other.  The sky had been clear, it was summertime and! as we were still a considerable way from the main city and in the country, the night sky was not polluted by city lights and stars were clearly visible.

We had been to a disco tech which was closed for some reason, and we were walking back to my friend's house in Emmarentia, which is a suburb in northern Johannesburg.  We were both around eighteen years old and sober.  My friend's house (parents house) was situated near a large lake, Lake Emmarentia.  As we approached the lake we were both astounded to observe a glowing orange orb, the size and color of a harvest moon, pulsing and hovering over this lake.  It appeared to be pulsing and quite stationary.  Suddenly it began moving fairly quickly  across the lake, stop, go straight up, stop there suddenly, move horizontally, hover for a few seconds and continue these erratic up and down maneuvers for a few minutes, then suddenly in a lazy upward angle and in an Easterly direction it sped off, gathering speed very quickly, and as it did so the color of the orangy yellow orb paled until it  disappeared  and the last sight before it disappeared was that it was almost a see-through transparent white color. The faster it went, the paler it became, as I said, and then disappeared from view. Nothing had been spoken during this sighting apart from right at the beginning of the sighting when we first saw the yellow orb, and to which we both said basically, “Wow, what is that??”  After it had disappeared, as suddenly it, or another very similar orb reappeared and basically went through the same maneuvers, though the time was quite significantly less than the first one's maneuvers.  It too sped off in a slight upward and Easterly angle and it too disappeared paling as it sped up until suddenly it was invisible.  We exclaimed to each other that that definitely was a UFO, and we rushed back home, just a few minutes later and called the Rand Daily Mail, which was the cities morning news paper, and reported the sighting.

March 2, 1967, was the date of this event.  I am now a Christian minister in Tennessee.  I am now 61.  When I was 14 the following event took place  8 miles SW of Hickman, Kentucky.  I was out in the back yard (country without street light) with a pair of cheap binoculars just looking around.  It was dark and appeared to be no clouds in the sky.  A full moon was shining as it came up in the east.  I was looking west across a field and woods.  About 23 miles SW of Hickman is Tiptonville, TN.    Southwest into Arkansas is located the Blysville Air Force Base in Arkansas. As first I noticed 3 lights in a V formation.  I looked around in other directions and looked back and saw 6 lights in two V formations.  They were just above the trees from my view but were close to the location of the winding Mississippi River about 5-10 miles away.  These lights appeared to be following the course of the Mississippi River.  I went into the house and told my daddy and we went out on the front porch facing north to observe them.  They were about 2-4 miles NW.  They were bright and there was no sound.  Daddy said they were probably airplanes with landing lights on.  I said ‘but there is no sound’.  Daddy went back in the house.  I watched with curiosity.  I heard an airplane coming from the east (probably from Union City direction).  It was making the usual sound a plane would make. The airplane appeared to be on a collision course with the 6 lights.  I was intensely watching because I expected something to happen to the airplane if these were real UFOs.  My eyes were focused on the airplane.  My side-view I could see the 6 lights.  I looked quickly left and only saw 4 lights.  By now the airplane was in the air-space of the first 2 lights.  Out of the corner of my right vision I saw the 2 lights about 5 miles away. I turned my attention back to the airplane.  Again I took a quick glance to the left and only saw 2 lights.  I immediately looked to the right and saw 4 lights in the distance.  Then I figured out what they were (impossibly) doing.  This time I focused my attention on the last 2 lights left of the airplane.  As the airplane was approaching near their air-space the 2 lights started to sparkle bigger at the top and narrow at the bottom (kind of like a top).  When the 2 lights went out I immediately turned my gaze to the location of the 4 lights at my right.  Then I observed the 2 lights starting to sparkle (bigger at the top and narrow at the bottom) and then come on like a light bulb glowing.  The airplane was all by itself.  The 6 lights were still in formation and they never broke stride (speed). I looked at my watch.  It was 8 o’clock.  I stayed out in the yard.  At 8:10 I heard the roar of jet planes coming from the SW in the direction of the Blysville Air Force Base.  They came very low over our house.  They were F4 Phantom jet fighters.  There were 2 of them and they were proceeding in the direction where I last saw the 6 lights. This means there should be a record at Blysville Air Force base of this event on radar.  I do not know if the airplane pilot made any report on this date.",,36.5712,-89.1862

I listen to you on the Rense Network.  If you have any questions please use my email.  Thank You.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,40.63503864168618,-75.37143231850116

I got up and went outside several times thinking it was an animal or passing motorist on the road out front of my house , not seeing anything.  About twenty minutes had passed when I went outside again to check the noise when I heard a very low humming sound , also had a turbo engine sound. I looked down towards the end of my drive way when I noticed lights just above the tree line. I found my flashlight and walked to see what it was.  It was what appeared to be a black triangle with lights hovering about fifty feet above the trees.   The object was about an acre and a half in size , I could hear the low humming sound as well as a low sound turbo engine sound ,  it had lights all the way around the sides and as well as the bottom not sure how many .  It appeared a black metallic , as well it appeared to have multiple floors to it , I assume two by the way it looked. It was stationary and the lights did not blink, they were continuously lighted . I stood watching the object for about fifteen minutes while dog continued to go crazy barking. Then suddenly three round white circles came from the bottom and started traveling through the woods in what appeared a grid.   I then put my flashlight back on the triangle object and my batteries went dead. I walked back to my house to get a camcorder to film the object but like the flashlight the battery which was fully charged went dead as well.  At that time I never saw the three white lights again.  The object slowly started traveling a north by northwest direction very , very slowly.  The engine sound did not increase, the object was headed toward Toledo Bend lake just over the tree line. I then went to get my car to follow the object , I followed it about three miles to a marina on Toledo Bend lake. It slowly went across the lake until out of site.  Having worked at Fort Polk military base I assumed it might have been some type military plane.  I was heavy equipment operator at Fort Polk and had regular unrestricted access to the airport and I have never saw anything like that. My dad had seen what he described as a similar object in the same location in 1997.  He often talked about it and I would be like “sure” .   I have seen the white lights before in the woods around my house on numerous occasions , no sound . The lights are not car lights, the booger man or bigfoot. I know what I saw but I do not know what it was.  Working at the military base I have seen lots of aircraft but nothing that could stay stationary like the triangle object was doing . I did not call the police because I did not want to seem crazy . I was clear that night about forty two degrees.Also that night there were lots of jets in the air coming from the Fort Polk circling above the object at around twenty five hundred feet . I would estimate five to six jets",2013-05-15T00:00:00,31.3541,-93.4257

I got up and decided to turn the computer off, because my work was saved,soI could try it again later.

After I was ready for bed, the dogs had stopped barking, so I got in bed, thinking that they would come in soon, anyway. I was on my side, facing my bedroom doorway. The door was open and I could see the bathroom door directly outside the bedroom door at a right angle to the left.  I looked towards the door as I pulled the covers up, and saw a glowing green light emanating from the bathroom,  In the bathroom doorway, I saw a mass in motion…it seemed like a liquid, like an oil with another colored liquid swirling inside of it.  The light from inside the bathroom was illuminating it, so it was translucent green, and moving slowly, like the liquid in a lava lamp. I was stunned as I watched it turn dark and opaque as it started to form a shape.  I became scared as the shape started to form and I saw a small long thin arm, and what looked like a thin leg……I could not see see any more of the shape, because it was dark and the light had diminished.

These were not clear, but seemed to be occurring continuously throughout my observation. Everything I saw with the naked eye was still there, but somewhat enlarged by the binoculars.

Approaching my house I see two distinct fire orange balls of light that appeared to be in tandem with each other.  They moved through the section of tree line that divides my neighborhood from the bluff and then appear to fly through the tree line heading away from my street in an easterly direction, as they cleared the trees, and in plain view of open cloudless sky they just disappeared.  Seconds later two more approach mimicking the same pattern, they flew approximately two blocks west of my home down the street. They got smaller and I assumed they were either going higher or disappearing all together because I was unable to visualize them when at the end of the street.  As the two balls of light disappeared two more are moving past the tree line, again following the same pattern.  I was able to get my neighbor’s visitor’s attention and he confirmed what I was seeing.  I was able to see a few small commuter airplanes in the distance that is typical of this area as I am close to Boeing and a few miles from the Everett Naval Station.  These lights were not typical of the aircraft I have seen here. There was no sound to them; they didn’t leave any sort of trail.  However, I counted 13 of them, they flew in pairs except for the last one, and all followed the same flight pattern.  This process took approximately 5 minutes, unfortunately for fear of missing anything I did not run back to my house and get my camera.  I only had the comfort of my neighbor’s friend who was able to see what I saw. I am providing this information because this is the second sighting I have had, the first was May 3, 2012 and that one was just a singular orange light that hovered directly over my home for approximately 3min, it was also 9-9:30 in the evening.  That sighting was much closer to my house and directly above it.  It also appeared to illuminate itself to appear really big and then shrink in size and look like a tiny white star.  It disappeared when I attempted to jump the shrubbery in my front yard and bang on the window to get my husband’s attention.  I made a search of the neighborhood seconds after I lost sight of that one and walked to the bluff which overlooks the water, Port Gardner Bay, but there was no indication of it anywhere in the sky. I do not believe these were airplanes, helicopters, weather balloons or flares.  These objects had intelligent and deliberate movement and seemed to be a team or in unison of some sort.  I am hesitant to contact the Naval Station and inquire about any sightings on the evening of August 2nd 2013 or possible unusual things seen on their radar as these types of occurrences are typically dismissed, so I decided to share it with you to see if this sounds like anything you have heard before.  I am sincerely interested since I live above the Naval Station and not far from the water.  Is their a correlation for the multiple sightings?  I don’t know, however what I saw was absolutely amazing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

All were traveling in a straight line east, taking 20-30 seconds to go from overhead to the horizon. They were vaguely round amber lights. All identical.  No shape was discernible.  I had a good pair of binoculars and followed #5 for nearly 30 seconds without being able to make out a source of this light or any recognizable shape of the light.  The lights did not flash or blink, and we heard nothing but the crickets.  They sometimes flickered near the horizon as they went through cloud cover. The first two flew very close to each other.  In fact, our impression was that they were the leading and tailing light of an airplane, since the second flowed closely behind the first (though as I said the color was wrong, and they were not blinking).  We were left perplexed, because while the speed and brightness suggested a low-flying aircraft, we should have heard it at that height. The other three lights were distinctly singular.  They did not apparently follow the same exact flight path as the first two, but did fly west to east.  The third came less than a minute later.  The last 2 came separately  2 or 3 minutes later.  All flew at a fairly uniform, constant speed. It was night, but no stars were visible because of clouds.  The source of the light was not very diffuse, so it may have been near the bottom edge of the clouds. I am a Visiting Professor of Sociology at a large University.  My wife works at a bank.  We and I are birders, so we recognize many of the ways people’s impression and memory of objects can be confused.

I asked my friend driving to pull over and stop, which he did; and we all got out to observe. The objects appeared to be at a quite high altitude but definitely within the orbit of the moon as they several times crossed in front of the moon and were quite visible as they were much brighter.  They were equal in size and appeared to be one sixth to one eighth the size of the moon.  Their movements remained within a quadrant of the sky, exhibiting incredible speed even during right angle turns.  My son commented that they were playing tag, which was an accurate description of their movements.  Several times two of the objects approached very close and began to spin about one another.

This activity continued for about 20 minutes, then they all departed outward toward space and within seconds were no longer visible.

I have.  Then they gave me something. Summer 1974 at Knights Fish Camp at the mouth of Black Creek, on the St. Johns River in Florida. An orb approximately 12 inches in diameter entered the building through the door that faced the east.  It was a faint orange and yellow in color and glowed.  It circled the room once and then stopped directly in front of me.  Three others were present,  Both the owner and his employee were standing behind the counter, and a customer/owners friend was seated on a stool.  I was standing near the door that the orb entered through and it hovered about chest high, not more than 15 inches in front of me.  I thought about reaching out and touching it for a moment but quickly got a sense that if I did I might get shocked or worse.   The orb stayed stationary in front of me for about one minute, then circled the room again before departing through a window.  No one said a word, we all just looked at each other in bewilderment. I helped out at the fish camp after school and on weekends for free.  My payment was the ability to take out any of the rental boats when ever I wanted and the occasiona!  l free sandwich and drink. I asked the owner if it was alright if I took one of the boats out and he shook his head OK. The fish camp had a small channel next to it where we kept the boats, so I climbed into one of them and left the channel.  The boat was a 12 foot Stump Knocker, with a 6 hp.  Evenrude engine.  At the end of the channel was the entrance to Black Creek.  Next to it was a wooden bridge that rotated open for passing sail boats, it took both train and car traffic.  I steered the boat under the bridge and after passing under it, there it was.  Off to my right was an aircraft hovering above the water.  It was beautiful, a perfectly shaped craft, silver with no visible windows.  But what I couldn't  understand was that it made no sound, and the fact that the water under it didn't move.  How could something that big suspend itself like that without an engine that should surly be roaring. And why wasn't there even a ripple on the water.  And no exhaust smoke.  It obviously couldn't be ours, so that meant that the orb came from it.  I assumed that the orb must have returned to it before I got there. Where else could it have gone.  This I just had to touch.  I figured that if I idled the boat up to it very carefully that I could touch it, I might even be able to board it.  They or it had to have come from some place a heck of a lot smarter than us, so they surely could teach me a lot.  But as I placed the engine in and out of gear to nudge myself closer, it backed away at the exact amount.  It matched my movements, it didn't want me any closer.  I left the engine in neutral and kept staring at it.  I asked myself why, but then figured that that's what they wanted and who was I to question them.  So I thought to myself if I couldn't touch or board the craft than what can you give me.  And I thought, if I could receive anything from you, than give me something that could help the world.  Make this a better place, and benefit everyone. I never got an answer, so sounds, no lights, no smoke, nothing.  Again I just continued to sit there and appreciate the beauty of this aircraft.  Suddenly I got the idea that I could possibly charge it, force my way to it and at least touch it.  But the engine just wasn't fast enough. As I put it in gear and started forward, it simply rose up about 20 foot.  Then it moved away from me and rounded the corner.  That's when I really got impressed, as it took off in a blur and then just disappeared.  It was as though it was able to constantly increase its speed without limit.  One moment its stationary, the next its going hundreds of miles per hour, then only a blur.  WOW.  Or at least I thought that I never got an answer. Have you ever had a dream, how about having the same dream every night for Ten Years.  Some how they were able to give me the details of an engine, or is it more than that. Every night its details became more and more detailed.  Eventually It got to the point where I could assemble it in my head.  I figured that I had better put it down on paper before I forgot, or something happened to me.  So I did.  I continued to go over it in my head over and over again.  One part was similar to a helicopter, so I enlisted in the Army and began working on them.  I had to figure out how they could change direction without the main rotor changing its pitch.  That answer was easy, a few of our pilots were remote control helicopter nuts.  So I showed them the plans to what I wanted to build. They couldn't believe their eyes.  They wanted me to let them hold my design so they could show their commander.  That was fine, a while later they returned wanting me to give them my design. I told them that ! I would sell it to the army, but I wouldn't give it to them.  Maybe I should have, at least by now I could have a working model.  I went to college and told my physics teacher that I wanted to make an electromagnetic engine, and he told me it was impossible.  I asked why and he said that because there wasn't one in existence. That's no excuse for me, there isn't one yet, because no one has made it yet. I don't have the dreams any more, but I still have the memories, and I have my design. I met a young man a few years back and he asked me if I had seen the ufo next to the bridge there in Green Cove Springs.  I suppose he was in a passing car that went over the bridge. I laughed and told him that if he saw it, then he saw the guy in the boat.  He said ya I saw that.  That's when I told him that I was the guy in the boat.  It's funny, when you have the money to build something you don't have the time, and now that I'm retired and have the time, I don't have the money. I keep hoping that maybe one day Ill put all the pieces together, slowly but surely I'm gathering everything.  I just hope I don't die first. Like I stated the engine works off of electromagnetism, no fuel, no fumes, no noise. It can be placed in anything.  Something as small as a power tool, or as large as an aircraft carrier.  It'll work on land, in the air, under water or even in space.  But what would happen to the power companies if every home powered itself.  Or the oil companies if we no longer needed fuel for our cars, trucks, jets, planes, or for the military. They spend what 6 Billion dollars a year in fuel alone.  Or was that ten years ago.. I guess that's really I hadn't built it yet, what happens to those who come up with ideas like that?  Those who put thousands out of business, or those who take the money out of rich peoples pockets.

It had lights and was spinning The incident occurred around 1980, I was living in Algonquin. I was lying in bed falling asleep, when I realized what I was staring at should not be.  I was looking south over an area that is now built up with houses and Spring Hill mall in West Dundee.  I did not see the craft, however I saw the lights and shape of the craft. It was a flying saucer with red green and blue lights.  The lights were spinning like in an Ed Wood film.  Classic flying saucer. I seemed to be dopey with sleep or?  When I realized what I was seeing after several minutes, I walked to my window to stare at it.  I did not get my mother , she would have whipped my butt for waking her.  After a few minutes, either the craft moved or a second then third appeared.  It was in the sky, then disappeared and reappeared directly below where it had been but much lower.  The distance was impossible to tell. I think it was the same craft, but there was no time delay. It was not like ""blink-blink&quot! ; it was here, then lower.  Then it moved again to the right[west] of where it had originally been, level with the first location but all 3 were equidistant from the other forming an even sided triangle. It sat in the original spot a long time, then down, then over for a few moments each. Then disappeared. I lost a few hours that night beforehand.  The timing was so precise, the distance as well. I then went to bed, and had a strange animal experience like in a book from 1985 that I read a bit of. I lied in my bed and saw 2 lights at the top and bottom of my dresser perfectly lined up and centered. The lights blinked in perfect unison. I was so scared I nearly shit my pants. When I worked up the courage to turn the light on, I found 2 lightning bugs. They flew off immediately and I thought nothing of it until I read many abductees have strange animal sightings. [insect in my case] I have never seen anything like what I witnessed outside of science fiction, I truly believe it ! was a UFO. I have thought of being hypnotized to investigate, ! but neve r have.

I don’t recall the exact date but it was later in the evening (probably between 8 or 9pm) when I left Columbia by myself.  I was driving down US321 listening to music when I noticed a bright white light in the distance shining in my direction at tree-top level to the left of the road I was on.  At first, it didn’t really register and, in the back of my mind, I thought “Wow, that is a really low plane”.   As I got closer, I realized that it couldn’t be a plane since it wasn’t moving.  I also saw that it was not a single light but what appeared to be two large round lights shining straight ahead like large car headlights with a smaller single red light moving back and forth between them.  I would estimate that each “headlight” was probably at least 10 feet in diameter.   As I passed the object I could see that it was hovering at the edge of a f! ield about 150’ in the air with the two headlights shining straight ahead over the trees. It was very dark and I was trying to look at it as I passed but could not make out the shape or size of the craft as I passed it, only that the lights were big enough that they had to be attached to something fairly large in size.   The object did not move and I did not hear any noise at all coming from this craft but my windows were up and I was listening to music. I almost ran off the road looking at it as I drove by.  As soon as I realized that I was not looking at any type of conventional aircraft,  I became very alarmed and sped up.  Even though it was dark,  I made it a point to look around in an attempt to find a landmark to locate the spot later on my way back home.  I noticed that I passed a house on my right across from the field where the craft was hovering.   Also, another vehicle passed me going in the opposite direction within a minute or so after I sped up so I am fairly certain ! someone else witnessed this object.  When I got to my girlfrien! d’s hous e, she was sleeping on the couch waiting for me.  I was very excited to tell her about what I saw but she dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter.  When I explained the details of what happened and why this could not be either of those, she said that it was probably a fire tower and that several of those towers were located in the fields on that road. I was fairly certain that it was no fire tower and, on my trip back,  I paid close attention to see if there were any fire towers in the fields. In the daylight, I did spot a fire tower but it was on the left side of the road as I was returning. It would have had to have been on the right side (same side as object I saw) as I was coming back in order to have been the object that I saw.   Further down the road, I found the house that I had noted and the field that I had spotted the object hovering over.  There was no tower in that field and I did not see anything out of the ordinary at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

""red ball"" Back in the beginning of 1987, a buddy of mine and I, had gotten off work at local movie theater. Our shift ended at 11:00pm and since neither of us had eaten that day, we decided to go to a Jack In The Box, grab something to eat and then go for a ride in my old car. We left the theater in Hayward, Ca. somewhere around 11:10pm and drove 20 minutes or so to the Jack In The Box on Castro Valley Blvd. in Castro Valley, Ca..   After leaving the drive-thru, we headed east on Castro Valley Blvd. and eventually came to Paloverde Rd., where we made a right turn. Now, It's dark out there and there was always a rumor or two, floating around our high schools, that the Palomares Rd. area was haunted or something, as was Niles Canyon Rd. To tell the truth, we did go there to eat what we just bought, but also, we went to look for anything unusual, which we soon found. After making my right turn on Paloverde Rd., I spotted, just up ahead, the entrance to Palomares Rd., so pulled over to the right hand shoulder of the small road and parked, right where Palomares Rd. met Paloverde Rd; it was a lonely spot. Just across from where we were parked, stood an old abandoned barn, with some old advertisements still painted across the back end of it, facing Paloverde Rd. We started eating and within a few minutes, sometime around 12:00 am, a red ball, about the size of a large beach ball, came up Palomares Rd., heading north, entered on to Paloverde Rd. and stopped directly infront of my car and spun around in circles, in mid air.  It made no noise at all and it was a solid red color.  It didnt't flicker or shoot sparks or anything like that and again, it was about the size of a beach ball.  The whole thing happened only a few seconds from start to finish; approximately 7 or 8 seconds at most, at which time it sped away, heading east up Paloverde Rd. towards Hwy 580 and out of sight.  We both saw it and have always talked about it whenever we run into each other. I should mention though, this was NOT the first time that I and others that I was around, had witnessed this same ""red ball"".  One ""red ball"" flew through some trees one warm evening, back in the 80's, and zipped right through our Dodge Ball game, about eight of us kids witnessed it, this was in Hayward, Ca.  The other time, I was sitting on top of my dads 1964 Chevy, thinking about some girl in class or something, when I saw a large ""red ball,"" high up in the sky.  It was following a DC-10 or somekind of large, jet passenger plane.  It circled around it and flew from one side of the plane to the other; as if it were playing with it. I ran inside the house, to tell my parents about what I was seeing outside, when I spotted the nightly news on tv.  The news person was mentioning that a large, ""red ball"" had been reported that evening, following and zipping around a large passenger plane and it was being called a ""UFO,"" by whoever judges those situations. This was also in Hayward, Ca. I have no reason to lie.  These events were real, all three happened at night, and all three events were witnessed by other people. Thanks.

It was hard to gauge it's size at that distance. The object began its path below where we could see because of a berm built up on the side of the highway so we couldn't tell if it started on the ground or not.  It shot up in a perfectly straight line at about a 45 degree angle from behind the berm.  It moved at incredible speed until it got up a couple thousand feet and then just stopped dead in place below some low level clouds.  It rotated in place so the front end was pointing straight up, and then shot up through the clouds at the same incredible velocity. I'm very knowledgeable about military aircraft, and this was not only moving with ""linear"" speed (unlike aircraft with throttle) that far exceed conventional aircraft, it stopped in place so abruptly that any pilot would have been killed.

During the late spring, early summer, of 1994 (not exactly sure of precise date but am very sure of this time-frame), I was home alone in South Montgomery, Al., located just south of the southern blvd.  It was dusk and just had become dark.  I heard what I assumed was the ""bugquot; that used to spray for mosquitoes during the summer late in the evenings.  I quickly began to go around the house closing windows and resumed whatever it was I was doing.  After a few minutes I realized the sound of the bug truck wasn't going or moving very fast so I stuck my head out of the door to see what it was doing. If you have ever heard the bug truck in your area, it makes a distinct sound.  I saw no vehicle or lights on the road out front coming from either direction.   Curious, I walked outside in the side yard and was puzzled because I continued to hear the truck spraying but didn't see it.  At this point it sounded as if it was driving or moving away from my! location.  I then caught movement above my head moving in a southeastern direction towards the Alfa Insur. angency and the Dannelly Field air port.  What I saw was stars disappearing way out in front of me in a wedge formation, probably several hundred yards away, and stars reappearing just over my head in a straight line.  I then realized what I was looking at was huge, jet black or the same color as the sky, and in the form of a giant triangle. And low!  I feel like I could have shot a rock from a sling shot and hit it in its belly.  That night was very dark and still other than what I was seeing and I recall this object having low or dim lights in a straight line along its three edges that were constant or not blinking.  These lights were no brighter than the stars in the back ground.  It's span from left to right was several hundred yards and its nose or tip was several hundred yards away from me.  Again, I couldn't believe how low it was.  As it was moving away, so wa! s the bug truck sound.  I recall being scared and excited at t! he same time while I was out there and was talking out loud in amazement.  As the rear of whatever I was seeing was disappearing over the tree line, my neighbor's Dad stepped outside.  I recall asking him loudly if he saw what I saw.  He said he heard the bug truck.

I don't remember if who I spoke with or what number I called, but they seemed puzzled about my story.  I remember asking the person all kinds of questions but they didn't seem to believe me.  I don't recall calling anyone else but have always wondered who else saw this thing, and how many people actually reported it to either Dannelly Field or Maxwell Air Force Base.  I've only told my parents and wife about this story since this happened only! because it sounds so far-fetched.  Who else saw this during the late spring or early summer of '94?  I don't know what I saw, but it was real, was huge, was moving slow, was making that bug truck sound, and was a pretty awesome experience.

Event Date:  Friday March 15, 2O13 Event Time:  1145 PST Event Duration: 30 seconds - 60 seconds Fortuna/Eureka California Single witness Disc/cigar shaped craft single craft  	I was driving from San Francisco to Kneeland, California the morning of Friday March 15,2013.  The skies were uncharacteristically clear.  Not a cloud in sight. AT ALL.   I was driving north on the US HWY 101 when I looked up to see what looked like a white wingless airplane, flying at what appeared to be EXTRA-ORDINARY speeds directly West, towards the ocean.   Abruptly the craft stopped and sped back the direction from which it came, East, towards the mountains.    Then as abruptly as it appeared, it just vanished.  Into the air.    I was 10 miles south of Fortuna California, and I am not sure how high the craft was flying or how far ahead of me it was, as there was nothing to compare it too size wise. 	I must add, being a small community that is relatively isolated, we only have three main roads in and out, and our small airport only handles a few flights a day, and they are all United, small airplanes, along with the coast guard crafts.   They fly over my property so I am extremely familiar with the type of aircraft that are normally seen in this area.    This craft was definitely wingless, tailless, windowless, silent(as far as I could tell) and as white as a cloud.     Small United Jets are Dark Grey and Blue, very identifiable, and pretty loud.  The coast guards crafts are all very loud, large, and orange/red.  I am 100% sure that whatever I saw was not either of them. 	The lingering thought/feeling I have is.   That sighting had to have been on purpose.    One would have to assume that if you are capable of flying a craft over the distances required to reach another life containing planet, you aren't going to accidentally spill your soda on the cloaking device in the control room, and accidentally make yourself visible.    It wanted to be seen by someone, for some reason.   I can't and won't guess as to why, but if you are chosen to go on an interstellar mission, I imagine that you would be one of the very best and brightest that the civilization had to offer.     I know we wouldn't be sending Bubba from the trailer park to another planet as part of a NASA flight crew, so why would they.     This had to be intentional. The real question is why?  EVENT 2. Kneeland California April 7, 2013 1915 hours 15-20 seconds single craft 2 witnesses. white disc/cigar shaped craft   My brother and I were outside on our property watching the sun go down, over the Pacific ocean, and we noticed a jet flying at a high altitude over us.   We watched the contrail behind it disappearing, because with the sunset it made it look very unique.       Behind this jet there was another in the distance, flying at approximately the same speed and altitude, also leaving a nice contrail.   There was a couple of minutes distance between the two jets, but then their was a bright flash, between the two jets of a third craft, whose direction was intersecting their flight paths.   The jets were flying East from somewhere over the ocean and had flown by our airport, so it is unclear where they were going.     The other craft shone this bright white flash  (then it was obviously white, oblonged disc/cigar shaped) as it intersected(approximately) the path that the jets were going, it was flying north and south. My brother and I both saw this, but I pointed it out first, then as soon as he saw it, my vision was overcome with spots.    I was unable to see anything but these spots for nearly 10 seconds, the best I can describe them would be clear, but all encompassing.    Like what it looks like when mosquitoes are dancing on the top of the water.  Then I was unable to see the craft anymore.  No more than 2 seconds after this happened to me, my brother said ""oh man, i lost it.   I just see spots.""  He got hit with the same spots as I and that was the end of the sighting.  It happened so fast I wasn't able to say anything to him before he said it to me.   He thinks that it was some kind of cloaking, but I prefer not to guess.    I have no clue, so guessing doesn't do any good. I consider myself to be level headed, calm, and rational.    I have never had any experiences like this before, although I have always believed in extra-terrestrial life.   It is egotistical, in my opinion, to believe that there isn't more advanced civilizations  spread throughout the vastness of space, let alone to believe that we here are on Earth are all the life there is anywhere.   That is aside from the point.    The point is that I don't just believe everything that people say, and if I wouldn't have had two separate sightings, one with my brother, who I trust wholly, I wouldn't have reported the first sighting.   Now I am compelled to report them.   However, I don't think I will be talking about this to other people at this time. My eyes will be towards the skies from now on though.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,40.76192392638037,-124.13557055214723

On Friday night, March 15, 2013 at about 8:34 p.m. I was driving down a street near my home travelling in an east to west direction.  I was alone in my vehicle.  I looked out of my driver’s side window and saw 6 round yellowish orange (amber) lights in the sky to my left.  Three of the lights were traveling in a straight line.  The other three lights were slightly behind the first three and were in a more irregular formation relatively close together.  The lights were travelling very slowly in the sky from west to east remaining in the same formation.  I pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to observe this further as the color and number of lights struck me as being rather odd.  I lowered the driver’s side window to determine if there was any sound.  I did not hear a motor or sound of any type.  The lights appeared to be silently moving across the sky.  They were travelling high enough in the sky that I listened closely to ensure that they were not some sort of small aircrafts or helicopters.  However, they were not so high that they could have been any sort of large commercial aircraft.  At the time that I observed the 6 amber colored lights, I also observed that there appeared to be an aircraft much higher in the sky with the usual flashing white light that can be observed on a high flying aircraft.  What distinguished this single white light from the stars was the fact that it was blinking and moving in the sky.  It provided me with a source of comparison regarding how far up in the sky the 6 amber colored lig! hts were.  They were lower in the sky and were not very large.  They appeared to be about 15-20 times larger than the stars that were in the sky that night.  After observing the lights for about 3 minutes I called the Police Department nonemergency number at 8:37 pm to inquire whether anyone else had reported observing these lights in the sky.  I was informed that no one else had contacted them about the lights.  I was on the phone with the nonemergency police dispatcher for one minute (according to my cell phone).  As I continued to observe the lights travelling silently in an eastward direction to my left, one by one they began to fade out.  What was interesting was that this started with the first light, then the second, then the third, and so on (sequentially) until all 6 lights could no longer be seen.  I remember saying to the police dispatcher when she asked me about the lights that they were fading out and that some of them could no longer be seen.  The way in which the lights dimmed and faded out was as if there was a dimmer switch on them that slowly dimmed the light until it was finally out.  The speed of their movemen! t did not change, and they made no sudden or erratic movements.  Once the lights started to fade, it did not take long before the 6 lights could no longer be seen.  The entire incident from the time that I first noticed the lights lasted about 4 minutes.  I do not know how long they were there prior to the time that I noticed them.  After the lights had completely faded I looked in my review mirror and noticed a vehicle pulled over about a half of a block behind me with its headlights on.  I thought that perhaps the driver had also pulled over to observe the lights.  I turned around and went back to ask the individual if they had also witnessed the lights, but discovered that it was an individual who was in distress due to an accident and a flat tire.  The individual asked for my assistance in trying to get them out of the vehicle.  However, the door was jammed.  I called 911 to request assistance for the individual.  While waiting for the police to arrive I asked the individual if they had noticed the lights, but they stated that they had not.  Once the police arrived and were able to secure the situation I asked one of the police officers if he had seen the lights.  He said that he had not, but that they “see them all of the time”.  He said that he does not know what they are.

The orb was completely silent.  After hovering for a few minutes it began to move east very slowly then faded and disappeared.  Shortly afterward a helicopter came over the house and circled over the area where the object had been.  Since it was after 11 P.M. we were unable to see what type of helicopter it was.

I'm an 18 wheel truck driver, 15 years experience trucking.  55 years old this month.  Eagle Scout, top of my class in high school, 4 year Engineering degree (1976-1980), private pilot's license when I was in college, and ex-airline mechanic  (A & P mechanic).  I love aviation, I love aircraft, you can't put me on too many commercial flights, that's how much I love air travel, and I know a whole lot about aircraft and flying. I'm using web site ""drivei5.com"", the northbound exit guide, for reference right now.  Spent the night in the sleeper berth of my tractor-trailer at exit 334, west side of Interstate 5 in front of the Best Western. Today is Saturday, 8/3/13.   Went to slept last night (Friday, 8/2/13) around 7 p.m.   I had been awake and working since 3:30 a.m. Friday morning, and by the time I finished dinner at the Chinese restaurant named Oriental Express, I was dead tired.  Finished dinner, got in my tractor, put myself Off Duty on the HOS (Hours of Service, federal truck driving regulations) computer at 6:32 p.m., and was fast asleep by 7 p.m.  I awoke this morning before my alarm clock, and I hit the road at 4:32 a.m. immediately after my 10 hour HOS break.  I was driving northbound on I-5 in my tractor-trailer during the entire time of both sightings, speed set by cruise control at around 57 mph.  The sighting happened between 5:10 a.m. and 5:15 a.m.  That's a rough estimate: ! I was a little taken and preoccupied with the sighting, so it might have taken a minute or two after the sighting ended before I had the presence of mind to look at the clock, which said 5:15.  I passed the Firebaugh Rest Area, which is mile marker 386, right at 5:30 a.m., which means I was 15 miles short of the rest area when I saw the clock reading 5:15 a few moments after the sighting ended.  Working backwards, I must have been driving somewhere near the stretch of freeway between mile marker 365 and 370 during the sighting.  It was before first light, so it was still dark out. I don't remember where the moon was or what phase it's in, you can look that up.  I don't remember seeing moonlight.  It was dark except for vehicle lights and the lights of towns down in the valley. First sighting:  At first I saw three lights in a straight line, off to my left out the driver door window, and I thought it was a reflection.  I moved my head back and forth, but the ""reflection"" didn't move against the background outside, so I knew it was outside the truck.  I don't remember if the lights had any shape, but they were white, like LED white.  Duration was in the seconds, definitely less than 10-15 seconds total.  I thought I had hallucinated something, or seen a reflection.  What happened next, though, made it clear I probably hadn't hallucinated. Second sighting:  That straight line of 3 lights disappeared very quickly, but it had drawn my attention to the left side of the freeway.  Normally, as a driver, I would just be looking ahead, and checking my mirrors for cars coming up behind me.  Next thing I remember, and it must have happened fairly quickly after the first sighting, best guesstimate 5-15 seconds later, I saw what looked like two distinct white lighted vehicles emerge from near the ground to my left heading from left to right across the freeway in front of me.  Distance away from me maybe a few hundred yards, a quarter mile, something like that.  Altitude started at ground level, which on the left side of the freeway is hilly and uneven, to anywhere from eye level to maybe the top of a telephone pole when they crossed the freeway in front of me.  The ground slopes down to the east as it heads into the valley.  The ground to the west of the freeway, to my left because I was heading northbound, is hilly and ! gets higher in elevation the more west you go.  So their AGL altitude increased the entire duration of the sighting. However, the entire sighting was at my eye level or a little above my eye level, easily visible to me through the windshield.  My windshield in this 2011 Freightliner is a single piece of glass with no divider in the middle.  Honestly, the entire show of the second sighting couldn't have been more perfectly designed for my viewing pleasure. I knew right away they were UFOs, something I'd never seen before.  Definitely not a crop duster or any other kind of aircraft.  Movement was way, way, way too smooth and straight to be a crop duster.  Besides, no crop duster works at night.  It was completely dark.  They have to see what they're doing at those low altitudes, because they can't seed a field or spray a field with pesticide unless they can see the field they're dusting.  Also, even if they were just out flying for fun, they'd fly into a power line or other ground-based obstacle and kill themselves at those low altitudes.  Plus I might have heard the engine at that short distance.  Crop dusters have very old, antiquated, and extremely loud radial engines, relics of the 1940s, all the WW2 airplanes had them.  If you've ever heard a WW2 airplane, you know how loud those engines are.  Raucously loud.  I couldn't hear any sound above the noise my tractor was making as I was driving. The two vehicles, that's what they seemed to be, were identical in size and shape, something like the shape of a Hershey's Kiss, completely symmetrical and sort of cone shaped, but not perfectly conical.  There was a shoulder in the close-to-conical shape.  The UFOs were heading left to right, west to east.  Both UFOs were the identical color and brightness, again a white like a white LED.  The only difference between the two craft (if that's what they were, ""craft""): the UFO trailing in the flight formation was steady white.  The UFO leading in the flight formation was flashing on and off rapidly.  It wasn't a regular flash pattern, it was some kind of irregular flash pattern.  So the lead craft was ""strobing,"" or blinking on and off rapidly in an irregular pattern, and the trailing craft was steady light.  During the entire sighting, I don't recall either craft getting lighter or dimmer.  Just the same steady brightness for each of them.  The UFOs never ! changed speed, altitude, or direction, as far as I could tell.  If they changed direction at all, it was so gradual that I couldn't recognize it.  The brightness of the UFO trailing in the flight formation was a steady light that never changed at all, either. The 2 UFOs crossed the freeway in front of me and I realized as they got further away from me that they weren't heading due east, they were heading northeast.  So from my vantage point, they were moving slowly to the right as they got further and further away from me, basically in a line that allowed me to watch them for a long time, minutes.  The elevation stayed constant, so they were just a telephone pole's height higher than my elevation during their entire trip across the valley.  I would wild guess the speed at between 50 and 100 mph, but that's purely a wild guess, I don't know how to estimate speed that well.  It was easy to watch them, even as they passed right in front of me, and especially easy as they traveled further and further away.  I didn't have to jerk my eyes or my head or anything like that.  It took several minutes, at least, maybe longer, for them to fade away into the distance.  I didn't have the presence of mind to look at a clock until after the show! was all over and they had disappeared into the distance.  By the time they faded away, they had to have been miles away, best guess 3 to 5 miles since they weren't that large.  All UFOs were identical in size, maybe 5-15 feet tall and roughly as wide as they were tall. The two craft were formation flying, or so it looked, so I suppose the lights could have been attached to one craft, but I never saw any backlighting or evidence that they were part of one single craft.  They were at elevation and didn't cross over anything that would have allowed me to identify a shape or a solid object connecting the lights to each other.  The sky was completely dark, so they might have been part of one craft, but if you put me under oath and told me to swear to tell the truth, I would say I was looking at two separate flying craft.  As they receded into the distance, heading northeast out across the valley, something unusual happened.  When the two UFOs were off in the distance, guesstimating a mile or more, suddenly the right-hand, or leading, UFO (the blinking one) disappeared, and instantaneously an identical blinking UFO appeared on the left of the steady white UFO, still leading/ahead of the steadily lit UFO.  So it looked for all the world as if the blinking UFO had disappeared on the right side of the trailing UFO and reappeared instantaneously to the left of the trailing UFO. At distance, if someone had seen the UFOs for the first time, a casual observer with no aviation experience might have thought they were the lights on an aircraft.  However, to this experienced aviation observer, the blinking UFO looked nothing like an actual aircraft strobe light.  It was a nearly conical, Hershey's kiss shaped object/craft that was blinking in an unusual way, not like an actual aircraft wingtip strobe light.  A true aircraft anti-collision wingtip strobe light doesn't have a size or shape.  A true strobe is far too bright to look at directly in front of you.  Also, that close to the ground, a true strobe would light up the ground around it and would even light up and reflect off the structure which it was attached to and a part of.  The leading UFO was blinking on and off rapidly, but not lighting up anything in the vicinity.  I looked directly at it with no pain or difficulty.  So even at a distance, it looked nothing like any aircraft or aircraft strobe ! I have ever seen, because it wasn't a strobe light. Remember, I replaced and operations checked anti-collision strobe lights on commercial aircraft.  I know what they look like and how they act.  At short distances, those lights will blind you.  They're incredibly bright and painful to look at from close distances.  They will light up the entire area when you turn them on at night.  These UFOs were easy to look at the entire time, never too bright to look straight at them even when they were close to me.  The lead UFO was blinking on and off rapidly, nearly as rapidly as a wingtip strobe, in a vaguely similar irregular pattern, but the wrong size, plus it had shape which a strobe light does not, and the wrong blinking pattern.  To me the lead UFO looked for all the world like it was attempting to imitate an aircraft wingtip strobe, but doing an exceptionally poor job of it because it wasn't bright enough or blinding enough, not to mention that the blink pattern was all wrong.  In short, the size and shape of the steady light,! and the size, shape and blink pattern of the light that was blinking, were unique and were something I have never seen before. The two UFOs looked for all the world like two very small craft flying in perfect formation, from the time they left the ground until they faded from view in the distance, even when one UFO disappeared and was replaced by an exact duplicate in a different location relative to the steadily lit craft. Next, what was going on in my head and in my life.  I have read that people sometimes have unusual mental and emotional experiences.  Nothing particularly strange or unique happened to me psychologically or emotionally.  I was curious and delighted to actually see UFOs.  I wasn't fearful.  I didn't feel spooked or anything.  Nor did I feel elated, or inspired, or anything like that.  There was no telepathy or strange voices in my head, there was no experience of ""lost time,"" nothing like that.  I felt like I was fully conscious and fully myself the entire time, my normal self basically, before, during and after the sighting.  I don't recall anything unusual happening in the hours or days before or after the sighting that I would link to the sighting. However, I should say I am having an unusual week for me.  I have been driving trucks for over 15 years, being a grunt delivery driver, and just this week the nature of my relationship with my career has been changing dramatically.  All I've ever been is an employee.  I've never supervised people.  I've never felt qualified, or competent, or confident enough to supervise other people.  Just in the past day or two, I've realized that I want to be in transportation management.  It has been dawning on me slowly this week that I want to start leading and managing from the front of the pack, instead of the middle of the pack, so to speak.  I don't want to ""manage"" or lead from below anymore, and I want to be acknowledged for my extensive experience and skills in transportation.  For the first time in my life, I want to be a manager, and I feel ready to supervise people.  It's a very, very new experience for me, and I am feeling more powerful and confident in myself righ! t now, this day, this moment, than ever before in my life.  SO the timing of this sighting is synchronized with the timing of me changing drastically what I want to do for work and my confidence level in myself professionally.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

About 1 minute after the 4th came into view, a 5th coming directly from our right continued on the same path as the rest of the orbs. We went outside with the binoculars to get a better look and the objects were silent. In the binoculars the objects looked like a red/orange glowing orb with a black core.  When they hit a certain altitude the orbs disappeared. Another odd thing to point out is during this time, as each orb moved out of eyesight up high in the sky, seconds later we heard what sounded like a cannon being fired off, the loud sound ricocheted, which one does not hear off of something like a firework being set off. We heard 5 or more of these sonic booms as the orbs were moving out of sight high in the night sky.  After all orbs had disappeared, we have not heard another “boom.”  We live out on the water, so the orbs were bright.  We see a lot of air traffic each day/night, but these orbs were different from anything we have ever seen in ten years.

What I noticed most was that it was actually hovering, stationary, for several moments while I drove. It seemed like a plane. It was not square like a football field, but more angular like a huge triange. I saw one.  Anyone on the freeway could have noticed it. The color just looked like a plane, some neutral off white, grey or silver I guess. It remained there the whole time I drove that strip of the freeway, which was many moments, and maybe a minute or more. I don't remember hearing any noise from it.

No other drugs or addictions.  I should have turned around and gone back, but the person I loved was waiting for me in Seattle for a good night of clean fun.  I did not report it because I assumed hovercraft had been invented while I was cloistered in college and graduate school.  I assumed a plane that large was not unheard of.

It was APPROX September of 1994, I had just gotten off work and I got home and laid down in my bed, I was relaxing like I often did and I laid on my back,  Just then I began to notice that I could see stars through the ceiling and the black of the space also became visible through the ceiling.   Just about then I looked down at my feet and realized I was outside floating just above the apex of the 2 story roof and just below my feet I could see the porch light.  Just as I am thinking, ""What the Hell!""   I see a shooting star that calms me and takes my mind off the reality of this all.  As this star gazed across the sky it looked like a big rectangle reading glass with three smaller round reading glasses inside it.  It had a tail and as it gazed across the light from the stars behind it would bend, following the contour of the reading glass they shined through.  As it gazed all the way tot he other side of the sky it began to move down Toward me!!  As it got close to me it flipped over and the very moment it flipped over I could not only see the color of the belly of the craft but it almost seemed like this paralyzing sound was coming from this belly.  The belly of the craft was very Round Orange Orb like a great big Orange and around the equator of it had Several Bright Red Orbs much smaller forming a ring around it.  It was so scary and it felt almost as if the Orange belly was where the sound was coming from. This sound was very rapid and high Mid high pitch.  It sounded almost like a flute like ""Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle!!""  But the strange and scary thing about this sound was the absolute milli second that this craft aimed the belly of it at me, this sound hit me like a beam!!  This sound beam his me, and grabbed me like, I can not explain but it paralyzed me and held me for the craft to get right over the top of me.  As it hovered over me the sound pulled me into it.  As I rose up into the belly of this craft I KNEW What ever was inside it I did not want to see.  I did have the clarity to think that I did want to know what was next but I knew that It would be scary as hell so I called out for Jesus Christ.  Now I did this out of Natural reflex because I was raised Christian at this time in my life I was very Anti-Christian and believed Jesus Christ was a total Lie so it was strange I called out to him.   It was almost like using his name in Vane but in a way I was so scared I was asking for help too. What happened was amazing,  The moment I yelled, ""Jesus Christ, Save me!"",  the craft Dissolved and I awoke in my bed Struggling very hard to gain control of my Body.  I literally felt like I had Ropes tied to my Elbows and my Knees pulling me back to sleep and that I was struggling very hard to overcome it.  My eyes where wide Open, I was wide Awake, But I literally felt Ropes tied to my elbows and Knees and eyelids Pulling me back to sleep and paralyzing my body back to sleep!!!  I was able to over come it and Over the next few months I noticed a circular Scar on my left palm.  Not a cut but a Scar much like a Burn.  It scared hell out of me because you know it made my Palm look like a pentagram.  So were talking a circle about the size of a coffee cup.  It was very strange because I never had a cut, It looked like I had put my palm on a pipe end and twisted it,  However like I said it never looked like a cut, If anything it would have been a Burn.  In fact you know if you Heat up a Pipe end and put it to my palm when it is red hot, it would burn a mark on my palm putting a circle around my palm print making it look like a pentagram.  The scar lasted about a few years and then vanished.  I went on and on in my mind to recall ever burning a scar into my palm and it just did not happen!!   So about 6 months after this event I was watching a Documentary on TV and a guy came up with an explanation for Alien Abduction he proposes that they are a result of sleep paralysis.  He says the Body falls asleep and the mind stays awake paralyzing the body completely.  This is so the body will not act out dreams!!  What really strike me was the renaissance paintings he showed of the Incubis they where little deamonds that would terrorise people in the night.  The Paintings from the renaissance paintings these little demonds where depicted holding onto Ropes which where tied to the Elbows and knees of the humans and these demonds would have a foot braced against the body pulling on these ropes. This freaking Shocked me that for hundreds of years other people felt the same exact thing like ropes tied to them pulling them asleep. I was convinced this was merely a dream!!  Till about twenty years later in 2012 I was watching the Debunking of David Icke and the guy talks of a experiment that took place involving over 400 test subjects they used some root from brazil which is a drug similar to LSD.  This drug was known to give similar effects and the test subjects experienced similar effects to the classic abduction.  Later this disturbed many of the subjects they needed psychological help over the next few months they tried many things and stumbled onto one that worked.  One called out the name, ""Jesus Christ!""  By mistake or nature and they vanished instantly!!  He reported this and they started to perform tests.  They told one guy to call out to Christ, told another to call out to Buddha and so on.  But the ONLY one that causes the entities to vanish is the name Christ!!  In the end they end up telling everyone to use the name Christ and eve for ""Non believers"" the moment they say the word Christ the bad guys Vanish!!  This blew my mind because though I was not on drugs I had the exact same experience, Long before this research group and never having known about this research group.  To find that they even tried the names of other gods and only Christ worked was amazing!!  Then something else really started to make me wonder if this happened or if it was a dream.  My situation was that it felt like an out of body experience or a dream.  But I do not recall every going to sleep, the moment I realized I was looking at stars a situation with a UFO which I assumed is a dream took only a minute or two and then I woke up some 12 hours later.  So in that I have experienced missing time,  And sure enough I have a very strange mark on my hand as well. Now come to find out I have common grounds with this test subject that took place.. Then another situation really startled the hell out of me.  A story I heard back in 1994 just after it happened and it was quite amazing but at the time I did not believe in UFOs so I assumed it was a Hoax.  But it was a case in South Africa where 62 Grade school kids saw two Silver Flying saucers during recess.  They also saw beings that spoke to them with ESP and delivered a Message.. Well, I had not seen that since 1994 since I was a teen ager and I had forgotten it and in my mind had written it off as a hoax.  However with a fresh mind I had stumbled onto the report again on youtube,  But now with all the UFOlogy and Ancient Cultural and pyramid technology research under my belt I can listen to each detail with a keen ear!!  Right away I noticed this was an Amazing situation and could not possibly be a Hoax.  This Child Psychologist interviews these school kids and he knows what he is doing,  He is very careful NOT to lead them in his line of questioning.  I loved the brilliant way he questioned them because It left a lot of credibility with me. For example he could have explained to the kids what ESP was and ask them if the Aliens talked to them with ESP.  But he did something that resulted in some solid data reporting because what he did was be so careful NOT to lead at all and allow the children to do the best job they can at explaining there Experience. He asked exactly how the man talked to them and the one kid said ""He said it to me with his Eyes"" WOW.. Anyway so realizing this was a very REAL Event.  It came to a girl that really frightened me with the reality in her eyes.  You can see the pure fear in her eyes and you KNOW this was real. But this girl says something that is really related to my experience.  Consider this,,  She is asked, ""What is the most scary part of your experience?"",  and she says, ""Sound that came from the craft, sounded like a Flute.""  Now this girl sees two flying saucers with Freaking Aliens come out to abduct them and the most scary thing is the sound of a flute?  Well, the most scary part of My experience was the sound that came from the craft, sounded like a flute!!  Why?  Because that sound grabbed me and paralyzed me. Now the other strange Part.  The 62 school children Saw this experience in September of 1994!! So in September of 1994 BOTH my self and this girl from Africa see a UFO rather dream or real, we both see the similar experience!  Both my self and this girl Agree the most frightening part of the UFO Experience was ""The sound like a flute coming from the craft.""   The event changed my life.  Because I went almost 20 years thinking it was just a dream but about 2 years ago when I saw this Debunking of David Ike and saw that others had screamed Christ to have these vanish, and when I realized the similarities that my experience has with the girl in South Africa.  And then I realize it was the Same Month and Year as My experience.. At which point it was hard to believe that it was not somewhat of a real experience..  So my recent travels to Yucatan travels I got really into researching UFOlogy, I learned to read Ancient Mayan Hieroglyphs, I am pretty much the third degree on Ruins on Mars, I talk with Wayne Herstel regularly.  I've reviewed all of Richard Hoagland's work.  I'm more than convinced that Humans have a very long history on Mars long before Earth. And I believe this somewhat inspired me. But it did not inspire me till after I learned about the other event in Africa with the 62 school children and the Debunking of David Ike. That blew my mind and changed my life. Today I realize that I have a history of out of body experience style dreams, dating back to when I was a very young child so it is very hard for me to feel like it was not a dream, because it had that dream feeling. But I cant help but think of the Facts and NOW That I have gotten so deeply Involved in the current study of Ufology. I have come to realize the most current information is these Aliens are interdimensional beings and that is yet another amazing coincidence is that might possibly explain why the DREAM Abductions perhaps they are Abductions occuring to your soul!!  Or perhaps it was Real, I mean I did experience 12 Hours in about 4 Minutes and I did wake up with Scar on my hand that lasted few years, and I did have the similarities with the Research group and the 62 school children case.. So it is extremely dificult to know if it was real. It sure felt real as shit to me when my antichrist satin rock band ass was sreaming for Jesus Christ to help me!!  I heard you on C2Cam tonight and decided to tell my story.  I do not like to tell people because people have said some rude shit about it but it is possibly that you might know of some other reports so I figured Id tell every possibly detail just incase it matched with any other case..:)  Thank you very much!!

They were all the same brightness except for one light was brighter and would go up three, down five, up six, down all the way, then halfway up and so on.  It did this random strobing very fast.  It was so unusual and compelling I immediately slowed down from about 60 mph to about 30 mph(on a highway!), never looking away.  Slowing down allowed me to view it for about 1-2 minutes. I should've pulled over to the shoulder to keep watching it but my subconscious kept telling me that I would figure out what it was, so just keep driving.  When I passed the hill it was above I lost sight of it then realized I HAD to go back and see it again.  I exited, turned arou! nd, merged back on the highway, (this took 5-10 mins.), but by then it was gone. I later saw the video of the Salida, Colorado UFO, and realized they're exactly the same type.  This happened many years ago but I remember it like it happened yesterday.  I told everybody at the party and they said that the reservoir has a history of strange lights coming in and out of the water.  A few weeks later I read in USA TODAY that an incident involving the military happened there about 30 years previously; a white light coming out of the water, hovering quite a while observed by many people.  The police were called and then eventually the military. I now live in North Carolina, and a few years ago saw two strange lights about 20 feet above some trees in WhiteCross NC. They were flat, about 15 feet across and did not project light but rather contained the light,  no glowing, no rays, almost as if they were portals. When I drove back to see them again, they too just disappeared. On the beltline in Raleigh, about 8 yrs.ago, I was with two driving students, and observed a small pin of green light materialize about 300 yards above some trees, it instantly expanded into an oval shape and then streaked across the sky leaving a green trail behind it. This event took about two seconds. This happened while the student who was driving happened to be talking about an event two years previously when he saw some strange green lights in the sky flying in random patterns. In the middle of his story, the green light appeared in front of us! We all shouted at the same time (sort of in Harmony); "" oh my God, did you just see that!"" All three of us shouted the exact same words;"" oh my god,  did you just see that"". The kid driving started freaking out pretty bad saying,""that's it! that's it! that's the kind of light I saw two years ago!"" it was as if 'they' heard us talking about 'them' and said, ""yeah, here we are!"". Needless t! o say I had him pull over to the shoulder so we could all catch our breath and figure out what just happened.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,41.0404,-74.301

I entered the Marine Corp in 1997, and that is the year the event took place.  I heard about this on Coast to Coast, and they said to report any event no matter how much time has elapsed.  I was in boot camp at MCRD San Diego, and during my thirteen weeks there, there are several times that we were taken to Camp Pendleton.   On this particular occasion we made our way there, and had to hump (hike) a mountain by the name of Old Smokey.  Old Smokey is a mountain on Camp Pendleton that was particularly high and steep.  Three quarters of the way up you have to basically crawl up the mountain it is so steep.  I remember actually passing through the clouds on the way up the mountain it is so high.   At approximately 21:00 hours my company was getting ready to go to bed when a huge craft appeared right above us.  It was so close it seemed as though we could almost touch it.  It hovered above us as though it was looking right at us.   There was about 200 Marines looking at this enormous craft, including enlisted and officers.   After about ten mins, we heard our helicopters, and jets heading right for the craft.  When our jets came within a couple of feet, the craft sped off with speed that I have never seen before.   After it left I’ll never forget the beautiful blue like exhaust that floated in the air for about two hours.   The following day we were told by our commanding officer never to speak of what we saw.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

Working tech support in a skyscraper downtown Denver, 18th floor, looking north over Denver, Commerce City.  A sun-shining Sunday afternoon, I watched a lone, low storm cloud move southward towards the city.  As I was helping a customer fix email connectivity, I focused on watching the cloud swirls and wisps.  I noticed a shiny flicker under the cloud ceiling.   As I honed in on the shine, I clearly saw 5 oval, pill shaped crafts, stationary in a 5 dot pattern formation.  The ships would then all swing up and out, down and back in to produce a new 5 dot pattern. (I likened it to braille patterns.  I got the impression they were producing communication with the different patterns.)  They continued to display different patterns.  I quickly put my customer on hold and ran to an adjacent room where 4 of my co-workers were on calls.  I hollered with authority for all of them to put their calls on hold and hurry to my window.  All 5 of us stood at the window watching these crafts move.   I then noticed, under the southern most tip of this lone storm cloud, was a 6th craft fully stationary.  As if in a supervisory roll, or to monitor any ""dot pattern"" messages being sent to them, idk.   The storm cloud was not high in the sky, it was smaller and by itself, so lots of sun shine.  All 6 air ships had dark bottoms and shiny metallic roofs.  I figured the dark bottoms helped them stay concealed under the dark looking storm cloud.  You probably wouldn't notice them being underneath, they may not have caught your eye to make you look up.  Remember, I was on the 18th floor looking across to them.   They flew over the area of Rocky Mountain Arsenal State Park, or the Oil Refinery in Commerce City.  The was no lights, no sounds, no flares or fire or smoke.  The movements were controlled and intelligent, similar to two like magnets repelling, but controlled. After the sighting, I emailed Art Bell at Coast to Coast AM and the local NBC 9 news station, although never hearing anything back.   These ships were real, in the daylight, and very close to the Denver vicinity.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

While standing on my first floor balcony I noticed a bright orange light over the water several hundred yards away.  An exact distance would be impossible to tell from the human eye but it could not have possibly been more than 1-2 miles from shore.  I pointed it out to my friends asking if it was a planet and as soon as we all caught sight of it it disappeared.  One of my friend claimed it was probably an airplane passing behind the clouds.  It quickly reappeared what looked like some hundred yards away and then disappeared once again.  About 2 minutes later we noticed a large orange glowing streak that looked like a falling star that was frozen in time, motionless.  Then this obeject slowly made a revolution clearly revealing a disk shape.  As this object slowly rotated a new light would appear which conclusively showed us the disk like shape.  Upon gazing at this slowly rotating object, my friend pointed out another craft displaying the same exact behavior.  An orange central light, with one orange light becoming visible with each rotation and orange lights displayed on the sides.  We then noticed the third identical object displaying the same behavior.  The three crafts seemed to reveal themselves in the order of left to right, slowly rotating and hovering above the Atlantic Ocean. These crafts made no identifiable sound though it was very windy.  Suddenly, all of the orange lights emitted from the three crafts went out.  They disappeared. About 3 minutes later we saw these disk shaped figures flying to our northwest, diagonally out of sight.  These crafts no longer emitted the glowing orange lights but now displayed what appeared to be multiple strobe lights around the edges.  Without these strobe lights around the perimeters of these crafts they would not have been visible to us.  We could only make out what appeared to be three ovular structures surrounded by strobe lights on the edges flying away from us in the northwest direction and out of our sight.  The first two were flying in a line in tandem with one another and the third following up in the rear.  This formed what appeared to be a triangular formation by which they exited from our view.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

I looked up to see two jet airliners heading northeast. as the first jet got closer I noticed a ball of light coming out of the northern sky.  It looked like It was going to hit the plane but it was only 1000 to 2000 feet up and the plane was 20000 feet up.  I could not believe the pilot did not see it and then banked left to avoid.  The plane following  made a slight turn left all the planes that night made same turn to avoid this spot.  a couple hours later I watched five balls of white light playing in eastern sky and for some reason I sensed they knew I was watching them.  the five of them hid in a star formation cassipeia ?  I knew they were there but they did not move. I never took my eyes off of them. a half hour has gone by still no movement.  then I notice dim light 150 feet away from me on ground.  I went over to see it closer. it was 5 lights very dim shining on ground on  the same spot they were over lapping one ano! ther. I was still watching them and they were watching me. I went back to where I was sitting. another 30 to 45 minutes went by still no movement. I had to go in the house but did not want to leave. so I called there bluff. I went to where the lights were shinning on ground looked up at them and said I must be seeing things? so I shrugged my shoulders and headed toward house. the whole time watching them while I walked away from them. when I got to my door out of there sight all five of them moved off there spots and headed in a southeast direction.

I jumped in my truck, and welcomed aboard Private ((name deleted)), my co-driver also known as my battle buddy.  I remember it was a quiet and slow ride, but then I seen that this HUMMV drifted ahead with speed.   The distance between our vehicles was increasing.  It only took seconds to get to the point when I wasn't able to see them at all.  I remember feeling terrified, because all I seen around was just darkness and we were on this cliff rolling downwards towards the end of the bridge.  I had no idea how or where those roads led, so I slowly released my foot off the gas, held down on the clutch and allowed my vehicle to roll, attempting to keep the wheel at what I considered straight.   All of a sudden my tractor jilted downwards fast as if my truck fell into a deep hole and my truck started to sway from left to right beyond my control, then it stopped.  My tanker full of fuel was creaking as if it was leaning.  I learned we were leaning in like a see-saw position as I glanced over to my frightened battle and seen she sat higher than me.  The unevenness in the cab of my tractor gave me a clue that we were leaning off the cliff!  This same cliff that had a significant drop!  We both sat solid in the truck beyond terrified because we knew we were about to die without a doubt. We both didn't even want to talk, we just stared.  The emotions of my battle filled me with sorrow and I was too stuck in fright to tell her that it will be ok.  The sad thing is I remember the only sentence she said was, ""I love you battle, at least we won't have a long death, it'll be quick because we're going to hit rock bottom too fast.""  We laughed, but it seemed as though our tiny fake giggles made the movement of the truck worse.  I had no idea where the convoy was behind us because I couldn't hear anything.  We were definitely not about to make a move and turn around to see.  So we sat still wi! th no other choice but to ready ourselves for death. 	What we then witnessed was out of this world and would require you to actually be there to believe it.  As I stated earlier we were driving vehicles that were used in Desert Storm, and that my tractor trailer was a stick shift.  The only way for that raggedy truck to turn on was if I pushed both my tiny feet way down on the clutch, then turn the key and hold it until it turns on in that exact order.  This instance was different. My truck just turned on by itself without the use of the clutch and definitely not the use of the key.  I refused to move a muscle let alone turn the ignition to start.  My hard to handle steering wheel spun crazily round and round and without being in any gear, my truck jolted forward then to the right.  I thought the weight of the truck had given in on the cliff and we were falling.  My vehicle continuously rolled forward until my battle and I noticed we were at the other side of the bridge and safe on regular road.  We can see our heavy foot HUMMV parked! along with the rest of the convoy that was ahead of us.  Behind us was a gap followed by the vehicles that were behind us from the start. It was a good thing a tanker moved from the back of the convoy and became the leader to lead the rest of the convoy to the end of the bridge where my vehicle was approaching. I didn't remember traveling that distance. It had to have been a 3 to 3 1/2 mile roll that I nor my battle had any recollection of.  I'm not insinuating that we were somehow time warped or anything of the sort, it's just that a 20 mph vehicle ride over a 3-mile stretch would be noticeable. It only took seconds for us to travel that distance.  At that time what mattered most was that we were alive. We were somehow saved from that cliff drop to death. My battle and I just stared at each other amazed by what we just witnessed and I remember my battle saying to me, ""I will ride in this truck from now on."" 	Once we were completely caught up to the convoy, Amy and I got out the truck and threw our hands towards the sky with kisses, thanking God for another chance at life. My praises was interrupted when I suddenly saw this anomaly in the sky. To describe it at it's best it looked like our moon when it's at full moon. This anomaly was shining bright and as it coasted in the sky a white fire like trail followed it. I wasn't able to hear a sound from it. It was high in the sky, but low enough to see and know for a fact that this was not something that we would call an aircraft of ours on this planet. It shimmered a royal blue like color as it coasted silently and slowly in the sky. It looked as though it was following our convoy while in the sky as though it was watching us. It was an odd sight, but very beautiful! My battle buddy, a few dozens of the soldiers in the convoy and myself watched this anomaly as it seemed as though it was following the whole convoy. We couldn't take p! ictures because flashes fell under light discipline and no one had a camera. This was an experience that would pass down as a myth to our grand children, but I will always know that I was there at the origin of that myth.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,,

It sort of reminded me of a comet with a very short tail.  We kept looking but did not see anything else.  It just seemed to disappear.

It moved at a medium pace while making lists to the left and right every 15 seconds or so. After about three minutes it gave a few flickers and disappeared.  However, it did not disappear over the horizon or mountains, instead it disappeared out the sky over the horizon.  The orange glow was most likely caused by the smoke of nearby wildfires, that had been burning the previous days. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

On the night of 03/16/13 in Armadale, Perth, Western Australia at 10:30ish pm, a light lit up all around me and my neighbour while we were drinking beer out the back of his property. It was very bright, brighter than any light I have ever seen, not even a halogen bulb could out perform this light. I liken the motor to that of an electric generator noise and that this was all I heard for a few seconds before it vanished. With an electric generator: lots of energy goes into changing direction of the pistons, some energy is turned into sounds of vibration. A very bright light was to my left, and on the right side of me there was a red tail light glare. I looked out the right hand side to see if any cars were shining their high beams. None. It was impossible for any vehicle to shine their high beam over the fence, and if it could, it would not be able to illuminate the fence completely due to obstacles being in the way, it would have cast the objects shadows onto the fence. The fence was lit up with no shadows cast upon it. I thought at that particular time 'I would have heard a vehicle's engine, so it wasn't a vehicle'. It was at this stage I realised it wasn't anything I knew existed that is man-made. I have been in a couple motor vehicle accidents in the past, and this is the only way I could represent what I felt like at that point in time, an observer to what was happening above and all around me. It wasn't like a sound from an electric generator either.  I used the electric generator to give you an idea of the sound I heard. It was definately a rotating click of about 2-3 second rotation, but it was a faint clicking rotational noise.  We were stuck in the middle of something I regard as a whirling vortex mass. I could feel its presence.  This thing felt as though it was overtop of me because I looked in all directions except above to see where the light was emanating from. We were both drinking and just kept drinking while this happened.  I was relaxed by this stage of the night when this event occurred.  Afterward, we laughed it off and got a few more beers. It wasn't till after it happened (5-10 minutes) when we both said to each other 'what was that?'  I looked up an internet forum to see if anything was reported.  There was a sighting on the 13/3/13 in Queens Park, this location is a few suburbs away up the Armadale Train Line about 25 kilometers away. The electric sound I think was buzzing all around.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

My two daughters, 11 and 12, and one of their school friends and I were returning home from the movies Saturday evening at 9:40pm.  We were ¼ mile from home traveling west when I observed four orange lights in the sky as I looked through the trees and while rounding a turn.  As I drove through the turn I immediately pulled the car off the road, turned on the hazard lights and asked the children to start filming what I saw in the sky.  All objects were approximately three thousand feet up, made absolutely no sound and much larger than any distant star.  If you held a pencil out in front of you they would be the same size as the eraser on the end. The first 4 objects were heading from SW to NE all along the same bearing.  Together they reminded me of the handle of the big dipper, referring to the formation they were in.  They, as well as the follow on groups of objects, were orange in color, almost looking as if it was a burning orange.  As the first four craft crossed my bearing, as I looked into the sky, one by one the orange craft “flickered” in color and vanished.  They all vanished at the same point in space.  It was this time that the children and I who had called family members to report what we were seeing noticed that the phone calls dropped repeatedly. The next 5 objects were in a “V” formation with one single object out front followed by two and then again followed by two more.  Once again they were burning orange in color and traveled in the same direction as the first four.  At the same point in the sky the objects flickered and disappeared from sight. The last two objects were in succession, one behind the other, and behaved as the others. Once home I called 911 and reported our sightings.  My daughter recorded 3.5 minutes of video which doesn’t do justice to what we saw but does capture the experience.

Nine round lights in an almost vertical direction ( 90 degree angle into the sky above) hovered but were mostly stationary over the N/NW part of the city of N Las Vegas.  The lights were equally spaced apart and would get bright and then dim in patterns.  For example, all lights would turn bright together and then dim, whereupon the bottom most light (maybe starting 250 feet above the buildings and homes) would turn a red color, the 2nd through 8th lights would go bright up the almost vertical line of light one by one, successively, after the other until the ninth and topmost light would grow bright red.  I and five other witness watched this for about 45 minutes straight. The patterns of the lights glowing bright white and then fading out almost completely, was constantly changing, almost pulsing at times, and the lights were moving very slowly, not breaking formation  due West.   As we were all viewing this event, a light appeared in the sky in front of us, South of the formation and closer to us.  It shot upwards after appearing and faded out completely. Additionally, closer and to the NW, we observed another bright light appear, and  travel at high speed for a second and disappear.  Appeared high up in space.  To right of the Big Dipper.  We all also observed another shooting light orb appearing out of nowhere and shooting upwards, arcing and disappearing. this was again South of the formation to the North and lower and much closer to our viewing position. Finally the formation moved West at a faster speed, all lights disappearing but one, which proceeded to grow brighter and much bigger.  At peak light intensity it vanished. We could no longer see anything in the sky to the North.  About a minute or less after the final large round light went out, as we were talking about it, we looked to the North East as a huge bright light caught our eye.  It was traveling in a South Easterly direction and appeared to be a large white light traveling very fast.  It was pretty close and low, and large.  Very bright white. It too vanished by going from extremely bright to dim in milliseconds.  Then it was gone. Looked like the large light from the formation, at the end.  Don't know if it was or not. Again six of us observed the light formation for around 45 minutes. We were driving and saw the formation, and stopped near our home to observe it.  So crazy we could not stop watching all of the events.  We have no idea if anyone else around the city saw it, but I am positive others observed it.

It was a Triangle shape with a white light at each point.  I instantly thought it was probably a plane since Pease International Tradeport runway was like less than a mile away. My girlfriend at the time and I were traveling south on Banfield and saw this white or orange or orange-white bright light through trees and finally it came over the road directly above us and as it was jist about over us it INSTANTLY changed directions, doing 180 and heading back the way it came without even slowing down. We tried to chase it around the block (up to route 3 and back around) and still could see the bright light as I called my mom.  Then it was gone.  I later speculated if it could be a hovering harrier aircraft but it doesn't have that light configuration and again it didn't slow down at all when it did the 180 directly over us.

On Easter Saturday, April 12th, 2004, at about 8pm, I was bike riding on the Greenbelt Trail with my boyfriend. We parked at the trailhead on Jericho Turnpike in Woodbury and rode south on thte trail. After riding for a short bit on Sunnyside Blvd, we went back into the woods. In that next section there are two hills and valleys. On top of the first hill we turned off our helmet lights and were catching our breth when I looked into the sky toward the west.. ""What is that?"" I asked.  It was a square flying object surrounded by lights and was flying away from us.  I shrugged it off, it was pretty far away, so I forgot about it, turned my lights back on and road down into  the next valley.  As we as we got up onto the next hill and turned our lights off, I looked to the south and saw the same flying object as before, but this time it was flying towards us.  It was square or rectangle, had lights all around the edge and was silent.  We were on a hill and the flying object appeared to be flying pretty low.  It was coming right towards us but turned 90 degrees on a dime and headed west, the same as the other ship we saw earlier. Right then any doubt I had as to what it was vanished.  I knew it was a UFO.  Planes are not silent and don't make right angle turns. I noticed something else odd about that night.  During other night rides on this trail the wildlife would be abundant with birds, squirrels, raccoons, opossums etc.  But on this night the woods was eerily quiet, before and after the UFO sighting.  Being filled with fear didn't stop me from continuing my ride that night, but it did interfere with future night rides.  I found many reasons to not go night riding after that.  My boyfriend wanted to believe the object we saw was just a plane.  He acknowledged it once or twice as a UFO, but then has been steadfast in his denial ever since.  I know was I saw.  It was a UFO.

It was around 12 that night that I had left a friends house and walked down the street to wait for a ride. Minutes later I noticed a small red/orange glowing orb or sphere in the sky up high and off the horizon.  I was surprised by this due to the fact that it was not a clear night, but instead one with rather low visibility having only a few stars in the sky. At first I thought it was mars, but then quickly dismissed that as the hovering object began to move across the sky about the same speed as a plane, yet with no flashing lights or noise just a silent steady glow.  The object continued to float across the sky in an upward zig zag pattern for a few minutes, which made me think it could have been a red chinese lantern, but I could tell by the size ratio in the sky and the high altitude it was at that this could not be possible. As it approached a nearby star the object stayed motionless, let off a white glow and then faded into a dim light (that could have been mistaken as a star) and then ultimately disappeared and vanished into thin air. After its disappearance I was left in shock feeling uneasy, and overwhelmed, the experience even led me to tears.  Although the whole event only lasted roughly 3 to 5 minutes it changed my life forever. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

A pressurized-sounding wind seen moving slowly about a Wildlife Preserve without any visible craft above its effects.,Indiahoma,OK,2013-03-17T15:00:00,unknown,20-30 seconds,"Occurred : 3/17/2013 15:00  (Entered as : 03/17/13 15:00) Reported: 3/17/2013 6:43:23 PM 18:43 Posted: 5/15/2013 Location: Indiahoma, OK Shape: Unknown Duration:20-30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96666.html,"A pressurized-sounding wind seen moving slowly about a Wildlife Preserve without any visible craft above its effects. Greetings- I have never been a skeptic after witnessing an orange/red glowing orb in upstate NY as a teenager which resulted in a time lapse to my knowledge but was never discussed afterward amongst the two people in my company. The following event occurred today:  As an avid hiker, I was resting on a trail which I enjoy trekking every week for about 5 months now.  The trail itself is roughly two hours long.  I was about half an hour into the hike.  The trail head is not near any main thoroughfare and the number of cars at the trailhead today was minimal so there were few people on trail. Let me describe the area;  The trail area was a wishbone-shaped terrain.  The main trail was singular before breaking into two parts.  I was resting at the lower ""part"".  On each opposing side the terrain grew gradually on the opposing sides into simple enbankments rising somewhat quickly.  Opposite to me was not a rocky terrain but was mostly low-level scrub brush and the local spruce reaching no more than 10-12 feet in this specific area. As I rested I began hearing what sounded like a wind in the distance.  It immediately registered to me as a moving vehicle before I realized I was miles from any road.  The sound was first heard moving from my right out of sight up the trail from where I had just traveled.  As I realized there was no way it could be a vehicle I tried to register what in the world it was.  I kept watching the trail bend where I heard the sound approaching and wondering what in the world it was. The wind here in Oklahoma is different- it can gust quite differently than most places. I've lived after having been active-duty in the Air Force for 10 years abroad and having live in upstate NY near Lake George and south of Lake Placid growing up. This wind was unlike anything I've heard or seen. It was moving up the path still out of my line of sight. When the sound came into view I knew it was something but I saw nothing. I saw no object or any craft but ""it"" continued to emit a strange sound like a ""hollow wind"" but there was no object. It began deviating slowly away from the trail up the embankment and I watched its effects. It was moving quite slowly and deliberately and it made my hair stand up to watch it. I knew it wasn't the wind but there wasn't any object or anything. As it moved slowly enough for me to watch it the effects area of its entire motion was about 20-25 feet in length- meaning, the area which was affected by this movement of air was a 20-25 foot space of land/shrubbery/dirt underneath which was continully being moved as it moved slowly forward or more accurately to my left at about 50-75 yards in front of me. I was quite mezmorized knowing wind doesn't make that sound or travel that slow or deliberate while remaining as though contained in the same specific area. As it moved into almost my direct sight at approx. 50-75 yards away, I muttered ""what is that""? At that point it slowed and stopped in place but continued moving things about underneath it but in place with an approx. width of about 20-25 feet. I was still dumbfounded as I continually looked above it and saw nothing but watched its effects beneath. At this point my instinct fight/flight was taking over but as ""it"" remained still, I was better able to hear the sound more clearly and it sounded more like escaping pressurized air. Also at this time I noticed clear evidence that this was nothing ordinary because the branches of the small spruce trees underneath were moving vertically up and down and NOT horizontally as they would have with any normal wind. Ater ""it"" remained in place for about 4-5 seconds there is no question I could not see anything above it. I did feel like I was looking at something though because I let my eyes scan freely and they locked on about 30 feet above the spot. However- the sound slowly stopped, not immediately but it faded and was gone. That was it. No further sound- no nothing. After reading some about sightings I've read there is often radiation found in the vicinity so I was not eager to inspect the area but to perfectly honest I just wanted to leave the area quickly.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,34.6815,-98.7406

Its bright white football shape quickly morphed into, what I can best describe as, a series of cotton balls attached to one another. It then began to writhe much like an amorphous earthworm. At the end of the object there was a small appendage that seemed to dangle separately, but it (the appendage) did not change shape. There was a ""fuzz"" surrounding the entire object that seemed to not allow proper focus (i.e. very few sharp edges or contrast). When it was at its closest, I thought I detected a pink hazy light, much like bio luminescence. And after a quick grab of my binoculars, the pink was obvious. Even after it had moved further away, I could see the pink light. It looked as though it was inside the object, and slightly outside the dorsal portion of it. It was silently moving from east to west, with surface winds approximately blowing at 5mph from the SSE. But at several points during the observation, it was moving into the wind. It seemed to be a controlled ""flight"" and not wind driven. Its height was below the low clouds that were drifting lazily by. What ever the cloud deck height was in Austin that day will give its approximate height. At one point there was a twin-engined small plane moving parallel to the object's position. As the plane moved closer, the object moved further away. Eventually the object simply disappeared. I observed the object for at least 5-minutes, but the first witness only saw it for a minute or so. I attempted to film it, but it doesn't show up on my camera. I did find a video of another observation that looks almost identical to what I saw.

They appeared to be moving together but not connected. They were very bright orange and high up, probably as high as a plane flying at a very low cruising altitude – or a helicopter at a very high flying altitude.  I would describe the movement like hot air balloons, but a few would move up or down ( in relation to the others from my perspective.. could have been side to side ) in what seemed to be a controlled pattern. As I drove I thought it was very strange , trying to focus on the road but very distracted by what these lights were. When I came to an intersection where more of the sky was visible I saw so many more, at least 30. Others have reported seeing 50-100 earlier in the evening! I saw them moving west to east.  Mostly in a cluster , a few trailed off behind. At this point I was very shocked and pulled over, and got out of my car ! to look. I took a photo and video with my cell phone but since my camera is not that great - the photos are blurred and hard to distinguish. The Extremely bright orange lights were like nothing I have seen. They did not flicker or pulse, just a steady bright light. The 30 (estimate) lights moving kept going slowly – to the west. Some would rotate around others... or move to different parts of the group but as a whole they all seemed to be going west. There were many people looking up at the sky wondering what they were. ( it is a downtown area – many restaurants bars etc... ) One particular bar/grill by my apartment appeared to have all the patrons outside pointing and wondering what the lights were. Eventually, they faded into the distance as they all moved west and disappeared into the night sky. After doing some research I discovered these lights were around Portland a few hours earlier as well, as reported by many others (http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/nov/15/experts-uncertain-about-reports-strange-lights-ove/)  This was a true phenomenon .  In my entire life I have not heard of any atmospheric or natural occurrence like this. (Apparently no one else has either.) A local museum suggested it sounds like it was in the atmosphere – but from my perspective it sure seemed like they were floating / moving at the altitude described above.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

It was about 11:30pm pst.   I was facing directly East,  and was looking up at the stars ( because normally you can't see them...). It was slightly cloudy,  kind of hazy out and in the mid 60's.   The eastern sky was the only area of the sky that had visible stars.   At some point around 11:30ish I noticed a bright orangish red ball flying above the the hills,  right above Mt. Hamilton.   I stared at it for almost a minute before I knew for sure that what I was looking at was something I could not understand.   It looked like a ball of light and it moved like an airplane at first.  I then pointed it out to my 2 friends,  and let them know that I had been staring at this and can't figure it out.  They immediately thought it was an airplane,  due to the size and speed.  But then it seemed to stop in mid air,  not to mention it wasn't really moving in a straight ! line.  So then we thought it was a helicopter.  This also was disproved by the size and speed.   I would say it was the size of a 3-4 bedroom house or slightly bigger.   So it moved toward us, and seemed pretty low, but then moved away,  then North,  then back to the West,  back North again before it looked to be moving away from us upward!  When it moved it was either really slow or extremely fast.  It shot up into space and disappeared within about 10 seconds!  This ball thing also seemed to be changing color from red to orange,  and I think I could see the colors moving all around the ball.  At a certain point I could see light radiating from the ball in all directions.  It looked like seeing a red light through a wet window,  or like how a bright star looks in the distance.   This lasted at least 2 minutes.   I was then walking around my yard going through every possible explanation,  and one of my friends was also doing this.  The 3rd friend was in denial and kept maki! ng up excuses as to what it was,  but non of them made sense a! nd I cou ld disprove all of them.   After a few minutes we sat back down and attempted to restart our conversation.  I however couldn't stop staring East.  Then, after about 2-3 minutes from the last occurrence,  I saw it again!  Except this time I saw it immediately,  as it rose above the East hills.   I started yelling for everyone to look at it,  and scared them because it made me jump up.  This time we all 3 saw it from start to finish.   The weird thing was that it took what seemed to be the same path as the 1st fire balls we saw.  A lot of discussion went on during this second one,  and all possible explanations were thrown out the door.  It was official,  what we were seeing defied all logic based on our knowledge and the available technology.   It was gone again,  after it shot off into space,  and we were all left staring up into the eastern sky wondering what the f@*k just happened.  Once again after a few minutes I spotted it again in almost the same spot.  The 3rd time we! were very big eyed and quiet just observing and inside freaking out.  After the 3rd occurrence I went inside the house and told my girlfriend to wake up and put her jacket on.  I had to have another witness, and someone to explain to me what was going on.   She came outside and we all told her what we saw.  By this time we were all climbing things to get a higher view,  and she thought we were nuts!  But just my luck it happened one last time.  The 4th time we saw it,  it seemed to get closer to us before it shot off into the horizon.  Also,  during the whole thing all of us saw several shooting stars each.  All of also can't remember ever seeing more than one shooting star ever in our lives,  from San Jose that is.   I got my 6ft. ladder out to get a better view,  thinking it would happen again.  What I saw over the top of my very tall fence,  on the very tops of the hills,  was some odd lights.  It looked like street lights but all the way on the top of the hills.  I've ! lived here 32 years,  and I consider myself a very observant p! erson. I've never in my life seen lights on top of these hills.  I pointed them out to everyone and mentioned they were not normally there.   Everyone thought they were lights from someone's house on the mountain,  but I knew there are no homes there.   No more strange balls of fire showed up so we went and sat back down.  About 5 minutes later,  I got up and climbed up my ladder again.  When I looked to the top of the mountains,  the lights we saw were gone!  Also,  today with the sun up I used my binoculars to get a good view of that area,  and there is nothing there...  I don't know what we saw.  But it wasn't an airplane,  helicopter, remotely operated device, wasn't a meteor, missile, rocket, weather balloon,  and took off into space.

My observatory is a slide off roof type giving me a full view of the sky.   While preparing to mount a camera on my telescope for some deep sky photographs I observed an object moving slowly almost over head in a Northerly direction.  The object trailed a blue glow.  It did not have navigational lights and the only reason I could make out the shape had to be that it was low enough to catch the glow from the city lights south end east of my location.   The object was rectangular or perhaps a flattened cylinder. Definitely not a shape I associate with aeronautics.   While observing the blue glow intensified and the object disappeared over the northern horizon in perhaps 2 seconds.  My estimate of the speed was something like four to five thousand miles per hour, yet there was no sound.

I am telling you this because when I say that the objects that 5 different people saw were not anything the FAA is familiar with, I know what Im talking about.   My wife, Brother in law, and his wife and I were attempting to do some night fishing and found ourselves having no luck for several hours.

We finally had enough and headed back towards the bay area to dock for the night and had just reached the mouth of it when I noticed the first of the three fireballs rising up froma site about 1 kilometer from shore.  My brother in law was the next to notice the odd light and alerted my wife and then his wife.  We set the boat into idle and watched as the second and then the third rose from the shore line to join the others.  The sat in a straight line approximately 300 feet apart at about 1500 feet Altitude.  About 30 seconds passed by and then the two farthest to our right joined the lead fireball and sat for a brief moment and flew off at such a high rate of speed that it took a few moments for mind to process that hadnt just disappeared.  The three of us to awestruck to actually say much of anything about it restarted the boat and headed back to dock for the night.  The next morning my mother in law mentioned that she had seen the three orbs as well.  I was not assigned to a Air Traffic Control facility in the area and had no reason to report the sighting at the time, although I have discussed it with other Air Traffic Controllers and while they think I am crazy they admit they have nver seen anything like that as well.  While searching youtube one day a coworker brought to my attenti! on a video taken in Hawaii that was exactly what we saw that night.   I should mention before closing this report that my wife did attempt to capture a video of the fireballs on a HD camera phone but the video was horrible.  It looked like the old tube television sets when you placed a magnet to close to the edges. It wasnt worth keeping so we deleted it.   I am just now reporting it because of the video we found on Youtube being identical in every way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2013-07-03T00:00:00,,

Our whole group of 4 adults, and 5 children began watching the object and discussing it during and after.

We had plenty of time to observe it and determine that it was not identifiable, and therefore as far as we were concerned, a UFO.

It appeared the size of a silver dollar held at arms length, but this was at roughly 5000 feet altitude, at the base of the clouds.

About 20 minutes before sundown while on the phone I noticed an aircraft which was thin, black and shaped like a V. It had 5 glowing orange lights underneath. ( lights 2 ft. diameter) As it passed overhead (NW to SE), I didn't hear much except for a quiet humming sound. It was flying low (app. 200 ft.) and slow (app. 100 mph). The wingspan was around 40 to 50 ft. It wasn't a B2-stealth bomber, Ive seen many (whitemans AFB). There was no cockpit, fuselage, rutters, or engines. Just a V. Seemed to be floating, or hovering. My best guess is that it is an undercover drone or surveillance plane. Maybe for reading temperatures.  I need help identifying this aircraft. I never thought Id see a UFO until i saw this. My report is documented with MUFON case #25885.  The only discrepancy in my account, is the wingspan of the aircraft.

The craft were very odd appearing, dark in color, with each craft oriented in the same direction, facing south. The shape of each craft looked similar to an outline of the New England Patriots helmet logo, with the tapered end facing north. Each craft ""floated"" independently, with slight movements among them in different directions such that I was able to discern multiple crafts instead of one.  The height of the crafts was about 3000 feet, and they were drifting away from me to the west.  When I first saw them, I had a very eery feeling as if they were monitoring or observing the ground from above. The crafts were silent.  They were too large for birds. I had wondered if they were drones, but they moved so close to each other that it would have been impossible for them to prevent interference among them with propellors or with other conventional means of propulsion. I had also wondered if they were kites, but the objects were too large and too high to be kites because there was no wind that morning that could have kept the kites aloft. I stopped my car, and walked around to the other side near the west to begin taking an iPhone video of them. By the time that I had started the video recording, the crafts had drifted sufficiently far away such that they appear only as very small dots on the video. Because they were drifting away, and because I was late to work, I stopped the video recording, and returned to my car.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,32.59007611940299,-96.96742835820896

The sighting occurred at approximately 9.40 pm on the night of March the 19th, in New Paltz, New York.  My step sister and I were having a cigarette on the side deck of my home when I noticed an extremely brightly colored orange light moving across the sky from a westward direction heading south.  It was a very dark, clear night sky and I immediately recognized the light to be brighter than anything I have ever seen before.  My step sister had her back to it and after allowing it a split second to register I immediately grabbed her attention and pointed her to the light source.  We quickly moved off the deck to get a better view and angle on the light.  I initially thought I would see a blinking light or quickly see an explanation.  Soon realizing what was happening I ran back to the deck side door and called for my mother and stepfather.  Then I ran back to my left side yard and saw the definite shape of a oval object that looked as if it were blazing on fi! re.  The object was roughly 300 feet above the ground and the easiest way to describe it was a Japanese balloon glowing bright orange, this was the logic I used to portray it.  The object/orb was impossibly brilliant orange and from a point blank view had a definite shape with absolutely no wings/sound/or blinking lights.  The light remained consistent throughout its entire flight.  My mother and stepfather and stepsister and I all watched as it gently moved almost hovering across the sky as if it were being pulled by a string.  The object appeared to be moving very gently and slowly but covering a lot of space at the same time.  The speed seemed to remain the same but within a few minutes it was very high in the sky and it seemed to be moving at a gradual incline.  The four of us agreed without question it was something we had never seen before and was simply unexplainable.  The defining details I clearly have imprinted in my mind were its brilliant color, definite shape a! nd precise smooth line of travel and ability to cover a lot of! space i n a short amount of time.  There in my opinion was zero chance of misidentifying this object, it was from a point blank view point and very definite in shape and color.  My stepfather thought at first it was a fireball.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,41.7583,-74.0657

The year is 2011, the month is March, and the location is Las Vegas, Nevada.  The time is 2:00PM and it is a sunny, clear sky afternoon.  It also happens to be primary election day.  I returned from voting and as the temperature was mild I went out to the patio and sat in a recliner to enjoy a bit of sunshine.  The houses are two stories with chimneys extending approximately  ten feet above the roofline.  Between my house and the one next door is full bushy tree of about the same height as the roof. I was gazing up at the sky and speculating on election results when an object emerged from the behind the tree moving slowly but steadily from west to east.  It maintained consistent altitude, speed and was silent.  The appearance was that of a large tall aluminum can turned on its side.  The surface was dull silver with an area along lower rear in black.  No wings, other protrusions, markings or obvious means of propulsion was evident.  It certainly didn’t seem to be aerodynamically designed for flight. I was somewhat drowsy when it first appeared and I immediately assumed that it was a banner or hot air balloon relating to the elections, which is not an unusual site in Vegas.  I immediately dismissed this assessment, as the altitude was so low that a plane hauling it or the apparatus needed for it to be a hot air balloon would be visible and was conspicuously absent.  I then considered that it might be space debris, perhaps part of a satellite that was falling to earth, but it seemed to be moving too slowly and steadily at a maintained altitude for this to be the case.  The altitude was so low that the object was occluded from vision when it passed behind the chimney. What I am about to report now is going to make me sound crazy or hallucinatory.  I can only say that I have never been subject to hallucinations; and neither was I drinking alcohol or using any form of drugs, prescription or otherwise.   When the object began to pass behind the chimney, I got up and proceeded along the left side of the house to get a better view before it would pass behind another tree to my left.  To my astonishment the object seemed to have simply vanished. That evening I thoroughly checked all local news sources, but found no reference.

For some reason I happened to look to my right in the sky and there was what appeared to be  a star.  It was the size of the largest stars in the sky.  This one was MOVING!. It was only visible for about 30 seconds, and it clearly did not have a tail, or trail.  No flashing lights.  Just a  light similar to the majority of the stars in the sky.  It was moving North East.  Then we saw about 4 shooting stars and then another weird moving ""star"" about 10 minutes from the first one, this one was moving south east and it did the same as the last.  Lasted about 30 seconds to a minute before getting dimmer and dimmer and fading away.  Then in the next 20 minutes we saw 3 more shooting stars.  Then suddenly I spotted another moving ""star"" moving east  north east.  As I watched in amazement I noticed there was another one almost directly in its path moving a lot slower but going in similar directions.  As the faster one approached the slower one, it seemed to slow way down and curve to the north, they passed right by each other and the fast one sped up and curved back in its original east north east direction.  I thought we were seeing satellites until I saw these two.  Obviously the fast one was being controlled for it to bank the directions it did.  They both were in the sky for several minutes before appearing to ""dim out"".  We saw 2 more of these after that.  None lasting more than a few minutes before seeming to just dim out.  It's probably important to note that all but 2 of these things we saw, had planes take the same path minutes after they disappeared.  I have checked on nasas website and it seems one or two of them could have been the space station and the japanese shuttle that was just launched.  But that only explains two of them.

Anyway as we were driving home my sister was making fun of me pretending she was an ""alien"" clone of my sister which hurt my feelings because I know what I saw, but later that night my sister and I were watching a movie and I fell asleep about 10.30-11 pm and I have no memory to how I got to bed except her yelling at me and being angry before she slammed her bedroom door. I woke up the next morning which was a Saturday and watched th! e rest of the movie as I fell asleep while watching the night ! before, so about an hour through the movie my sister comes out and said what the fuck were you on about last night and I replied with I don't remember anything what did I do, she went on and told me that when she tried to wake me up and I got up and said ""where is everyone"" and she told me she said that they were asleep and she was going to bed then she told me I asked where (fake name) dahlia was which was her 'name' and she said she replied I'm here? And I said no seriously dahlia where the fuck is dahlia and she thought I was joking but when she was telling me she said it did t seem like i was joking because I would have smiled by then anyway apparently I continued on the the kitchen and she was so scared I was going to have a knife when returning that she followed me stopping at the door she said she watched me and I stood in the middle of the room for about 3 minutes until I went to the light switch and turned off the light, she said I was angry and swearing when I wa! lked past her to the lounge room where I turned off the lights leaving her in the dark and she she said she got angry saying ""I can't turn off the lights on her"" she told me while telling me what I dd last night that she was so scared because I was so angry and that I've never acted like that to her, then she continued on saying that she went to her room yelling at me saying not to turn the lights of on her which then she slammed the door at that moment I said that I remembered her slamming her door and her being angry but that was all, not even going to bed it was like I was in a trance, after reading a book on people's reports of aliens I thought I should so that's why only now I'm reporting my sighting Oh also the next day I read on Facebook someone's status quote ""Aliens visited (my home town- she said the actual name though) last night"" In conclusion I believe I had an alien encounter as it was not only me that felt the weirdness ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in February 2012 is approximate.

It was a clear evening, and I noticed a pulsating donut shaped red and green object to the north.  The only reference points were the large buildings on the other side of the strip, as I estimate this object could have been 2-3 miles away and above 2000+ feet up in the night sky.  The ""Christmas Donut"" as I called it was proceeding in a slow pace to the west. I had my small digital camera which also takes video with me.  I proceeded taking 8 photos and 2 videos of this object, my girlfriend also saw this object, as did numerous patrons and associates of the club.  What was kind of strange is that other people that I excitedly exclaimed about the object, could care less, also they closed the patio and made everyone go inside the building.  They could have closed the patio at 11pm, I don't know.  I watched the object intensely as I photographed and videoed the object, what was unique is how the object changed shape as it progressed across the sky and there was some type of strobe light on the second video I recorded.  My photos are somewhat blurred due to no tripod, but as I stated this object was a donut, where you could see through the middle, and was quite large due to the distance.  I posted the first video on U-Tube as April 17, 2012 Las Vegas UFO. The illuminated sphere of the Eifel Tower is the picture with my video.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

If you were to lay a one dimensional triangle down where all three points were laying against the ground this is how it was moving from South to North.  It was no higher that 300-600 feet above us and crossed directly over us once the light changed we began driving I was in awe and told my friend to look up and when she saw them she stopped the car and climbed up through the sunroof to see them.  We had plenty of time to take photos, yet it was hard to get an a shot that would come out as awesome as they were in person.  This flat triangular shape bean to turn in a 360 degree rotation with the pointer flame/light tumbling first, and it did this 3 or 4 times.  It began ! to level out once it crossed over Hwy 67 North and then suddenly after crossing over the top point of the triangle was flickering more rapidly and then it vanished, along with the second and third.  One at a time, in a 5 second interval.  I'd say when we started the angle at which we were looking was at a 45 degree and it slowly became 90 degrees and directly over head where we were looking up underneath.  As it past over us I noticed that there was some material that connected each light together along the outside edges. I couldn't see anything in the middle of the shape it appeared hollow.  I did see that the lights were causing whatever material that was keeping them together to reflect and honestly it looked like what spiderwebs look like under a brief flash of a flash like at night.  They didn't seem to make any sound, and were kind of pretty.  I do think that they were somewhat intelligent and it looked like they were showing off, once other cars stopped to watch.  On! e car coming from a side country road actually drove off the r! oad and onto some railroad tracks that run alongside the highway.  Yes these tracks are still in use and we did call the police department because the car actually bottomed out on the tracks.  I notice they jumped out and kept looking though, which should demonstrate how awesome and unusual these lights were.

They would at times stay in the same general spot for hours & we would all just watch them & try to see if it moved as we were working through the night.  The orange lights would brighten and dim as time passed and at moments it would move quickly over very short distances & disappear and re-appear.  The closest I could describe this object was if someone was holding a very dim orange flash light at a pretty good distance away.  Also, the size of this object must be rather large because I know what I small boat looks like at a distance of about 10 nautical miles & this object was a lot bigger than any small boat. Out at sea you see a lot of objects in the sky that would defy anything like an airplane or jet.

We as many others do use Ghostboxes and many spirits come through claiming to be inner dimensional beings, on the moon,..........The maker ((name deleted)) says aliens channeled him info on how to build the first box. Anyway, last summer I took a box out was in my pool playing with husband and goofing off chatting away with them.  Many lie, some are truthful, you have to use discernment with them, that's why in our YouTube video's we put we neither endorse nor refute we just present their evidence.  Anyway a HUGE ORANGE ball lit up my back yard.  It was like a plasma ball and you could see them in it.  It was REALLY SCARY.  They came through the box.   We calmly walked into the house and I didn't use the box again for months.  I have also since been followed home by two from Jacksonville, NC (32 miles from my house)but they were not the plasma balls they were light like crafts.   Anyway I will put you some links to smaller ones pics.  They are here all you have to do is look and tune in.

The very first thing I saw was what appeared to be a firework above the tree level in all red-ish orange flares however these flares reversed direction and created this very large red-ish Mostly Orange Orb.  It did not fly in a straight line.  The glow was massive to the eye!  I felt like it was going to abduct us and panic was setting in.

When I turned I looked up at the moon and noticed a pulsating orange orb/fireball but it wasn't fire that I was seeing.

Now by the time we went outside in back yard it had accelerated extremely fast in a matter of about 25 seconds it was onl! y about 15 to 20 degrees above the southwest horizon!  It had to have accelerated to a very high speed and was out of eye sight within 15seconds of coming outside to the backyard!  I am not sure of the altitude but it seemed like at least 15 or 20 thousand feet because a plane came into view that was not to far away from the object, and then it was out of sight!  It made no sound, but since I didn't know its height it may have just been to high to hear it.  I couldn't make an educated guess on its size.

Me and my spouse at the time were talking.  Something entered him.  He had one eye wide open and another eye was normal.  He was talking in a weird language.  He would speak and then he would ask me questions.  He asked me several questions and he moved around to several different spots while he was in the trance.  I had seen a red orb earlier.  I wanted to call someone and tell someone about it but for fear of being called crazy.  The good thing is that he can testify to the event as well.  It was like something took him over and it was gone as soon as it entered.  I told it to leave and I told him to tell it to leave.  My spouse has no mental or medical explanation.

I got up instantly and saw an orange yellow bright fireball which was bright enough to awake me and instantly go to my window.  It moved in an north to south direction, tangentially at a low angle of descent to the east of the town. It was bright enough to light up the town, but lasted in total only five seconds in total.  I do not recall any sort of tail.  It disappeared suddenly without any noise or explosion. It appeared to my eye to be a meteor, moving at an extreme rate of speed.  It was certainly not a balloon or Chinese lantern. Parenthetically I saw a large triangular craft in the nearby Iao valley about two years ago, at about 3:00. It was noiselessly motionless above the highest local peaks of the west maui mountains. It had lights along its edges at the long axis.  I watched for 15 minutes or so, then left. I have seen several identical objects in palm desert in the past, over the period of three to five years ago.  I watched these for hours. Silent.  Motionless at night always. Usually as I recall around the same time of night. I have inexplicably become used to waking up at 0:300 and feeling compelled to arise and direct my gaze toward Orion.  This behavior began about six years ago.  I have no explanation. I add only that I had the feeling, based on just a gut reaction, that these triangular craft are not alien. Thank you.

On this night I was driving westward in Bartlett, Il, and I was the first car stopped at a stop light when from the north west an orange/amber  ball was moving across the sky in front of me at a slow pace.   The object did not have any aviation lights and wasn’t moving very fast. I began to observe this object hard because it wasn’t normal to me.   The distance was not far at all from me judging by the speed and the point of view.  I was startled and called my girlfriend at home telling her about what I was seeing.  She lives only a half mile north east of my position.  I told her to drop what she was doing and look out her back window to verify.  She did see it, but barley because of how low it seemed.    It wasn’t raining, but the clouds had a very low ceiling and it was almost misting outside.  There were planes above going to O’Hare, which were higher than this object.  The planes were heading east like normally lining up for landing and their head lamps ! were coming through the clouds in a fog.  These planes lights were totally different and moving a lot faster. I know in my mind that this light wasn’t normal at all.  I’ve lived in this area 25 years and I know what planes look like.  I also work next to Dupage Airport and see all different types of planes every day.  Trust when I say this was not a conventional aircraft.   If I were to accurately guess the height of the object I would say it was similar or lower than a single prop private plane would fly.  As the light turned green I almost was directly under it and followed it left down a side street as it was heading in a south eastern direction.  Now I’ve caught up with the object and it was basically directly above me as my head is above my dashboard looking straight up through the windshield.  I pulled over to the right of the road at a park to get a good look at it.  Once I got out of my car, there were 4-5 other similar objects all congregated in this air space abov! e me seemingly out of nowhere.  The only noise I heard was the! sound o f passing cars and a plane that was in the area.  These other objects were not a glowing amber color like the original, but almost a white color and brighter.  I did not notice if these objects were in a certain formation or not because my mind was running a million miles a minute, but they were in some sort of cluster.  As they began to move south east again, I hopped in my car and tried to follow again through a windy loopy neighborhood, but they were all gone within another minute or so with no trace.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,41.9734,-88.2065

It looked like a star at first but it was far too large and bright to be a star. It started in the NW part of the sky. The bright white light then turned red and streaked quickly towards us leaving a red trail in the behind it.  As decreased speed the red light faded.  Then it was very close and you could see it clearly.  The craft was an equilateral triangle with a large white light in the center and beige/orange lights in each corner.  There was a blue light on top.  It was only maybe 30-50 feet corner to corner.  It traveled east slowly and continuously toward, and then over us. The sight was so fantastic and we thought no one would believe what we were seeing. So we each pulled out our phones and tried to take a picture.  His phone shut itself off when he opened the camera application, and then mine froze up when I unlocked the screen then shut itself off shortly after.  That only added to the mystery of the experience. The craft was only maybe 500 ft away when it was directly above us.  We never heard a sound the entire time we saw it.  The craft flew over the house so we ran around following it so we wouldn't lose sight of the most amazing thing we've ever seen.

I never really believed in ufo's before and certainly never saw anything that could even come close for my 72 years I have been on this Earth. Last Thursday 12/27/2012 changed all that.  I really can't explain what I saw in the sky over Orlando, FL in any other way except that they either came from some other planet or our government has made something far more technically advanced than anyone can imagine. I was coming in my long driveway in Chuluota facing West looking towards Orlando and the international airport. I am used to seeing planes landing all the time as there is usually a continuous line of them coming in full of Disney World vacationers. I saw a couple of lines of aircraft (lights) lined up as if coming in for a landing but were too close to each other. I remember saying to myself ""Boy, they really have the planes stacked up tonight at the airport"".   But there were two things that weren't right. First they were coming in from the West too close to the runway and second, they were the wrong color with only one light. Instead of the usual color of landing lights, these were bright red or red orange and pulsing slightly. I parked my car and came back out in the yard where I could see them well. There was one line of four going very slow as if in a landing pattern gradually descending coming from the West with another line of three lined up in the same direction several miles to the north. I saw a jet airliner gaining altitude going North having just taken off from OIA and flew right by the lead light. After a short time the lead light started climbing with no increase in speed at a very sharp angle, maybe 75 or 80 degrees. the second and so forth started following the leader up into a cloud hanging over an area to the south of them.  When the first line disappeared into the cloud the second line did the same thing then I noticed more coming out from behind the tree line and they did the same thing. I never saw any of them again. It was cloudy to the south but very clear every other part of the area and the full moon was out. So I had a perfectly clear view of all of them until they disappeared into the cloud.

They did not behave like flares nor helicopters and weren't lanterns because I have seen all of these possible objects in the sky and what I saw was different. They were of a fiery orange color and they would move from one side to the other but not as blown by the wind but more as an independent type of movement. One of the lights went further away and descended from what appeared to be behind the mountain from my perspective. I cannot tell what exactly did it do since the mountain was in the way but it was clear it went down in altitude.  The other 2 remained for a while moving and hovering in turns. There was no sound that we could notice at any moment while we were witnessing this. Since the moment I realized what I was seeing I called my mom to run upstairs and take a look which she did, so we both witnessed it. The only recording device I could get my hands on at that very moment was a tablet and when I tried to take video the lens was just not good enough to capture the lights at that distance although they were perfectly visible and obvious to the naked eye.

After a couple of minutes it disappeared into the clouds . I usually watch the night sky for the plannets , shooting stars and satellites but this was none of the above and definitely not a plane from its movements (strange wobble ) and how bright it was plus there was no engine sound or flashing marker lights.  It was still at the start then headed north east away from my position . The strange wobble it had while moving has left me puzzeled as to what it was .  It flew a straight line for a few seconds then wobbled then normal then wobbled again this happened with it every few seconds until it went into the clouds .  I've never seen anything like it .  Then 10 minutes later 2 helicopters flew across in the same direction the object went im not sure if they were military or not but its very rare to see two helicopters together here.

PD)) SIGHTING #19 – August 5, 2013 7th SIGHTING OF AMBER-ORANGE UFOS (FIREBALLS) I was at my regular skywatch location on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, next to the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The weather was partly cloudy, no wind, with visibility nearly unlimited where the sky was clear of clouds.  There were several jets, common at this time of the evening, coming in from the northwest toward the Ft. Myers International Airport  At 9:46 p.m. I saw what I at first thought was the bright headlight of an oncoming airplane just inside of a cloud, due west of me, approximately 55 degrees over the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  The light was bright enough, about the size of a large grape at hand’s length, that it should have popped out of the cloud almost as soon as I saw it.  It did not.  I watched the light both with and without binoculars for about 4 minutes before it faded out.  At 10:08, just below the same cloud where the light was shortly before, I saw one of the amber-orange UFOs (aka fireballs) that I’ve reported on many times before.  Unfortunately, I was not looking directly at that part of the sky when it came on.  I watched this light for several minutes, both with and without binocs, and could confirm that it was precisely the same kind of UFO I’ve seen before.  The UFO slowly drifted downward to about 10 degrees or less above the Gulf, and then slowly faded out.  I observed this UFO almost exactly where I saw one on July 26, which I reported in “Sighting #14.”  Of great interest, this UFO dipped into the horizon ALMOST EXACTLY WHERE I AND OTHERS HAVE REPEATIDLY SEE “UGOs!  What now gets more fascinating, is that at 10:18 I saw another UFO that looked precisely as the previous one, but it was already at or very near where the one of 7/26 was.  Whether this UFO was the same one I saw earlier, or another one of the same type, remains to be determined.  It pretty much remained stationary as I watched it for a good 5 minutes, and then it faded out like the other one, and again, just like the one of 7/26.  NOW, putting together the fact that this last one was in the same location as where I saw the 5 “slow flashes” of the 7/26 NGO, this further leads me to believe more strongly that (1) these fireballs are indeed directly associated with these mysterious glowing objects, and (2) something of significance is happening in that area, and indeed, the entire area off northern Sanibel and Captiva Islands.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

As I was observing this phenomenon, I noticed a dimly lit orange object approaching from extremely high speed from the north, flying directly south.  It was approximately 20,000 feet in altitude and moving approximately four or five times the speed of ""normal"" jet.  I would estimate it's length to be 500 feet.  It was huge. It travelled from horizon to horizon in about eight seconds, and appeared to curve towards the east as it left.  It was shaped like a four leaf clover. with the two outside ""leaves"" approximately twice as big as the front and back leaves.  The front and back leaves were more elongated, the outside more round.  The object had a faint orange glow with dimmer half circle areas on the outside leaves.  It made absolutely no sound.   Two jets flew over in the same path in formation at the same altitude approximately five minutes later.  I could distinctly hear them, and I also noted that they seemed extremely slow and small compared with the orange object.

Monday evening my son and I were outside walking the dog. We both noticed a stationary sphere of light that looked like a bright star. We saw a flash come from the sphere and it started to move. I took a video but it did not come out very good at all. However I got a couple of still pictures that did come out Pretty good.  I was using an iPhone so the quality is not great but With a photo APP I was able to play with the light source and get a different Look at it.  I have no idea what I am looking at though. There was also an object that came out of the side of it and did a short loop around and then back into the sphere.   It took off slowly and silently but flashed out in what seemed like an instant. It was amazing to say the least.  We see a lot of strange things here on Cape Cod. 08/06/13 It is now Tuesday evening.  My son and I have been looking up to the sky since it got dark. To our amazement it happened again.  At 9:05pm tonite we were looking at a stationary star. After what we saw last night we were looking again up at the sky. My son said: Dad that star is bright huh!  I said yes but it's only a star and not what we saw last night. I was convinced I was right. As we looked at it, it flashed like a flash bulb 3 times just like last night and it started to move east to west across the sky. I tried my best to get a picture of it tonight but I couldn't get my phone out quick enough.  It started moving slowly but then shot away at an unbelievable rate of speed. Two nights in a row we have seen this anomaly.  It didn't travel in a straight line but rather a zig zag pattern as it moved slowly.  When it took off both times it just moved so fast it looked like it flashed out. We are excited, a little freaked out but after seeing this twice I had to tell someone. A few years back we saw something very weird and I sent my video to Mufon but they told me there was nothing on my video. There was and it was very detailed but I never heard from them again. This is no joke, the night sky along the waters of Cape Cod are filled with many strange things.  If I had the time and the right equipment my pictures would be better I'm sorry. Well, that's it, I swear on my life and to God and family that Every word I have written is exactly the truth.  My son is not a child, He is 28 yrs old and I am a 57 year old grandfather. It's very hard to tell people what you've seen but I know that you will not think we are crazy. I assure you that I am telling you the absolute truth. Thank you.

I jumped up off the couch telling my husband “it’s a huge meteor” and ran for the front door never taking my eyes off of what I was seeing.   Even before I got to the front door 2 thoughts in secession went thru my mind.  The first was that this meteor was big and definitely gonna impact with a boom but then as I got closer to my picture window, which is right next to my front door, I had a second thought that this meteor did not look quite right.  What had appeared to be the fire tail just did not look like fire at all.   My husband had jumped up and grabbed his cell phone and was right behind me as I opened the front door.  As we stepped out onto the front porch this fire ball slowed down and slowly split into 5 or 6 very bright amber orbs and came to a complete stop hovering between my house and the Tucson Mt. range which is about 3 miles away.  I cannot tell you how long I would perceive this string of orbs to be except to say it was huge and would easily be seen in the night sky.   It hovered for about 3 seconds then turned itself horizontal and slowly sank behind one of the peaks of the Tucson Mt. ridge line.  It then came back up from behind the ridge still in a horizontal line but in a diagonal trajectory.  Slowly sank behind the ridge again and then came back up once more in a diagonal trajectory but only revealing 3 of it orbs this time.  It sank back down behind the ridge again and came up one last time only revealing part of 1 orb.  While we were watching this display take place my husband called his friend who lives on the other side of the Tucson Mt ridge (in town), he ran out to his back yard but did not see any lights dancing up and down in the sky.  I found that to be quite perplexing.  My husband was speaking with his friend while the orbs were still displaying themselves.   The next morning as I was leav! ing for work I noticed a smaller ridge between my house and th! e Tucson Mts. that I never really paid any attention to before and thought to myself that maybe these orbs were not actually dancing up and down behind the Tucson Mts but might possibly have been between this smaller ridge and the Tucson Mts.  A few days later I checked the internet to see if any one had posted any sightings and could not find any thing mentioned.  I am confident that had this happened where town could see it people would have been coming out of the wood work.  These orbs were huge and bright and seemed to be having some sort of fun time dancing up and down in the sky that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

We go to this location around the same time every night arriving at the park around 23:15-23:30. We both spotted the object rising above the horizon infront of us (SSW) about 5 minuets after arriving at the park.  What we both saw was a small orange-yellowish solid light slowly rising above the horizon and continuing to rise for about 15 to 20 seconds and then disappear about two feet above the horizon from our perspective.  The light stayed the same size throughout it's ascension above the horizon in front of us and did not leave any sort of visible trail. My fiancee and I as I said before try to every night we can when it is clear go out to this location to look at the stars, never saw this kind of object before and have not seen it since in the 5 years we have been going to this location.  I am a television producer here in North Bay, and my fiancee is a student attending the local college here. We have seen several meteor showers both ourselves and together and have yet to see one that looks like this, normally you can see a flickering of the light from the meteor but this light we saw that night was solid.  My first thought was that we were seeing it travel straight towards our location since from our perspective the object rose over the horizon and ascended directly upwards.  I have seen the ISS numerous times, and I often use satellite tracking apps on my phone to locate and see flyovers over my location so I am quite familiar with what they look like, and this object looked too big, bright, and coloured to be a satellite. Anyways, I hope this is of some help, as I said before we go out to this location almost every night the clouds allow us to  and have never seen this object before or since even though it was a couple months ago now it is still fresh in my mind as I always visualize where it came from and its pattern each time we go back out to see if it does repeat or not.

I was facing south, with a great view of Downtown and the Space Needle.   At 10:34 I saw 7 or 8 bright orange orbs float upward from left to right seemingly from Capitol Hill or First Hill.  They continued to float/fly up behind the Space Needle heading from east to west. Some seemed to head south, and some seemed to head north before disappearing into the clouds. They appeared to move as fast as a small airplane or helicopter.  Seeing them fly across the sky and disappear into the clouds took about 3 or 4 minutes. 3 or 4 of these orange orbs were brighter than the rest.  They had a soft flickering quality.  They also appeared at first to be in a cluster, and then flew away from each other in a more perpendicular line while flying upwards.  Although the line was by no means perfectly straight. I sent a friend a text to ask if he had seen the bright orange orbs flying past the Space Needle.  He said no. At 10:54 pm another orange orb popped out of the sky over Capitol Hill or First Hill and flew upwards from left to right.  I told my friend to look out his window at, what I called, the loner orb.  He saw it and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  This one flew up west and north.  Finally, another lone orb appeared at 11:39 following the same flight pattern as the orb before it.

My first thought was that they were a group of hot air balloons that had just taken off.  But realizing that couldn’t be the case due to the ‘glow’ of the objects-my next thought was someone released a bunch of Chinese luminaries. At this time I realized these objects were heading in my direction…at what seemed to be a fairly fast speed-and clearly were neither balloons nor luminaries.  They were coming from a northeasterly direction traveling in a southwesterly direction and I would best describe them as little ‘suns’.  They were orange-ish in color and pulsated. I immediately reached for my cell phone and called my sister to see if she could see these objects.  She is located near 7th street and the 101 freeway, about an hour drive from me.  She could not.  As I was speaking with her and continuing to drive northbound- my excitement increased as I began counting out loud to her how MANY objects there were!   When I reached 28 in number, I could clearly see some of the objects’ light’ beginning to fade away. At this point these objects were flying directly over my head.  I told my sister I needed to hang up and roll some video.  I quickly pulled over on the east side of Gantzel/Ironwood in an office complex, just south of the Banner Ironwood Hospital.  I got out of my truck and started recording video from my cell phone. What was fascinating is that these objects were not in any particular formation…again-the reason I first thought they might be hot air balloons or luminaries-both of which would have had much of the same random/scattered flight pattern as I was witnessing with these objects.  At one point one of the objects appeared to be moving much faster to ‘catch up’ with another object.  Again, something I could not explain away as anything I have ever witnessed before. After about 2 minutes of recording video-the camera stopped and I was alerted my cell phone was out of data space.  I quickly erased a prior video and began a second recording.  Both recordings lasted several minutes, and as noted in the audio of the recordings-with the naked eye I could faintly see some of these objects still illuminated albeit they seem to disappear from the video.  Also, as they flew over my head one of the objects lights went out…but against the night sky I could still see an object.  It was silver in color and a rectangular shape.  Their altitude was about that of a small plane flying above.  I watched it continue southwesterly until I lost sight of it. What adds even greater intrigue into this sighting-is the events that followed.  As I got back in my truck and continued northbound on Gantzel/Ironwood Road-obviously excited and wishing to hell I had somebody with me to witness this with me, I couldn’t help but feel SOMEBODY had been able to capture much better video than what I had captured.   There was not a question in my mind this had to be witnessed by dozens if not hundreds of people. I decided to call television station ABC 15.  When I spoke to the news desk-nobody had reported any ‘odd’ occurrences, and they suggested I submit my video for review via their website. My next call was to the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  Amazed- the phone just rang and rang and rang-I hung up and tried it again.  This time after again ringing and ringing-a recording came on and said that my ‘call could not be completed at this time.  Please try again later’.  Of course my first thought is they have been overwhelmed with phone calls and the lines are jammed.  I redialed them again-and again- the phone just rang and rang and rang…. I then called another news station, and again, got the same response that no one had reported any ‘odd’ occurrence, and they too gave me information on how to submit my video via their website. Then, I again attempted to call the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  Once more, nobody answered the phone.  I then called the Mesa Police Department.  As I was explaining this occurrence-the dispatcher asked in what location this event occurred, and I told her San Tan Valley.  She then stated I would have to report the incident to the proper jurisdictions department-the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  After explaining I had tried numerous times to contact them, she seemed to allude to the fact I miss dialed or had the wrong number.  I told her I had the correct number.  The dispatcher then informed me she would patch me through herself to the P.C.S.O. Again, nobody answered the phone.  I tried several more times with the same outcome. I placed calls until approximately 23:15, and never did anybody answer the phone.  (I am attempting to get a report from the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office on their call logs for that evenings dispatch.  It has proven to be a difficult task.)  At this time I was approaching Guadalupe Road, when  three police units passed by me in the southbound lanes of  Ironwood with full lights and sirens and driving at least 100 mph.  For some reason I couldn’t help but think this was somehow related to this sighting. The next day I was up early and scanned the television stations for any possible news reports of any ‘UFO’ sighting.  To my surprise-I flipped to ABC 15 just in time to hear them say something about all the sightings on the WEST SIDE (I am on the EAST SIDE) of a possible ‘UFO’.  After returning from a commercial break the reporter explained that these reports were actually people witnessing a ‘solar plane’ that was in the area and that they could head to the stations website to see more footage of this craft. Immediately I couldn’t believe it!  Was this a cover up???  Surely dozens…hundreds of people saw this event!  Are ‘they’ really going to explain it away as a solar plane??  In fact, a solar plane might very well have been the culprit to what some people saw.  It is NOT what I saw. In disbelief and to amuse myself, I then went to the television stations website and viewed the ‘solar plane’ that many reported as a ‘UFO”. Let me clearly state  that what I saw was nothing close to what people might have seen with this ‘solar plane’.  NOTHING CLOSE!!  Since that date I have searched online for any report from that same evening, from anybody that witnessed the same event I did..  I found only one link matching the date of May 3rd 2013-and that was from a person that apparently witnessed this ‘solar plane’. Again, this is not what I witnessed.  I hope you take the time to review my two videos taken from that evening. FOOTNOTE:  On the drive home the other evening I caught a few minutes of the radio program ‘Coast to Coast AM’.  To my shock they were discussing the numerous reports from across the country of this same type of sighting and prompted people to write in if they had a similar experience themselves. And so you have my story…and it will be a day I shall never...ever...forget......",2013-07-03T00:00:00,,

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD)) SIGHTING #20 – August 6, 2013  5th SIGHTING OF A “FLASHER” I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:35 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass, and had not seen anything other that airplanes and a satellite, when at 10:30 p.m. I saw a very brief white and bright strobe flash with my naked eyes.  It was just a little bit south of due west, and low to the horizon – maybe 20 degrees above it.  Based on previous sightings, I quickly trained my 10X42 binoculars on that area and saw what I’ve come to call “Flashers.”  What made this one different from many others I’ve now seen in the area, is that it was a single strobe, flashing quite irregularly, with 5 or 6 flashes in a row very quickly, and then just one or 2 flashes per second.  Light intensity ranged between an occasional very bright flash, to mostly observable only through binoculars.  The quality and crispness of these strobes is quite different than an airplane strobe.  It stayed in the same location for a good 3 minutes as it drifted down toward the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico before disappearing. Fascinating was the fact that it was pretty much in the same spot that I and others have seen a “UGO” – unidentified glowing object just over the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  I had the feeling that it was somehow associated with this glow, as well as the slow moving and hovering “fireballs,” in addition to the UFO that landed near my friends house on Sanibel Island (see Sighting # 8).",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

I was out there for less than a minute when I thought I saw a shooting star in my peripheral vision almost directly above me.  Upon focusing on it I saw two white circles, not like bright directional shining lights normally seen on a plane but just white circles.  I initially thought it could be one object total but it could be two separate in the same path of travel as the white circles were separated.  The white circles were about the same size around as a #2 pencil held out at arms length and they were spaced out to fit about two of those #2 pencil diameters in between them.  It was moving very fast from East to West.  I saw it from about 90 degrees to about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I could tell it was pretty high up because the sky was clear straight up and all the way to the east but to the west there was some very thin cloud cover that I was able to sti! ll see bright stars through and I could see the white circles slightly dim as it went behind one narrow cloud then get brighter after it passed over it into the clear for a bit and then went behind more cloud cover and got smaller the further away it was and dimmed and then it was gone. This all happened very fast. I estimate the total time from it first catching my eye till it went out of sight was 4 seconds. I know for a fact it was not a plane or a satellite. Way too incredibly fast to be either. The object made no noise. It was purely silent. I also pulled up airplane radar flight records online between 12:10 and 12:20 and there was no planes flying over the city in this timeframe. I talked to an individual at a local airport about it and they stated that it could be a secret military aircraft as they fly those in the middle of the night so they aren't easily seen.

Right away I was certain that it was not a plane. The moon was not entirely full, but was ascending at approximately 50 degree’s from the horizon to the southeast side of our porch.  The object was so bright I thought to myself that the sky looked almost as if there were two moons.  It hung in the sky at approximately the same degree as the moon, just in the wrong location.   It appeared that the object almost had a headlight on it that was striking some passing wispy clouds, but the object itself was not moving in the sky.

The UFO appeared to be be a translucent blue in color. It came down falling from the sky looking towards the West. It was similar in nature to a shooting star or meteorite sighting. Although there were a few major differences that certainly made it very easy to distinguish that it was not a meteor sighting. I have seen many meteorites and this certainly was not. Indeed it did look like a teardrop shape. It resembled the teardrop type ornaments you might see on a Christmas tree. I saw this with a friend. We were both sitting in our vehicle. Immediately upon seeing this the both of us went into shock.  I screamed out something about it as did my friend at the same instant.  The object moved very slowly. It moved about triple the time slower than a typical shooting star would. The object was also incredibly bright. So bright that it lit up our surroundings. It kind of reminded me of when I have shot tracer rounds out of a rifle. Except this object was much slower! . It appeared to be dropping down in elevation. Unlike a shooting star that would move across the sky. This object came down from the sky. We both then proceeded to discuss what we had just seen. We both had exactly the same impression and feeling that this certainly was not a meteor. We both felt that this was not normal. We both felt that we had just seen something very special. I have a background that involves me being familiar with all kinds of aircraft. Military and civil. 5 minutes after we witnessed this a aircraft did come into the area. It was indeed a military aircraft. The aircraft had its navigation lights turned off. It turned them on and then back off. I do not believe that we could have been the only 2 to experience this. Even though it was 3:29 in the morning I am sure somebody else must have been awake in this area. It could not possibly be missed. It was just so bright. I came here to report this in the hopes that somebody else saw what we saw too. Or per! haps somebody may have some insight into what we saw.

There was a light cloud cover beginning to move in, and ultimately, the stopped craft seemed to disappear behind the clouds as they closed in on it.  The clouds seemed rather opaque as they covered it, although it otherwise appeared to be very light cloud cover, that I would have assumed that you could have perhaps seen such a bright light through.

I had finished playing a song, picked up my cigarette, and looked up at the first brightest star that caught my eye (the star I have since identified as Vega).  As I was looking at it, something caught my eye underneath it, and I averted my gaze.  The moving object was as bright as Vega, but had to have appeared out of nowhere seeing as how it would have otherwise caught my eyes first. 	At first glance I thought it was a satellite (It could not have been a plane because I can identify when something is or not).  As I was watching the object move, it quickly flashed white and immediately after started to glow a yellow-orange color, but the glowing grew in size.  Now if you take a nickel between your thumb and forefinger and extend your arm, that is how big the object appeared to be glowing.  It continued on like this for about six to eight seconds before returning to its previous state. 	As soon as the object had returned to its normal size and shape, another moving object appeared almost in the same place as the first, but was not as bright.  This one followed the same path as the first object.  Now the distance between the two, I measured with my pinky finger and my thumb on my left hand.  The degree (relative to my hand and extended arm) was a little over 90 degrees.  The second object did not flash or glow or even grow in size, but six seconds after the second, appeared the third object.

It is hard to estimate how high in the air it was. the ground across the road from my house lies on a small hill.  The object appeared over that raised area and to my thoughts was close to say 500' possibly 1000' in the air. There was no sound and no trail behind it.  This was not an aircraft or a helicopter or any other man made device.  I have tried for the last 4 days to think of how to describe it. The only thing I can come up with is an elongated oval. It was not circular, or cigar shaped. it was not oval shaped, it was more like an elongated oval.  The object was duel colored. The entire somewhat oval shaped exterior was a luminescent, neon, glowing green. The brightest green I have ever seen in my life. The interior was a solid glowing yellow.  At 11:05 pm that night, one minute after seeing the object, I called the Athens, Ohio branch of the Ohio state highway patrol, and spoke to dispatcher Saunders and told him what I saw.  I swear this to be true on my eternal soul! I will never forget it as long as I live!  I reported this event to the hotline on Saturday evening/Sunday morning at 12:26 am EST. The gentleman I spoke to was about to go on the radio and didn't have much time to talk and asked me to submit this form.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,39.1867,-82.0249

We live along the Appalachian in PA near the Susquehanna river.  We are about 30 minutes away from the closest airport, so we do have some air traffic.  We are completely aware of what planes look like and do not mistake them as the UFOs.  Most of the time the UFOs seem to be an orange ball of light that we seem to notice around dusk just before the sun sets. Sometimes there are 3 of them that seem to just hover but then dissipate one at a time until they just completely vanish.  They always seem to be close to the river. We also do a lot of star gazing and we can see satellites with our naked eye but a few times we would spot them and then all of a sudden the pin of light would grow into a big ball of light for just a few seconds before returning back to its original size.  It almost seemed as if it was beaming light towards us because it changed its appearance only when it was directly ab! ove us! The most bizarre sighting was a couple weeks ago.  The sun was setting and I just happened to be looking east when from a distance I saw this light slowly rise from the trees between two mountains, which seemed to be close to the river.  I stared for at least 10 minutes as it hovered there with no movement or sound before I called for my husband and his friend over to see what I was seeing!  After 5 more minutes of no movement it finally started to move towards the mountain, it rose as if it was outlining it until it reached the top.  Then we all heard & saw a helicopter coming from the west. The light then dissipated and in place of the light seemed to be a white disk! We couldn't believe what we were looking at! The disk then shot off into the sky as the helicopter came closer! We can't come up with a good explanation for any of these sightings?

At first I was afraid to say anything for fear of becoming a casualty in case it is something you already know that I now know too. I have been extremely careful not to tell anyone. They probably wouldn’t believe me anyway.  Now I am afraid not to contact you.  In the last year the numbers of these things have increased.  Some nights I see 8 or more of them. I solemnly swear not to tell a soul about this.  As then I would be in danger of knowing too much. If you guys already know, I don’t want to know any more about it. I know Phoenix is a hub for drone testing but a drone or a satellite would not unnecessarily waste that much of its own energy to make a light show. Please come and take a look for yourselves. I bought a 100x telescope and it did not increase the size. They are geosynchronous and move with the horizon.  They are seen in the east rising and the west descending. The light they emit is way brighter than stars. Like a planes headlights as it is approa! ching. And they go through the spectrum of colors of visible light in a second’s time. Like a rotating prism being backlit. They also appear to be rotating which may mean they are emitting a frequency around 24 to 25 Megahertz. The scan rate of my camera is about 24 Mhz. Because they are rotating the frequency is ahead or behind the scan rate on my camera. My cheap video camera is not good in low light and cannot see stars but through experiments and adjustments I have got some pretty good images. In the best one where it is enlarged although blurred it just simply disappears on camera and I did not block the lens either but it was still there to the human eye. It is my theory that they are farther away from earth than the moon but that they are watching us and have technology a million years advanced than we have. I also think they have a way of cloaking when we get too close. I also think you guys have technology that is way advanced of what the public knows but not this ! advanced and not this powerful. May I suggest contacting NASA ! and perh aps HUBBLE to examine them using x-ray, infrared, sound waves, radio waves, microwave and non-visible frequencies. I will wait for an email that is legitimate and not phishing or from a free email and will not respond unless it is from your guys.  I have only contacted you guys anyway.  I also solemnly swear to erase all data I have to protect myself and our country. I know nothing. Please email me and I will send the Videos. And you are always welcome to come here and see them for yourselves. R.S V. P.  They have a regular schedule and are more visible on crest and new moon nights usually Tuesday through Thursday between 8 pm and 10p, And 3am new ones appear.  Sometimes I can see them in broad daylight too, that is how powerful they are. Kindest Regards Mr. --------- in Maricopa, AZ. P.S.

Hi, my name is ((name deleted)) I’m from Gainesville, Florida.

As me my girlfriend Holly and friend Rich finished assembling of our unborn child’s crib.   All three of us went outside to say goodbye to Rich, as Rich stepped down the stairs and off the stairway leading to the apartment he noticed something in the sky that was unfamiliar. So he called me off the porch down the steps to see as well.   As my friend Rich fumbled with his phone to video this amazing event, I step off the porch solid onto the pavement soon after Rich, I immediately looked straight up into the sky and the first thing that I saw was about four glowing, almost egg oval, orange red objects  in the sky above all four Illuminating, three in a row and one on the side accelerating quicker than the others moving towards the front of th! e others and eventually 5 or 6 seconds later to lead what it appeared to some sort of straight line formation.  They also made no noise at all like it was a defining moment in life were everything goes silent until that special event is over. A second after witnessing that I my girlfriend and Rich are all now on the pavement observing this breathtaking and phenomenal event witnessing at least 6 more UFO’S behind  the first group in a less organized way than the first four.  After two minutes into observation of this event, my girlfriend called her mother, sister and brother in-law witness this event as well.  As we all observed the UFO’s in the night sky for about 2 ½ to three minutes Rich finally got the video up and started recording the night sky while the UFO’s passed through at a very slow pace almost as the speed of a blimp illuminating an orange-red fire color as they go.  These UFO’s had a very low altitude &lt;as if I can reach out and touch one&gt; they were moving g! eometrically perfect traveling SE. As these UFO’s slowly moved! about w e all talked and enjoyed the beauty of or neighbors getting out for an ole stroll in the park –it was beautiful and enlightening. When the UFO’s started disappearing out of sight their altitude went higher from a straight line and then a swooping upwards motion off the straight line altitude up and out of sight like they went through some kind of door or something because they vanished into thin air. This whole event was about 5 to 6 minutes from initial sight of the UFO’s, taking place in SE Gainesville approximately between 8:45pm and 9:05pm on 3/29/2013.

"Two red/orange orbs moving south to north over east side of Lexington, KY; no sounds",Lexington,KY,2013-03-29T23:30:00,circle,~10 minutes,"Occurred : 3/29/2013 23:30  (Entered as : 03/29/13 23:30) Reported: 3/30/2013 7:04:10 AM 07:04 Posted: 5/15/2013 Location: Lexington, KY Shape: Circle Duration:~10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96834.html,"Two red/orange orbs moving south to north over east side of Lexington, KY; no sounds At approximately 11:30 pm EDST (23.30) on the east side of Lexington, Kentucky, on March 29, 2013: My small dog was agitated at the back door, barking excitedly, which is uncharacteristic for her. When I went to see what the matter was, she was excitedly indicating that she wanted to go outside. Normally she will just sit at the door patiently waiting if she wants to go outside.  I let her out, and followed onto the back deck as she descended the steps into the back yard. It was at that point that I noticed a red orb hovering stationary slightly to the north of me, high in the sky. It was too large to be the red wing light of an airplane. It did not move as I observed it for perhaps 30 to 60 seconds. I went inside to get my iphone in order to take a picture, and it was still visible when I returned, but had started moving very slowly in a northerly direction.  I took pictures and a short video (or thought I did; this morning those pictures and video do not appear on my phone, but two others, taken later from the upstairs deck are on my phone.)  My wife had already gone to bed, so I went upstairs to our bedroom, woke her up and told her what I was seeing. There is a second floor deck off our bedroom, and we went there, where the object was still clearly visible, continuing to slowly move in a northerly direction.  I then saw a second identical object which was much closer to us, but about the same apparent altitude, moving south to north. This second object was slightly to the west of us, but nearly overhead. It was moving slowly toward the location of the first object. When we looked back to the last location of the first object, it was no longer visible.  We watched the second object move very slowly—much too slowly for a fixed wing aircraft—in the same south to north trajectory. Eventually the second object disappeared as we watched. It did not go off into the distance, it just disappeared. The apparent size of the objects was the same. My recollection is that at the first sighting of the second object it was about the size of a dime held at arm’s  length. My wife’s recollection is that it was larger, i.e. about the size of a quarter held at arm’s length. We agree that the apparent size was smaller than a full moon. The moon, at the time, was far east of these objects, which were high in the sky as opposed to near the horizon. Unquestionably these objects were not stars, both because of size and the fact that they moved.  As to color, I saw both objects as being red. My wife saw them as being orange, although she also saw what appeared to be a small red “dot” in the center of both objects. I did not observe this “dot”.  Regarding photographs: This morning I looked at the photos on my camera. To my great surprise, there was no video whatsoever, and only one still shot of one of the objects. It appears to be the second one, due to it’s apparent size in the photo. The photo was taken at full zoom on an iphone 5. When the photo itself is enlarged, the object does not appear to be an orb at all, but rather appears to have a crescent shape, with curve on the bottom, but with the top tilted slightly to the west. Upon closer inspection, we thought it appeared to have a “saucer” shape, with the bright crescent being at the bottom. It is also possible the impression appears because of something which may be the “red dot” appears above the crescent. I have not magnified the photo beyond what I can do by zooming into the photo with the iphone. The color of the crescent in the photo is much more white than the appearance of the color to our naked eyes. As I said, I would call it red, although tending toward an orange-ish red as opposed to bright red, while my wife says the color was orange with a “red dot”.  The other photo is completely black, as if only a picture of the night sky. I am baffled as to why there are only two still photos on my phone from last night, and no video whatsoever. I am certain I shot both, downstairs as well as upstairs. My wife thinks that I may have failed to properly take the shots due to my excitement, but I disagree. I clearly recall both the action the phone does after taking a still shot, as well as seeing the video icon active.  At no time was there any sound heard from these objects, at least by we humans. It may be that the dog heard something which caused her agitation.  Backgrounds of the observers: I am an attorney. My wife is a dental tech. I am in my early 60’s; my wife is in her late 50’s.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,38.00883948620362,-84.47708249286394

I looked up and saw a huge light in the sky.  It was hard to not notice.  It was moving horizontal, from North to South along the coast line.  The cigar shaped object was followed by 2 small objects.  The lead, cigar shaped object projected a huge cone shaped light from it's front side, bright like a spotlight.  The two smaller objects followed.  The lead object would lead bright, luminescing cloud like plumes that could not be mistaken for all of the naturally occuring clouds in the skyline.   The objects moved slowly, hovered, moved forward, and turned from south to east over the ocean and disappeared.

August 7, 2013   Dear Peter,  	 This evening at 8:30 PM, I was outside getting my horses in for the evening when I looked up in the sky and saw the curly white contrail of what I thought may have been a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral.  I live in Sanford, Florida, and as the crow flies about 40 miles from The Cape.   I have a good view of any rocket launch and have viewed multiple shuttle launches right from my yard.  I was not happy that I had missed a launch--which later this evening I did confirm was a Delta IV rocket.  This time of year, 8:30 in the evening is still daylight and hot!   As I was looking at the curly contrail, I noticed a VERY bright round light to the left of the contrail.  It was not moving.  It was not an airplane or helicopter.  I am in the path of the airplanes coming and going from Sanford Airport. – so believe me, I know what an airplane looks like.  No stars were out yet.   As I was focusing on the bright round light, a line of smaller white lights appeared to the right of the large rou! nd light. It happened so quickly.  I am not sure if there were 4 or 6 round lights and I could not determine if the lights were parallel to the large white light horizontally or vertically.   For a brief moment, it seemed like I was looking at the lights through a sheer white curtain and what appeared to be an outline was visible which made me think that the smaller lights were actually part of a triangle shaped object.  It was brief and the thought or shape was no longer there but the lights remained. As I was watching the lights, I called my friend and neighbor to come outside to look too.  As it turned out, she was in her car driving to the grocery store about 3 miles away.  She was watching the white contrails and also saw the large white light but she could not see any more than 2 of the smaller lights.   We stayed on the phone with each other for about 5 minutes watching the lights and the contrail.  Oddly enough, above the contrail was a very strange cloud that appeared to be brightly illuminated as if there were lights inside or above where we could not see.  There were very few other clouds in the sky and none of them had the brilliance of this one. For all of this time, the large round light never moved nor did the line of smaller lights.  There were small planes off in the distance with their lights clearly visible.  As the white contrail began to disperse, a few of the smaller lights disappeared.  The bright cloud was still very bright.  The last 3 lights remaining were the large round white light and two of the smaller lights to the right of that large light.  Then all 3 lights just faded out.

Three other people responded to my statement of “What is that?” and all saw the object as well. I did not have a recording device nor camera and have never considered UFO’s before.  I am a neutral observer. I do live near Cape Canaveral so that came to my mind, however this object was hovering still for quite a while and was not directly above the Cape.

I was curious about that aircraft for two reasons 1.  I am a private pilot and generally enjoy seeing aircraft flying over and 2. I had watched my daughter and son-in-law arrive along the same track two nights ago while they were returning on a flight from Philadelphia to Miami (I had been watching their progress via the internet flight tracking software.  I looked up a couple of minutes after that aircraft passed to the south and saw another light in the sky at about the same altitude and location.  This light was white in color and looked like a landing light.  It almost looked like a satellite but without the speed one would normally see.   Within a couple of seconds I noticed a green light behind the white light (to the left of the light, or North).  A seco! nd later there was a sudden bright intensity that looked like a rocket separating from its booster, a bright center with the shape of a brilliant triangle with the original light at the tip pointing out towards the east.  The light shape lasted only a couple of seconds and then disappeared.  I lost sight of the light for a second or two and when I next located the same position in the sky there appeared to be two green lights separated by about ¼” at arms length.  The green lights remained separated by a fixed distance while the lights appeared to move towards the east.  Living in Florida for the past 40 years I’ve seen my share of rocket launches, this was in the wrong location for a rocket coming out of Cape Canaveral.  The shape and color of the contrail looked just like a rocket separation.  My best guess was a missile that was dropped from a launch plane, engine ignited and flamed out after a few seconds.  Very strange. I am a private pilot and retired Deputy fire chief.  I am an avid aviation enthusiast and monitor launch schedules from the Cape and satellite sighting via iPhone software.  This was the most unusual sighting I have seen, mostly because of the location being so close to West Palm Beach and the commercial airways to and from Ft.

While at a friend's house for a pool party, I happened to glance up at the southeastern sky and what I saw was unlike anything I'd seen before.  To my amazement, there was approximately 100 solid white lights moving very rapidly in formation in a northwesterly direction.  At that point I asked the group to look up and confirm what I was seeing.  Everyone was in agreement as to the description but no one in the 7-10 people there could explain what we were seeing.  The objects were moving at a high rate of speed (100+ mph) and there was no sound!  The formation was random with the objects following a consistent flight path.  As the group thinned, there were several small clusters of objects and finally, one was following at a considerable distance behind the others.  The large cluster and subsequent smaller clusters as well as the last few solo objects/lights traveled directly overhead, approximately 500-1500 feet directly above us as we watched in amazement.  The duration of the event was probably 20+ minutes.  As we watched the objects fade into the distance over Lake Travis or in that general direction, the sky began to get hazy with some low level cloud cover. We continued to watch the sky and probably 15-20 minutes after the initial event subsided, we glimpsed a similar formation much higher, above the haze/clouds traveling in the opposite direction. This time since the objects were much higher, they seemed to be moving much more slowly and at times appeared to stop. We eventually lost site of the objects/lights after about another 15-20 minutes as the cloud cover increased.  Conditions: clear sky, no clouds during the first period of sighting then low level haze/clouds during the last period.  We all snapped multiple photos with our phones and recorded video. Unfortunately, most photos and videos were way too dark to see any significant detail. I have posted the best two photos we captured.

We live in a mobile home on private property at about 1,000 ft. elevation which is a couple of miles from the nearest town.  There are virtually no streetlights and houses are far apart; hence, our view of the night sky is excellent.  I often step outside in the evenings to gaze briefly at the sky--ever hopeful I may be rewarded with the sight of a meteor. Early Friday morning (06/01/2013) between 1 and 2:00 am, I briefly stepped outside onto our front deck but, after checking the sky for a couple of minutes and seeing nothing of interest, I was just about to go back inside when a pair of bright stars (at least that's what I thought they were at first) in the eastern sky just above the treeline caught my attention.  The reason they did was because they actually appeared to be moving AWAY from each other in completely different trajectories!  As I watched, the brighter star (which was, from my perspective straight above the other, slightly dimmer, star) began to descend vertically towards the tree line.  At the same time, the dimmer star started moving horizontally in a northerly direction.  After going a little way on these separate courses, both hesitated, stopped and began moving back toward each other again. They moved back and forth like that slowly for a few minutes while I stood there, trying to figure out just WHAT they were and HOW they were doing what they were doing. I then dashed inside our trailer--looked briefly for my pair of binoculars (but couldn't immediately find them)--and grabbed my Canon XS-100IS camera before dashing back outside. I was able to take a little video and a couple of still shots while I fiddled with the settings trying to get something documented on film; however, I don't own a tripod and the ""stars"" were so far away that the quality of whatever shots I was able to get was severely downgraded. I went back in the house briefly, found my binoculars and dug my small flashlight out of my purse.  I decided to walk down the driveway to my daughter's place, bring her back with me to my house so someone else might be able to confirm what I was seeing. My daughter got out of bed and followed me to our house at the top of the hill and confirmed that she also could see these two ""stars"" moving back and forth. Looking through my binoculars, I scanned a group of very small, very dim ""stars"" directly to the north of the first two and noticed, after ""pulling out"" the zoom function of the binoculars that these lights were arranged in a very organized-looking pattern -- resembling 2 triangles stacked one atop the other with their apexes faced in opposite directions (like a ""Star of David"").  My daughter also took a look at them with the binoculars and confirmed they appeared to have this pattern. I returned to observing the first 2, brighter, stars and noticed the brighter one was changing colors from blue to white to amber (or red/yellow) in rapid succession.  After about 15 minutes or so, when I glanced back at the group of dimmer stars which had been arranged in the ""Star of David"" shape when last I looked at them, I found them to have moved into a different pattern which resembled a wheel with a ""hub"" in the center.  There were 2 ""rings"" of lights at that time -- one ""inside"" the other -- and what appeared to be one light in the exact center of these 2 ""rings."" All together I (and later, my daughter) observed these ""lights"" exhibit inexplicable motions and patterns for nearly an entire hour.  They were still exhibiting these characteristics when both my daughter and I went inside for the night and went to bed.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,38.7827,-122.9232

Suddenly everything went kind of silent and I had what I can only describe as a primal fear response.  Something just told me to get inside. 	As i walked up my five steps to the  backdoor, I noticed lights in my right peripheral vision.  I thought it might have been a  cargo plane, but as I turned to focus on the  lights I immediately realized it was not any  kind of conventional aircraft. 	It was illuminated by a bill board  allowing me to see the entire craft.  It was  illuminated by a billboard on the side of hwy 98  so i assume it was over santa rosa sound (i  live right by santa rosa sound on the other side  of hwy 98). 	It was huge, dwarfing the billboard  sign.  It had a white light on each corner of the  craft and an orangish reddish orb on the bottom  center.  I saw a row of smaller white lights  going down the side.  The body of the thing was matte black colored or very dull charcoal  grey.It was exltremely slow moving, maybe 2mph  from my point of view.  It looked like it just  floated kind of.Its direction was west to east. All of this lasted for about only 8 seconds, i was still standing on the top step of my  stairs.  At this point i was in complete shock and  felt as though all the blood had just left my  body.  My memory gets kind of blurry here because  of the adrenaline going on, but i openend the  door and yelled for my mom (im 22).  By the time i  looked back and my mom got outside  it was  absolutely gone.  And i mean this thing was HUGE  and just gliding completely silently pretty close to my house only seconds ago and then it was gone?! 	 We stayed out there looking for about one minute and then eight trucks of some kind  came flying down the highway,all with their red emergency lights flashing on top. They were  traveling together like a convoy in the same direction and location where i last saw this  triangle craft. 	It is important to note that i live  right by the southern boundary of Eglin Airforce  Base.  Also, the night before this me and my  mother witnessed a strange light at a much greater distance.  The bottom line is this thing  was huge, silent, moved impossibly slow, and was  something that  is absolutely unknown to me.

Can only be seen through camera Lens! Just after 6:30 this morning, March 30 2013, I went to the usual spot (North San Fernando Valley, facing south/southeast towards Burbank and downtown L.A.) from where I watch the sunrise whenever I can. With that said, I have been there many times and have seen many interesting things, but nothing quite like this. I started recording video on my iPhone 3S, because I had forgotten the batteries to my digital camera.  I figured why not give it a try especially since I had recently listened to an interview discussing the abilities of digital cameras compared to the human eye. At first, I filmed a quick, less than 30 second video and remembered I had my Samsung camera in the glove box and stopped recording on the iPhone.  But, before grabbing the other camera, I noticed the screen image displayed after the video was finished saving. At about the center of the frame, set against the morning blue sky, was a light blue, rectangular/square shape.  It clearly stood out and was not common or normal.  After that, I just stuck with the iPhone.  I tried to capture it from different angles, moving the camera back and forth, trying to satisfy the doubts in my own head.  I compared the view from inside the car through the windshield to an unobstructed view outside.  Nothing changed.  The object never moved or changed appearance in any way.  That was until I looked at it with my own eyes. When not looking at the screen, I could not see the object at all.  I kept going back and forth looking at the screen, then with my own eyes.  It was quite remarkable.  Like in the movies when a vampire cant see himself in the mirror hes standing in front of.  I am certain, without a doubt in my mind, what is seen on the video is not and cannot be a glitch or glare or fragment of something floating around in the air. Im then narrating what Im seeing (not seeing) and the object virtually disappears!  After watching the video, to me at least, it looks as if the object had been sucked away at light speed.  Almost immediately after, the closest street lamp shuts off.  This, of course, created all kinds of questions and doubt in my mind.  These were dismissed after I opening the video in an editor.  When looked at frame by frame, it is clear that the object leaves before the light is turned off, which would indicate that the light was not the source of the “rectangular” object.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

It was zigzagging back and forth and that is what caught my attention.  I had a camera with me that had a high power zoom on it and I took several photos where I could see no visible object at the beginning of the vapor trail, but this thing was moving fast and was now headed north overhead.  I pulled over and took several photos and it almost seemed to change shapes in flight.  It seemed to have a double vapor trail coming off of it and it continued to curve sharply one direction and then the other.  In some of the photos it looked like one giant group of rocks and then in others, you can see a ghostly transparent image of what looks to be a large airliner, but why would it be zigzagging sharply at speeds fast enough for a double vapor trail?  It seemed to have no less than 4 different shapes in 4 pho! tos taken just moments apart.  Then it was gone.  I looked back to the south where it had come from and the original vapor trail was fading away as they do, but I took one last photo of it to show the zigzag motion it had.

Many orange lights over the freeway In Azusa CA,Azusa,CA,2013-03-30T20:40:00,unknown,1 minute,"Occurred : 3/30/2013 20:40  (Entered as : 03/30/13 20:40) Reported: 3/31/2013 8:22:40 PM 20:22 Posted: 5/15/2013 Location: Azusa, CA Shape: Unknown Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96890.html,"Many orange lights over the freeway In Azusa CA I was driving on the freeway to work on Saturday March 30, 2013 at about 8:40 pm in Azusa CA, driving at normal speed I came around a turn I could see about a half a mile in front of me in full view many orange lights low in the sky just above the freeway. My first thought is that it was military and that it looked like an invasion or attack just because of the number of orange lights and how low there were. Then I realized that this in no way could be military, there were no flashing red or blue lights that would distinguish one of our aircrafts. The orange lights seemed to be hovering or suspended in mid air but it seemed like they were all moving together at a slow crawling speed. What came to my mind then was the Phoenix Arizona lights in 1997. I had a feeling of fear and amazement I knew that what I was seeing was something amazing. It was so shocking and so incredible that all traffic on both sides of the freeway slowed down drastically (from about 70 ! mph to about 20 mph). I could tell everyone was looking at the lights trying to see what they were. I have never seen anything like this before and it's hard to explain exactly what I saw because there are no words to explain what exactly was in the sky. I would guess there was approximately 20 lights but possibly more. The lights took up a space of about 1/4 a mile long. At first I thought that each light was an individual aircraft, but the more I looked at the lights I realized that the lights all lined up perfectly and geometrically together, the angles each light were to one another was mathematically prefect, and they moved in unison together that it could mean that this possibly was one huge aircraft in the sky and not many small ones flying in a formation which is what I initially thought. It was flying too low for it to be any aircraft I have ever seen. If I could guess I would say the object/aircraft was about a building's length high in the sky maybe about 20 or 3! 0 stories up from the ground. I have seen helicopters low but ! this was to big and moved too slow to be a helicopter. Since this object/ aircraft was flying directly over the freeway, and the fact that traffic slowed down so much as we got closer to the object; I was able to look directly up at it from my windshield and I could not see any kind of shape or mass of an object/objects, all I saw was just orange lights suspended gracefully in the sky. So hypothetically if this was one huge craft it was possibly camouflaged with the nights sky. The only other aircraft lights I could see near by in the sky was LAX traffic miles away in the horizon which is visible in Azusa and the San Gabriel Valley. That is the only air traffic close by where planes would be flying low but Azusa is too far from LAX and the path the planes take to land at LAX. I wish I would have taken a picture or video of these lights since it was so close to me and I was driving slow enough to capture it, but my phone camera was not working. So instead I called my boyfriend and wa! s in hysterics telling him that I am seeing the most incredible thing in the sky but I can't tell what it was and I did my best in the moment explain to him what I was seeing. He was amazed and could tell I had just seen something not only amazing but indescribable. I have already found a video on youtube of another witness who saw what I saw, but they were a bit further from it. I have done research via the internet and have found that Azusa is prone to UFO sightings. I have not contacted the city of Azusa or the authorities about this event, but I might just to see if anyone else has reported the lights that I saw. I am a very open-minded but logical person, but this event is something I have never experienced before and it has really effected me. It has changed my perspective completely about UFO and UFO sightings, I don't think I could ever forget about it.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,34.1748,-117.8751

But what caught my eye was that orange/red light not a streak.  It had been still for maybe 4-5 seconds and then it went out and then it appeared again but this time it was a bit higher.  I told brad and he seen it then but it had gone out again.  But this is the part where it weird.  From the point that it was lets say strait up & down this light appeared 3 more times but in a east west direction the direction it went was east from it's original position.  Keep in mind that the fire was behind us and so we waled to the road. And again we seen it like 5 more time but it wasn't the same as before the color was it was only momentary and 5-10 minutes later it would do it again.  It almost looked like a firework like the mortars but instead it stayed in the same area no trails or such! like a model rocket engine in flight.  The single ones would be explainable but the first 5 were very odd indeed. I'd say it was before Salina But could of been around Kanoplis and approx 1000 - 2000 feet high.

Sunday night I was in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I saw a bright light through the tree's to the west.  The object seemed like a plane at first until it came into full view. It was not a plane. It traveled from west to northeast. The object was flying about as low as commercial planes that take off from PDX (Portland international airport), (low enough to hear the engine and see the wings and flashing lights if it were a plane)  This ball of light had no flashing lights, no wings and made no sound. It was the brightest light I've ever seen in the sky at night.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it,  I watched it fly from the Hillsboro area, over the west hills to Portland when I lost sight of it. During the the time I was watching it, it did not leave a trail, it did not change brightness, make any erratic movements, or change speed. I have lived in Oregon for about 20 years.  In that time I have seen one similar object, in broad daylight about 15 miles from this sighting. When I was a child, I spent a lot of time on the Colorado river at the Aha Quin resort (trailer park/air strip).

I'm still not sure what these were, but I do know what I saw doesn't match up with anything I have ever heard of, read about or seen before. I am not an aeronautical expert or even hobbiest, but I can't get the piture of these things out of my head and have been doing research all day. I came across this website where I have read several peoples' desciriptions of similar sightings and thought I would share my own. The time was between 2:30 and 3:30 AM. I was catching a ride home from a friend and had some trouble getting into my house that night. I had recently moved away and was back to visit and I forgot to grab a key from my dad. Anyways, my friend offers to let me crash at his place, so we make the 5 or 10 minute drive it takes to get to his place. We pull up and I grab a couple things from his back seat before we turn and start to head towards his side door. At this point, we are facing East with a full(ish) moon off to our right. I honestly don't remember who saw them first but there in the sky, traveling in a general north-east direction, are 3 objects moving in perfect synchrination. There appearance was triangular, and they all looked the same. They appeared to have yellow lights on each corner of their respective triangles with an red-orange light in the center. As they traveled we noticed that the formation they were moving in was a giant perfect triangle. The thought occurred to me that we might actually be looking at one distinct object, but they were fairly high up and it was dark enough to make it dificult to tell for sure. A couple other things of note from this sighting: (1) it was very dificult to determine how fast and in which direction they were heading. I am also fairly certain they were not on a strait course. There appeared to be some back and forth movement in their route. (2) The lead object (or appeared to be the lead), disappeared about halfway through the sighting just as an additional object appeared back towards where we first noticed them. No idea if this additional object was the same object that moved very fast without us noticing or an entirely different object all together. (3) We heard absolutely zero sound coming from these objects even though they moved fast enough that it would be expected if they were using any human technology that I am aware of. At the end of the day, I still do not know what these things were, but I can say that I much more open to the possibility of there being something else out there that we are sharing this universe with. Hope someone out there has seen something similar and can share some information or at least theories.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,40.215994779116464,-85.41153895582329

The other 14 that followed did not form a V when they ascended but followed the same flight path.  They did not make any sounds. I have never seen anything like this before.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,37.19880653950953,-93.30922288828337

It was a craft it looked like it was about ¼ inch wide, and maybe 3/8 of an inch long and it was so far out that it was fuzzy looking around the edges, and I know from experience as an ex- USCG base photographer and working with a lot of telephoto equipment that when things are really far away that they have less definition but they have to be damn far away.  To me that means, that this thing had to have been HUGE!  It did not seem to be reflecting light, because the light was evenly distributed across the entire surface, and the color was a very light blue it was like the light was being emitted by it.  The actual shape of the craft was, well it looked a lot like a (22) bullet, but without the rings on the back of it, it was not metallic but more like pale porcelain with this very pale light blue all over it. How fast was it going I have never seen anything move that fast in my life, and I’m 59 I have seen a lot!

April 1, 2013 I usually go outside to stargaze before I go to bed.  Last night was no different.  As soon as I walked outside and looked up I saw a “shooting star” go right over me heading south.  I was amazed at how bright and clear the stars were, this is very unusual here in SE Texas.  I went back inside the house to get my binoculars.   I came back out and was focusing on the star Alnath, in Taurus.  I was facing SW.  This star was just below Jupiter and was very red, it also appeared to be twinkling and changing colors.  Most of the stars appeared to be twinkling and changing colors.   I had just focused on this star when something flew right through my line of sight. I immediately looked for it and focused on a formation of ten flying objects flying in a V formation.  They did not have any lights on making them difficult to follow, and they were moving very fast.  I do not know how fast they were traveling.  I counted seven seconds from horizon to horizon.  My “horizon” is within a pool courtyard surrounded by a house.  The objects were travelling   E-NE.  The formation changed from a standard V.  I have attached my drawing for a description. The colors of these flying objects were very close to desert camouflage (tan, brownish gray).  Their shape was an irregular four sided polygon, with the shorter side being in the front, resembling a triangle with the top cut off.  I could barely make out other shapes and impressions; there is an attached drawing of this as well. I realize this description is very similar to military aircraft, but here are some differences that stand out.  There was absolutely no sound, except for traffic on the freeway that is about a mile away.  There was no wind that I could tell, and I waited after I could no longer see the aircraft for any mechanical sounds, and there was nothing.  There were no lights coming from these objects, nothing blinking or glowing or spotting.   Finally, my perception of the speed they were moving is faster than anything I’ve ever seen. This is not the first UFO I have ever seen, it the second I have seen in Texas.  The first UFO I ever saw was in Brussels, Belgium in 1990. I am a 41 year old single mom currently finishing my degree in child psychology.  I live with and help care for my aging parents.  I am not originally from Texas, I moved here from Cape Cod, MA. to be closer to my family.  I have done extensive travelling in my life, and saw my first UFO  while living overseas.  I have been an avid stargazer ever since. Thank you for for providing a forum for me to share my sightings.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,30.10207910447761,-93.85383582089553

It was in the fall, I do not remember the exact time or date, so the are rough estimates.  My mother and I were driving over to the Pilot Rock, OR, area to meet my Dad and uncles there.  We were all staying in a large cabin . During the road trip at night, my mom and I saw a distant orange light slowly approaching from our left side of the road.  It moved smoothly and steadily towards us.  It silently kept getting closer, its height matching the rolling hills and uneven terrain with a precise and unchanging  distance from the ground. My mother pulled our car off to the side of the road.  It was clear, I could see stars and there was dead silence, no wind. This oval, solid orange object came right up to us, never slowing down, moving very slowly.  (About the speed of a avarage running man).  I looked into it with awe, it had no markings, solid color, not even a variation of orange.  Its luminescence was not to bright that I could not look at it.  It was bright, but it did not illuminate much of the ground around it. It kept getting closer.  Close enough I think I could have hit it with a rock.  It compared in size to. Softball held at arms Length  from you.  It was about 20 feet off the ground.  I would guess it was about 40 ft in diameter (oval) and had a vertical length of about 10 ft (maybe slightly more) it had no sound. This object continued to move steadily past us.  After it was out of sight, we got into our car and drive to the cabin.  I kept looking for it and notice it was trailing our right side in the trees lines quite a distance away.  I could see glimpse of it until we turned left onto a gravel road, drove a bit longer and we were at the cabin. Never seen anything like it since.  I have only told my family until now.

That is the best I can pinpoint the ‘ancient history’ from my past. The unidentified object was shaped very similarly to a jack in the child’s game of ‘ball & jacks’. It was on the ground, tilted so its low side faced the city.  It was flat-black color. Its circumference was slightly larger than a basketball. Toy jacks that I recall had 4 legs radiating outward from a center axis.  This object had 6 legs.  Two front legs were feet-on-the-ground, facing the city.  Two legs were a bit off the ground and to the left and right sides of the ‘face’.  Two ‘rear legs’ in the back of the ‘jack’ were off the ground facing uphill. It was an odd configuration because whoever saw it asked, at least instinctively, “How could 4 legs off of the ground be outweighed by the 2 front legs that were on the ground and tilted to face the city?”  This basketball-sized jack with the flat-black finish was sitting halfway up a hill in Grandview City Park in the Pittsburgh, PA. A neighborhood named “Mount Washington” overlooks Pittsburgh. Mt. Washington has two well known vantage points that gaze across the river at the downtown skyscrapers.  These vantages are Grandview Avenue and Grandview Park.  They are on opposite ends of the neighborhood. Grandview Avenue got lots of pedestrian and vehicle traffic.  Grandview Park got much less, especially during winter. The park has an observation deck near the main entrance.  Uphill from the deck, the park is ‘terraced’ by 3 service roads. Atop the hill are 2 huge water tanks.  The park’s lowest road is its main service road (no public access for vehicles].  It’s between the hill and the observation deck.  This road is 2 vehicles wide. There are 2 more single-lane service roads.  They are further up the hillside. The position of these roads gives a framework for the remainder of this report. The highest service road goes to the water tanks.  At its apex it was about 60 yards (175’) higher than the main service road.  The middle service road was about 40 yards (125’) above the main service road. I know these distances because on snowy nights I practiced playing football.  Specifically, while walking our family’s fearless German Shepherd, I played quarterback.  I threw snowballs at trees. They were adjacent to the service roads and spaced apart at intervals of 10 to 50 yards.  I knew the distances with respect to the same distances on a football field. Facing the water tanks and, thus, facing away from the city, the large hill is gumdrop-shaped.  At its base is the main service road.  The highest and midway, single-lane service roads curve across the face of the hill.  They intersect at the main road. This particular night I walked Duke (the dog) up to the top of the hill.  It was snowing medium hard.  We could see only the brightest lights of the nearest downtown buildings.  And those lights were fuzzy & foggy.  The same was true for visibility of the park’s service road street lights at the opposite end of the park’s main entrance.  Only the 2 of us were walking through the park. The snow was ankle deep to mid-calf, depending on drifts formed by the wind.  The snow was deep enough that the wind that whistled through the park during winter had not yet blown any spots bald to render them devoid of snow. We walked along the highest service road over the crown of the hill facing the city, walked down the hill to the midway service road, to double back to where we entered.  Duke was usually rambunctious and very curious.  He knew my game of snowball football. Sometimes, he liked to race me to where my snowball hit a tree.  That night we’d done some casual racing in the snow to about 10 trees. We got to one of his favorite places to race & run.  The next tree was about 40 yards away. He liked hearing “pop” when my snowball hit that tree.  He liked to take-off as he watched its flight.  But he didn’t on that night.  He shied away from hurrying toward that tree. He avoided the upside of the service road and stayed his leash’s length away on the downhill side toward the city. He usually preferred the uphill side because other dogs marked their spots on the uphill side. As we made our way toward the tree I’d just hit with a snowball, I noticed a depression in the snow on that service road.  I couldn’t yet see it clearly because the city lights and park street lights were dimmed by medium-heavy snowfall, but there was definitely something dimensionally odd about a point in the snow near tree I’d just hit. The nearer we got to my new ‘line-of-scrimmage’ (the tree), the more Duke was reluctant to continue. He always led the charge toward any new curiosity.  But he didn’t this time.  As I got nearer, I saw a circular black spot with almost no snow on the asphalt service road. Then I started seeing the jack-shaped, object dormantly sitting there. I got about 2-3 yards away from it.  Duke stayed with me although he had enough leash to go sniff it -- which he’d done with everything before and after our encounter with that object; put his nose right on or in it. I did not feel heat radiating from the jack, but heat had to explain why there was no snow in the radius around it.  I ventured to a bit more than an arm’s length away.  I picked up a pinch of the fluffy snow and sprinkled it toward the jack.  A bit of my sprinkling landed on it and was gone in less than 2 minutes.  It took only slightly longer to vanish than the regular snow falling on and around it. Meanwhile, I studied it as closely as I dared.  I saw no seams, nothing that resembled a hatch or window.  Yet I had the distinct sense that it was specifically facing the city lights; almost like admiring the view through the snow while enjoying the calm & silence of such a snowfall.  At the same time I had a definite sense of “Hands OFF!  Don’t touch!”   The center of the jack had the biggest pod/cylinder; both in diameter and height.  At the end of each leg were smaller-scale versions of the same pod.  The pods were approximately the same diameter as the legs that connected them to the center core.  If they were different diameters, then it was by a mere millimeter or less; measurable only with calipers.  Small as it was it didn’t seem spindly.  It seemed sturdy.  It didn’t seem hostile, but it wasn’t inviting or overtly friendly.  It emitted a sense (or invisible aura) of power . . . not energy, but of power. Duke inched nearer to it only as I did. I was his shield and security.  This was totally out of character for our fierce, fearless dog.  I’d always needed to restrain him. He was a trained attack dog that K-9 police gave us because he was too aggressive ~ until he encountered this jack. This whole encounter was 3-5 minutes. I stepped past the jack, threw a few more snowballs at my next possible (football receiver) trees, drifted back to the jack for one last look, and saw no changes.  Then we returned home.  My snowballs were unusually accurate that night; missing 1 or 2 of 75-80 throws.  The next day my brother took Duke for his morning walk.  I told him about the black jack.  He looked for it.  It was gone. But where I’d seen it there was a divot in the snow shaped like the bottom of a basketball. Thinking about it you’ve got to ask: “Why was all of the ground below it devoid of snow?  Why not only where just the front feet touched the ground?  How did the black jack get there?  Obviously, it didn’t walk or tumble there. Why were there no tracks or footprints in the virgin snow?”  That made no sense. It had been snowing for 2-3 hours.  Anyone/thing moving afoot through the park would have left telltale tracks. And, Duke very cautiously and tentatively stuck his nose only so close as if a spherical energy field was radiating outward from the jack, just 1-2 inches beyond the full length of the jack’s legs.  My observation was that Duke knew or sensed something to the effect, “That’s as near as you get!”  But maybe it was selective/smart shielding because snow was OK for touching the jack. These are my thoughts articulated today (November 2013) but at least subconsciously in my 15-17 year-old awareness during the encounter.  It was weird, semi-spooky, and it simply “didn’t add up”.  While looking at it I pondered picking it up and taking it home to show Dad (a master engineer of power plants, steel mills and water processing facilities).  But Duke avoided the jack as though it was the Plague -- a sign to duly consider.  And I had no idea of where to put it, what to do with it, and it ‘felt’ too strange. The jack looked different than all other UFO configurations/shapes that I’d seen before and that I’ve seen since.  I kind of have regrets about this probably dubious ‘opportunity’.  But I played it safe and I’m still alive to tell you about it. ----------- Completing the end of this report form . . .  Contact me if you want.  I can not accept (pay for) a collect call.

When I was a teenager, my mother told me of an event that happened to all three of them in 1973.  I was only 4 years old when this happened and did not witness it myself although I was present for the event. It started at my grandmothers’ home which was just a quarter mile NW of ours.  My family owned a 90 acre ranch in the NW section of the county and both homes were on the same property.  My grandparents and my dad had lived on the property for about 13 years and my mother and I had just moved to the property after she married my dad.  Most of the property was cleared but we were surrounded by a thick forest. At around 2 am one morning my grandmother got up to use the bathroom and as she was going back to bed she saw a very bright light outside her bedroom window facing east toward the front of the house, the bedroom was in the southeast corner of the home.  She didn't know what it was so she went to her kitchen window also facing east to get a better look. She described an intense light hovering above the ground at the tree tops and moving toward her house from the east.  She said it was very bright and lit everything up like daylight and she said there was a high pitched whistling/whooshing sound that was so loud she had to cover her ears.  She watched as the light moved up and over her house to the west when it suddenly disappeared.  The light and the sound were just suddenly gone and she did not see it anywhere in the sky when she walked outside to look for it.  My grandfather never woke up and has no recall of the event. At about the same time my parents were awakened by a high pitched whistling/whooshing sound and the whole house shaking violently.  My mother said the house was shaking so bad that the mirrors on her closet doors were rattling violently and she thought they were going to break.  She said the sound was incredibly loud and she and my dad had to cover their ears and shout to each other to be heard.  They made their way to my room and found me sleeping soundly as though nothing was going on.  They could not see an object but said it was circling the house incredibly fast and making that horribly loud sound. They said after a few minutes the atmosphere changed and it became very difficult for them to breathe and they felt like they were in a vacuum. They said all of this lasted about 10 to 15 minutes when suddenly everything stopped.  The sound, the vacuum and the violent shaking just stopped as though it had never happened.  They told me that neither of them was able to get back to sleep that night and they never knew what it was that had caused all of the ruckus.  I have no recall of anything related to this event and I never experienced anything like it in all the years that I lived there and my parents never had another experience after this one. I don't believe in ""little green men"", aliens or extraterrestrial beings but I know something happened that night I just don't know what caused it to happen.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,29.153170016207454,-82.11931701782821

The sighting happened at dusk sometime in mid- September  of 1973.  100 (or more) of us were ordered to change barracks from one barracks building to another.  While walking with my personal gear accompanied by another Marine, I heard someone say, ""Look up!"". When I looked up, I saw a saucer-shaped craft hovering several hundred feet above me.  Although the craft was hovering, it made small darting movements left/right and up/down.  These occasional sporadic movements were so abrupt that it was obvious the anything inside the craft would be tossed around like a rag doll.  Brilliant rotating lights were emitted from the underside of the craft.  The lights splashed in brilliant colors, blue, red, white. etc. Someone else yelled, “Look over there!  There are more of them!.”  I quickly scanned the horizon and saw what looked like 2 identical saucer shaped craft downrange from the craft we had been watching.   At this point, all of us that were moving gear stopped, set our gear down and simply watched the spectacle unfold.  Many comments were made by many different Marines that these craft were obviously not of this world. Being on a Naval Air Station, a single F-4 Phantom jet was scrambled.   We watched the fighter take off and make a slow turn to the right toward the closest craft with his afterburner glowing.  Marines everywhere were saying things to the effect of “I wonder what will happen now!” or “Man, I’d hate to be that pilot.”  There was a great dread in the air that it seemed that we could all “feel.” As soon as the fighter began to approach the closer craft, the craft moved at unbelievable speed and began hovering again almost instantaneously beside the other 2 saucers that were waiting downrange. The Phantom jet  rolled to the left and made a high G turn toward the (now) 3 saucer shaped craft hovering some distance away.  As soon as the F-4 started to close on the 3 hovering craft, all 3 UFO’s shot off at great speed and were completely out of sight within 2-3 seconds.

Sometime after dark, the fire department was dispatched on a report of two overdue fishermen.  As ranking officer, I responded with an area captain to the bridge on Highway 7 – the point the fishermen were last seen--to coordinate response by the department.  As we pulled up to the bridge, I spotted a large bright white light downstream from the bridge at a point I guessed was directly over the confluence of the North and Middle St. Vrain creeks. As I watched it, the light moved back and forth in a U-pattern.  My immediate association was to an airplane dipping its wings.  After a few seconds it faded out.  I had the mental impression that this light was signaling the location of the fishermen, and letting me know they were okay.  I asked the fire captain if he had seen the light, and he said no.  I told him what I had seen and what I thought it meant. It was too dark to search downstream, so I assigned a couple of people to stay at the bridge overnight in case the fishermen walked out.  The next morning I led a crew down an access road to the creeks.  We had only been walking a few minutes, when we met the fishermen walking out.  They were okay, and reported they had spent the night “where the two creeks come together.”  I asked if they had seen any unusual lights during the night, and they said no. At the time, I was living just upstream from the bridge, and I had seen a similar sized flashing white light in the same area, but a little further north and stationary.

I am reporting this today because of all the attention UFO's have been getting lately.  I had always thought that my story would be irrelevant because it was only a sighting, but after watching a UFO show on the Travel Channel, I'd report my experience just to have it on record. It was around June of 1994 and i was living in Las Vegas in an apartment complex on Desert Inn and Pecos.  I was living with my girlfriend named Dana Scavone at the time and was a dice dealer. I got off from work at 8pm and went to the apartment.  It's been a long time so the exact time of the occurance escapes me, but i want to say around 9:30 pm or somewhere in that time frame.  I smoked outside, and we lived on the second floor of our apartment complex, and stepped outside of the apartment door onto the balcony, lit a cigarette, and as i was smoking the cigarette i happened to look up...and that's when i saw a HUGE, black, perfectly triangled craft slowly moving across the sky making no noise whatsoever.  The craft couldn't have been more than 1000 ft. up, moving from the northwest towards the southeast.  This craft was black, had no bright lights, but did have some kind of circular metallic object in the bottom side middle of the craft. I looked in awe for a few moments and then yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come out and look at what i was seeing. Dana came outside and looked up and said, ""Oh my God, what is that?"".  I replied, ""I think it's a UFO"". I then ran into the apartment, grabbed the telephone and dialed 911.  The operator answered and i proceeded to tell her exactly what i was looking at.  I said to the 911 operator, ""I am looking at a huge black triangle in the sky right now as we speak, and it's flying right over my apartment""; or something to that effect.  The 911 operator was not mad at me as i had thought they might be for calling in a UFO (Which i didn't even think really existed), but was more interested in the idea that i was really looking at a UFO.  I think i asked her if she had heard aything from other callers, and she replied that she had not.  Then one of us decided that i should contact McCarran airport or Nellis AFB to see if they might have anything on ra! dar to explain the craft.  I remember just saying something like, ""Maybe you guys should contact Nellis and see if they have something because i am definitely seeing a huge black triangle fly right over my apartment"". I hung up the phone and watched the craft continue on towards the Southeast as it climbed and eventually disappeared out of sight. I heard no noise.  I am absolutely sure of what i saw.  And if you can get the 911 audio, you'll clearly see how startled i was. This event happened.  This was not an airplane.  This was a triangle.  It moved slowly, without sound, directly over my head.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

I noticed far off in the distance an orange light pulsating slowly in the distance.  I couldn't see it anymore as I walked up the hill, but when I got to the top of the hill I was facing north toward Burlington looking for it again when I looked directly above me.   That's when i saw a black triangle with lights on each point and a bulge in the middle flying very low (maybe a couple hundred feet or less off the ground), slowly and silently toward Burlington.  It was almost as if I blacked out because by the time I actually 'woke up' or realized what I saw, the object was now a large bright white light in the sky still heading toward Burlington.  I watched it for another couple minutes as it was getting further away from me (closer to Burlington) still appearing as a bright white light.   Then I noticed what were clearly planes (small red blinking lights) moving toward the light.   As the planes got closer the bright light got dimmer then faded out and disappeared.  I'm assuming it was gone because the planes seemed to circle the area. Then I ran to my friend's house to tell her what I saw and we went up to the roof deck (which has a clear view of burlington and lake champlain) and we could see and hear that there were a lot of planes in the sky (maybe helicopters, too).  About 40 minutes later what appeared to be a low shooting star with a green trail behind it flew across the sky.  My friend didn't see it. I told her what i'd seen and traced the path across the sky with my finger.  When i was pointing out where it had disappeared, it lit up again and shot toward the ground in the form of the shooting star with the green trail. I didn't see any mention in the news about it the next day and never heard anyone ever mention any phenomenon that day.  I've always wondered if anyone ever saw the same thing.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,,

I looked at it clearly ... thoughts through my mind that it was clearly something big, unusual and not moving surrounded by blue sky and not joined to the ground in any way...this sounds strange but I was almost looking for it to be joined to something on the ground as a way of explaining how it could be. I told my husband quite desperately to look but it was not visible to him driving and was til high for him to see from his seat...I kept eye contact with it for a good minute and it remained stationary and I had to turn my head to continue to see it.  We passed behind light trees and I could still see it's broken shape and mass.  My husband took the first road on the left which brought us behind the line of trees and when I looked behind them it had completely disappeared.

It had darker markings on both ends but was definitely angular and rectangle...possible 10 times as long as the height. At the time my husband and I discussed how I had no reference to gauge the size snit was just stuck in the blue sky with no other structures around it but I could gauge how close it was and it's size as I could see markings and the edges were crisp and it was solid and close enough for me to know it was nothing that I would ever expect to see....it was nothing that I could explain with any physics known to man unless it weighed absolutely nothing and somehow didn't move in a breeze!

After this event we saw in one hour more simular things, but the lights was smaller, and flight from west-east. but the light was constantly white, it looks like the star is traveling but faster that airplane....

While my wife and I walked our son and daughter in-law to their vehicle in our driveway, I looked up to see what appeared to be the space station, travelling from West to East, slightly to the North.  It struck us as unusual,  that trailing behind the larger white orb was a smaller orange sphere.  The trailing orange sphere appeared almost tethered behind at a distance the width of a fist at arm’s length.  All saw the two objects and commented, “What the heck?”  I ran to the back deck and observed the two spheres through, Orion 9 x 63 binoculars. I have observed the space station over one hundred times and am quite familiar with its behavior.  Especially the change in brightness as it travels to the East and loses, “line of sight”, with the sun which changes its intensity of brightness as does its rotation.  The first object was a bright white appearing object twice the size of either Venus or Jupiter at their brightness and about 50% larger than my observation of the Space Station, although about the same color and luminosity.  The second orb which travelled directly behind the first was much smaller and orange, the size, color and brightness of Arcturus. I was able to observe both spheres as the travelled through the sky at a similar speed to the space station until they both disappeared behind the tree line to the East.  Note, during the approximate ninety, (90), seconds observed through the binoculars the intensity and color of both orbs did not change, nor did the spacing.  In addition I looked for any kind of mass between the two orbs but saw none as the smaller orange orb followed directly behind and at the same angle as the leading larger white orb.

Last night, Larry Sloss saw the HTV-4 in hot pursuit of the ISS in the twilight skies over Priest Lake, Idaho:  ""The HTV-4 was trailing the ISS by just 3 seconds,"" says Sloss.  Many observers noted ""HTV-4 flares"" this week. Apparently sunlight is glinting off a flat surface of the spacecraft, briefly raising its luminosity to match that of the much larger ISS. Sloss saw one too: ""In the image, a brief, bright flare from the HTV-4 is slightly offset from the ISS trail.""  HTV-4 has an interesting payload.  Among the 5.4 tons of food, spare parts, and other supplies are Kirobo, a talking robot to join the crew of the ISS, and Firestation, an experiment to study mysterious Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes.  Update:  The HTV-4 docked to the space station at 11:38 EDT on Friday, Aug. 9th.  Unloading has commenced.

A 2nd object was seen coming from due west and following the 1st object.  Both had the same constant speed.  No sounds.  No usual aeronautical lights.  Objects just had a constant, non-throbbing orange glow with a red-sharp glow coming from its equator. I immediately brought my smartphone out to film the objects.  During filming, both objects disappeared from sight at 2 different times and locations.  I scanned the sky but could not find the 2 objects.

They were still in the same position, so I reasoned with myself they must be stars or planets.  They sat slightly diagonal from each other.  The one on the upper right was reddish (made me think of mars) and the lower left was bright whitish almost to the point of looking blue.  I just sat and looked at them, thinking how neat it was they were so bright…so I actually observed them for a few minutes.  Suddenly the white one on the lower left moved toward the west and went off or behind something…it was a measured, deliberate movement….not a “shooting off” quickly.   I looked back to the upper right one, and it went straight down and out of sight with the same deliberate motion…and I just sat there with my mouth open, looking around to see if anyone else saw it (I was alone in the parking lot), and wondered what the heck I had just seen.

I live four miles from an airport, so I am used to airplanes, however, what I saw tonight was unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky before.   It was four large, round, muted orange lights flying in a perfect straight-line formation (as if part of one large object).  They moved very fast and completetly silent from west to north- east.  Although the lights were large, they appeared to be far away, and quickly dimminished as they went across the sky. The lights appeared on the sky for no more than eight or nine seconds, and in that time, they had traveled from straight above me to gone in north-eastern direction.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

Green Crafts/Dark Shadow Crafts I must stress the amount of activity over Vancouver's lower mainland and I am baffled no one appears to have made any reports supporting mine. Please allow me to elaborate; I noticed pin-points of light traveling quickly in the night sky before last Christmas. They would stop then change direction so I knew they were not satellites. Soon after I noticed, and the only way to describe them is, triangle shaped craft's outlined by translucent, deep green lights. And not one or two but many. They are hard to see due to the colour temperature and easier to notice when it's overcast because the translucent deep green colour seems enhanced by the clouds.As well I've noticed what appear to be dark square shadows in both the day and night sky. Both of these crafts appear to do the same thing; line up, fly a circular pattern then repeat it over and over almost as if they were repairing something (?) At 11pm PST and 1am PST I notice, again this the only way I can describe it, all of the translucent deep green outlined crafts standing still and omitting what appears to be a wide spread green 'laser' similar to a rock concert laser light show. Synchronized, each craft's fan of beams pans left to right for approx. 2 minutes projecting a 'mesh' over the night sky. I spotted a dark shadow that hovered over a neighbors house for a number of night last January and shawn a green laser pointer at it. It slowly moved towards me and for 15 seconds hovered in front of me no more than 60 feet away. It resembled a pulsating eye, like a rain drop hitting a puddle, then moved off. It wasn't frightening and seemed as curious of me as I of it. Like I said, I noticed this before last November. I see these every night and think it would be more worrisome if they disappeared. I have video to show you and after reporting to local groups still absolutely no one ever gets back to me.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,49.26892572695909,-123.11223982257269

Also was sent to Unsealed Alien Files.  Interestingly no one has ever contacted me about it except for a few non-scientific fanatics. The photo was taken in Hawaii, on the island of Oahu in the town of Haleiwa. The date was sometime in January 1997.  It's been a while.  I am a long time professional photographer (surfing and stock) who has been in the business for over 40 years.  One evening, after watching a movie with a friend, and they were leaving my home, they pointed out some strange lights in the sky, it was late about 1 am.  I decided, what the heck, never shot a UFO foto, and got out my big surfing lens (a Nikon 800mm f/5.6 and added a 2x tele-extender and used a very heavy duty tripod) and took about 10-20 photos.  The film was Fuji Velvia 35mm transparency, exposure was about f/8-f/11 for about 15 seconds.  It was very clear that night, no clouds or haze at all. I have my own film processor so I pushed processed the film to a speed of about ISO or ASA 200+.  I got two really good photos, this is a slide duplicate and digitized file of one of them. The bright light is not the moon.  It was shot looking s! outhwest from the north ground position, roughly far above the center of Oahu. 	As far as I could tell (its really hard shooting the sky at night) the objects were at least a mile or two up in the atmosphere (from previous experience shooting aircraft with the same setup during the day), I would say the objects were about as big as a 747?  There were blinking multi-colored lights on their perimeters, and you could clearly see the outline of the craft thru the lens.  This was the second series of photos over about a 1/2 hour period.  The first series revealed only one object, triangular shaped, with pastel lights on each tip (maybe the Aurora?).  During the second series of exposures about 20 minutes later there appeared to be two 'craft' and that is the photo I submitted.  There appeared to be a super bright beam that connected the two craft for about a minute.  Please be aware that the film was grainy and because it was 'pushed' (the only way I could get a decent exposure), and super dark night. Its really tough to shoot this kind of thing at night and get anything at all.  As a professional there wasn't much else I could do to get the best exposure under the conditions.  I didn't want to shoot too slow because of shutter vibration, wind etc, and this was a very long, very heavy lens. 	At this point I will have to tell you that I thought about calling the local news, but I am a fairly private person and didn't want the publicity.  I was able to call Art Bell's show several weeks later when I think he was interviewing Peter Davenport (my memory is a little foggy) but I remember Art or Dave mentioning that I could contact a fellow who Art had mentioned was a ufologist named Mark Bean in Nevada.  Apparently he had some high quality equipment and said he could enhance the photos.  I made some copies of the originals with a 'slide duplicator' and it ended up being a good decision because I mailed him (Mark) the two best 'originals' with the intent that he would scan them and return the originals.  I never heard from him again, and sent the photos with delivery confirmation, but there was no record from the Post Office that they were ever delivered!  A mystery!  I tried contacting Mark a few times, never got any replies, and gave up.  I just wonder if he ever got them!?  It was a perfect typical 'Murphy's law' situation.  I was just glad I had made duplicates.  I've been sitting on the 'dupes' for over 10 years. 	The one I submitted to Coast to Coast was from a duplicate that I took to Costco last year and had scanned to a fairly large digital file (about 4 mb). That's the one I sent digitally to the show. Please be aware when you make a duplicate of a dark photo like this you really lose a lot of the original quality in the second generation exposure, and then again when scanning the image. 	 I have the 'triangular view of the single craft' duplicate in my files and can look for it again. If someone could spend some time on these with photoshop and very high quality equipment they could probably get a better enhanced image or maybe recreate an artist's conception of what these objects looked like. 	I've been a techno geek in photography for over 30 years and still can't figure out exactly what I photographed, as I have shot other time exposures in darkness and have my work published in national photography magazines.  Please note: There are so many small details, and opinions I have that it would take a few pages to give my theory and opinions what these objects are. I always wanted to shoot a UFO, (doesn't everyone?).

Neither of us spoke for what I estimate was approx 4 minutes whilst we watched the object open mouthed. It spanned approx 3 (2 up 2 down )terraced houses and was really low,it was high enough that I could still see the underside and I got the impression there were 3 lights as when it rose up after being completely stationary above the houses 3 beams of light shone downward it was daytime but the light was visible. Although it was close and low it made no sound at all, it was completely and utterley silent I just knew immediately it was not anything earthly as it was still, not hovering and so silent, after a few minutes (I think it was my brain was taking so much in it was very surreal), it rose slowly, still silently and went in a westerly direction for a short distance then literally zoomed off, no trail, no acceleration no noise and we could not see it within literally a second, Stretford isn't too far from Manchester airport so we were used to seeing aircraft landing and taking off and you can see them for miles in the distance, this was just gone. I got the impression it was metallic although it wasn't shiny by my recollection.

Most peoples reactions were yeh, ok funny joke, I eventually lost my temper with a few people even my mum who (god rest her soul) was really open minded and knew me inside out said to me,I believe that you believe you saw a ufo. Even Paul my work mate, sick of being ridiculed eventually asked me to stop speaking about it as no one believed us and he was sick of the teasing, as you can imagine this rea! lly annoyed me, why would we lie to people we saw something we could not explain, it wasn't anything that moved like anything humans can currently engineer (to my knowledge) and the speed, the g-force alone would kill a human. Anyway someting positive happened as approx 2 weeks later, and after me losing my temper with a fair few people that knew and loved me, after them not taking my sighting more seriously there was a big article in The Manchester Evening News about UFO's being spotted all over Manchester and the police main switch had been jammed with calls reporting these sightings, my friend still refused to discuss it and people were so blase about it I eventually dropped it.  About 6 years later I was talking to my new boyfriends mum about the incident and it turned out that she, her hubby and 2 kids had spotted it on the way home from school and had followed it for some time,. I also had a conversation with a new colleague a few years later that lived in Stretford and it turnd out that he also saw the same type of craft out of his high rise flat window although I'm not sure if this was the same day, however to my maths that's 7 people I personally know that have seen this same ufo in Stret! ford. I'm not saying it was a little  grey was at the controls, but I will bet my life that craft is not from this planet. It seems funny how blase I have become too over the years, I guess its because although people say they believe, and act inyerested in what you saw when faced with the facts of the story they try to tell you you didn't see what you know you did, I'm not a moron, it wasn't a weather balloon, blimp, chinese lantern, remote control plane, copter etc, it was daylight and very close there wasn't even camera phones or I reckon I would have had some of the closest footage ever shot as that thing was low! I try not to watch too many things about ufo's as, aside from my partner and my 4 year old daughter and 8 year old son being sick of hearing me repeat the same story over and over again, I find it frustrating when people are sceptical I'm also puzzled and shocked how the government still haven't given an honest statement regarding what is going on despite the number of strong sightings, tyrustworthy witness testimonies and video footage. I find that quite scary to be honest as I know without any doubt that UFO's do visit us so, so must the government, do they have a bad agenda? Is that why the government aren't speaking up? they don't want mass panic, I don't know, all I do know is the majority of the stuff I have seen on the web (usually what my partner has found, afterall I've already seen one close up I don't need convincing) for example the  footage of the triangular crafts are, the same as the one that I saw,  and therefore very, very real. You'd think that you'd be different somehow having this knowledge but nothing is different, life carries on the same except now you know there IS life on other planets.  I suppose the possibilities are endless, quite scary when you think about it, so I try not to think too deeply about it all as I don't have any answers and it looks like the government aren't gonna provide us with any, at least not anytime soon.  In fact this is the first time I have ever given a written account of what I saw.  I learnt a long time ago people think you're a bit odd if you start talking about UFO's so just my loved ones and close friends know these days, in fact one of the things I love about my man is that he believes me despite not seeing it himself, he doesn't just profess to be open minded, he really is, and he aint faking it, he believes me and that is really quite important to me I've discovered, especially when you've been mocked and ridiculed by loved ones, no matter how good naturedl! y the teasing was.

I was in the passenger seat.  We were headed to my house late at night.  The forest was thick along the road but opens at one point to a clearing.  We drove into the clearing and were surprised beyond belief.   The clearing was illuminated as if it was daytime. In the clearing at about 300 feet was a massive glowing object the size of a cruise ship.  It was football shaped and glowing a fluorescent blue/green that was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.  Although it was illuminating all around we could see it clearly without hurting our eyes.  We were only about 200 yards from it.  I said,""do you see that?!"" and my girlfriend replied,""of course I (bleeping) see it!""  She slowed the car as we watched it but it shot off over the mountains like something out of Star Wars.  Then we were both gripped by a paralyzing fear like nothing I've ever felt before or since.  When I say fear, I sincerely mean it.  My very soul was struck in fear.  What we saw shook us to our core.   We drove to my house and talked about it for hours trying to console ourselves.  We were afraid it would come back and still felt its presence although we saw it shoot off and away.   For over ten years now I have thought of it everyday and am now afraid of the dark and of being alone.  I'm a grown man but the memory of that fear has left its mark deeply.   Years later I looked up my girlfriend on Facebook and asked her about it.  She was amazed I brought it up but I wanted to make sure it wasn't something I mistook.  We talked about it for awhile but we both felt the fear again and stopped talking to each other altogether.  The fear of that thing we saw is still real.  I wish I could describe it better.  It froze my blood.  I am finally reporting it because of it being on my mind every single day.  It may be childish but the feeling of that fear is with me every night.

I had been sailing with a friend south from Annapolis.   We anchored on the Western Coast of Chesapeake Bay.  As night fell, our vantage from the boat was Eastward and we saw a range of approaching aircraft landing lights, presumably heading toward Andrews AFB.  The glidepath seemed to be just above us, the aircraft further out were highest on the path and as they approached, the lights lowered and became brighter.   With conventionally powered binoculars,  I looked at one that didn't appear to be moving toward the top of the the range and it looked like Saturn, a disk with a globe in it.  I assumed it was Saturn.  Its brightness was the same as the other lights at that height.   I awoke at 4:30 the following morning and noticed the light seemed to still be there, upon looking within binoculars,  I saw it was exactly the same shape.  I know that had it been a planet, it should now be in Western sky.  A satelite wouldn't emit that much light and if it reflected the Sun's light, which it could, it couldn't reflect it back to my position at both 20:00 hours and 4:30 hours when the sun would be have moved 90 degrees relative to our position.

While at Ada Hayden Lake, (northern most region of Ames, Iowa) on our small fishing boat, my brother and I spotted a red-orange object beneath dark, heavy clouds.  It made it's way toward the lake from the south, having either come over the city heading north, or had dropped out of the clouds. It was a bright object and formless looking at the distance from which I spotted it.  Being familiar with the area (ie, city lights, towers, etc) the light caught my attention immediately. Not to mention there was a dense, low cloud cover and it was approximately 11pm, so very dark.  As it got nearer, through our mutual shock and original attempts to explain it as something else, we both noticed it was vaguely diamond shaped, & looked to wobble on an axis.  Straining to hear a noise, we heard nothing coming from the craft, which was moving in a northerly direction at a fast pace.  Being dark and uncertain on the height of the ceiling of clouds, I could only guess how large or fast it was. I grabbed a flashling and tried to signal it with timed pulses directed toward it.  At its closest point, it was close enough to one of the shores to see a reflection of it in the water.  That specific shore was perhaps 250 meters to the west of us.  Not long after I flashed my light at it, it seemed to speed up and bow to the east further over the lake, hover, then changed course heading west, southwest. As it hovered, a hole in the clouds opened directly above us two or three fist widths in diameter and I saw something very large, grey or black in color with multiple lights.  Through the clouds around the hole, four or five yellow lights filtered in, these seemed to move with this second craft and I think were a part of it.  Whatever it was, it filled the small hole in the clouds and then some, meaning it would have had to been enormous.  This second craft was moving above the cloud cover in a southwesterly direction and was gone from sight through the hole in a matter of seconds and the yellowish hazey lights faded. Looking back to the red-orange object, we watched it hover for a moment, then take its new course as above mentioned, to the west southwest and stayed on that course below the cloud cover before speeding over the horizon. It seemed to be moving much faster than before as it left the area.  The whole affair couldn't have lasted more than three minutes.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,42.04085172413793,-93.61238318965519

I am 74 years old, I have two incidents I want someone to know about, and I know that if I tried to talk to someone about them I wouldn't be taken seriously. The first incident took place in Alberta about ten years ago. I was travelling south east of Drumheller on a not frequently travelled road.  I stopped to take a picture of a seam of coal in an embankment.  There was an odd looking cloud in the sky, kind of triangular shape.  I also noticed there was a craft within the cloud, it was not a typical air craft.  It was rectangular in shape, long, and higher than it was wide, and it was actually producing the substance that was forming the cloud, some of it which was falling to the ground somewhat like soap suds.  That is all I remember, but it did show up in the picture that I took.  This has been bothering me for years. The second incident took place about five years ago in Ontario.  About 6:30 AM I was travelling to visit my daughter in the Listowell area, at trip that I have often made.  I was travelling west on highway 7A, I turned north onto highway 35 for about a mile and then west on Highway 7A again.  I remember going past the Yelverton side road, I always notice that sign just because of the name,  The next place I should have come to was Nestleton, but it didn't happen.  The next thing I remember, I was parked facing south on a side road east of Lindsay, about 30 miles NE of where I last remember being.  It was 8AM..

I would like to preface this report by giving a little bit of back ground.  I formerly was enlisted in the United States Navy and was attached to an Intruder squadron.  I have seen almost all types of military and civilian aircraft and am familiar with flight mechanics.  Also I was not under any influence of any drugs or alcohol.  I am normal and healthy with no history of mental illness. November, 7th 2010/6:50am  I was returning home from work traveling East on Hwy 14 near Eagle Lake, MN.  Upon clearing a crest in the hill I noticed a bright blinding light to the East about 300 to 400 feet in the air.  Having experience in the aviation field my first thought was that it had to be landing lights of an airplane since there was a local airport only a couple miles away.  The object was at the time was between 1 and 1.5 miles away. After traveling 30-40 seconds the light neither moved in altitude or distance.  It appeared to be stationary. I started approaching the object driving about 55 MPH.  As I got closer I was able to start to distinguish the shape of the object.  Initially it looked just like a ball of light.  As I could start to make out features it looked like a shiny metallic surface with intense light shining from the underside of the object.  At this point I was able to eliminate airplanes, jets, and helicopters as possible objects. Not being able to Identify it as any aircraft I know.  I attempted to turn to a second line of reasoning. The object looked similar to a giant Mylar foil balloon.  Based on the size of the tree's below the object it was about the size of a normal 3 bedroom home.  My thought at the time was perhaps they were trying out a new type of weather balloon or I also heard that the military was trying out new dirigibles to patrol the boarders between the United States and Canada.  Perhaps it could have been one of those.  As I approached, the object started moving west the same direction I was heading.  ((sic.  Witness was going east.  Please see below.  PD))  I was traveling at the posted rate of speed 55 yet the object was pulling away quickly.  Having no cars in front of me and knowing the road was straight I accelerated to about 85mph in an effort to get closer. *never will I condone breaking the law but something was obviously not right.  At this point the object swiftly pulled away veered North and shot across the sky at an extreme rate of speed.  After about 8 to 12 seconds it was out of my visual range. Total elapsed time from first sighting, until loss of visual was about 7 minutes. Since I was in my car driving at highway speeds I was unable to hear any type of engine noise.  There were no vapor trails.  To reference how fast this object was moving..  I have seen F-14's flying at full speed.  This object was moving at least twice that speed.  And I also know that any soft surface of a dirigible would not be able to hold up at those speeds therefore the surface had to be solid.  I cannot tell you what this was.  I can tell you what it was not.  I told my now ex-wife about it and she seemed quite skeptical..  The only other person I have told about this is my sister.  And It sounds crazy..  If I heard someone telling it I would think they sounded crazy..  But I cannot forget about it.  And the least I can do is report it. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I just noticed I switched my east and west up in the second to last paragraph.. I was heading east.  I was never heading west. I always took Hwy 14 west in to work, and Hwy 14 east from work.  I was returning home.  A misprint on my part spell check did not catch it.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,44.1523,-93.8479

On Christmas night I was sweeping my sons floor and I hear a huge explosion which scared me at first but I immediately assumed it was a large firework from someone messing around and continued sweeping but then immediately realized it was still making an after sound like when you hear the rumble of thunder after a big lightning strike.  It was loud enough to set off a bunch of car alarms and rattle my windows.  When I thought it was thunder I promptly ran outside thinking it might start pouring rain and I had to cover my motorcycle.   So I ran out there looked up and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.  It was one of the clearest nights you could ever find in south Florida.  It couldn't have been a lightning strike with a clear sky.  I know it wasn't fireworks because I know exactly what those sound like up close.

They were in a very loose trail formation and maneuvered very differently from conventional commercial or military aircraft.  The lighting on the objects was constant and non-flickering.  There were no conventional red or white anti-collision lights apparent on any of the objects.  There were no red, green, or white navigation lights evident on any of the objects.  This was in stark contrast to commercial passenger airliners approaching San Diego's Lindbergh Field for landing.  The lighting and flight paths of the objects were in stark contrast to the commercial airliners that appeared to fly under the formation of the objects.  Military helicopter flight operations at NAS North Island were also ongoing simultaneously and were in stark visual contrast to the objects.  The objects did not make any sounds or noise.

It was around the spring or summer of 2008.  I was working as closing manager at the BlockBuster in Daleville, Botetourt County, Virginia (now closed) and was working with two other people.  We closed the store at 11:00 and were ready to leave by about 11:15 or 11:20 or so. When we walked out into the parking lot (the Botetourt Commons parking lot where Kroger is), we stopped at my co-worker's truck to talk.  While we were standing there talking, one of us looked toward the West and saw the object and directed our attention toward it.  He said something like,  ""What is that?,"" and we watched it but could never figure it out.  It was the topic of our conversation for the next 5 to 10 minutes, and just about the time we were losing interest in it, we noticed that it had disappeared.  We had not actually seen it leave.  Here is my description of it.  It was an orange ball of light.  It did not appear to me to flicker like a fire, but just a steady orange glow, like a street lamp.  Sometimes it stood still, then would slowly move in one direction, start turning in an arc, stop, move in another direction, and just generally moved erratically at different speeds in a relatively small area of the sky.  It was very high up but I couldn't tell how high or estimate its size, but it was significantly bigger than a star or planet.  I have lived near airports and seen all sorts of aircraft, but this did not behave like any of them.  It didn't seem to have a specific destination but just circled around erratically in the sky, turning too abruptly and moving too rapidly at times to be a helicopter or plane.   It also made no noise.  For a helicopter to be so far away as for me not to hear it (because they are very loud),  it would not be able to appear to make the kinds of movements that this object was! easily making.  The best way I can describe the pattern it made is like lazy figure 8's that abruptly stopped and started and reversed direction at times. When I looked on Google maps later at the location in the sky where we saw the object, I realized that we were looking directly towards Carvin's Cove, where most people in the Roanoke area get their water.  It was directly on the other side of the mountain that the object appeared to be ""dancing"" over.   None of us three thought too much of it at the time except that if we told people that we had seen a UFO (since we literally couldn't identify it) they would just think we were joking or full of it.  I still don't know what it was,  I only know what it wasn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2013-11-11T00:00:00,37.417,-79.9131

The object moved at a fast pace and was much closer than the stars.

I believe the guest was Peter Davenport but I’m not certain.  He reported an object following the International Space Station.  I can report I indeed saw this object clearly. When Peter gave his report, I checked the location of the ISS using astroviewer.com.  It was over Australia, but I noted that it’s trajectory would take it over the region where I live, slightly to the North.  I live on Eastern Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, roughly 49 N, 123.45 W.  I am on the outskirts of a small town on a three acre property in a relatively rural area, surrounded by ocean and trees.  There is only one street light in the area a few hundred meters away which it is hidden by trees.  Vancouver is over the horizon in the North East and obscures the stars near the horizon.  Other than that there is very low light pollution and no lights were visible other than from my home.  I could see the glow of the local spiral arm faintly but clearly.  As the graphic on astroviewer.com showed the space station approaching I went outside to watch the Western sky.  I have watched the ISS come over before.  Soon I saw it, eventually passing overhead at 10:48 p.m. PDT August 8, 2013, and slightly to the North, from West to East.  The ISS was bright white, far brighter than any star in the sky.  Trailing behind it was a distinctly reddish light.  At first my eyes drew a line between the two lights as if there was a cylinder joining them, but as it went higher in the sky I could see they were two distinct lights.  The trailing light was not as bright as the space station, several orders of magnitude less probably, but it was still as bright or brighter than the brightest star in the sky.  I held my arm out.  It trailed by about the width of the tip of my little finger held at arm’s length.  Both lights were very distinct, separate, and clear.  It was not an optical illusion or a result of blurred vision.  I would presume it is a Soyuz or Dragon capsule.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,48.9203,-123.7187

To report to you. Exactly what HAD BEEN WITNESSED June 3, 2013, at about 10:23pm est. These ' three ' separate UFO sightings Occurred here in southwestern Oshawa bordering Whitby, Ontario. Total time on and off witnessing all three were between 10:23pm to 10:43 pm  Here is my testimony as follows :  While walking my dog down the park near the creek and mature trees I was looking up above a large tree to the southwest some hundred yards away Above the tree high in the sky - maybe a guess between 2000- 5000 ft. I notice a bright slow moving white light coming over. Instantly I grabbed my camera to film it. As I film it and watch in awe It's now just slowly hooking north and even going slower. It's movement had a slight jiggle to it Moved about under  'half the speed ' of a Cessna Then it just fades out and is now gone under one minute when first noticed. Of course I just shake head and pick up the dog's leash and put my camera back in my pocket. As I continued walking the dog for a about another minute I now see another one moving from the west overhead heading east Being so in shock observing this bright single white light I drop the dog leash again and pull out my camera and start filming the second one. I watched it for about two to three minutes from the start to the end. This single bright white light travelled directly over my home heading eastern Oshawa on a straight flightpath It moved too slow to be any type of conventional aircraft. Talk about being shocked times two now. So once again, I grabbed the dog's leash from the ground Put my camera in my pocket shaking my head once again in wonderment. Continuing to walk the dog heading south across a road and into another park Then I now see a third one coming from the south - It started out quite bright as again I pull my camera to film. Within about thirty seconds The intensity of the light starts to fade to aqua- blue light. Then starts moving even slower and starts fading in intensity As I watched it travelling in the likeness a a star light - blue - white Still looking, now to be so much more  'higher ' in altitude heading north just west of my position. The speed was very slow and had that jerking motion  This was a first timer for me to witness three separate slow - low white ones at night here.  One really does wonder by thought and feelings what is about up there here. Guess I found my answer and along with photographic evidence to share.  I have noticed these types since Summer 2009 at night. They are out early June and in more numbers no doubt from my eyes. Best time between 9:30pm to 11:30pm Summer /Fall  Amazing enough I contacted a friend out of northern Whitby the next day He and his wife also witnessed and video taped the same type It has been posted on YOUTUBE He had captured excellent footage for visual detail on these slow anomalous white lights reported.

I and two friends were camping at a location a few miles east northeast of Ithaca, NY.  We were walking across a small meadow to our camping area when we paused to look up at the stars as it was a clear night and had been cloudy and rainy of late.  We were discussing the relative visibility and general appearance of satellites versus planes – similarities and differences, when my friend pointed and said something to the effect of, “now WHAT is that?”  We all then watched a very bright light moving at a relatively slow speed, a speed which would not have seemed unreasonable for conventional aircraft.  And we were in fact near a small airport. Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport was due northwest of our location about two miles.  However, several things about this light did not reconcile with what any of us could consider conventional.  As I said, we were near an airport and every night would see planes coming and going – most often travelling from east to west or west to east relative to our position. In fact there was at least one visible in another part of the sky at the time which gave us something to compare the object to. The strange light appeared above the trees due south of our position and it travelled in an arc that was mostly north and a little bit east when it eventually fell out of view against the treeline.  The first odd thing about it was the light. Rather than any blinking light or combination of red, green, yellowish, etc. it was bright white light. I would say it was about as bright as Jupiter when Jupiter is super bright. Maybe a little more intense than that. In other words, the object was brighter than any star in the sky but not enormous and blinding. It did not blink or quaver, but rather was continuously bright as it travelled. There were no other color lights as there often are on aircraft. Just one bright light, far brighter than any other aircraft.  Sound: the brightness of the light would have only seemed reasonable if the object were fairly close to us yet we heard no sound at all.  Flight path: as I said, the path was roughly south to north from an area that would have taken it over Fall Creek, Lower Creek Rd, and then northward disappearing from our vantage point as it headed toward Etna Rd. The speed, as I said, was not unusual, but the deviations from a straight line were peculiar. It followed the general path I just described but at times would “squiggle” for lack of a better word, in a way that would be wildly impossible for any conventional aircraft. I don’t know how to estimate the scale of these sudden, rapid movements. They were not large or all over the sky, but rather just as if the object were like a needle on a record or seismograph and it was bumped…it would squiggle off the path and then back on again. Another way to describe it would be to say that the object was capable of “jumping” from side to side and back again…not like floating and moving but just an occasional and erratic jump through space from one location to another (whether t! he space was covered represented 30 feet or 30 yards, I don’t know as I don’t know how far away the object was or how big) instantaneously. Each time it happened, one of the three of us would say to the others, “did you all just see that? Are we really seeing this?” So we were confirmed in knowing that we were not “imagining” what clearly was out of the ordinary. One of the witnesses was a Veteran who has spent time around all manner of aircraft, and he was quite sure he knew of nothing which could perform the “stunts” that we were seeing.  The path of travel that we could observe (which was limited due to the treeline surrounding the small meadow) probably took about 3 to 5 minutes. As it disappeared behind the trees we all debriefed and were pretty agreed that we had no logical explanation (despite the nearby small airport) for what we had seen. A few nights later (maybe 3 or 5 nights later?) two of the three of us were again in a slightly different spot at the campground, and we saw the same phenomena again. However the available viewable sky from our vantage point was very small so we could only track it for about 30 seconds, though it was very similar and travelling a similar north/northeastern trajectory.  Regarding animals: I am not suggesting a correlation, but for what its worth I heard coyotes howling and ""carrying on"" that night (it was the first and only time in my four weeks that heard them) probably 20 minutes or so after the sighting.  I would note that two of the three of us were camped in that location for four weeks, as we were part of a wilderness skills program. So we were quite familiar and acclimated to the local sights and sounds, including the typical airport traffic and patterns.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,42.41041894736843,-76.51318263157894

Around 10:30PM on 06/03/13, looking east over our house with Jupiter in view. I spotted an orange object moving approximately south very rapidly; it passed just a short distance over Jupiter.  I would compare its apparent speed to that of a low flying jet fighter except it was completely silent.  The object was bigger than a point of light and was not symmetrical; it seemed to have a longer dimension perpendicular to the direction of flight.  The object continued south and seemed to curve toward the southeast as it gradually faded from view as it approached the horizon.  I would estimate total time it was in view at around 15 seconds.  My best guess  is that it could have been a meteor passing through the atmosphere more or less parallel to the Earth's surface although it did not leave a vapor trail. What makes me doubt that the object is a fireball is that about 2 or 3 minutes after, I saw a satellite on the same path moving south to north and passing right above Jupiter.

It never twinkled or varied in brightness as it traveled very slowly across my sky view.  I stopped walking to verify that it was indeed moving and not my imagination. I noticed that it had a very unusual trajectory.  It seemed to meander a little east and west never moving in a straight line.

I started realizing something was odd when the blinking red light came in very close airspace to the star and appeared to tag along with it.  The blinking red light had a very straight trajectory and did not move like the white light did.  As I was watching this unfold the lights moved beyond my field of view blocked by my gara! ge.  As I started to back up very slowly, I started to also move to my left which exposed a huge portion of open sky that was previously blocked by my garage.

I ran back into the house to get another person to witness this, but when I returned with the witness a few moments later all that was visible was the original moving star with the blinking red light beside it still traveling north.

At approximately 2150 I went out for a walk with the dogs. I’m a habitual star gazer, and was looking at the night sky. A low and light cloud cover with intermittent gaps provided a peaceful view as I walked. At 2155 I noticed, approaching from a northwesterly direction, a bright orange point of light with a slight reddish glare. It was just above the clouds. The intensity of the light undulated and the speed was variable. This was not due to the effect of uneven cloud cover, as it was too thin in the beginning to be the cause. Even in the gaps, where the sky was clear, the color and intensity of the light undulated and the speed varied. The object also moved almost imperceptibly from left to right at irregular intervals, but kept to its trajectory toward the southeast. From the horizon (zero degrees) to approximately 130 degrees (sorry, I can’t calculate angular velocity here), it traveled for about 20 seconds before speed slowed and the light began to fade! . It almost looked as though it was ascending or stopping at the end, but as it moved over thicker cloud cover, I could not discern which. There was no flicker or winking as it faded and disappeared from view, and no noise with the exception of a civilian helicopter in the distance. I called the national UFO reporting center and was interrupted by a second light at approximately 2108.  A second call was interrupted by a third sighting, another five to eight minutes later.  In all three cases, the light appeared from over the northwest horizon and moved southeast, passing directly overhead. Again, there was no noise, slight wavering in direction, slight variation in speed, and dramatic slowing at the end as the light faded. After the third siting, and upon the advice of the gentleman who answered my call to the NRC hotline, I called the FAA Flight Service Station in San Diego, which reported light cloud cover at 1300 feet and very light winds. I called the Camp Pendleton Command Duty Officer, who said there were no exercises on the range that he was aware of. He speculated that illumination from an artillery battery could be the cause, but as a Marine myself, I know of no reason why the 11th Marines would be firing arty illumination over the civilian population more than fifteen miles to the south. (The altitude of such illumination would be much higher than seen as well -- though not as high as illumination launched or dropped by aircraft – in either case, this is definitely not what I saw.) This was not something that looked like any conventional illumination the USMC might use in training. I called the Oceanside Police Department desk sergeant, who said there were no other calls or operations in the area – and frankly I am not sure the Oceanside Police would have any reason to launch flares from a helicopter. The desk sergeant said she would have thought they were flares as well. I want to say these were flares. They looked much larger and brighter than stars, undulating, and fading, but not winking out. The cloud cover prevented a clear, sustained view for the entire arc of movement. These objects seemed to be moving much faster than any flare I have seen, including military grade flares. They were directional and not drifting, and when they faded they didn’t appear to descend at all, but either remained at altitude (above 1500 feet at least) or ascended. If they were flares, they were pretty darn good ones -- just not for ground illumination! Very strange, indeed. Unfortunately, I was unable to capture any images on my iPhone.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,33.247651756440284,-117.33448852459017

So XXX, my next-door neighbor, went outside to look at what XXXX was writing about.  Dan got very excited and called me and my husband outside, to see the lights.  They appeared in the north sky in an equilateral triangle formation, with one light at the apex of the triangle and two at the bottom.  The lights were orange in color and looked rather like flames or that they were shimmering.  All three lights hovered in the triangular pattern for a few minutes, and then it appeared that the two lights at the bottom of the triangle were growing dimmer until they finally disappeared.  I ran into the house and got a pair of binoculars, through which I viewed the remaining light. It was still a bit blurry for me, so I! gave the binoculars to my husband. He said the remaining light appeared to be an array of parallel lights numbering 4 on each side, with a white light on the top and bottom of the array, in the middle of the parallel.  The remaining light began to move slowly west in the sky for several minutes until it too, disappeared. When the lights disappeared, it looked like they were turning sideways until they were no longer visible.  At no time did any of us hear any sound and the lights did not move quickly.  There were a few distant airplanes in the sky, whose blinking running lights appeared quite different from these orange lights.

At first I thought it was a helicopter because the light lit up the tree tops and was coming towards us. I told the other guys to look.  Now this light was getting close (it was probably a quarter mile away when I first saw it ).  It was not going fast at all, Maybe 25 or 30 MPH.                                                                           ! Then the actual light comes in to view.

It goes right over us; the light actually lights up the road we’re standing on and never makes a sound.

This is hard for me write, and quite honestly I can't shake the memory of what I had saw the early morning I was driving home from my friends house.

I have seen all forms aircraft and heard all types of propulsion engines and what I had seen that early morning was nothing any human could possibly create.   It was roughly 4:15 in the morning when I left my friends house, I was driving down Washington Valley Road and it was still dark.  I was the only car on the road at this time but as I was driving I saw in the distance, not even half a mile away a shimmering light, almost like a star in the distance.   At first I thought it was a bright star and I couldn't stop staring, but as i kept driving down the road I noticed it was way to low for it be any kind of star.  My next assumption was that it was some sort of helicopter with its search lights on however odd that may be.  I was driving at a steady pace of 40 miles an hour but something possessed me to slow to down to a mere 10 miles an hour.   As i kept creeping up towards this hovering light i was maybe a mere 50 meters away and i noticed a strange thing that this bright light had no definitive body shape around it.  It was almost as if someone lit phosphorus in the sky....it was that bright.  But within milliseconds the light disappeared and the object became solid.  Strange lights began to blip around the edge of the craft in wonderful colors of blue green and green blue in that succession.  It wasn't moving fast at all, it was just slowly hovering down this road and i knew i was going to intersect it right underneath this object.   I can still see it in my mind as i drove right below it.  It looked as if it had a triangular bottom with three bright red enormous bulbs on each of the edges.   I rolled down the windows I couldn't believe my eyes what i was actually seeing.  I wanted to listen for an y signs of propulsion that allowed this massive object to hover so low to the ground and to move so slow.  But i heard nothing, the only sound that I heard was coming from the engine of my Honda Odyssey and even that 4 liter engine was not that loud at 10 miles an hour.  Silence complete silence.... This craft was in no hurry and it kept hovering past me as i drove away, or at least that's what i could remember.  And  all i could think during this entire time was god I wish i wasn't the only one to see this, so someone can back me up, so that no one can claim that I'm some washed up soldier hallucinating objects in the sky, maybe this will help with your report maybe not but please by no means discredit what i have seen.... i can still draw the object that I've seen that night and i still have dreams about it every so often recollecting the event in patches.....

These lights went on for at least another 5 minutes, and all the while, the power was cutting in and out which had to have meant there was an EMP or something like that. Another part of this experience is very noteworthy. We also noticed a floating object in approximately the southeast direction of the sky. It looked like a huge disk made of molten gold, almost like how photos of the sun look. It also had about five other smaller disks that looked the same, attached by some type of energy bolts. Just like that, it was all over.  We were all exhilarated, afraid, and amazed.  Most of us described it as ""the sky getting hax-ed.""  Ever since I've wondered if there was some type of glitch in reality as we know it, or if there's some type of technology we haven't been told about, or if we were visited by extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional beings.   Whatever it was, there had to have been amazing power behind it to do the things it did.   I've also looked for answers as to if it could have been a power outage, the Northern Lights, or meteors, and none of those explanations make sense.  I checked the news and there wasn't a single report of it. It still boggles my mind to this day, so I'm still looking for similar accounts and telling people about it whenever it comes up. I hope something other-worldly like that visits me again someday!  But if it was some low-key technology, I hope the government grows a pair and informs the public. The search continues, I guess!",2013-11-11T00:00:00,43.47350769230769,-112.00362435897435

Several Unexplained Objects Flying Low in the Night Sky.,Louisville,KY,2013-02-16T22:20:00,sphere,5 minutes,"Occurred : 2/16/2013 22:20  (Entered as : 02/16/13 22:20) Reported: 11/1/2013 11:36:23 AM 11:36 Posted: 11/11/2013 Location: Louisville, KY Shape: Sphere Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103776.html,"Several Unexplained Objects Flying Low in the Night Sky My wife and I were driving home from celebrating Valentines Day dinner in Downtown Louisville, KY on 02/16/2013.  At approximately 10:20pm while driving northeast on Hurstbourne Lane towards I-64, we witnessed at least 20 glowing red orbs in the eastern sky towards the town of Shelbyville, KY.  The sky was overcast, with high winds, low cloud cover, and probably less than ten miles visibility. I hold a private pilot certificate and have worked several years in the aviation industry.  I know these were not manned aircraft for several reasons:   1.  	The bad weather/visibility would have prevented a large group of aircraft from flying in close formation at such low altitude. 2.	  There were no position lights.  U.S. powered aircraft always have a red light on the left wing, a green light on the right wing, and a white light on the tail.  Prudent pilots will always fly with a flashing omnidirectional beacon. 3.	  The orbs of light mostly stayed stationary in the sky and did not seem affected by the high winds. Occasionally the orbs would move vertically (both up and down) at high rates of speed. The sky was overcast, these were not stars. 4.	  They were bright red orbs. The intensity was strong and the light didn’t waver. 5.	  They were in a strange formation, some were higher/lower than others. They didn’t seem to be organized in any sensible pattern either horizontally or vertically. 6.	  They suddenly disappeared.  This video is very similar to what we saw, though there were many of them all at the same time:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi-6DFe2fEg&list=PL4D428923123EF286   Possible explanations/problems with our sighting:   1.  	I thought they could have been sky lanterns (like those used in eastern cultures).  They seemed to be flying over part of the U of L extension campus. It’s possible that a group of students launched a bunch of them to celebrate Valentines Day weekend.  However, as stated before, there were really high winds that night and the orbs appeared to be relatively stationary in the sky.  The orbs also moved vertically at high rates of speed.  I have also scoured the internet to find news of celebrations involving sky lanterns.  I haven’t found anything.  We do not live in Louisville so we do not have ready access to their news outlets. 2.  	They could be helicopters flying in a rough formation.  The problem is: no position lights, it was overcast, very dark, with high winds, and really what would be the point?  I don’t see a bunch of pilots participating in a potentially dangerous flight at night with low visibility. 3.  	They could have been stars.  It was overcast, the orbs moved, and stars don’t shine red. 4.	  The only exasperating part of our experience is that I can find no evidence on the internet that anyone else witnessed what we saw!!  These were high enough in the sky that thousands of people could have potentially seen them.  It was a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. I would love to have an explanation for what we saw, or at least hear that someone else also witnessed this! If you have any information I would definitely be interested in hearing it. This was not my first experience with a UFO sighting in Louisville, KY. In 2000 I was working at Standiford Field (the Louisville Airport SDF) for the summer.  It was a warm night and the skies were crystal clear.  Several airline agents and I witnessed a large white lens shaped object seemingly floating in the night sky to the northwest.   We thought it might have been an advertising dirigible flying over Papa John’s Stadium.  However, it seemed to just suddenly appear.  We could not hear any engines (to indicate that it was powered). It was not present the night before, or the night after our sighting.  It did not move at all.   We contacted the control tower to ask what it was and they had no explanation.  There was nothing on their radar.  We had to work an inbound flight, but when we were done, the object in the sky was gone.  A possible explanation is that it might have been a large balloon tethered to the nearby stadium.  However I have several problems with this:   (1)  It was huge; it appeared to be the size of the good year blimp. (2)  It had no top: there were clear skies and its top seemed to just fade into nothing. (3)  It did not move. (4)  There was no visible advertising on the side.  It seemed to be illuminated by the city lights below. (5)  It disappeared   (6) ATC (air traffic control) did not know what it was  (7) Standiford is a busy airport, and is a major hub for UPS. Huge cargo aircraft are constantly flying in and out of SDF all of the time (especially at night).  I do not see the FAA allowing such a huge balloon (if it was a ballon) to be tethered so close to the airport, especially at night. I would love to hear more information on this one as well.  We do not live in Louisville, but we do live in another major city nearby.  I find it ironic that both of my sightings have been in Louisville.  I’m still very skeptical, but just a little excited too.  I hope this information helps in some way.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,38.21121446765155,-85.68918456444217

Afternoon jog, roughly 3-3:30 pm, late March, 2013. Sunny day, blue skies, scattered white puffy clouds. I am a GA pilot, always looking at the sky.  I fortuitously noticed a reflective stationary sphere, silver or white, off towards the NE.   I first thought it was a balloon, but the day was breezy, this thing was stationary, and was clearly not a balloon.  Distance and size tough to assess, as there was no nearby object to serve as a basis for comparison.   In any event, I observed the object for 10-15 minutes, and recorded three short video clips using my iphone.   I knew it was not a balloon, but also knew that an iphone video clip of a stationary spherical object would not convince anyone otherwise, so I never planned to do anything with the video.  Nonetheless, I shared the video clips with friends and family; this is where it gets interesting.   My sister-in-law, who was not present at the sighting, noticed a streaking flash across the screen on one of the video clips.   I uploaded the iphone video onto my computer, and viewed the video as close to frame by frame as I could (simpy hit play and then pause as quickly as I could).  At the 27 second mark, you can see a clearly non-artifactual object (possibly up to four onjects) moving at an incredible speed from right to left across the screen.  Not sure the speed, but it had to be several thousand miles an hr.  The objects are not readily evident on the video in real time, other than as a terribly brief streak/flash on the video; the kind of thing one barely perceives.  The best analogy is almost like the perception of very faint stars using one's peripheral vision; you know they are there, but you can't really get enough visual info to process the data. Incidentally, no noise whatsoever was heard. If desired, I can provide GPS coordinates and the video clip of interest. My backgound: I am a physician. I am also a GA pilot, and although no expert on aircraft identification, I know this was not a balloon, and I know these were aircraft unlike anything I have ever seen.

Another astronomy instructor, 2 more police officers and several students observed the object as it moved from zenith to the west.  It covered about 25 angular degrees in the span of about 15 minutes.  We took photographs of the object with cell phone cameras through the telescope. While watching the object, an officer saw another, similar object coming in from the east, at about the same magnitude brightness.  The object moved westward, until it was at zenith overhead and then continued west.  The time it took to travel from an altitude of about 80 degrees to zenith was about 10 minutes.  We observed this object under same magnification, and saw a silvery disc, with the same “lights” along the same quadrant. Both objects left our view, passing westward.  The entire viewing time was about 1.5 hours. Our working hypothesis is that we saw Mylar balloons, or weather balloons, with the sunlight reflecting off the “dimples” along the edge of the balloon.

They didn't appear to be moving real fast but when I looked at the amount of ground they covered they had to be moving fast.  They traveled south probably three minutes.  They then turned east, that's when the lights faded and they disappeared.  They all traveled in the same path, so couldn't be lanterns that people talk about.  They looked fairly close to us, guessing 5-8 miles, but when they turned you could see they were very far away.  I think the lights were so bright it made them! look closer than they really were.

PD)) SIGHTING # 23 – August 9 , 2013 –   10th SIGHTING OF A “UGO” AND 8th SIGHTING OF MANY UFO “FIREBALLS”  This is a continuation of my other sightings on this night.  As I mentioned in my previous report (#22), I and 3 fishermen saw a dim Unidentified Glowing Object (UGO) at my “due west” location where I and others have seen it before.  The 2 other locations where this “city on the horizon” is consistently seen are northwest of my location, and very near the shoreline of Sanibel Island at Clam Bayou (no, it is not swamp gas).  I had asked the fishermen if they had seen any unusual lights before while shark fishing at this or any other location and they said no.  I told them that I had seen much and that I was making reports to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) and UFO Hunters, in addition to MUFON, and if they did see anything, to make a report to NUFORC or UFO Hunters because those were the easiest reporting forms.  Shortly after I pointed out the UGO to the fishermen at 9:45 p.m., I saw another one of the amber/orange UFO “fireballs,” straight up the beach from us, just off shore of what I would guess to be Cayo Costa Island, to the NNW.  The UFO just “came on” about 3 finger widths above the horizon, slowly drifted for about 4 minutes to the west over the Gulf of Mexico, maybe 2 to 3 miles off shore, and then just dimmed off.  I and the fishermen were amazed.  Although the UGO remained relatively dim, this glow went on and off from when I first saw it and pointed it out to the fishermen, until I left at 11:00 p.m.  To my amazement, one of the fishermen made a report of it and more “fireballs” the next day (8/10/13) to UFO Hunters.  Unfortunately, their report was rather incomplete, as I found out the following Friday night when they were at the beach fishing again, and we could discuss what they saw in detail.  Here’s what they saw for the following 3 hours after I left the beach at 11:00 p.m. that night.  They saw another orange-redish fireball come on the same location I pointed out the one seen earlier, and then a second right after.  These two objects went quickly west out to sea and then southerly to where they were just about straight in front of them, stopped, and changed direction, going back to where they started from, probably just off shore of Cayo Costa where all the activity was taking place previously.  Then they just went out.  A while later, they saw another of the redish-orange fireballs come on in front of them, and then another to the NW (right) of them.  These UFOs basically hovered in the same position, occasionally going on and off.  I asked them if they went on and off like on a dimmer switch and they said no – just on and off.  A while later, they were looking at the “city on the horizon” glow as they called it, when they got a strike on one of their shark rods furthest to their right.  They missed the hook set and came back to where they were sitting, “no more than 2 minutes later” they stressed, to be amazed that the UGO had moved some 40 degrees on the horizon to the south!  They were really excited about it when they were talking to me. We both guesstimated that the light had moved at least 25 miles, if not more.  Shortly after that the light went out.  From around midnight to 2 a.m., the guys said they saw the mostly red and orange-red fireballs at least 6 times, with up to 4 visible at one time.  The night I saw them again (8/16/13), nothing unusual was observed, which in and of itself seemed unusual.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

I trained my binoculars on it and saw what I first thought were 2 airplane headlights because that’s how close they were together, slowly strobing, about 2 finger widths above the horizon, and maybe a mile off shore of Sanibel Island, around 4 miles distant.  But the color of the lights was wrong – they were a “crystalline” blue-white, about 50/50 blue and white.  There were no red or green navigation lights.  I watched it through my binocs as it hovered in one place for several minutes, when the light on the right started it started to “tilt” upwards.  It would have been like a plane coming straight at me (which I still thought it could be) making an extremely sharp bank to its right, which would have been toward the east, away from the Gulf.  But it remained in position, with the lights getting almost vertical to each other, but not quite.  After around 5 minutes of being in this position, it started coming toward me and to the NW.  When it got to the SW of me and became visible  to the naked eye, I pointed it out to the fishermen.  We then watched it as it headed toward the NNW, about 3 to 4 miles off shore and 45 degrees above the horizon.  It really started picking up speed when it got about in front of us over the gulf, and moved at least 2 or 3 times the speed of an aircraft, and then just went out of sight because it became so far away.

It was unusual because I thought it was an airplane with its landing lights on, but I've never seen orange landing lights on an aircraft, they are always white.  But here is the really strange part, it was followed by another nineteen similar, orange lights “craft” flying silently in the same west to east direction, all following about the same course.  They were spaced at about 90 second intervals.  There was no sound associated with them.   They flew over the house next door and kept going until they disappeared between the houses across the street. All of this happened over a ten to fifteen minute period.  We followed each one until it disappeared, some behind the trees; others seem to just blink off after they passed us.  We saw no interactions between the craft. I didn't have a camera, but grabbed some binoculars.  I saw nothing but the orange lights.  Some appeared to have a bright white core.  There was no sign of a solid craft that would have been visible with reflected light; or the usual navigation lights on an aircraft (red, green, white).  There were certainly no strobe lights which I see all the time on aircraft flying in the area. While we were seeing the lights, an airplane, with its bright white landing light on, flew in the area, but it looked like it was at a higher altitude and much farther away. The next night, August 10th, 2013, we were at a concert in Rockport, MA, about three miles in a straight line from the first sighting.  It was about 9 PM.  We went outdoors to watch an impending fireworks display on the other side of Sandy Bay.  The Bay was filled with stationary boats waiting for the fireworks.   Over the next fifteen minutes, we saw five more of the same glowing orange light objects performing in the same way, this time spaced about three minutes apart.  That is, they were flying low, one at a time, following the exact same course as the previous one, this time about North to South.  In this sighting, we could see where they first came into view.  They originated low on the other side of the Bay, implying that they were at a very low altitude.   They flew overhead and to our right until they disappeared behind the buildings in back of us on Rockport’s Main Street. We were surrounded by about ten to fifteen people who were also waiting for the fireworks.   No one appeared to notice the orange lights.  If we hadn't seen the same objects the night before, we probably wouldn't have paid attention either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Looking through the windshield, I saw something move rapidly in a circular motion and it vanished quickly.  As a result, I thought I was looking at a remote control model airplane or a bird.  The object was very dark against a fairly bright sky, below a scattered overcast. The object appeared to be very low over the distance treetops when in view, but momentarily vanished and I thought it went down below the tree line or the horizon.  I could not determine how far the object was laterally, from my position.  There was nothing behind it that it crossed to get a distance estimate. I looked down to my sandwich and when I looked back up to the same location, (which was to my northwest), I saw an object, roughly spherical in shape, very dark, which began an immediate vertical ascent. What put me into a sudden ""What the hell"" moment was that the object was moving straight up and pretty fast.  I leaned down toward the dash and crooked my neck to watch the sphere continue its vertical ascent as it kept going until it reached what appeared to be the cloud base (the cloud ceiling). At that moment, the object then stopped moving and held stationary at the cloud base.  It remained stationary for approximately 2 minutes.  It could have been moving slowly to the right, or perhaps the clouds were moving slowly to the left, but after about two minutes, the object merged into the cloud above it and became obscured. At its highest observed altitude (as it moved into the cloud), the object could be distinguished as a spherical shape, a black dot at this point. As I observed the object , I was so captivated by what I was seeing that I failed to do a simple time count as it ascended; but the total time from near ground level to the cloud base at 25,000 ft. was not more than 3 minutes maximum, but could have been as little as 30 seconds. Following the event, I placed phone calls to the nearby Forest Park administrative office as well as a local university's science departments and inquired if any kind of balloon had been launched. All inquiries came of negative. I inquired into how to find the accurate cloud ceiling for the date and time of the sighting and was referred to the National Weather Service where I found the Three Day Weather records and June 4, 2013, data established the cloud ceiling at OVC250, which means overcast at 25,000 Feet, and that matched what I observed. Using a speed and time calculator, I found the following possible indicated speeds of the object.  The following speeds are based on three estimated times for the object to travel from near ground level to 25,000 feet. 30 seconds, 1, 2, and 3 minutes. 3 Minutes: 94.69 MPH  2 Minutes: 142.04 MPH  1 Minute: 284.09 MPH 30 Seconds: 568.18 MPH   Having seen a variety of balloons in the air, I’ve never seen a balloon ascend at these rates of speed, and although I cannot state exactly “what” this object was, it must have possessed considerable size because I was able to observe the object at the cloud ceiling, or 25,000 feet.

As a big fan of aircraft, I tend to check for traffic in the sky.  At 17:35, I looked up and noticed two white craft, one behind the other and slightly to the starboard side of the leading craft.  At first glance the two craft looked military.  Then I noticed how they looked more rounded at the nose which then made me think that they were drones.  This made a lot of sense because the two craft were moving fast relative their altitude.  If they were at a higher elevation then their airspeed would have been pushing supersonic and there were no subsequent sonic booms.  I estimate that these two craft were around 1000 - 1200 feet.  They were traveling from north to south near the I-65 corridor.  The sky was mostly clear, warm, humid, around 85 degrees with a light SE wind.  The two crafts were out of view in under fifteen seconds.  I made a point to try to listen to the noise produced by these craft.  Am! idst some background traffic and neighborhood noise, I could hear a slight whine that would seem to be associated with a turboprop engine, but much quieter.  The event ended and I thought that I had witnessed my first domestic drone flights- nothing more.  Only until a few minutes ago did I think that I ""only saw two drones"".  Media outlets in Huntsville, AL are now reporting a mysterious radar ""blob"" echo that appeared on multiple radar products over the Huntsville area this afternoon, exactly over the northwest corner of Redstone Arsenal.

I then looked back to see at least two red lights and one white light in the triangular formation. I continued to look as it stood still for 5-10 seconds and then moved up and over until it had moved it was upside down, 180 degrees. We then entered the roundabout and lost sight of the lights.  Then again heading up Widerson street from Hasting River Drive I spotted the lights in the same formation, lower and closer to us, almost as if following behind us, motionless for 10-15 seconds before moving slightly closer. Panic kicked in so my female room mate and I stopped looking.  We arrived home, in the area of Widerson street, calmed down and asked my male room mate who was driving the car if he had seen it. He didn't for the obvious reason. 5-10 minutes past from arriving home and my female room mate peered out the curtain of a window facing west and again the triangle patterned lights where there, not more than 75 meters away hovering low, this time my female room mate, my male room mate and I saw it, although our other male room mate was in the room but did not see the UFO. It stayed motionless in the sky and by the time I got out my phone to capture the UFO on camera it had vanished.  My female room mate believe that from what she saw the UFO may have been bell shaped but she could not see the top. My male room mate and I cannot describe the UFO with any further accuracy than the three lights and their formation. One thing all three of us agree on is that the UFO made NO sound. Unfortunately my female room mate and I forgot to bring our phones in the car and my room mate who was driving didn't think to pass his phone to my female room mate or I.  All three of us have spiritual beliefs close to spiritist. We have recently started a non-processed foods diet and we all have been making major life/career decisions the last few weeks. I meditate daily and recently have been researching zero point energy generators as well as electromagnetic gravity modifying devices and space crafts. When meditating I often ask guidance in the workings of these devices. I have also been creating 'energy centers' in our home to amplify our bio-electromagnetic fields (some people may not know anything about energy centers etc so just skip that if you want.)  The night before we witnessed the UFO I had an extremely lucid dream in which I was in a house, white light pored in from the windows and a tall and 'lanky' grey being entered the room. I felt no fear just excitement and curiosity as it approached. It seemed to communicate without physical sound. I conversed with it for what seemed like hours before it left. The dream then speed forwards to the next night. My mother was now also in the house with me as the same thing happened with the light poring in the windows. My mother was scared for my safety as I walked outside into the light. Nothing dramatic happened, once more I conversed with the same entity outside  and I asked my mother to come out side and meet this being, whom I felt I had known for a long time before meeting.  As mad as this dream sounds I had to include it into this description as I feel it may be significantly related to the UFO sighting. I would like to ask if the person who reads this, weather or not it is put on the website database, could post their thoughts on the website and maybe any concerns you may have to convey about the intentions of the entities for which the UFO may be a part of.  From what I gather, it seemed as if the UFO was looking for something, or possibly following after something bellow.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,,

PD)) SIGHTING # 22 – August 9 , 2013 – EXTRAORDINARY SIGHTING OF SILVER-GOLD, GLOWING FOOTBALL SHAPED UFOS APPARENTLY COMING OUT OF THE GULF AND MERGING TOGETHER, AND 9TH SIGHTING OF A “UGO” I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:35 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The beach here runs NNW to SSE.  The weather was clear and calm, with some clouds well past the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  Although this was my third and last sighting of the night, it was so exciting that I will report it first.  When I first arrived at my skywatch site, I saw the same UGO at the same “due west” location I and others had seen it at before.  I pointed out the UGO to some shark fishermen on the beach where I was, and they could see it too, even though it was somewhat dim.  Other than the UGO, nothing else was happening so I walked up to the rock jetty about 150 yards to the south, to see what I would see down toward my friends house on Sanibel, where we had seem many UFOs and UGOs before.  I saw nothing down there, and after a while I had walked just about all the way back to the shark fishermen, when at around 10:30 I saw a yellowish light on the horizon with my naked eye, about a mile off shore of North Captiva.  I looked at the light through my binoculars and could clearly see two dull-silver/goldish, glowing, clearly defined, oblong-football shaped UFOs, one above the other, with the bottom one clearly visible right on the water’s surface, apparently having just come out of the water!!  The craft were not full football shaped, nor were they fully oblong.  Maybe more like an oblong with a bulge in the middle.  I think that my color description is a good one; it’s also the first color that come to mind.  I figured it was coming out of the water because when I first saw it, compared to the one above it, it was much smaller and “blob-like,” and then almost instantly got bigger and gained an identifiable shape.  It was the same shape, size and color of the one above it.  I feel comfortable estimating that it was no more than 4 miles away from me, and that the clearly defined craft were no more than 100 feet long, and perhaps 40 or 50 feet tall.  The surface of the craft was well defined! , and its skin gave them their glow and color.  There were no other lights.  Very important here is what really struck me about the shape and color of these craft, was their possible resemblance to what my friend saw a couple of weeks earlier, not more than a half mile away from her house – see Sighting #17.  Her description of the craft could very well be better than mine simply because of the distance at which I saw it/them, and the closeness at which se saw them, at a half mile or less.  The bright white craft with “yellowish edging” that she described is very similar to my color interpretation of a a craft that was dull-silver and goldish.  This there is at least some reason that these two craft could be of the same class.  After no more than one minute, the craft below began to rise, while the one above remained stationary.  The craft were approximately 5 widths apart.  The craft ascended the 5 widths in about 15 seconds, appeared to become one with the craft above because it looked like there was a single craft but twice as wide, and then just merged with the one above!!  I figured that they merged because after it happened I could only see one well defined craft.  Then after 30 seconds or so, another craft just emerged from the Gulf and stayed on or very near the water’s surface for 15 or 20 seconds before it too ascended and merged with the craft above, which remained in place during the entire event.  Once this second craft merged with the one above, they just disappeared!!  I went and told the fishermen what I had just seen, and they were just as stunned as I was!  Wow!  I continued to look back and forth across the horizon of the Gulf, and no more than 5 minutes later I saw with my naked eye the same kind of oblong, whitish/yellow/gold light to the south of me, just off of the end of the rock jetty at Blind Pass, and maybe 3 or so miles to the SSW of me, perhaps a mile or so off of my friend house.  This is the first time I’d seen this colored light down there for quite some time.  I had just brought my binocs up and got it in focus to see that it was the same kind of “double craft” - one above the other – that I’d just seen to the north, when a car pulled into the parking lot at Turner’s Beach facing toward the southern Gulf, and “accidentally” shined it lights on it, and then it just disappeared. Now things get a more interesting.  When I started writing up this report it brought to mind my 4th sighting, during which I was able to get a photograph of 4 of the amber fireball lights, where I thought I saw only one.  As I wrote in that report, I thought that the object was very near the water because I could see what I thought was a reflection of it on the water.  But now that I think about it, in light of what I’d just watched to the north off of Cayo Costa, and what I had just seen, I now have to think that what saw back then was most likely what I’d just witnessed to the north!  It was not a reflection underneath of it, it was another craft coming out of the water!  Further rationale:  back during my 4th sighting, it took about a minute from the time when I decided to take a picture of the amber light, to when I dug my camera out of the bag and set it up to take a picture.  I know with certainty that there was only one light out there before I started taking photos (only 1 of 3 came out), so the only thing I can think of is that the 3 additional craft that came out in the photograph had just come out of the water!  Where else could they have come from?  If anyone would have suggested such a t thing to me back then, I would have thought that they were crazy!!  I do remember that I was sure glad I took the photos, because very shortly after I took the photos the lights were gone.  Something special really does seem to be going on out here, and I’m now beginning to think that it may have to do with one or more underwater “bases.”",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

I walked into the woods and when I came back all 6 of us saw 4 amber lights in the sky.  They appeared to be in the shape of a trapezoid, but then shifted in a triangle formation, with 2 of the lights on the bottom coming together.  Shortly after, the 2 lights on the left faded out, followed by the other 2 on the right.   We have video of it as it has already been posted on Facebook and shared on my Facebook account.  I believe that if I had brought an infrared camera I may have been able to see the 4 lights as I believe they may be boosters.  The technology on this thing was amazing though.  The the way it moved showed it had anti-inertia technology.   I just wanted to report this information and hope that it gets passed on to Bigelow Aerospace for review.   I've noticed in other UFO reports and videos that a lot of them represent a similar shape, the triangle.  I also know that that symbol has been seen on many artifacts found all over the world that are 10,000-12,000 years old.   If you look in the video, it looks like there is a very faint beam connecting the 2 lights with each other on the left and a separate beam on the right pair as well.   I spoke with another witness from near by and determined from the direction she was looking and the location she was looking from that it was about 400 yards away.

Very suddenly, and almost out of nowhere, a very large object with blue lights and one red light came silently across the sky from the south and seemingly in slow motion, (but it happened fast) descended down to the east approximately 30-50 feet ….this was happening roughly 100 - 125 feet in front of me. It was huge and didn’t make noise …nor did it seem to make the trees that it was situated among move. It seemed to have a black v shaped body but the lights were so intense, big and bright that I can not be 100% clear on that.  It  came down, stopped for a few brief seconds, seemed to flash a red light and then left. (it was illuminated by blue lights the entire time ….a beautiful blue like I’ve never seen. Different somehow but I can not tell you how. Right before the red light became more apparent, the blue lights seemed to have deepened or become more intense and large.  The red light seemed to be in the center and  also seemed to “flash” one time as if it had some sort of purpose in doing so, right before it took off. Everything seemed very sudden but yet happening in slow motion until the craft suddenly gained altitude and distance very quickly. Almost in the blink of an eye and heading east. I do not know why, but at this moment I didn’t think to much of it. The impact of what I had just seen hadn’t quite “registered” yet. I began to look up into the sky directly after this object left and noticed 2 very bright objects. Approximately 12-16,000 feet altitude.  One to the east and one to the south.  The white light of these 2 objects seemed to flicker very fast but both objects also had red light on them …every few seconds I could see a red light that, sometimes, seemed to turn more of an orange and then what appeared to be “beams” of white light coming down from them.  The one positioned in the east seemed to be much more active as it was bobbing up and down and sideways erratically, sometimes stopping for a small portion of time, and then would disappear,.  Maybe behind a cloud or just all on its own . I say “maybe” behind a cloud because it was lightly cloudy.  However, I could not tell if it was going behind the cloud or just disappearing all on its own only to reappear again.   The one positioned in the south seemed to have all of the same features and light properties of the one in the east but! wasn’t moving around as much.  Although, in order to keep my eyes on one, I had to then turn them away from the other. I watched both objects very curiously for approximately 3-5 minutes, at which time I began to feel uneasy and came back inside. I came inside, sat down and that’s when I  started to really question what I had just seen. Thinking about it now it is very surreal and hard to process yet very vivid.  As I sat and questioned what I had just seen I suddenly wanted to go back outside to see if they were still in the sky. I walked out on the porch again and immediately saw, approaching from the south, something flying much faster than an airplane, making no noise, (not that I could hear or recognize) and all lit up in red. I would approximate the altitude of this red flying object to be 8,000 feet.  It seemed to be shaped like a remote controlled helicopter but was hard to make out because it was all lit up red and parts of it were flashing VERY fast.  Like a strobe light.  I watched it fly to the east for roughly 40 seconds before feeling uneasy again and stepping back inside where I stayed until bed time. The sequence of these sightings and events took place in an approximate 20 minute time frame. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There is an oak tree in the front yard ninety feet away from the house that stands approximately one hundred feet tall.  As I was looking up into the southern sky, a vehicle, craft or vessel began to materialize approximately twenty feet above the oak tree.  I could not believe what I was seeing, but I immediately knew that I was looking at something that was not of earth origin.  This vessel was similar in shape and size to a B2 Stealth Bomber and appeared to be uncloaking or materializing into the earth’s atmosphere from another place or time.  As the vessel was becoming visible, the image of the craft was very wavy and distorted, like heat waves from the highway on a hot summer day.  For those of you that have watched Star Trek, when the Klingon War Ship begins to uncloak, that is exactly how this thing looked when it began to appear above the tree.   It took approximately ten seconds, from the time of entry, for the vehicle to become a solid object, at which time it began to move slowly just above the tree line, in a southwesterly direction towards a ridge in the distance.  The vehicle appeared to be matt black with no external engines, maneuvering at approximately ten miles per hour, in total silence.  From the rear of the craft, a round soft white glow was visible from each wing, which appeared to be the propulsion system.  The glow was a soft white, similar to that of a florescent bulb in a kitchen or bathroom, but had the appearance of some form of energy or plasma. As the vessel moved slowly through the night sky, I could see a strobing red light on the left wing and a green one on the right.  The pulse width of the strobing was much slower than that of a jet or airplane and the colors were somewhat different from the reds and greens that we are familiar with.  At a glance or from a distance, the vehicle would appear to be just another aircraft in the night sky, but seeing it up close and personal is a totally different experience.  I observed the object until it went behind the ridge to the south and was no longer visible.  I immediately went outside with binoculars in hand, to the lower part of my driveway just below the oak tree, hoping to see the vessel again.  I knew that I had just witnessed something very special, that to me was a great privilege and most likely, a once in a lifetime thing.  I stayed outside scanning the ridge hoping to see the object once more.  After waiting for about five minutes, sure enough, it reappeared, but at a much greater distance over the southeastern part of the ridge.  I knew it was the same vehicle from the soft glowing fields of energy being emitted from the wings of the craft.  The vehicle began to accelerate toward the east at an unbelievable speed and was out of sight in less than a second.  Due to this sighting, I have been looking up for five years now, hoping to catch a glimpse of another extraterrestrial ship traveling through our night skies. I am retired now, in my sixties, with a background in automotive electrical and emission controls. I do not drink alcohol or use drugs.  My mind is good and I do not have a wild or vivid imagination.  I do however have an open mind and am not naive enough to believe that we on earth are the only form of intelligent life in the entire universe.  I have no idea as to the technology that would allow a ship or vessel to materialize into the earth’s atmosphere in such a way, but I promise you, every word of this report is true. Some of you may ask why I waited five years to post this information.  As most of you well know, the subject of UFOs is a very sensitive area and sometimes ridiculed.  For this reason, I made the decision to keep this information to myself.   I sometimes listen to Coast To Coast AM and had just recently heard the proprietor of this website mention that someone had reported a triangle shaped craft over their residence in a town that is ten minutes east of my location.  After hearing this, I decided to post this information.  From my understanding, this event took place in the late evening or night hours of August 30, 2013.  I have been checking the website daily for an update, in hopes of reading that report.   I would like to thank everyone involved in the development and creation of NUFORC, which has given me the opportunity to share this wonderful and truly amazing experience.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,36.5268,-82.376

Hey I saw the blue beam space craft in oct of 2008, I drew a picture of it in photoshop and have images of the same ship on the same time frame caught in a still shot on live video. It made a left turn and shot twice, the brightness of the flash illuminated up the entire inside of the craft. I am sorry I never reported this, I only thought... Hmm.... so they do exist. I have come to learn more about them. they come from the Ulosha, or Nebula behind the orions belt. they will be coming back if God calls them to. There is no blue beam, it will be all wicked. only purple and a blue at the bottom. If they shoot it in the atmosphere, the beam would split up a bit but nothing will stop it. I got images to display, please email me at Billyaguilar1@yahoo.com Please call me at 760 590 0840 as they have also sent other things to the earth.

I have a story for you.  It was so huge and headed west to east about 20 minutes before we hit the Oklahoma border.  We were coming home from Nebraska off on vacation.  It was real windy that day and we had two layers of clouds one close and the other was where this was traveling.   Looked like the moon shape and whiter than the whitest cloud around.  It was so big you could fill it with the size of our jets at the chem trail distance.  It was moving like it was darting in and out of the clouds not to be seen but within 45 sec I caught it a few times by itself.  In the middle of the day sun was to the west clouds coming from south to north and it was moving west to east.  During the day ???  I know what I saw.  The depth was not seen just a straight on shot.  I could describe this better on the phone,2013-09-30T00:00:00,32.9762,-96.5953

I first need to mention here so that latter on something I'm going to say will be understood I live in a rural area of Putnam county with plenty of wild life including owls in which a few weeks prior to this incident I saw an owl that had landed in the grass on the side of the road around the corner leading out of my circle of a neighborhood. Now to the sighting on or about the 23rd of April I went for a nightly walk to the marina on the lake where I live upon returning to my circle at about 11:15(+/-), instead of turning directly to the left to return to my home I decided I would walk around the full circle then return to my home. Directly to the west in which was the direction I was facing and walking toward I could see that a very light cloud front was heading to the north east to my left was what I remember was a full moon where I was,was still clear I got within ten foot of the driveway of the second house in my circle and saw a shadow coming from my left it was at this point that the first thing came to my mind ""I was being swooped on by an owl"" or so I thought I proceeded to duck down and was looking up. As I looked up I expected to see the wings of an owl instead I saw what I can only describe as a gigantic triangle craft moving quite fast due west in the direction I was walking towards this craft had no lights at first I thought it hadn't made any sound but reflecting on it it actually made a sound like aluminum foil being vibrated not a rattle but like aluminum vibrating from sound waves,like how they tune the front and back plates of a violin. I could tell this craft was just slightly above the oncoming cloud front that was moving in I was so glued on it before it got to the clouds that I cant say if it was blocking out the stars I would have to assume it was this happened so fast but one thing struck me then as it does now I saw nothing out of my peripheral vision on my left side. But that's where I saw the initial shadow come from this means something passed directly in front of the moon during this event either this craft was coming in from a south westerly direction made a sharp turn to fly right over my head just to travel due west or there were tow of these objects and I only saw one,I will say this from just looking out my front door at the clouds as high as this object was I'd say you could land about eight 747 jets on top of it and likely still have room for more that is not an over estimate! I did not make an official report through MUFON at the time of this sighting I was being called daily by the producers of a UFO related T.V. series I was out and out asked to lie of film and say that I had witnessed a UFO land in a field and create the circle I'd found I at that point lost faith in objective investigations into UFO related sightings at that point. I've since witnessed at least 40 other events on and off since this sighting but nothing as close as this event,it was only after I had walk around my circle here that I noticed air traffic again it was almost as if it was planned to be this way as I saw no jets when this object was making its way over my head and off to the west my only question is with it being a moon lit night how did this thing go un-noticed because this was not a small object?",2013-09-30T00:00:00,39.6559,-86.7554

I was fixated on two lights in the sky in particular when they started moving.  Initially, I thought that they were planes, but one object started to glow very brightly with white light.  These objects were travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour.  The object closest to the atmosphere started to dissipate and finally vanished.  The second object was still bright at this point but started to get dim.  Once it dimmed it came to an immediate halt, waited a second or two, and shot off toward space, with seemingly dull red ""taillights"" on what i assume was the back of the craft.

Located notes now indicate that the sighting very possibly took place on a different Delta flight three days later (7/26/11).  Of course I apologize for any confusion from the prior report and, as always, have provided my name an contact info to NUFORC just in case any further clarification may assist.

I have since located the item which states ""Approx. 7:15pm orb travels south off right wing of plane...7/26/11.""  At first when I found this note (Delta napkin), I assumed I must have written the incorrect date on it because I thought the only flights on that trip's itinerary which included a northerly path were the ones on 7/23/11, when I flew from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City and from Salt Lake City to Denver (as originally reported).  In addition, I assumed that my 7/26 flight was a nonstop from Denver to New York (predominantly an eastbound path, not northbound as the sighting details called for). However, after locating the napkin, and contacting the airline again to confirm the details of my flights I learned that I did not take a nonstop flight on 7/26/11.  In fact, on that day, I flew from Denver to Atlanta and from Atlanta to Denver (flight 786 which was scheduled to depart Atlanta at 5:35pm with a typical estimated flight time of 2 hours and 22 minutes, which means the likely estimated landing time was 7:57pm). As such on Delta flight 786, on 7/26/11, when flying north from Atlanta to La Guardia, it would have been very possible for the sighting to have taken place at 7:15pm, as noted on the napkin. Though I still cannot be 100% sure if the sighting took place on 7/23 or 7/26, I am now more confident that the sighting described below actually took place on 7/26/11. Note that I discovered another NUFORC sighting report for 7/26/11, from a couple, who also claimed to see a UFO while flying on a different Delta flight.  Perhaps just a coincidence but very intriguing. Below is my original report text with corrections provided in brackets.  ==========================================================================  [EASTERN] U.S.: Metal / gray sphere seen during commercial flight  On [TUESDAY, JULY 26, 2011], I traveled from [DENVER, COLORADO TO ATLANTA, GEORGIA AND FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA TO NYC (LA GUARDIA)].  Delta flight [#1316] was scheduled to [DEPART DENVER AT 11:45AM]. Following the layover [IN ATLANTA], [DELTA] flight [#786] was scheduled to depart [ATLANTA AT 5:35 PM---A DELTA REPRESENTATIVE CONFIRMED THAT THE ESTIMATED FLIGHT TIME WOULD BE 2 HOURS AND 22 MINUTES, OR AN ARRIVAL IN NYC OF 7:57PM].  During [FLIGHT #786 FROM ATLANTA TO NEW YORK] [(ACCORDING TO the note I made on THE flight)] I looked out of the right side of the plane (I had a window seat). Traveling in the opposite direction of the plane, at an altitude a bit lower than the plane, and at a distance of approximately 120 - 250 meters away, I clearly observed a gray metal sphere.  The object had a diameter that was approximately the same as an exercise ball (or about 2.5 or 3.5 feet). I was immediately shaken /startled at how close this sphere was to the airplane.  I thought to myself that this object, and it was clearly an object, could have been a severe threat had it collided with our aircraft. I discussed it with nobody as (1) it was gone in an instant and (2) I was concerned that a report may draw alarm by the passengers or airline crew, even though the object harmlessly passed by.  I do not know if other passengers or crew saw the object. However, I did imagine that others who looked out the window would have likely seen it.  Again it was moving in the opposite direction of the plane at a trajectory that was roughly parallel to our travel path. So, it is difficult to approximate the speed of the object as both the plane and the sphere were both in motion.  There are no photos or video of this event, as I could not react quickly enough.  [AS NOTED ABOVE, THE LOCATED NOTE NOW MAKES IT VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE SIGHTING, ORIGINALLY THOUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON 7/23/11, MAY HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON 7/26/11].  This [CORRECTION] is [AN UPDATE TO] my sixth UFO sighting report to NUFORC. The other five were for sightings that took place on:  1. 2/6/97 (Mesa, AZ)---Close up triangle. Original report was updated with map.  2. 4/26/09 (Brooklyn, NY)---Orb  3. 5/14/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Lights  4. 7/10/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Brilliant light / orb  5. 7/30/12 (Brooklyn, NY)---Orb  A later (7th report) was recently filed for a sighting on 8/21/13 (Brooklyn, NY)---Light",2013-09-30T00:00:00,,

I was using 10x32 binoculars viewing the moon from a large open window when I noticed what looked like a streak in the southern area of the moon, rather below the moon and to the right. I thought it may have just been nothing, it was still very much daylight out, and I barely saw anything but possible movement.  The sky was mostly clear. Within 10 seconds or so another movement, more like streak, drew my attention and binocular focus to the area East almost North East of the moon.  I was still not able to identify what I saw because of  high speed and small area.  But within 15 seconds or so I saw a bright thin blue streak traveling at about a 45 degree downward NE to SW angle “ / ” in the center of the binocular circle.  The streak was short in length leaving no trail, traveling a seeming! distance of the width of the moon visible in the blue sky.  The object streaked toward the East part of the moon and vanished within just a range of around or less than a No. 2 pencil width if I were to draw to size what we saw (which we have). I shouted to my wife who was nearby that “I just saw a shooting star! I mean a meteor! It was a bright blue streak..” Were the first descriptions I could give, as I maintained watching the area the object vanished in with binoculars.  In no less than 15 seconds an object appeared in the place where the blue streak ended.  The object, as best as I can describe, was a twinkling multiple color silvery object that resembled a star in nature.  The center was shimmering whitish silver.  The size of the object through binoculars was a magnitude around that of the brightest star.  I had a small moment of, I guess adrenaline and panic where at that time I called my wife over trying to describe the object and show her the object through the binoculars.  I do not have 20/20 vision, but I do not need the aid of glasses, and the object was just barely visible to the naked eye, with intermittent and often twinkling that made the object distinguishingly visible.  My wife could quickly spot the ob! ject which maintained its position very close to the moon, as if on the outskirts of an invisible atmosphere. We observed the object passing the binoculars back and forth as I tried to record with a camera phone at one point, but it couldn’t pick anything up, even tried to have the camera lens to lens with the binoculars with no success.  The object began to traverse very slowly downward around the bottom of the moon twinkling and shimmering, but would also fade for short times.  It was easy to track as it traveled the same slow speed.  As the object traveled precisely maintaining the same distance from the moon as when it first appeared, the object made a full travel from the Eastern part of the moon to the Western side where it stopped and sat exactly at the West center side of the moon.  Also during this time I noticed a couple other streaks to the South of the moon while my wife used the binoculars, the streaks were similar to the second one I saw at the beginning of the event. As the object was making it’s final approach where it stopped at the West side of the moon, it began to change.  The object was a very bright magnitude now with four other objects appearing, very similar in physical description, just smaller objects.  The four smaller objects appeared in a very close range of the first object, as if the smaller objects were attached or on a grid.  The objects never traveled away from the first or appeared to move independently.  The four objects appeared and sat around the first object, maintaining direct North South East West positions like a compass or cross “ + “ but not connected by any visible means. The five objects did not move for approximately five minutes, other than twinkling and shimmering, with the center and original object being the largest. The time was about 6:26PM when the object faded away. I have not been able to find anything on the internet about this event, at all. The only close possibility is a picture on the internet from Sydney, Australia. But the only similarities are the date and appearance of objects’ distance from the moon in this picture may be somewhat close. But the website and description are not detailed enough. Thank you to those who took the time to read this, and to those who post what they see out there! There has to be other people who saw this too..",2013-11-11T00:00:00,46.632617886178856,-120.56871761517615

The reason I say somewhat is because after the light vanished I could literally see the SAME light when looking indirectly at this object as if it burned a hole in the sky. Very similar to how stars appear around early dusk.  Only slightly visible, however this object was clearly surrounded by some type of LIGHTLY GLOWING BLUE""cloud"" or ""wavy membrane"". This may sound odd as this scared the living hell out of me. This object just came right down to where I was, and as the object was moving I c! ould clearly see it had STRIPED/CHROMATIC colors tailing behind it. It seemed to happen instantaneously and I could see it hovering a couple hundred feet above my house, moments later. I was astonished at the complexity and clarity of what I was looking at even though I was not able to look directly at it and notice it.  The only way I can explain it was like seeing a previously unknown spectrum of light, if that makes any sense... This object appeared to have had waving, spaghetti-like strands in a double-helix pattern circling around it just before it zoomed off into  a cloud. This cloud expanded at least 10-15 x its size as 5 or 6 light colored objects flew in. That was the end of my unexpected encounter with a UFO. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and if anyone else out there is... know that we are powerful beings of light . We need not give into fear and intimidation if we are to get through these challenging times . With the universal power of love anything! is possible. - Light. Love.

We were traveling south on I-49 near the Bunkie, La when we exited on to highway 106 right off the interstate to quickly use the rest room.    As I turned to exit I saw something catch my eye out the window.  We then stopped so she could use the restroom and I got out and looked again.   Report is below:  I stopped the car got out and looked again and that’s when I saw a fuzzy or faded blue light moving in the sky towards the W/NW.  I strained hard to see it as it looked very fuzzy and then it started zig sagging so to speak and becoming clearer.   At this same time I was trembling not believing what I was seeing and I asked my girlfriend if she could see it as well.  She said yes and then we both watched it together, kind of zig-zag about if you will.   After a minute or two of this we saw a normal aircraft(which could be heard) cruising at roughly 20,000 to 30, 000 feet traverse the sky.  There was not a light around and the stars (including the milky way) were very clear.   The blue light then moved as a clear pin point, like a star, and shot up high into the atmosphere near where the plane was and traveled much much faster.  It then blinked out and then reappeared at another point well below where the plane had been.   The object then shot with such great speed clear across the sky, stopped, and completely changed directions back towards the west where I first observed it. The object made no sound.  I felt fear, wonder and confusion as this was happening.  My girlfriend then decided we had been there long enough and wanted to go.    During this time, I attempted to capture the object on my iphone, but, there was not enough light to capture the image much less the stars.   I will gladly upload the images of blackness that I do have in case you can enhance them.  The event lasted for roughly 10 minutes.    It was hard to tell the distance of the object, but, my best guess would be anywhere from 5000 to 20000ft high and several miles away.  But, like I said, these distances were nothing to this object.   My coordinates were +30.856926 -92.222672.  Mark 293 N/ NW.   Time was around 1:00Am.

A very large, perfectly round, very bright red/orange object drifted slowly across the Guelph sky at 11:00 p.m. on August 9th, 2013.  It had NO flashing lights, travelled from west to east, was relatively low in the sky (at about a 45 degree angle from the ground), and the red/orange colour was so vivid that the 5 individuals who witnessed it at first wondered if it was a small plane on fire.   It was quickly established of course that this was not the case, given that the object was obviously not falling, but rather, maintaining a steady course across the sky.  From the time we noticed the object, it took approximately 2 minutes for it to travel out of our sight towards the east.   The 5 witnesses were puzzled by this sighting, and found the experience quite unsettling.  Although our hope is that the object was a large, low-flying satellite, we have continued to feel unsettled today in light of the fact that none of us have ever given any credence to reports of UFO sightings in the past.   We have checked our local paper to ascertain if others in Guelph witnessed the object, but no mention of the incident has been noted thus far.   We remain puzzled and disquieted, and hope to discover a logical explanation to calm our minds regarding what we saw last night.

My first thought was that it was the glow from airplane lights reflecting off the haze.  But now that I was looking at it directly I could see why it couldn't possibly be an airplane.  The flight pattern was too erratic.   I couldn't see what the glow was emanating from but whatever it was was zipping through the clouds at unearthly speeds and darting around like a hummingbird.  The glow also seemed to be too dim for plane lights.

The view is from a bluff looking to the east from Manomet Point across Cape Cod Bay at approximately 110°.  The location of the camera was N41° 55’ 24.24”  W070° 32’ 26/18”. I did not personally observe the image.  I noticed the image when I downloaded the photos.  I also noticed that the image does not appear in either the previous or subsequent frame.  You can see by the small movement of the clouds and bird how little time elapsed.  The distance in frame is approximately fifty (50) miles from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Bourne, Massachusetts. I am 59 years old, a private pilot and have flown over a million miles commercially.  I have lived on this bluff over 28 years and have never seen anything like this before. I enlarged the photos at much as Paint would allow and could not see any wings, tail, blades or source of thrust or lift.  I am sure you have better digital photo equipment.

The light looked to be about 5mm across from my current altitude of 4620ft.  There was no sound and it was moving slowly from West to East originating from The Spray Lakes area.  At one point, after it had passed over head, it appeared to hover or change direction to the SE as it stood still in the sky for a good 15-20 seconds then continued off to the East. Frantic  I quickly hung-up on my wife - I took some quick pictures with my iPhone as the object was over head and even attempted to get some video as it hovered to the SE. The object was too high to be a helicopter and had no red or green wing or rotor lights.  I feel the inclusion of the hover or change in direction rules out the ISS or a satellite, also I have seen the ISS and satellites many times and this was too low of an altitude and the size too great to be either of them. I have posted an original unedited picture I captured to my Google Drive and it can be viewed here:  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1nvmKVaxG72TVVsdnRZeWdQMEE/edit?usp=sharing   On a copy of the image I was able to enhance the shadow and highlights to reveal what looks to be a round disk shape (seen as a black ring blocking out the sky behind it) and a thin secondary, yet broken, halo of light that I can only assume is from light being emitted from the top of the object.  It is the most compelling UFO photo I have seen to date and if I hadn’t seen it with my own two eyes, I would still find the images very hard to explain with any known craft in the skies today.

It was approx the brilliance of two planets seen in the night sky together.  It got a bit brighter as it moved, left to right in our vision, and had NO blinking lights.  It moved parallel with the ground, left to right, then (slowly) it dimmed, dimmed, and it was gone. We had previously seen planes in the area and they clearly had blinking lights on. This was just a large massive light, uniform in its shape, roughly that of a ""light"" or ""star"". To say it was an orb is too specific. We saw the same thing days before (like 3 or 4 days can't remember) but it was way up in the sky, like where a satellite would be. So I just ignored it as a possible satellite. Yeah,its not a satellite. Also saw a small sprite like light (white -VERY WHITE- and about the size of your hand, f! lies very fast)that appeared right after the encounter. I had seen one of these (5/31/13)but I wasn't sure what I had seen. This time (6/5/13) my neighbor saw it with me, thank goodness. It was like a probe whipping by us or something.

I immediately looked up towards the south.  As soon as I did I instantly see a very bright orb in the sky headed from north to south.  I caught it roughly 10 seconds before it passed below the treeline.  It was not moving particularly fast.  It was very bright white with hard to make out edges almost like it had an aura surrounding it.  It appeared to be an orb in shape.  I also believe there was a slight tinge of blue light near the center of the mass.  All light being emitted from the object was bright, solid, and completely encompassing the entirety of the object.  I ruled out a meteor as it was moving too slow and was way too large.  I do not believe it to be an aircraft of any kind as aircraft have much smaller lights which typically blink as well as it did not produce any sound at all.  It also could not have been a satellite as it was producing its own light as well as being much too large again for it to be that.

I asked my wife if she could see it and she responded that she could.  It was moving much like a leaf falling from a tree, but much slower, descending in altitude.  We wondered if it could be a plastic grocery bag that had been lifted by a dust devil and then caught in a thermal updraft as can sometimes happen. Then it slowly stopped and appeared to hover.  We wondered if it could be a weather balloon at this point.   Then it slowly made a looping maneuver and again appeared to hover in place for a few moments.  At this point I asked my wife to run in and grab her birder binoculars so I could take a closer look if this thing wasn’t going anywhere.  She ran into the house.  During the time she was in the house the object began moving slowly to the! east.  There is a church steeple in the field of view and the object passed behind that. I walked across our yard to get the view from the other side.  The object appeared from behind the steeple slowly moving eastward toward a patch of fair weather cumulus cloud. My wife appeared at this time with the binoculars and I managed to get a glimpse of the object as it began to disappear behind these clouds. In the binoculars it appeared to me to be a tube or cylinder, silvery and sparkly in nature, perhaps with flashing lights running along its length, and it reminded me of a short flute. Something else that was very interesting, but perhaps coincidental. There were two airliners flying in our field of view at altitude leaving contrails. As I searched and waited to see if the object would appear on the other side of the clouds, which it didn’t as far as I could tell, another smaller aircraft leaving a contrail was flying at twice the speed of the airliners out of the Northeast toward the area where I last saw the object enter the clouds. Could this have perhaps been a military aircraft attempting to intercept the object? I don’t know but found it very interesting.

They did not appear to be flying in an symetrical formation but did stay together all but one which headed off to the southeast and appeared to be descending.  The color of the lights/objects was a shade of Orange I just can't put into words.  The other lights/objects seemed to remain on their course which from my vantage point was south.  They actaully flew/hovered over me as I was driving and I pulled over to keep watching them.  The color and intensity of the lights never wavered.   I have watched a lot of UFO shows on TV and was always waiting for that ah ha moment when they figured out it was a plane, helicopter or other aircraft.  To be honest what I saw sent chills all through me and even as I wr! ite this, I hope it can be explained but as it stands now it cannot.  After the sighting I called 911, I don't really know if it was fear that motivated me or just plain curiosity.  The 911 operator took the information I gave down and proceded to call the FAA.  I asked if I could call back and see what they said and she gave me their direct number.   After about 30 minutes I called back and they were still on the phone with the FAA in Little Rock and the FAA told the dispatch officer there were no radar hits in the area.  Shortly after my first call an off duty police officer saw and reported the exact same thing to 911, at the present his location of his sighting is unknown to me.

First glance I would have said the size of a hot air balloon at what I estimated at about 2000 feet above ground level but since the objects appeared to be just light those esitmates could be way off both in si ze and altitude.  Their movement was constant and slow except for the one I previously mentioned.  I have never witnessed any event like the one I just witnessed in my life.   Whatever it was is to me a true Unidentified Flying Object.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,34.60069111111111,-92.49105555555555

I came outside to smoke a cigarette.  I know the exact time it was in the air as I had placed a call to the comm center for someone else to run out and witness this. At the time I placed the call the object was directly overhead (just east) of my position. When I came outside I noticed an object that looked similar to an orange in color streetlamp. Only the object seemed to be moving as would maybe a plane would.  So I just watched it but initially paid no attention for the first few seconds as I thought it was just a plane. As it came closer to my position I noticed it was ""different"".  I started to pay more attention to it. I dont remember it getting brighter as it closer, I just thought why is that street light moving? I then began thinking ""someone else has got to see this"".  But it was hard for me to get my phone out and make a call because i felt that i didnt want to miss any of this. I made a call then to a co-worker to come outside.  There was absolutely no sound.  It seemed to be orange in color, and maybe just a little bit oblong, as to a circle. I waited for some type of sound as it was closer to me now than before. Judging the distance from my viewpoint and that the sky was somewhat overcast, I was in shock that i did not hear anything. By the time my co-worker had made it outside it was indistinguishable. It seemed as though the tail end was somewhat not as bright as the front. I lost sight of it through a tree on the opposite horizon. The craft came from the south and headed north bound. Seeming to pass right over the city of Lebanon. I believe it came from a south easterly direction then seemed to maybe ""curve"" to take a direct north bound path. I knew the sky was overcast as I could only see a star or two in the sky. This object seemed to not be obstructed whatsoever from cloud cover. so im guessing it was somewhat ""low"" altitude. the sighting lasted about 1.10 minutes. Thats m! y best judgement. It never changed color or shape, only as it ! passed o ver the tail end seemed to be ""dimmer"" than the front. I dont believe it was a ""perfect circle"", but It didnt seem to be cigar shaped or egg shaped. Thats the best description I can recall. It did somewhat shake me up, because I knew it didnt seem to be a plane or helicopter like ive witnessed numerous times. As I work in a 911 center in Lebanon County, I was excited to go back in hoping to get some calls on a strange light in the sky.

It first appeared to be stationary, but when I averted my eyes for a second and looked back it was moving to its right, my left, in a NW direction, almost over my house.

There was no air traffic observed at the time. There was no structure connected to the light and it was as bright and unchanged going as it was coming. It made no sound.  The night was silent, in fact, it was one of those nights you have every once in a while where you suddenly realize the silence was almost deafening. I didn’t notice the red illumination reflecting off anything in the yard or on the porch during the entire sighting.  It seemed to be self-illuminated. There were no other lights connected to it or around it. It continued NW until obscured by the top of trees.

I jokingly called out to my brother, “hey check it out the star of Bethlehem is over the house!”  When he came outside to see it we were discussing what it could be, possibly a planet or a large star when the object slowly started to move.  I quickly pulled out my phone and started recording for almost a full minute.  I have a good smart phone and I began to review the video I had just taken while the object continued at a snails pace in a northeast direction.  The video was completely black sky, which I found to be unusual considering how large and bright the object was.  The object then began to pick up speed and in my frustration I snapped a photo since my video was less than remarkable. We continued to watch it fly and as a helicopter approached from the east heading west (the object was very high compared to the position of the helicopter) the object quickly dimmed its light.  It could still be seen as a tiny speck of light which quickly disappeared in seconds. My brother and I were still talking about how strange it was when I remembered that I had taken a picture.  At first glance it looked like I had gotten nothing, but when I zoomed in and cropped the picture several times there is definitely something there.  It is the object we had observed; only the picture captured the object differently than we had seen with our eyes.  We had seen it as a very large bright light and in the picture it kind of looks like a grey glow worm with eyes. There are always airplanes that fly over the house but this was not an airplane or helicopter or anything I’ve seen relative to our technological capabilities.

(Note: it was pitch black, no visible stars, it had however started sprinkling.)  I was using my phone as a flash light, and my view finder on my phone kept trying to pick up every random object in the back yard, I was amazed at how well it was at seeing objects I could barely make out, so I turned it up towards the sky to see if it would pick up any stars that might be hiding behind clouds, and immediately my view finder focused and this bright dot appeared,   I looked up, saw nothing but pitch black, looked back down and watched the dot appear, and disappear, then right beside it two more would appear, when all 3 lights were on at the same time, it made a triangular shape, they stayed mostly white lights, but occasionally we saw them blink purple and blue   (Note: it seemed like these 3 particular lights were the same object, other parts of the sky would h! ave one or two, it was always changing) kinda like a airplanes lights blink,but there was no pattern at all to the lights, at first they were completely stationary just blinking on n off at random,and like I said, none of this was visible with the naked eye. I watched a few minutes trying to figure out what I was staring at, and called my son outside to look to make sure I wasn't just seeing things, when he confirmed my sanity was still intact, we immediately started trying to name off things that it possibly could be, and I kept coming up with nothing that I have ever seen before, so I switched my phone to video and started recording the lights, at this point, I'm not gonna lie, I was freaking out, so I went in and woke up my gf, and made her come out and see, she grabbed her phone, and I started charging my video camera as well to hopefully catch it on there as well. This went on for over a hour, in several different locations in the sky, we walked around the house and do! wn the road a little, facing the opposite direction, and after! a min o r two these lights would appear. I called a friend of mine who ever since we were little was obsessed with airplanes, he worked at the airport and even built his own 1 person plane. I figured he would be able to tell me what I was more then likely seeing, after a few minutes of apologizing for it being so late, and for sounding like a crazy person, he had me send him the videos I recorded, I waited for him to watch them all, and when he called me back, he was baffled as well, he told me that airplanes can't remain stationary in the sky and that they have guidelines for certain color lights they can use, and he also said the fact that we couldn't visually see it without the camera lens told him  the light sources had to be infrared like on a tv remote. He told me he really had no clue what it was, he did however tell me that he also had seen something he couldn't explain a few months prior, but that he was able to visually see it with his naked eye. I don't know much about ai! r craft and if we all missed a obvious answer, I will gladly accept feeling like a moron.   Today, while browsing the internet I cane across this video about syria and the strange sightings that are currently being seen there, which made me think about how similar some of these videos I was seeing were, so i searched to see if anything strange had ever been seen in Virginia, and I found this website, and a youtube video that had been filmed the same day, in another part of Virginia, where the viewer had the same phenomenon of only being able to see it through his camera lens. So after watching that, I decided to come on here and share my experience and videos.  Ever since then I randomly scan the skies with my viewfinder when I'm outside at night, and I have never incurred these strange lights since that night. So yeah, call me crazy lol but I dunno it was pretty nuts.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,38.007,-79.04830000000001

We saw what looked like 3 to 5 dark orange hovering orbs still and silent.  Position was N to Ne just above tree line. Next, as we turned canoe to get a better look the large low hovering orbs began to float up and away glowing like Chinese lanterns.  However, we knew they were not.  At first they looked like large oval glowing jellyfish then appeared to shift into a more lantern like shape as they floated upwards silently. The third phase was when they appeared smaller and more brightly colored but were still much bigger and lower than stars.  They locked into a formation at about fifty degrees above the horizon and floated in that formation more directly north.  This formation looked like the top of Orion the Hunter, or possibly a circular form with a shape inside it much like an arrow or cross.  Unfortunately part of this formation was hidden behind a building on the end of the lake so we couldn't fully make it out.

It would be comparable to holding a dime about a foot in front of your eye, but a little more cylindrical.  They resembled radio stars in they way they flashed multiple colors blue, white , red , yellow, green.  They danced around each other like bees over flowers in silent circles somewhat erratic in this pattern as if they were swirling around each other. Finally they organized once again and formed a perfect hatchet shape with the rectangular piece facing west at the top and a long handle on the right or east side each dot representing a light bright type of design of perfect angles to create a clear shape.  They flashed a couple of times as though to show off their display, or the final act of this show. Lastly they filed slowly out of the hatchet type of shape drifting off to the Northwest sky, up and away.  They almost seemed to puff out one by one like a burnt out firework.

On 08 October 2013, at approximately 1730, I was on way to attend a state representive forum in Tillmans Corners which is WSW and just outside of Mobile, AL.  I had stopped at an intersection waiting for a red light facing north when my attention was captured by a white oval/roundish object.  This object was about a little over 3 fists above the horizon with luminosity equal to or a bit brighter than the moon.  The size was about ¼” to 1/3” comparatively speaking.  What fascinated me most at the time was that it remained stationary.  I didn’t take a photo at the time because my impression was that it was a blimp even though it was rounder than that.  I figured it maybe it was the angle disguising such an obvious shape.  Besides I was driving in a new area looking for the building where the forum was to take place so I dismissed it from my mind.  I found the building a few minutes later and decided I had time to get a bite to eat. After eating, I was returning via the same route 30-40 minutes later. At the same intersection I glanced up to the spot where I had seen this anomaly and it was still there! Making a left and arriving at my destination a few blocks over, I parked and got out my car. I stayed outside for another five or so minutes continually watching this object. I wanted to take a picture, but thought it would be unimpressive and when I decided to take one anyway, it turned a bluish gray and disappeared!   Again thinking maybe it was blimp, I thought I should at least see something slighter darker the clear sky color to indicate a shadow or something but there was nothing.  I waited a few minutes more but nothing further other the than the clear sky. It ended about 1925. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sorry about that, it would be October 08, 2013.

While we didn’t see any meteors, what we saw will probably stick with us for a long time. At about 10:15 that night, one of us noticed a very bright, very low-flying orange “thing” just above the tree line of the eastern shore of the reservoir (see above). Beyond the reservoir to the east is a state park called “Devil’s Den.” It is named as such, according to the Darien Times, because charcoal makers in the hilly, rocky area would say that a hoof-like mark made in a boulder was the footprint of the Devil. It took about 20 minutes for us to become convinced that this was something that we should take pictures of. Once the camera was up and running, the lights remained hovering for about 10 minutes, according to time stamps taken from the camera that took the pictures below. The orange light hovered above the trees moving in an erratic, “jerky” fashion. Near the end of its visibility, it began moving purposefully towards the south, where it disappeared beyond a grove of pine trees that blocked our view.  ——— This is not the first time these lights have been reported by observers. ———   (For the record, I am a newspaper reporter who works for a chain of newspapers that includes the newspapers that have covered Redding, Easton, and Weston for a long, long time. No one working at these papers, including the publisher, had ever heard of anything like that which I show below. However, research like this is my job, and I stand behind the information I present to you. But, I cannot guarantee the veracity of the reports listed below. In my opinion, the chances of this many separate reports of similar incidents in one small part of Connecticut over a vast period of time is more than a coincidence.)  As far back as 1966, a Doctor from Darien, Conn. driving past the reservoir noticed lights that seem to match the description of what we had seen.  His report was chronicled by the Spartanburg, SC Herald-Journal. There are also multiple matches for what we saw recorded in the National UFO Reporting Center.  Below I partially quote one entry from Feb. 22, 2011:  “Last night at 8pm I looked out my living room window and noticed a flashing bright red light low on the horizon a mile or so away over the Devil’s Den area on the Weston/Redding border.  It was low in the sky and unusually bright, much brighter than any airplane lights, flashing and drifting very slowly.”  And another partial quote from Sept. 28, 2010 in Redding:  “I saw a bright light that slowly moved through the sky and seemed to have striations that looked like lightning bolts eminating from it.”  And another partial from Weston in Feb. of 2003:  “Bright light in sky. Not an airplane because it didn’t move.  Not a star because it was twinkling white, green and red lights. To the left was another star-like light that seemed to blink a few times then stop…blink again a few time then stop, etc.  After 5 mins. or so both lights grew dimmer and more distant until they were gone.”  And another from Norwalk in August of 2007:  “Blinking Bright Star/object, at lower altitude than normal at stand still/ moving very subtully through the night sky.  The UFO appeared to be a a blinking star or a plan.   As I laid down in the bed it was descending in a weird fashion.”   ——— Our Location ———   Below are three maps which show our location, our line of site, and the location of the floating object.  The blue lines represent the opening through which we viewed the orange light.  We were only able to witness the light’s movement between the island you see to the left of our line of site (respective to the observer) and the tall pine trees which cover the peninsula to our right. You can find the same maps at: https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zwGJfJDQECZY.k7Uby7nJpcsQ    Visibility maps. Visibility maps.  ——— The images ———  That night, I was lucky enough to have my Canon Rebel T3i in the car that brought us to the reservoir. I had taken some 30&#8243; exposure shots before the light appeared. All of the images taken that night were in RAW, CR2 format, which can be provided to anyone who might assume they have been “photoshopped.”  When the light first appeared, we believed we were seeing a plane coming from the east, rising very slowly.  However, compared to other planes that very regularly fly over the reservoir at night, it was moving far too slowly, and too erratically.  To give the lights some context, I took a picture of a plane traveling above the reservoir just after the orange lights disappeared. It is pictured below. http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-presentation-plane-wp.jpg?w=660&h=440   An image of a plane captured above the Saugatuck Reservoir after the orange lights disappeared. An image of a plane captured above the Saugatuck Reservoir after the orange lights disappeared. As one can see, the lights recorded when taking a picture of a plane were regular, and tightly delineated. I was not taking these pictures with a tripod. Any camera shake is negligible, and the lights of the plane are clearly defined. EXIF data and zoom views are included above. Contrarily, the pictures taken of the odd orange lights were not clear or well-defined. The following picture was taken with the exact same EXIF settings, from the exact same point on the reservoir as the plane lights above. Yet, it depicts something much less defined, with varying colors. It almost looks like a hieroglyph. http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-1-presentation.jpg?w=660&h=440   (An image taken of the orange lights seen on Oct. 8 at the Saugatuck Reservoir.)   The next image of the orange lights give a much better perspective of how unbelievably low these lights were hovering above the tree line.  The brightness and contrast have been edited to show a clearer look at the tree line.  Also of note are the green lights which seem to be the source of the orange, glowing lights.  This image is also taken at about half the shutter-speed as the above two images, and appears to show the eratic nature of the light’s movement across the sky. http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-presentation-2.jpg?w=660&h=989   A third image of the lights again shows the clear difference between the green and orange lights in the sky, though the human eye could only pick up the green.  When we saw it without a camera lens, the light appeared to be an orange circle floating across the sky.  http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-3-presentation.jpg?w=660&h=440   An image that shows the orange lights in the sky   ——— Conclusion ———  I cannot even pretend to guess what on earth I took a picture of that night.  Maybe its a lighted kite for all I know.  All I can do is give you the information I have seen and found, and let you make your own conclusions. I’m the furthest thing from a skeptic when it comes to this sort of thing, so I urge you to debunk anything I say as harshly as you can. My fellow observers and I are excited to see what you all may think.   Feel free to contact us at [Email removed/cms/tg]",2013-11-11T00:00:00,41.2246,-73.3768

But they couldn’t have visited us because we didn’t get home until 11:30pm.

During the last 3 years I have compiled over 600 photos of the Spheres in the daylight, in the very city of Mostar (my city) – I have something like 60 different sets. I know what they want.  I do not want to stay anonymous – I want people to know. I will send those photos and some texts to your organization on that email. I can send all since it would last too long. My photos and parts of texts are published on different UFO and other web sites, magazines and I do now even know where else.  A few weeks ago I got contacted from one ufologist from Germany – he is also going to publish some of the material in his book. I am the first to take photos of the Spheres doing transformations in the air. I have photographed them in black, translucent, yellow, red, orange… I knew even before they had done those transformations that they are polymorphs.  I am connected with them. it is not what you think, this is completely different. They are here for us. They are ok.  I know what they want – they want to wake us up, it is already here. Strange things are happening around me and it is accelerating. I can do some things with nature. I was not born this way – I was told by them that I am a Pleyadian. I do not know – everything is possible. I do hear voices in my head. There are some strange characters surfing the web. They are all super-intelligent. They even know what you had for a breakfast, although they are in a completely different state and your web cam is completely disconnected from you computer. you can ask them what you want and in one second you get completely correct answer. I want people to know – we are not this what they say that we are. I was threatened with life for my work a couple of times. I am starting to get psychic abilities. They are responsible for all my photos and this start of awakening. I am here simply with them. They are cool and I really like them. I am just a human, like all of us – although this cannot be happening. I was born in a city environment and I have never had almost any interest in ufology. It was simply something for me to pass the time by watching a show or two per month on Discovery or Nat Geo. Nothing else. This is really happening. I am going to put here my nickname and my mails – if somebody is interesting to read those several texts and see some photos – not a problem.  I guess that I simply have to do this.  I hope also that some serious researcher simply might take this seriously enough and ask me a few questions.  He would not be the first one. This is how it is. Once one highly esteemed ufologist told me that we are going to be famous because of this – I told him I am not interested. I got in touch with him here – abovenbeyond2011. He is the only one who has all my photos and texts. This is happening. At least it is not boring to me. Maybe I even am from Pleiades and maybe I am not – I do not know and more or less do not care – this is all simply to interesting. I am having the time of my life. And one more thing – it has been a month that when I am angry light bulbs simply die around me. Maybe it is just a coincidence and maybe it is not – I also do not know and do not care. And the nature is getting to be something special – I am starting to feel the life in everything around me. All the best to all of U.

It was moving in a peculiar manner - meandering through the sky - instead of cruising, drifting or cutting through the air like an airplane it was meandering through the sky - not moving straight - I tried to film it with my phone camera but the contrast was terrible and barely anything was showing (I tried the camera indoors afterwards and everything was very dull in a lit room - I only just acquired the phone and don't seem to be able to get the camera working properly) - as I have successfully telepathically communicated with ufos before I went through a lot of things to send to it in my head but wasn't sure what to say, and didn't feel like it would have too much impact anyway for whatever reason, I! am mainly filing the report to help track local ufo activity as another time when I saw one at 200 feet or so there were a lot of reports from the islands around here of glowing craft in the night sky. Really it just meandered through the sky moving with that strange 'lightness' that they do until it was nearly out of view behind a tree - then I ran up a hill to get a new vantage point to watch it for longer but couldn't find it again after that.  I feel a bit gutted that I 'wasted' my time trying to film it as it was closest to me at that point and I was mostly looking at my flippin phone haha - oh well .  At one point there was an airplane clearly visible (near the end of the event) and it was interesting to note that the lights on the plane looked tiny compared to the light that was the ufo - roughly speaking the width of the ufo was equivalent to the size of the plane - roughly.  I was very excited to watch it.  Will keep watching as I saw five last night - not as close as this one - they were like satellites but not moving straight.  This one and last night's were all star like in colour.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,,

I was also talking on the phone. I noticed in the sky these lights that were in a bird flying pattern, a sideways V, with the point of the V pointing to the right or east.  I asked my nieces who were with me, do y’all see that? They both replied, “Yes”. I pulled over about 30 feet from where I first saw them and exited my vehicle. I was still talking on the phone with my Dad.  I was telling him about these UFOs.  He said they were probably big birds reflecting light.  I know they were not birds. Birds fly with the point of the V in front. These UFOs were traveling toward the open end of the V, or west bound. There were seven individual lights.  There were five on the top row and two on the bottom.  They were moving very slowly. Eventually they faded out of sight one by one.  I waited to ! see if more would come back or to see what would happen. Two more rose from the tree line, flickered and then vanished.  My Dad still says they were large birds. I disagree. I do not know if anyone else saw these.  Thank you for your attention in this matter.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,33.34393775510204,-87.5699193877551
