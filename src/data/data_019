At appx 11:40cst, I saw a fairly bright red light moving very slowly toward my location, appx north to south.  I first assumed that this was normal air traffic (probably around 30-35 degrees above the northern horizon)  but it was moving slower than what I thought was normal.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my head away for a couple of seconds and when I looked back at the light, there was a second light, white and not as bright moving from appx west to east at a faster, but not very fast speed. Had this been a 2-D screen, the second light would have been slightly below the red light.  It did not seem to be moving fast enough for me NOT to have seen it before I turned my head, i.e. it seemed to appear from nowhere.   After about 30 seconds, the white light just went out.  This got me kind of excited and I continued to watch the red light which never blinked as much as it sort of flickered, now much closer to my location still moving VERY slowly.  At times it seemed as though the light had come to a stop.  As it continued moving toward to the south (now about 45 degrees off the horizon) I realized that it had become more copperish orange in color.  I am almost sure that it came to a stop and then began moving more easterly.  It moved very slowly for maybe 20 seconds before in dimmed to the brightness of a dim star and then went out.  I kept looking for about 2 more minutes before I decided it was not going to reappear and I had to go back inside (I was at work and was watching from the first floor roof of my job site, taking my coffee break checking out the sky as I always do on my overnight shift.)  The moon was somewhat overhead and could be seen fairly clearly through a thin clould layer.  There was a slight ring around it and I could see a bright star, actually probably the planet Jupiter through this same thin cloud layer.  There was a slight band of heavier clouds between the moon and where I saw the lights but I am 90% sure that the lights did not disappear behind any clouds. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))  The red (to orange)light moved in a straight line until just before it disappeared when it appeared to stop for a moment or two and then began heading east. (Again, the very slow speed of the object was, to me, very strange and what really kept my attention.)  I agree that a white light moving slowly and then disappearing, under other conditions, would beg to be labeled a satellite, but the conditions at this location, in that direction and under these weather conditions was not right for a satellite.  One of my hobbies on weekend nights, when I do not work is to sit in my backyard and hope to see meteors.  I have seen many satellites and I would bet the farm that this was not one.  This light, though not  blinding was at least as bright as Jupiter, considering that Jupiter was dimmed somewhat by the icy haze in the air.  It seemed too low in the sky to have been a satellite and the fact that it appeared so suddenly and so close to the red light (probably two to three fingers width at arms length ""lower"" than the red light) was at best very coincidental.  The location I was at is just not conducive to seeing satellites.  One cannot even see stars that low in the sky facing north.  Its just too close to downtown Tulsa.  Too much light.  Of course, I could be wrong.  Thanks again. ((name deleted)) in OKlahoma PS Say hi to Jeff for me next time you are on the show.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

It was a crystal clear night sky in Denver at the time.  As I was talking to him, I looked to the North of Saturn, just East of the constellation Cassiopea and saw two bright lights fixed (not moving)approximately 10 degrees apart at an elevation about 45 degrees above the Eastern horizon.  They were very bright, both with the same magnitude, nearly that of Jupiter.  They looked beautiful, like a wide double start system.  As I continued talking I saw one light begin to fade, then about 4 seconds later, the other faded also.  They both became dark.  They appeared to have angular dimention, as opposed to being like point star light sources.  They also appeared to be very high.  When they both faded away, none of the other stars in their vicinity faded.  I then, about a minute later, saw two aircraft with navigation lights flying in the vicinity (about 20,000 feet)in differnt directions. I can only surmise that I was looking at two satelites in a fixed geosychros orbit.  It was about two hours after local sunset.  I'm thinking the objects faded when the earth's shadow engulfed them.

They appeared to have angular width, not points of light.  It's difficult to say, but I'd estimate altitude at 20,000 feet.  As I was still talking, one of the lights started to dim.  After 2-3 seconds, the other light also dimmed.  Both dimmed to darkness.  No other surrounding stars ""dimmed"".

It was around Christmas 1996.  My sister, myself and my niece were out looking at local christmas decorations.  When we had left the house I noticed a Bright star in the sky, it being Christmas I naturally thought it was the north star, yet it seemed extremely bright.  I have been a star gazer all my life and the night sky was clear and this star was the brightest object in the sky, I couldn't help but keep watching it.  I had pointed it out to my sister and we kept looking for it has we drove around.  About 30-45 minutes into our trip the object was still in the sky, like a star, it hadn't appeared to move it was high in the sky like a star and stayed in this one spot the whole time.  Then I noticed what appeared to be a plane coming closer to the object, I made a joke that there was a plane checking out this star. There was just a tiny green light in the sky like the green lights on a plane, it appeared to be approaching the star, then there was a red light that appeared below the green light also like a plane, I commented again that there was a second plane checking it out.  Then the lights both the green and red light got brighter and then it became apparent that they were a part of this star.  They appeared to rotate like the object was turning sideways and we were seeing the bottom of it.  The green light the red light and the bright white light together formed a perfect triangle.  I was amazed and told my sister and niece to look.  It slowly rotated around and then it streaked across the sky, faster than anything I had ever seen.  Then to our surprise it suddenly stopped,  it was on the horizon just above the tree line.  It slowly moved across the night sky, now only the white light was visible.  Then it went dark, then dim, the a bright flash and the 3 lights appeared again,  we were dumfounded. Like it's going to show us again.  We had continued to drive the whole time, this object had never left our sight we decided to roll down the windows to see if we could hear anything, there was no sound! . At the speed this thing had moved we knew there would be a sonic boom, but there was nothing. Then the 3 lights that made the triangle appeared and it streaked off again, this time going out of sight.  I couldn't believe what I had just seen.  I felt really strange, knowing if I ever told this story I would be looked upon like I was crazy.  I have always been a believer in UFO's but to see one was unbelieveable even to myself.  If my sister and her daughter had not also seen it no one would have ever believed us.  Actually I don't think anyone believes us anyway. I am an avid watcher of UFO television specials, and until last night when I watched ""Lights over Illinois"" I had never seen anything that compared to what I had seen.  The object that they described in that show was so close to what I had seen I think it even convinced my husband that I had actually seen something.  The description that they gave sounded like me telling my story to my husband almost 5 years ago.  He himself was amazed at how their stories had sounded like mine.  This is the first time I have said anything about this other than to my closest friends and family.  We too, live near an Air Force Base, I have seen many a plane come and go from there, but this was no plane.

All that could be seen was a blue ring of light that looked to be at a very high altitude. When we all managed to see it far up, it suddenly accelerated our line of vision, then as quickly as it started to accelerate, it stopped in mid air, and then zoomed backwards in a semi-circular motion. After this it accelerated again at a fantastic speed back in the original direction. Later on one (circa 15mins) of my friends saw it again returning toward the direction from which it originally came, again at a fantastic speed. Before the rest of us could locate it in the sky this time it was too late and had gone. Initially we were trying to justify what we saw, for instance lasers from a local nightclub, however we could see these as a shaft light led from the source up to the sky. It certainly was not anything man made that the general public are aware of, especially considering the speed at which it accelerated, stopped and then changed direction. Description: could not see any detail at all, condidering it was late and it was most likely very high up.m What we did see was a light blue ring of light the cntre of which was indiscernible from the night sky. The blue colour was quite  similar to the hyperlink colour on this page (where it says ""Click here to see examples"") although bright like a light and not a dull colour. The ring of light was basically all we could see, and it probably was a perfect circle.

I was facing SW and out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright purple sphere that looked very far away come in a perfectly straight line across the sky. Went just under the moon and continued in a perfectly straight line moving at about well if I put a measuring tape up in front of me to use as a guide I would have to say it moved across that measureing tape about 1 to 2 feet per second in a perfectly straight line. I have never seen anything like it. I was out with a friend and there were several other people there as well that saw the object move across the sky and to my surprise 2 of them said, oh we see stuff like that all the time. I am originally from South FL now a transplant to the area and have been looking up for 30 years and never saw anything like that. But I can tell you that after I saw this purple glowing sphere move across the sky the way it did and it looked very far away I became a believer that we are not alone.

(can i say it another way???)  i noticed in the disc of the sun to the right side abd just lower than the centre of the sun, a long black object.  it was over a quarter of the suns radius and less than half.  it was slim and the feeling i got was that i saw it in profile.  ie.it was a disc shape on edge to me or cigar shaped...but not rounded like a cigar on the ends.  it tapered to the bottom like many of the famous disc shaped objects seen.  (i can't remember off hand any famous ones by name but the pics taken by the california highway worker on profile edge kind of do it justice.)  it was 8-10 times longer than high.  and tapered to the bottom, not evenly between bottom and top.  (can i say this in another way???) this was seen for about 15-20 minutes at the speed given before.  my feeling at the time was that it was way far away as it didn't move in relation to the sun.  this would mean a LARGE object way far away to not show any paralax in my moving observation.  or it was closer but moving at a relative speed between me and the sun but closer. frank edwards in his book 'FLYING SAUCERS: SERIOUS BUSINESS' tells of an astronomer in mexico (book publ'd in late '60's '70's) who saw streams of objects between him and the sun like i observed.  except i saw one... for some reason i didn't confirm with anyone else on the bus. i can write to you by snail mail with topographical maps so you can get coordinates on where exactly i was and a sketch of what i saw... i heard of y'all on 'art bell'  (where else?...) and thought it was the perfect place to tell...

I noticed a red light in the southern sky away from the fireworks, approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon, sitting motionless.  I asked my fiance if she saw it too, and she stated yes.  We watched it for a couple of minutes and it did nothing.  We both got up and went down to the parking lot and I got out a pair of binoculars to view it with.  My binoculars are fairly low quality and they did not help much, but I did observe something apparently fall from the light and leave a burning trail as it went down to the south of us.  Another guy was in the lot when we were looking at it, and I asked if he saw it too, and he stated he did.  I told my fiance to stay there while I ran up to get a cell phone to call somebody to see if they could observe it.  But while I was running up to our apartment, my fiance said it grew smaller and vanished.  While we were still out in the parking lot, it (or something similar to it) appeared or reappeared in approximately the same position in the sky, but only further to the east.  This light, too, vanished after only a short period of time.  My fiance and I both discussed what it might have been.  Could it have been a burning ember from the fireworks caught in the upper atmosphere winds?  We surmised not because we did not see any motion whatsoever.  An airplane or a helicopter?  Like I stated, we thought not because of the lack of motion.  An acquaintance suggested it might have been a homemade hot air balloon.  That seemed plausible to me because, when I was a kid, my dad used to make them out of sheets of plastic and sterno fuel.  Anyway, I know we were not the only ones to see this, because I've read other accounts of this on this web site and the next day on a local radio talk show, I've been told people were calling in describing the same object.

It was the brightest object in the sky by a factor of 4 and I showed it to my wife.

However, at 40 degree above the south horizon it's velocity slowed and it's brightness/color changed from bright white to slightly yellow orange. I had the impression that what ever it was has just bottomed out of a dive, in an arc. It then changed direction and accelerated/fluttered/skipped almost directly away from us getting dimmer as it went into the upper atmosphere. It then turned west after gaining significant altitude and went out of site.

I observed them from the other side of the lake I was staying at. They looked about 3-4 miles away. I stayed at Salmon lake in a cabin for a week with my family, so that is why I do not have all the location information. I had never seen anything like them before, looking at them made me afraid, for whatever reasons I am still trying to understand. The lights were near the horizon and very bright. The light they emitted was a white light. The first light I saw was the brightest. It cast a reflection on the lake. It had 3 different shapes that it kept alternating into every few minutes. The first shape looked like two balls that were stuck together, then it appeared to move closer to me and would turn into a five point star, then it appeared to be moving farther away from me and change into a fine point of light. The light did have an aura around, but you had to look hard to see it. The light appeared to be stationary. A few times it did move rather rapidly, but would stay in near the same place as it moved. The first time I saw it move was when it made a figure 8. A few other times it moved ever so slightly, but didn't really go anywhere. It also made a few ""sparkles"" but that only happened when other aircraft came near it. I saw 5-6 planes go near the two objects, it was hard to see them becuase that didn't have very bright lights flashing like most air liners you see. The planes could have been from the military, it looked like one of them shot a missile at it one time, (that is when I saw the first ""sparkle"") but I dont know if that idea would be true, or becusae I have wathced to many ""UFO"" shows in the past. The 2nd ufo I saw was higher in the sky than the 1st, and it stayed in the same spot the whole time I was watching. It was not as bright and was about 1/2 the size as the 1st light. It had a shape of the two balls stuck togther the whole time. I didn't see the lights come in. I just had gone outside and saw them. I didn't see them leave either. I had watched them for a couple hours and the desire for sleep took over since my family was leaving early in the morning to head back to where I live. I would have stayed to see them depart, but they didnt show any signs of leaving...I could have been there till daylight watching them, or maybe just a few more minutes. I guess I will never know.

There had been pretty high winds throughout the day and it would not have suprised me as we were on the 10th floor of the Rio Tower. Our room looked out over the back of Ceasars, and the Marage. Anyway,  I told my wife to look at it and she said it looks like a parachute coming down.  I jumped up to my feet and told my wife to hand me my glasses.  It appeared to be a parachute coming down with a wobble. I was unable to tell the size,  but it seemed to be about 2000 ft or so high.  Again,  I couldn't get a good idea of the size.  The closer it got the more it looked like it was the top of a mushroom or a jellyfish, without tenacles.  I then thought maybe a weather baloon.  I have an A&P linense and have been in the Aviation industry since I was 18 in the U.S.A.F. and have worked on the flight line day and nighttime hours for the rest of my life working as a line mechanic. I don't feel that I get fooled easily by objects in the sky.  I have never seen anything that I thought couldn't be explained away before.  Now for what was unbelievable to me.  The object then stop decending and started to rise.  It continued to rise until it looked like a small star, it was very bright as it moved higher, then made a left turn and went a small ways to the left and then, get this! It completely reversed and started back the way it came. There were some clouds about, but my view was to a clear blue sky.  They object then began to climb at an angle and met with another object about the same size that came down from above it. They move together up and to the right until they disappeared from view. In the next few minutes, as I continued to watch the same area of the sky, I shaw three more decend,  but not nearly as close to the earth.

I was attending a wedding reception last night at the Princess Mary restaurant in Victoria, British Columbia. At the restaurant on the top floor was an outdoor patio where guests of the wedding would go to smoke and socialize. The group (5 in number) which had gathered on the patio were talking about how beautiful the moon looked coming over the western horizon and we talked about the number of shooting stars which had shown themselves throughout the evening sky. Just as we finished discussing the shooting star, which I had just witnessed, one of the people in the group yelled, ""What is that"" and pointed above us looking east in the night sky. It was a group of about 6-7 oval shaped objects traveling in a straight-line formation. They didn't seem to be lit up by their own luminescence but since they were traveling over Victoria near the city center it looked as though the city lights lighted them up. The objects appeared to be a grayish in color. It was also hard to tell exactly what altitude the objects were traveling. We couldn't discern any noise coming from the objects throughout the entire sighting. They proceeded to move in a westerly direction until they began to form up into a new formation in an square/rectangular shape and began to ascend into the sky almost directly above the city center. At this point the videographer who had been hired for the wedding was called out on to the patio and we all pointed to the objects in the sky and told him to start taping the event. A few other people who came out on the patio also witnessed the formation and their ascension. The objects continued a slow climb in the square shape formation. As they got smaller we could see their lights flicker and at this point it was hard to make them out. However, we did see some of the objects seemingly streak off into space, but I do clarify at this point they had become faint star -like lights. All of us who witnessed the event just stood there in disbelief but we all had to agree we just saw something unexplainable and it clearly was a UFO sighting. The sighting happened on August 12, 2001 at approximately 12:15 AM to 12:30 AM. The duration seemed to be around 3-4 minutes and the weather was clear. My background is I'm an amateur historian and currently work in the IT industry. The other witnesses: One is a chef One is a student of Computer Programming The Videographer, I don't recall his background The person who first spotted the object has an insurance background The other witness who saw the whole event I do not know personally A few others who came out later during the sighting Come from various backgrounds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally credible witness.  We believe that the witnesses were looking into the southern sky, and the Moon was rising in the east, where it usually is seen when rising.  Please see other reports for the same date.

Could we change it to reflect the proper headings? Thank you... Warm Regards, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the witness for the follow-up comment.

I slowed down and it stayed there even as I passed it.  Then I saw anther closer to the airport in the distance and thought maybe they were planes but neither was moving.  I thought maybe they were helicopters hovering but they usually have blinking lights and make a little noise but I didnt hear anything.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,26.136914681280647,-80.21914075569657

I was looking up at the sky when the object appeared.  The object entered the sky at approximately 70 degrees above the visible horizon and appeared to be heading straight down toward the ground.  It began looking like a falling star.  One to two seconds after appearing, it began to break apart into an orange fireball, with pieces trailing behind it.  The color then changed to a bright green.  It looked like it made it relatively close to the ground, because the clouds were illuminated, which made that entire portion of the sky flash green for a moment.  It looked like it made it to the top of the layer of clouds.  The clouds to the north of my location (where the object was seen) were broken at about 40,000 feet.

The craft appeared to have a hole in the center of it, and the bottom of the craft had a series of dull red lights on the underside, with the entire group of red lights forming the triangle shape.

Just after 18:45, my wife and I pulled onto Ventura Blvd. from Radford Ave. heading west.  There is a traffic light that you have to stop at immediately on Ventura Blvd. and I noticed what I thought at first was an airplane in the night sky to the front of me and to the right.  But then I thought it was too low and too slow to be an airplane so I pointed it out to my wife and asked her what it was.  Then I noticed that it was very low and very slow and very close, so close that there was no way that it could have been an airplane but it did not look even remotely like a helicopter.  As it got closer it slowed down to a crawl and could make out more of the lights and the shape and it and all of the lights were brilliant white, steady and not pulsating and the object was definitely triangular in shape.  The traffic light turned green and not wanting to lose sight of it, I pulled into the gas station on the corner of Ventura Blvd. and Ventura Pl. and was now looking at it through the windshield of my car as it passed over the rear of the buildings right across the street .  I had rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything and my wife rolled down her window to lean out and look at the object.  Neither of us noticed any sound coming from the object!  It had now come to a complete stop and hovered for just a few seconds and then it accelerated smoothly and turned to its left and departed in a generally north-easterly direction.  I turned right onto Ventura Pl. to keep sight of it and had to stop at a traffic light again as we watched it fly over the TV studio and out of sight.  When first noticed, it would have been near to being over the intersection of Laurel Canyon Blvd. and Ventura Pl..  When it hovered, it looked like it would have been over the buildings between Ventura Pl. and Hoffman St..  When it departed it looked like it flew over the guard shack of the nearby TV studio at Hoffman St. and Radford Ave..  Its direction of travel was almost due east until this point when it started turning! north b efore we lost sight of it over the buildings and trees of the studio.  We went to the guard shack and asked the three security guards in it if they saw the object and none of them did.  It was a cool night and they were all inside.  We noticed that while they had a terrific view of the area where the object flew, their window's reflections of the brightly lit interior made it very difficult to see outside.  When the object accelerated and turned as it departed, it never wobbled or tilted and did not bank as it turned.  It was like it ""skated"" away on a perfectly flat surface.  I would guess its speed when last observed to be about 50 mph.  There is a 12 story tall bank building at the corner of Radford Ave. and Ventura Pl. and this object was less than twice its height in altitude.  I would estimate it to have been 200 ft above ground level.  Also using the building as a reference, it think the sides of the object were about 60 ft from tip to tip.  I think the trailing edge was not perfectly straight but may have bowed out or a very shallow point.  There was a bright light near each tip of the triangle but the front tip was not quite as bright or as large as the lights the rear two lights.  There was also two panels of lights near the center that ran parallel to the center-line of the object and were side-by-side to each other.  Later we watched some airplanes taking off from the nearby Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport flying overhead and there was no way of confusing them with what we observed.  Our location was around Lat: 34.143, Long: -118.393 according to mapblast.com.  When we got home I checked the weather at the airport and it was was clear, 73% humidity, 49° dewpoint, 58° windchill, 30.08s barometer, N4 wind average, NW20 wind gust and 58° temperature at 20:14 hours.  I think it was in the mid 60s temperature-wise during our sighting but everything else would be close to the conditions we experienced.

We both sketched what we remember and will scan the images and email them to accompany this report.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,34.138264772727275,-118.39205681818181

I had previously reported spotting a black object flying very low and very fast over Winchester Road after dawn on 11/02/01. I had absolutely no expectation of seeing another unusual object in the sky, and yet that is precisely what occurred this morning. My account has two parts, so please bear with me. Part I: Leaving for work at 5:28 a.m., I stepped into my garage and hit the button to lift the door. (I looked at the digital clock just before I stepped out.) Moving alongside my car after the door was up, I saw the newspaper in our driveway and decided to pick it up before I left. Before I made it to the driveway, however, a very definite and very well-defined and lengthy shadow flitted across the driveway and our front lawn. There was absolutely no sound associated with the passing of this shadow. I'm not the nervous type, but the shadow startled me so that I jumped into my car instead of going out to pick up the paper. I'd never seen anything like this before. It was still quite dark, but a street light illuminates our entire yard to a certain extent. My first impression was that something huge had flown beneath the street light and cast the shadow. This explanation was quickly discarded due to the physical impossibility of such an event, but I was puzzled by what I saw. It appeared that our cat had been startled as well by the passing shadow because she ducked for cover under a hedge. Part II: Seven minutes later. It is now 5:35 a.m., an hour before sunrise, and I am traveling east on Winchester Road. There is almost no traffic. The sky is mostly clear. It's 48 degrees, and the winds are calm. A few stars are visible, even though there are city lights nearby. I am going to work early to complete a project. I've put all thoughts of the ""shadow"" behind me as I mentally prepare for the day ahead. The usual Fed Ex jets are flying past on their west-to-east flight paths, leaving Memphis International Airport, and I pay them little attention. However, as I passed the Nike plant on my left, I noticed a ""plane"" that seemed much lower in the sky than normal for this part of the landing and take-off pattern. It definitely caught my attention. It appeared to be hovering in place at a spot just east of the Nike plant on the north side of Winchester Road. This area is about five miles away from my home. I slowed down and came almost to a stop to get a better look at the ""plane."" It was my perception that it was not moving at all. As I studied it, I realized that there was no strobe light on it. It also did not cast its lights ahead of it, as you would normally expect to see the lights of a jet beamed straight ahead. Instead there were three white lights aimed downward. It was then that I perceived that I was looking at a triangular-shaped craft with three bright white lights, one at each corner, and a single red light in the middle of the underside of the craft. The craft was approximately the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm's length. If I had to guess, I would estimate that it was about a quarter to a half-mile away from me, hovering in place. It exhibited no motion whatsoever, and from my perspective, seemed to be hovering over an empty field. I got quite a good look at it for a period of time I would estimate as long as two minutes.(I regret not having the presence of mind to roll down my window and listen for any sounds. I was too surprised by what I was seeing.) I continued heading slowly eastward until I lost sight of the object as I passed some trees. It was then that I resolved to make a quick U-turn and go back and get another look. I found a place about two blocks farther on to turn around, and I raced back to look at the object again. There was no trace of it whatsoever! I searched the sky for several minutes in vain. The object had quite simply vanished. What I saw was very definitly NOT a star. It was not Venus or Jupiter. I know what the planets look like when they rise in the east. This object was in the northern sky as I faced east. The object was NOT a light on top of a cell phone tower or a utility tower. (I checked on the way home, and there are no towers of any kind in the vicinity of my sighting.) It was also very definitely NOT one of the Fed Ex jets. I had an opportunity to compare the object to the jets flying past in the background, and they were very different. This craft was lower than the jets, and the lights appeared to be of a different intensity. I have no explanation for what I saw, but I decided to give as detailed an account as possible so that others in the Memphis area can keep an eye out for such an object in the sky. It might possibly be one of our own aircraft, keeping watch over the skys in this area during this troubled time. If so, it seems to be a remarkable craft indeed. Of course, I have no way of knowing if the shadow flitting across my lawn was related in any way to the object I spotted a few minutes later in the sky. When I got home this evening, I saw that a bright light traveling behind one of the tall trees near our driveway could have produced such a moving shadow. The light would have had to have had much greater candle power than the street light, however. I've lived in this home for over a decade and have never witnessed such a phenomenon before.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

We stopped the truck (expecting to see a plane crash) and I opened the truck door and looked right at the two lights and then saw four to six more identical lights appear in succession to the left and below the second light, almost evenly spaced and forming a semi circle as the last one or two lights appeared heading back to the right. The light positions remained static, with no change or movement, and the lights remained steady with no flickering. As I grabbed my camera, all of the lights disappeared. It all happened very quickly. The lights were much bigger and brighter than any star and we saw several airplanes as we continued our trip and none of the plane lights remotely resembled what we saw.

I continued to watch the cloud, hoping the object would appear again.  But that was the last I saw of it.  I don't know what the object was, but it was definitely not a balloon.  Its movement appeared controlled. About an hour later, I heard the low rumble of helicopters flying at low altitude.

I was in the back yard on a clear day today, except for a few normal contrails and cirrus clouds.  I noticed that a swarm of insects was flying over my home, following the wind direction.  I was annoyed by this, and scanned the sky to see if I could find out where they were coming from.  A few seconds later, I noticed a white circular object in the sky, almost directly overhead.  It was about half the size of a sunflower seed at arms' length. It appeared to be self-luminous, since I could see no shading or shadows on its uniform white contour.  I quickly resolved that this was a rubber party balloon, and decided to watch it out of sheer amusement. Assuming that the circle was a balloon a few thousand feet up (which we can get from simple ratios, considering the size of a typical party balloon versus its projected size at arm's length), then the object's speed in radians/second, and therefore its implied speed, are within the normal range of wind speed, roughly 2-30mph.  But the analysis is not complete. First of all, 15-20 seconds into this boring event, the circle simply disappeared.  I don't mean that it stopped radiating and turned black, the way an airplane does as its reflective surfaces rotate with respect to the sun.  Rather, it disappeared, revealing the blue sky behind it.  I flipped my sunglasses on and off, scanning the sky around it, but found nothing.  There was at least a baseball-at-arms-length of steradial blue sky around the place where it had disappeared, so it could not have simply wandered behind a cloud.  I did not see any change in the object which might have presaged its disappearance; it simply ceased to exist.  I must admit, I have a Bachelor's in Physics, but my blood ran cold. But perhaps the ""balloon"" could have popped as a result of the cumulative thermal stresses of the high atmosphere on its rubber skin.   Originally, I had determined that this was the explanation, until just this evening, the following hit me, and my blood ran cold again:  I could tell from the way that the insects were sweeping over the roof that the wind was in a certain direction on the ground, about 5mph.  I could tell from the direction in which the cirrus clouds _and_ the contrails swept overhead that the wind direction was similar up high.  But the ""balloon"" had travelled in an apparently arrow-straight line roughly perpendicular to the wind direction.  So I would have to believe that the wind suddenly rotated 90 degrees, then 90 degrees again, between the ground and the cirrus clouds, which seems unlikely. I would note that this second fact also eliminates another possibility, which was that the circle was some form of exotic ball lightning emmanating from the local dormant volcano, Mount Konocti.  I have heard that such balls of light sometimes bubble out of the ground due to tectonic stress in the weeks prior to an earthquake or eruption.  Again, though, I would expect ball lightning to follow the prevailing wind pattern. I am left with these possibilities:  (1) The circle was high above the winds, i.e. in the mesosphere or higher.  It was simply a round satellite which for some reason popped of existence in an instant, without any signs of an explosion.  (2) The circle was not of this world, and either popped into hyperspace, or accelerated out of view so quickly that I thought it had simply ceased to exist. I do not think that this observation is meaningful or substantial unto itself.  I post it here just in case you get similar stories regrading this locale or time period.  I am reminded of similar white circles/balls which were observed in groups of 10-20 in the vicinity of Mount Popocatapetl(sp?) in Mexico.  I do not recall how such balls eventually disappeared from sight.",2001-04-01T00:00:00,38.9199,-122.7954

However, a celestial body in the northeast sky would not descent, it would appear to rise and move to the right slowly, as the Earth rotates.

I had just finished swimming in my pool.  I was toweling off when a fast moving 'golden flash' caught my eye.  I looked up and saw two extremely fast moving objects flying through the sky coming towards my North Phoenix home (trajectory was southwest headed northeast). However, the objects flew on a heading to the northwest. As the objects flew past my home, I saw a third light (object?), also golden. The objects resembled chaffe or flares, but they were not falling.  They were moving horizontally and at an extremely fast clip..  They appeared to be flying in a very tight bunch. I expected the objects to fall towards the earth, but they elevated at that time.  I then went inside to see if any explosions had been reported in the area.  I checked the net & televised news.  Nothing at this time. Immediate thoughts: Shooting stars (much too close to the ground), asteroids/space debris...errant missles from an F-16 (Luke Air Force Base is located in the direction that the objects came from, approx. 15 miles from my home). I must point out that I've seen F-16's at night and during the day. A friend used to work on them at Luke. The objects were in no way near the size of an F-16. At no time did I see traditional form to the matter that passed by. No wings, smoke or trailing airstreams. However, the objects were moving so fast that the gold color trailed. One other peculiarity, there was no sound at all. I live in a sleepy residential area and at 1:05 AM, I should have heard something from objects so close to the ground. Believe me, I am 42 and have never seen anything like this.  I have never seen a UFO, nor do I feel that I saw one (classical sense) tonight.  What I did see was something extraordinary.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

On Sept. 30, 2001 at around 8:48pm, traveling on Rt. 520W leaving Holmdel approaching Marlboro my family and I observed a very bright stationary light in the sky.  It caught our attention because it was raining and of course cloudy and we knew it could have not been a star or the moon. When we first sighted it this bright light seemed to be about 2 miles West of us.  As we got closer to it, it seemed to be like the U.F.O. that we always see in the movies, disc like and with many very bright lights around it.  When we finally reached it we passed right under it and seemed to almost look like an airplane except the bottom of the 2 wings each had 3 square windows with very very bright lights.  At first we were joking in the car ""oh look that looks like an U.F.O."" and we laughed.  After we passed this object (which was still stationary) about 1/2 mile, we see this object make a semi-circle turn faster than anything I ever seen fly.  All of the sudden this object is again in front of us.  Now we are getting a little scared because this object kept following us.  Every time we made a turn and or passed trees, we would think that we would lose it, or IT lose us and the object again would speed up and catch up to us.  Now we are really scared so we used our cell phone to call the relatives whose home we had just left in Holmdel.  But could you imagine calling your brother-in-law and telling him ""we think we are being followed by an U.F.O, please stay on the line until we get home"".  We lost connection but then we called our relatives back and they stayed on the line until we got home.  As soon as we pulled into our driveway in our home in Manalapan this object disappeared and we didn't see it again.  After 45 mins. of contemplating whether to report this to the police or not, because of course they are going to think that I'm crazy, I finally called the police and they said ""we have so many air force activity right now that it was probably something related with the air force.

She said she had seen it for some time and it hadn't moved (give or take an hour or 2 that we where trying to find our way down those back roads) I couldn't see it so I stopped and got out and had her point it out, it still looked like a plain and was headed pretty fast opposite the direction we where driving. We get back in and head down the road and converse back and forth about it until are lights start flickering and going off, they did that for about 10 mins off and on until I turned the brights off and spead the car up, later down the road it happened again, and again an hour later. It hasn't happened since. The car is a '91 mercury cougar if it helps any and there was a digital clock but it was unaffected. Nothing else was effected by the lights and we where about 15 miles from a town both ways when it first happened.

I looked up as well and saw a white ball of light that was gliding across the sky with such perfection. This lasted for about 3 seconds, and then the light seemed to fade away really quick, as if the light scattered across the sky. I have seen meteor showers, and this looked nothing like it.

Chased pointlessly by naval jet air I am only writing in the hopes that you will pass this along to the person riding a jet from Vanouver to LA and had basically passed over my residence when he-she saw a strange craft and has always wondered if it was a 'sun dog'. Please relate this factual series of events.  I lived on an island in the Washinton  (US) Sa Juan Islands. My folks had gone to the mainland shopping for school clothes and I stayed home. Late in the morning, almost noon I was going to go check on our cattle and then take the dog down to the beach and throw sticks for him (he loved to swim after stcks).  As I rounded the back of the house for some reason I looked up and rather than the usual eagle or hawk that triggers the peripheral vision response, I saw something a bit out of the ordinary no jet although they were always to be seen flying far overhead, rather I saw a huge disk shaped object (relatively slowly meandering across the sky.  Of course I was fascinated and started to run through my mental inventory of what kind of aircraft it could be when it suddenly traveled south at such a speed as to boggle ones senses (I knew about G forces and such and I couldn't equate that anything could move so fast from a near motionless state (no flames of rocket or contrail or such).  Well it disappeared over the horizonto the south and I just stood there staring, my dog bumped my leg and he was staring too. (He liked to chase anything in the air, a would run around undernearh birds, stare at planes and such...a Spaniel with a natural affinity for airborne creatures.  So just as we started down the drive the 'thing' reappeared moving fairly rapidly back toward us (northerly direction) when it was about halfway toward us a flight of jets came over the horizon in pursuit. I surmised they were from the Whidbey Island naval Air Station.  This slightly dull silverish/gray disk got almost directly overhead at a fair height I guestimate 20,000 to 25,000 ft when the jets almost  (within a mile or two) reached the object. It then went straight up an! d dwindled to the size of a pin just before it vanished in the stratosphere.  The jets had hit their afterburners and were climbing in chase on long tails of flame. It was really quite spectacular. Then when the thing disappeared and the jets reached their ceiling, they banked off to the south presumably to return to Whidby Island.  I've only mentioned it to a few people over the years more as an anecdote than to any purpose, because I don't personally care what people believe as long as they don't try to shove theirs down my mental craw. So please...I've always believed in them because of this event...but tell the person who is living in doubt, tweren't no sun dog or St Elmo's fire or a curious behaving weather balloon, Alice. It was a large disk shaped object that performed aerial maneuvers that even today would be impossible for humans to match. (We'd have been splattered all around the inside of the thing). And since there was no evident mode of propulsion one would have to presume that the drive was gravitational  They'd have to have control over gravity to negate the g forces.  So such is life, sorry no abduction or strange probings, no photos and my dog, Thumper, the only other witness is long since in that happy field and stream in the sky. So now you have it and my conscience is clear and free.   Oh, I forgot to mention it was completely noisless although many seconds later the sound of the jets reached us. The object traveled very quietly, wouldn't that make airports nicer to live near? ((NUFORC Note:  The date indicated for the event may be exact, but we are not sure.

I noticed that there was a mysteriously looking circle of clouds around the moon.  If you would look at the moon, the radius of the circle would be about the size of a pinky. Its colors were also unusual to see in a dark sky, you could make out colors of red and green, sort of like a fading rainbow.  We also noticed that it changed its diameter a couple of times on a small scale.  Immediately I called my mother who lives in Northeast Philadelphia, and she confirmed seeing the same thing.  To my surprise when I called 3 of my friends in Brooklyn, NY, they said that they saw the mysterious circle as well even though they were about 80 miles away from where we were.  Inside of the circle there was no sign of other clouds at all, but outside of it there were some scattered, but the circle itself was separated from them.  It finally started to fade away around 0200 on Sunday morning, December 1,2001.  My girlfriend's sister had also noticed this phenomena who was in Northeast Philadelphia at the time. I was also wondering where I can find out if more reports were made regarding this event.  I am aware that reports were made in the past years of mysterious clouds appearing, and some thought it was UFO's. I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

It was just to our right when it stretched out and there were a series of colored lights- red, blue green, yellow, and not in a staight line.  From a few, there appeared to be a vapor-like trail.  As I looked at it , it was about 6-8 inches long in my field of vision, of course it was away from me and up, so it was actually many feet long. The lights were in up and down positions, not in a single line. THEN, the object again resembled a stealth, with a few trailing lights. It started slowly turning on its side,like it was banking to turn.  At this time it was directly in front of our line of vision.  The object got large, about 3-4 times the size of a stealth and had three lights on the underside- red, blue and maybe green.  The underside looked whitesh or light grey.  It PAUSED in front of us, in that position. My friend then ran in to get her husband.  The next thing I saw was it going behind Hershberger Peak, which is directly in front of my line of vision.  There were only a few colored lights at this time.  There was a large orange, glowing light which wasn't there before.  It was about 3-4 times the size of the other lights I had seen and there was a long straight vapor-like trail.  It went behind the southern edge of the peak at about a 30 degree angle.

As it passed the lights seemed to glow with different colors (Orange to Red, Green to Blue, and Gold).  It was hard to get a good view of what the exact shape of the object(s) were.  However, we were able to make out what seemed to be an outline of the central object.  It looked tubular (almost like an airliner fuselage or a missle).  The central object's outline looked much longer than any commercial or military aircraft (I've seen C-5s up close and this looked bigger). We slowed enough to role down our windows and listen...no sound from where we were.  The objects seemed kind of ""hazy"" and yet were pronounced enough to see points in the sky in addition to the presumed outline of the main body. We watched as the objects moved to the North out of our view.  From the backside, it seemed that the lights had more of a green hue than orange or gold.  Although our vantage point may have been poor to determine altitude, it really seemed like not more than 10,000 feet.  It seemed like it was an object that would land (rather than crash) because the nose seemed to be pointed upward from the tail as it traveled from South to North. We went home and immediately tried calling News Stations (all busy).  I reached the Air National Guard after hours Security Office who referred me to the Tulsa International Airport Tower Security.  TUL stated that it was a Satellite that fell out of orbit and crashed in Kansas.  That was mindboggling as we had seen the objects less than 10 minutes before and we are 70 miles south of the Kansas line.  The objects certainly did not seem to be traveling fast enought to descend and crash somewhere in Kansas.  That's neither here nor there. Nevertheless, KJRH News reported it in the news broadcast as a crashing satellite. KOTV News reported it as ""space junk.""  KTUL didn't report it until Sunday, December 2, 2001 as a Russian SL-12 Rocket re-entering the atmosphere.  KTUL said it probably did not crash to the ground, but burned up before it hit the ground.  KTUL went on to clarify that if the object did hit the ground, it probably crashed somewhere in Kansas.   If so, I want to see pictures of the crash site.  I want to know what satellite or rocket it was, and why it's crashing over U.S. soil. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

I looked up and just above the lake there was triangle shape figure hovering motionless above the lake.

It was like a neon blue but it wasnt very bright.  I was so in aww of the object i remember looking at my buddy, he had this wierd look on his face like he couldnt believe what he was looking at.  I quickly looked back to the object.  I couldnt say a word.  The object hovered there for about 10 seconds, we didnt say a work.  Then very slowly it began to move.  It was heading toward the south side of the lake.  All of the sudden it began to increase speed very quickly and within a second or 2 it completely dissapeared.  We both looked at each other and said what in the hell was that?  We were both very frightend.  We imediatly decied to pack up out stuff and leave.  We were very skeptical to speak of the incident at work, because we knew people would laugh and think we were crazy, so we just told family and friends.

I am a married man with one eleven-year-old child. I have a M.A. degree in history. I am currently employed as a manager of a hedge fund. I am also a writer of short stories and novels. My wife is a former filmmaker and an animal rights advocate. It was a clear evening at approximately 7:00. I was sitting on my back porch with my wife. We were talking, and I looked to the west. I noticed what appeared to be three or four seagulls flying in close formation towards us. The ocean is very close, and it is not unusual to observe sesagulls flying in the area. I have seen them many times in the past. However, this time I instinctively stood up to see better because they were flying at a very rapid speed. I remember remarking to my wife that they were flying much faster than seagulls were capable of flying. The objects flew within approximately a fifty feet of my house. I remember thinking that there must have been a very powerful sea breeze above us because the objects were so fast. I noticed that the objects were oblong with short wings (I am not sure about the wings) that did not move. As the objects whizzed past me, I was amazed by how rigid and metallic they looked. My wife still believes the objects were seagulls. She, however, did not notice them as soon as I did, and she did not stand up to really look until they had almost passed by. The entire time frame of the sighting from first seeing what I thought were birds to their flight past our house was maybe five-to-ten seconds. That's what I found so amazing because I first saw them a couple of blocks away coming from the direction of the ocean. Birds just do not move that fast, and they were so low in the sky, i.e., maybe fifty-to-hundred feet over roof tops, that I could clearly see them. The three or four objects, which were flying in a perfect, tight formation, were small but bigger than seagulls. I will never forget thinking how unusual it was for those birds to be moving so rapidly in such a tight formation without flapping their wings, and how awe! struck I was when they passed in front of me. They were metallic and looked like some kind of gliders that were on a mission. I remember thinking (my first thought when I noticed their metallic nature) that they were probably extraterrestrial reconnaissance flights surveying the city. I have always been a believer in the existence of alien life, and I have always wanted to see some evidence of it. Since it happened, I have had second thoughts about what it really was. However, it is something that I cannot dismiss because the experience stays with me, and the objects were metallic. I did run to the front of the house to see more after they passed by, but they had disappeared. I thought this unusual too because of the speed by which they disappeared. My eleven-year-old son, who was inside the house, heard me remark about them, and he ran to the front of the house before I did. He saw them for an instant, and he agrees that the objects were not birds, but rather some kind of solid objects that disappeared in a flash. Also, they made absolutely no noise, and I found that to be unusual considering the rate of speed at which the objects traveled. They passed within several feet of the front of my house. I certainly would have heard a noise if they made one. I must say that UFO experiences are very mystifying simply because they catch one offguard and happen so quickly. You do not have time to collect your thoughts.  Then, you experience self-doubt because what you've seen violates the known laws of physics, traveling a distance of a half mile to one mile in seconds without any noise or observable means of propulsion. They looked to be gliding in a smooth pattern but at a very rapid speed. I cannot imagine how the objects I saw were man-made. They moved too fast, without any noise, without any engine glow, and without any exhaust. The three or four objects looked like highly polished silver/copper-colored oblong objects. They flew in perfect unison and moved very rapidly. I will never forget how amazed I was with the ! rich-loo king metallic appearance of the objects. It was a beautiful metallic color that I had not seen before. The objects looked very well-designed with an appearance of substance and strength. I am just now reporting this incident because it is something that I cannot forget. I often times think about how strange the metallic objects were, and I believe it is worthwhile reporting something that I consider to be other-worldly, especially after thinking about it for so long.

My wife spotted the object first and, curiously, I had seen the same object a week before except it was about 5000 feet altitude and a mile off to the south headed SSE. More baffling is that in August of '98 when my daughter (age 12 at the time) and I were camping at Cougar Reservoir (West slope of the Oregon Cascades, roughly central Oregan) she pointed out the very same type object as it passed over our campground at about 100 knots and 200 feet altitude. She was old enough to know it was a craft not from this Earth and got really scared and began to cry, thinking it was going to come back. A strange side to this report is that as the object passed overhead an Oregon State trooper came roaring into the campground and the overlook across the reservoir.

I was in the passenger seat.  Myself, the driver and another passanger all saw the same thing.  We kept seeing this really bright light over the road several miles ahead.  It was in the middle of nowhere and at first we thought it was some kind of plane, or airport.  But then we kept seeing it going back and forth so we figured that it was an overpass and we were seeing trucks cross over.  But when we got closer we realized it was something else.  It was literally swooping right through the traffic -which was fairly heavy considering it was 3:32 am in the middle of nowhere.  It had 3 bright white lights and when it would swoop from east to west over the highway it would shine an incredible bright beam down onto the road and surrounding ground.  Then after it swooped through the traffic and rose again the beam and the 3 white lights would go off and it would turn to one red blinking light.  It was not blinking consistently the same.  The speed at which the red light was blinking was changing, sort of like Morse code and I wondered if it was some sort of pattern.  Then it would flip around and back to the starting point.  I've NEVER seen anything move like that.  It was truly bizarre.  It turned in all directions, end over end and side over side.  It was very graceful and smooth.  It didn't jump at all.  It kept repeating this pattern.  We passed under it and kept traveling south.  When we drove under it, it was very high up with the red blinking light and it was flipping back to the starting point again.  We watch it make several passes.  At least 10.  We continued to watch it until we were out of site.  We travel back through the area almost exactly 48 hours later, there was nothing there.

It was a beautiful night with small clouds and patches of sky in between.  There was an oval of diffused white light which appeared to be coming from behind the clouds.  Only th outline or the rim of the object was illuminated. It seemed as if it were over New Jersey, but I could not see any beams of light coming up from the ground. I moved away from the door and windows to turn out the terrace lights--literally an instant--and when I looked again it was gone.  I watched the sky for a couple of minutes and all of a sudden I could see it again.  It appeared as if it switched the lights on and off and had been there all the time.  It had just not been illuminated which is why I could not see it.When the lights came on again, they started off a soft lavender color and then went to pink and possibly green.  Again very diffused soft colors.  Photographs I have seen of the aurora borealis came to mind.  But this light was stationery.  No movement  The first time this light turned off was 3:04 in the morning. I believe it turned off once or twice again. I believe that one time it turned off when a helicopter went down the Hudson River.  After the helicopter was out of sight three balls of light (one at each end of the oval and one in the middle) flew away from the central light and instantly disappeared. They flew faster then any plane  I have ever seen.  I believe this happened at least three times.  The closest visual analogy I could make is the huge craft that the scientists played the music for in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""  As a matter of fact this object looked exactly the same.  My friend was sleeping soundly during this so I called WCBS and ABC (whose studios overlook the same  part of New Jersey as I do ). I wanted to see if anyone else had phoned in after seeing this.  The people at both numbers were polite but obviously didn't believe me.  At 3AM I'm sure that many of th! eir call s are from people who are far from sober.  My friend heard me on the phone and woke up.  I excitedly told him what had happened, but since there was nothing in the sky now he had difficulty understanding what I was talking about.  However, as we were watching the sky, I saw a faint light, then two.  Once I brought them to his attention, he could see them, but since he hadn't seen the entire object as I had, they didn't mean much to him.  As I noticed a third light appearing, they suddenly flew off whoosh into the skies behind us. That he saw.  He couldn't figure out any logical explanation either nor could I.  I am aware that people in Virginia and some of the other southeastern states had seen something which was described as a fireball in the week prior to my experience.  What I saw was nothing like a fireball.  It was almost as if someone were projecting a slide from ""Close Encounters"" onto the clouds. I am retired, although I am only 55 years old.  I was the president of a company which  manufactured women's clothing. The most unusual thing I have ever seen in the sky was what I believe was a fireball over the Pacific off Tahiti.  The reason it was described as a fireball was that it looked like a bright meteor travelling horizontally.  What I saw over New Jersey was not a natural phenomena.  It was perfectly shaped and would appear and disappear as if someone were flipping a switch. I am terribly interested in knowing if anyone else saw this that night.  There are millions of people in New York.  Granted few are looking at the sky at 3AM, but someone had to see this.  It was huge.  I would also like to know about other sightings of objects similar to this. In the space for number of craft seen, I answered four.  I decided on this figure because I saw one huge craft and no more than three others at any one time.  However because three craft flew off at least three times, I have no way of knowing if they were different craft each time.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I had arrived home late from a social occasion (I was completely sober though). From my back yard, looking north-west, I was taking a look at Mars which in recent months has been very bright.(I'm in the southern hemisphere remember). There was about one half of the moon showing and the night sky was virtually clear of cloud cover. As I stood watching, a light appeared out of nowhere at about the one-o'clock position, travelling east-west, and probably 80 degrees up from the horizon. It travelled to about the ten-o'clock  position and changed direction, without changing speed, and headed north. After a few seconds heading north it faded out, just the way it had faded in; like someone using a light dimmer switch. Now just a few more details: The colour of the UFO was a uniform yellow-orange glow. There were NO flashing lights as per conventional aircraft. An ""arrow-head"" form was discernible behind the glow. In size it appeared about 4-5 times larger than Mars appeared that night (it actually crossed close to my view of Mars so this was easy to judge). When it changed direction it did not change speed or bank into the turn, (it was like it bounced off a wall at right-angles!!!). It did not appear to change altitude during the time I observed it. Its altitude was difficult to judge but I would say at least 12-15,000 feet. Its speed was much faster than I have seen any aircraft travel yet slower than a meteor,(""falling star""). It had no ""tail"" like a meteor. There was no sound associated with the event that I could hear. It was moving as it faded in and out; that is I could see it moving before it reached its maximum brightness and I could still see it moving as it dimmed to invisible. I have seen numerous UFOs over the years but this is the first one that impressed me so much that I felt I had to make the effort to report it to someone.(Someone who wouldn't laugh anyway). I have scientific training (analytical chemist) and I'm well read in areas of physics and astronomy. I can with confidence rule out that I saw any of the following on this occasion: a conventional aircraft, space debris, meteor, satelite, space shuttle, space station (esp MIR), balloon,(weather, hot air or other), searchlight, flare, fireworks. In short I cannot ascribe what I saw to any man made device or phenomena. Unfortunately, I cannot say what it is that I saw either, only describe it as I have.

July 27th, 2001 While Driving Home From my GirlFriends house at 12:45, I was heading northbound on Meridian Road in between Ustick and McMillan.  While coming to the stop sign at the intersection of Meridian and McMillan I saw a Green light coming from the field northwest of the intersection. It was about 50 feet high in the air, moving parallel with McMillan about 40 feet north of the road.  It was coming towards me and then the Green light dissapated.  I could still tell their was an object flying in the sky and when it came to the point where it was going to cross meridian road, it banked and turned 180 degrees and was then heading west.  I was probably fifty yards from the craft.  Then, the belly of this diamond craft lit up like white lava and radiated very bright light on the ground.  As soon as the craft lit up, it dived for the ground and then pulled up back to about 50 feet from the ground.  Then the plasma light on the belly completely shut off.  I saw It then bank, and turn another 180 degrees and it was coming towards me again, still moving parallel with McMillan coming towards meridian road.  Then the Front of the craft illuminated it's front ""Head Lights.""  It had three very large lights on the front of the craft.  The lights remind me of lights in a Football stadium.  The middle light was slightly higher then the other Lights on each side.  Then the Diamond shaped UFO started to radiate colors from the end of its wings.  Not blinking lights like an airplane, But slowly appearing light that gradually became brighter in color.  I beleive the first color was blue, then red then green.  It took about 5-7 seconds for each color to come on very dim, gradually become brighter and then dim out-to start the next color.  After the green color on the edges of the UFO dimmed, the front headlights shut off, the UFO banked and turned again, the belly lit up and the CYCLE repeated itself.  Instantly I knew I had encountered it again.  Absolutely nobody was on the desolate farming roads except for me.  I had a sensation ! of an ov erwhelming feeling that I needed to leave the area ASAP.  The only logical thing I could think of doing was to drive where lots of people were, so I headed towards boise down McMillan street at a very fast pace. July 28 2000. While coming home from work at 1:20 in the morning on a late thursday night (Friday morning),  I saw the exact same UFO I had just described.  Except this was the first time I had ever encountered a UFO.  The exact coloring, shape, plasma bottom, three head lights and the cycles of going in circles  were all the same.  But, I didn't recognize it untill I pulled into my driveway at home.  It was probably 100 yards away from me and the three headlights (It was so bright, that Is all I could see)was coming straight for me.  I scrambled inside of my house, and paced back in forth in disbeleive of what it was.  I  kept seeing the craft fly about 30 feet high off of the ground on my street where my house resides.  I quickly woke my father up to tell hime about the flying crafts outside of our house.  He woke up and walked outside with me.  Nothing was their.  He went back to bed thinking I was insane.  About 20 minutes later I heard the distinct humming noise this diamond craft makes and I immediately went back to wake my father up.  We went outside again and the craft was farther off in the distance.  Within a minute or so the craft was in our back yard, doing the cycles and my dad was so scared, he ran in the house (of course I did too).  We peeked out of our windows and watched the craft for about an hour and a half, going back and forth inside and outside.  While watching the UFO, it did it's cycles in three spots within about a couple of miles.  The first cycle was right near our house.  Then the craft would fly about 2 miles southeast and do some cycles  there.  Then the UFO would go directly west and do more cycles and then come back to our house, (northeast) and continue its cycles.  Three different spots of continuous cycles and then repitition.  This lasted for nearly 2 hours..... The UFO was quiet large.  I would say it is bigger then an average size home, Especially the width.  For how big it was, It meandered through the air like a hang-glider.  For something that big to be flying 50-60 feet off of the ground and turning around and diving towards the ground, ruled out any logical explanation of what I think it could be.  I also realized that when I had come across the UFO for the second time, it was one day away from being exactly one year from when I saw the first one.  The only thing I can conclude, is that both experiences happend on the last thursday night (Early friday morning) of July 2000 and July 2001",2001-08-05T00:00:00,43.60516381909548,-116.40865226130653

After banking or whatever they did they dissaperd behind a large pecan tree in our front yard. the sighting lasted approx. 6 seconds.There was no sound or wind at the time , skies were clear.They were approx 1 thumnail at arms lenght after  banking. They moved west to east we were facing north They were approx. 30 to 35 degrees above the north horizon.I would guess the distance at apporox. one mile or so but could have been more.This sighting was very upsetting to my husband and myself.

The house is located within one mile of the route 79 E exit off of I-15 some 30 miles N of Escondido, CA, near the Pechanga Casino.  Looking at the stars, the man noticed that three stars were in motion.  They appeared to form an equilateral triangle as they flickered and moved to the South horizon.  The triangle subtended a huge arc of the sky(a distance between 10:30 and 1:30 elevation )  This huge spread attracted the man's attention and he told his girl friend to look at this phenomenon.  Both were quite amazed and emotional. They both observed for five minutes.  During this time the leading star-like object stopped and the other two objects fell in line behind it.  They then faded away as they got low on the horizon. The man is a military veteran and held secret clearances.  The night was very clear with the Milky Way visible.  He had never had an experience such as this and has viewed the night sky many times in the past around the world.  This witness volunteered he was not drinking.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

I was out playing catch with my dad at dusk, when I noticed a bright object, nearly due south of my house, appear very near & below the moon (within the diamater of the moon below the moon) in the sky.  In appearance, it looked like a meteor or light reflecting off of a missile or the fusilage of a shiny airliner. In this first object, there was a bright light at the front, and two smaller lights very close in a line behind (in reference to its direction of travel), which made it appear to be the tail of a meteor (but they did not change in relationship to the front light, so I've pretty much ruled that out). The lights were nearly the same color as the yellowish-red type of street light (high pressure sodium, I believe). There was no sound, nor was there a vapor trail. The object traveled in a mostly west & slightly south direction. When the object reached approximately south-southwest of my house, the 3 lights appeared to move closer together, until you could only see 1 light. This 1 light appeared to grow *at least* 4 times brighter than the 3 lights combined. It stayed bright for a period of time, maybe 10-15 seconds, then it dimmed to the brightness of the original light (the one in front without the 2 behind). It continued to move in the same mostly west, slightly south, direction until it faded out of sight (presumably from going further away). Just before the first object faded out completely, my dad looked at the spot where it appeared, just below the moon, & saw another object. This second object was *identical* in appearance & motion, including having the 3 lights combine into one, grow bright, & continue west until fading out of sight. At a similar interval (just before the second object faded completely), the third object appeared. It was sighted just above & to the left of the moon & traveled in exactly the same direction & approximately the same speed as the first two objects (presumably it was in pursuit). This third object was quite obviously a plane, as vapor trails and wings were evident. However, the leading edge glowed in 3 places a *bright* red, approximately the same hue as a bright red car, or a fresh cherry. I assume the bright red in front, was a reflection of the now set sun. I am no expert in finding velocities of flying objects, but if all three were plane sized, I approximate their speed at around 5-600mph, & an altitude of 30,000 to 45,000 feet. At no time did any of the objects change speed or direction of flight. My very first impression of these objects was that they were planes that had the setting sun's light reflecting off of them. But there were no vapor trails (except for the 3rd object), no strobe lights, no sound & no wings or tail (except the 3rd object, where we could clearly see wings). A few moments later an airliner flew directly overhead & it was very clear that this was an airplane, we could see the full length of the fusilage, the tail, both wings & a vapor trail. But the first two objects are very puzzling to us; they definitely fit the under the category of Unidentified Flying Objects. If this description isn't detailed enough, or you would like me to make drawings of what I saw, I would be glad to answer any questions or send drawings if you contact me by phone, mail, or (preferably) e-mail.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,38.0439,-100.7561

The shape was odd in that the bottom portion was somewhat oval, but like an oval tilted with an appendage attached to it. The appendage was triangular in shape, but seemed attached to the tilted cylinder like a sail. The point of the sail pointed to what would be south/west. The object did not move at all for about 15 seconds as I watched it, before running into the house to call my wife to come look. She came out immediately, by which time the object seemed to have moved far to the north/northwest and appeared only as a bright circle.  As we watched it suddenly got smaller and smaller and faded out and disappeared, all within about 6 or 7 seconds. I have never seen a UFO before, and don't know if I saw one this time, but this was by far, the oddest object I have ever witnessed in the sky.  My wife and I were both amazed.

THE LIGHT WAS STATIONARY & I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT LANDING LIGHT, A SEARCH LIGHT OR POSSIBLY A TOWER LIGHT BUT REALIZED THAT IT WAS TOO HIGH ON THE HORIZON TO BE A TOWER LIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS STATIONARY. AT THIS TIME AND FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MILES, THE LIGHTS DID NOT CHANGE IN SIZE OR INTENSITY. THERE WERE BLINKING RED & GREEN LIGHTS DIRECTLY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BRIGHT CENTER LIGHT FLASHING IN A REGULAR PATTERN AND APPEARED TO BE DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE CENTER LIGHT RATHER THAN OFFSET FROM IT. WHEN I EXITED I95 AT EXIT #25 SOUTH, I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BEHIND TWO OR THREE OTHER CARS & TRUCKS THAT HAD ALSO STOPPED TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT, I WATCHED AS IT BEGAN TO MOVE DIAGONALLY FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST VERY SLOWLY IN THE DISTANCE.  AT THIS POINT I EXTED MY TRUCK AND OBSERVED IT FROM THE ROADSIDE ON FOOT WHILE SPEAKING TO YOUR OFFICE VIA CELLPHONE. IT THEN CHANGED DIRECTION AND FLEW ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. AT THIS POINT I COULD SEE THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT FROM BELOW AND IT APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE A WEDGE OR CHEVRON WHEREIN I COULD MAKE OUT WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PAIR OF SWEPT WINGS ATTACHED TO A CENTER FUSILAGE WITH SOLID WEBBING BETWEEN THE WINGS AND THE FUSILAGE.  THE LENGTH OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE VISIBLE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE EQUALATERAL WITH A SLIGHT CURVITURE OF THE WEBBING AT THE TRAILING EDGE.  ALL OF THE UNDERSIDE SURFACES OF THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE EQALLY WELL LIT WITH A DIFFUSED LIGHT AND THE SURFACES APPEARED TO BE SILVER-GREY BUT CLARITY AND LIGHT QUALITY FADED AT THE PERIFERY OF THE OBJECT.  THERE WERE NO DICERNABLE MARKINGS OR OTHER INDICATORS ON THE OBJECT OTHER THAN THE VISIBLE ""WHITISH"" LIGHT NEAR THE LEADING POINT OF THE OBJECT AS WELL AS THE BLINKING RED & GREEN LIGHTS NEAR THE LEADING POINT. THE CLEAREST DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT I CAN RENDER AS IT FLEW OVERHEAD IS AS THOUGH SOMEONE SHINED A SPOTLIGHT DIRECTLY UPWARD AT THE UNDERBODY OF A SWEPTWING AIRPLANE AND ONLY ILLUMINATED THE CENTER PORTION OF THE PLANE. THE OBJECT FLEW VERY SLOWLY OVERHEAD AND APPEARED TO PROCEED IN AN ELLIPTICAL PATH FROM SOUTH TO NORTH THEN SOUTH AGAIN RATHER THAN CIRCULAR SINCE THE VISIBLE CHANGE IN DIRECTION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATE AND DIDN'T APPEAR TO ALLOW TIME FOR A WEST TO EAST ARC. THE PATH OF TRAVEL BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF FOUR BASKETBALLS (WHEN HELD AT ARMS LENGTH).  THE MOON WAS NOT VISIBLE (AS A REFERENCE OBJECT) FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT AND THERE WAS AT LEAST ON STREET LIGHT NEARBY AT THE COMMUTER PARKING AREA. THERE WAS NO DICERNABLE SOUND FROM THE OBJECT AS IT FLEW OVERHEAD.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT OR ITS RELATIVE SPEED. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY SLOWLY WHEN CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE CLARITY AND SIZE OF THE VISIBLE UNDERBODY AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD. THE RELATIVE SIZE FROM MY VANTAGE POINT WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE SIZE OF A QUARTER WHEN HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. THE SKY WAS EXTREMELY CLEAR WITH SEVERAL CONSTELLATIONS CLEARLY VISIBLE. UNTIL I SAW THE UNDERBODY, I THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY THE OBJECT WAS A POLICE OR SEARCH HELICOPTER WITH A SEARCH LIGHT GIVEN THE SLOW RATE OF SPEED, THEN WHEN IT FLEW OVERHEAD I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS POSSIBLY A SEARCH OR TRAINING FLIGHT FROM THE BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION. BUT REALIZED THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE, GIVEN THE EXTREMELY SLOW RATE OF TRAVEL. I HAVE IN THE PAST OBSERVED SWEPT WING (MILITARY) CARGO AIRCRAFT FLYING (VERY) LOW OVER THE TOWN OF RICHMOND, MAINE (AFTER THE 9/11/01 ATTACKS) TRAVELING TO OR FROM BRUNSWICK N.A.S., BUT THE SOUND COMING FROM THOSE AIRCRAFT WAS ENOUGH TO STARTLE (OR IMPRESS) YOU AS THEY FLEW OVERHEAD. TRAFFIC ON I95 WAS EXTREMELY LIGHT AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT AND THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO ROAD NOISE TO MASK THE ENGINE SOUND OF A PLANE OR HELICOPTER THAT WOULD FOLLOW AFTER A PLANE PASSED OVERHEAD.

Sister was only one who saw it on this day. She said it looked silver or metallic in color, and flew around in circles then suddenly couldnt see it anymore. My sister told me about it the next day on Mon. the 7th, and she took me outside to show me where she saw it at approx. 15:00 hrs. (3pm), and lo and behold, there it was again in the same spot ! I saw it this time, and my description is basically the same as hers -- appears to be the size of a ballon at arm's length, but I think it's more like the size of maybe half of a Volkswagen. The object looked more round than any other shape, although at one point it looked kind of oval as it would turn. The UFO was flying haphazardly like a bird fighting the wind, but definitely wasn't a bird. The UFO made no sound whatsover, and looked to be approx. 1000 ft. or lower on a clear blue sky. The Sun at this time was behind us in the west (we were lookig south at it), and whenever this object would turn a certain way towards the Sun, it would shime very brightly, as if only part of it was made of shiny metal (it didnt reflect off the Sun the whole time, just silver in color most of the sighting). I get email news updated from our local ABC News channel here in Houston (channel 13), and somebody else in Pearland on Sunday (Pearland is maybe 30 miles south of us - same direction we saw our object), and the took a video of it, which can be viewed, and their story on the ABC News Houston website).  The picture they took does look a lot like what we saw, but more rectangular than what we saw. These people said it appeared to be burning, which might be the Sun reflecting off of it like I said how it shined very brightly when it would turn towards the Sun. That's it, I'll report any more sightings promptly the same day it happens next time.

If, in fact, there was no significant rapid motion to the object, we believe that one of the first possibilities to be ruled out would be a condensation trail (""contrail"") behind a high flying airliner.

I could just see the outline of the craft in the lights from the craft and I remember saying ""Wow"" because I was so surprised how quiet it was.  It had a very soft roar.  I thought I was seeing a stealth go over.  My husband says there would have been blinking lights on it somewhere if it were an aircraft and I don't remember seeing any blinking lights.

The erratic nature of the object may be due to the fact that the video camera was not on a tripod, and was moving.  PD))",2002-01-11T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

As it travelled across the monitor it made two abrupt ~15 degree turns. I did catch it on the video tape, so if you would like a copy, I will send it.

I'm familure with the planets and with how airplanes look as they pass over. I saw nothing unusual until I looked toward the north. There I saw a bright light come on. It grew in brightness until at one point it was brighter than the planet jupiter. It only tooks a few seconds to grow in brightness, then it went out. The total time the light was on was about 8 seconds.  When it went out I could barely make out a small light that was dimmer than a very distant star and much smaller than an airplane. I watched it travel for a few seconds when another light, just like the first, came on in front of it. It did the same with the light coming on then going out. I watched them take turns doing this with several seconds in between the time one light would go bright. When the two were dim they didn't have any blinking lights on them at all that I could see. When they were nearly out of my view I saw another light, the same as the first two, come on go out but it was going in the opposite direction.  I watched it do that for several times then went to get my husband. When he came out none were to be seen, even though the 3rd light should have been visible.

I am guessing that  ""Morvain Falls,"" as stated in the report, must be a typo since (according to  my maps) there is no such town in NC.   There is, however a small town called  Moravian Falls, and it is approximately 25 miles north of Hickory, where I  live.   I don't know if anyone with your organization has followed up on the report.   I tend to agree with your comment that if a UFO had crashed there, it is  likely that there would have been other reports at that time.  However, since  I do live near the area and had occasion to drive out to the site in question  last Thursday (3/1/01), I made a point to look around to see if there was  anything unusual.  (Granted, this was nearly 3 weeks after the sighting was  reported.)  I did not see any signs of a crash at all.  In fact, the  construction site mentioned in the report is about ten feet or less from a  well-travelled highway, so I believe it would be difficult for something like  that to go unnoticed in a town of that size.

No visible body even when illuminated by lightning. Saw from commercial airliner. I was on a SW airline flight from San Jose to Phoenix, ~35,000 ft and 500 knots. I don't know the exact location because the plane flew futher west than usual to avoid a thunderstorm. We were over CA 15 minutes before because I recognized all of the city lights from the San Jauquin valley. Then everything went black, so I assumed we went far enough east to be in Nevada. I was looking at the lightning going mostly cloud to cloud in a 50 mile wide thunderhead to the east at about 40,000 feet. Then I saw red and green lights fly at a 90 degree angle to the plane (I was on the left side of the plane, and it was flying east. I assume we were flying south). It was flying at about 20,000 ft. I watched it for a few seconds, and didn't think much of it until I noticed how fast it was going. I spent four years in the Air Force, so I just thought it was a fighter. It was going at least 1,000 mph, because it was going at least twice as fast as other airliners going perpendicular to the one I was in. I always get a window seat and I spend most of my flying time looking out the window. Then I noticed that the lights were not flashing periodically like a plane, but randomly. Sometimes there were more than one red, and the lights didn't stay on for the same durations either. It actually looked like the whole aircraft was either red or green because I could not see an aircraft body unless it emitting either the red or green, even when lightning lit up the sky, which it did at least once. I watched it intensely. After about five seconds, it did a u-turn (changed its bearing by 170 degrees to about 280) in less than 100 milliseconds. Not only are there no planes that can do that, that stunt would have instantly killed anyone in the aircraft because of the g-forces. Then after about one-two seconds of heading almost straight toward the plane, but still 15,000 feet lower, it headed straight up to about 25,000 feet in less than one second. I figure one mile per second is 3,600 mph, straight up. Then it changed course and he! aded NE and disappeared into the thunderhead in less than one second, at a speed more then twice before. It seemed to be seeking out the lightning. In other words, If I was in an aircraft with that much capability, and I wanted to be hit by lightning, that's the exact flight path I would have took, assuming that I was coming from the west. About five minutes later, I asked the stewardess to ask the pilot if they saw anything on radar back then. They said no other aircraft in the vicinity for longer than that. After we landed, I told the pilot and he didn't seem to care and told me to report it to the FAA if i wanted to. That's all folks.",2001-08-20T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

It was a triangular and had lights on it.  The craft was fairly high but came lower as it aproached my vehicle.  It had 4 lights on the front of it.  Two of them were red and two of them were blueish white. It moved extremely slow and it made zero noise.  It literally scared the piss out of me when it hovered infront of and around my vehicle.  As it left my area I could see that it had maybe six to ten bars of light on the back.  They were as tall as the craft and I noticed that two of them were red and two of them were blinking white.  That is about much detail as I can remember.  I am still in shock.  It actually was very scary for me.  It looked exactly like something you would see on unsolved mysteries or some ufo show.  I have always believed in them but now I know they exist.  Anyway that is about all that I can say right now.

It was low on the horizon--that is, just above trees, buildings, etc. It was bright enough and big enough to be very noticable, and yet its luminosity was kind of dullish--that is, it didn't ""shine""--it had a kind of uniform brightness and tone. It had a bluish white color--very much like the moon.

I watched it move with reference to various objects on the horizon: it hovered, and moved slowly a few angular degrees both horizontally and vertically.

Feb. 5 2001. Boise Idaho. When driving southeast on Chinden Blvd at approximately 6:40 PM I noticed a set of two very bright lights about  10-20 degrees above the horizon that at first appeared to be stationary. My first impression was that this was a conventional aircraft with its landing lights on. After a minute or so I noticed the aircraft was not following the normal airport approach. (I live near the airport and have a good feel for the normal arrival and departure patterns as well as the appearance of various aircraft at night.) The aircraft proceeded in what appeared to be a straight line over Garden City directly toward west Boise. (Plotting the flight path on a map indicates that the object passed virtually directly over the state capitol building downtown.) As the object approached, a white strobe light between the two ""landing"" lights became visible. For a moment I got the impression that an aircraft was in trouble and considering Chinden as a possible landing strip. Then I got the impression that the object could possibly be a slow moving blimp or perhaps I was approaching a balloon over the fairgrounds. (I was searching for rational explanations that I dismissed one by one.) I was stopped at the intersection of Chinden and Kent Ln. (next to the fairgrounds) when the object passed overhead and to my left. I was able to roll down my car window and look up at the object. It consisted of four white lights (two bright ones on the ""wingtips"", one strobe on the ""nose"" and a dim one on the ""tail""). There were no conventional (red/green) aviation lights. There was no additional ""low flying jet"" noise above the normal traffic noise.  I caught a glimpse of the vehicle body as it passed in front of an upper level haze lit by moonlight and it appeared to be black and diamond shaped with four white lights at the tips. It was about 1 thumb width (at an arms length) from wingtip to wingtip. It also appeared to be leaving behind a vapor trial that was about the same width. It was difficult to estimate the altitude, and whether it wa! s ascend ing or descending.  Unfortunately, I could not observe the shape at length because the traffic light changed. At this point, the object clearly seemed peculiar, so I made a U-turn when I could and attempted to pursue it in the direction of its travel. The rear light was dim and the object was much more difficult to make out from the rear. I noted once again that the normal red and green navigation lights that would otherwise clearly mark a conventional aircraft from the rear were absent. The object seemed to move away and disappear much more rapidly than it approached (Probably because the brighter ""forward facing"" lights made it visible from farther away.) It disappeared over the rim of a ridge above Chinden. My total observation time was approximately 5-10 minutes. Two acquaintences of mine mentioned the next day that they also noticed some strange lights. One was traveling west on I-84 approximately 7-10 miles SW of my location. She reported that she saw strange lights moving west and south of the freeway, about 20 degrees above the horizon. The direction and time are consistent with my observations. I also monitored the sky at the same time on subsequent evenings to verify that this was not part of a routine daily jet flight.

I am acually quite nervous  sharing this information with you.  But since yesterday morning, I haven't been able to get it out of my head. The way it happened, all seemed to perfect, to be real. First, I was driving home while listening to 640AM which was educating us, the people, of this website. I get home and go straight online to look up this site, (I am always eager to educate myself; currently reading the book Chaos- Making a New Science and I also read philosophy.) While I'm researching this site, my cordless phone gives off half a ring, mind you it's about 3:30am, and I was startled. Last year I had 3 strange incidents occur with both my home number and old cell number at about the same time. I even have witnesses for those incidents. (A sound like a baby's heart through an ultra sound.) So again, I was startled when my phone rang yesterday morning. I got off line quickly, and for some reason went to go look outside my kitchen window. That's when I saw the red and white lights coming forward, yet in sort of a side to side motion. I was thinking to myself, ""no way, this can't be happening."" And continued to stare at the object to prove myself wrong of it's side to side motion. I went outside in my backyard and watched it fly over my house. It seemed to be in the shape of a triangle because of the white lights at the front point of it and on each end of what would be it's wings. On the bottom, there were two red lights that seemed to be pulsating and made a quiet humming sound. I tried to analyze it as best as I could so I would then be able to confirm to myself, that it was only a plane. But I was unable because of a glare or something from the white lights. I have no idea whether it was a ufo or not, I only know that the nature of it, seemed unfamilar to me.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,34.42961198156682,-118.57039631336404

I was walking into a friends apartment complex in downtown Dallas, TX, and looked into the sky and saw what I initially thought was someone parachuting out of a plane at a very high altitude. There were 2 objects in the sky at the time between 45 and 65 degrees off the horizon. One closer (the parachute) and the other was further away (what I thought was the plane). I thought that this guy was crazy because this was in the middle of Dallas and it was very high up. This was going to be on the evening news for sure. I ran inside and got my friend who came out and I showed him and what appeared to be a parachute. When I returned it changed into a circular silver/white object that didn't represent the first object that I had seen, but still remained in the same location. I was gone about 15 seconds. The two objects matched each other now in color, size and movement. I asked my friend what do you think it is.. He said ""a plane of course."" We turned around and I showed him a plane in the sky that was moving at a high altitude 180 degrees from the location of the objects. No comparison. The two objects were moving very slowly together in a northerly direction. Their movements were very calm and not jittery. I asked my friend if he had some binoculars or a zoom camera. He brought out a Nikon 35mm with a non-zoom lens. I was able to capture pictures of the objects, but not as close as I wish. I captured several pictures of the two objects and as they continued to move slowly across the sky an identical 3rd object appeared. Within 4 minutes all 3 objects were no longer visible. The sighting lasted a total of 10 minutes. I was able to capture about 5 pictures. Pictures will be sent in this evening (I hope!).",2001-02-18T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

She was babysitting two children, 4 yrs. old and 6 yrs. old, who were with us. My friend went into the store and I sat in my truck with the kids and waited for her. It was about 5:30 pm, and the sun was going down. The sky was very clear and still a light color but the ground was almost as dark as night. The younger child pointed into the sky and said that she saw a light in the sky, which I'm sure was the crescent moon. When I looked up to see what it was, I saw the moon, which is what I think she was looking at. Then I looked to the side of the moon a considerable distance and I saw a dark object in the sky that was shaped like a plump Hershey's Kiss, or perhaps a teardrop with a slightly flattened-out botton. It was black in a apearance with a pointed top and seemed to have an extremely faint aura around it that my friend also noticed. There were no lights on it, and it made no sound whatsoever. It was due east of us, as I was looking in the direction of the Mississippi River from the store's parking lot in the Beechwood area. I got out of my truck partway and stared at it. It moved closer very slowly at a slight angle coming from left to right. I stood and watched it for about 3 or 4 minutes. It got about 30-50% larger as it seemed to come closer. Then it stopped moving and hovered in place. At this point it seemed to be at an altitute of between 500 and 600 ft. if my speculations of distance and size of the object were correct. I watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes, and noticed that several other people in the parking lot were also staring at it. A black couple in their late twenties spoke to me briefly about it, and I asked the man if it seemed like it was about 500 yards away, no more than 1000. He agreed that it was about that far away. My friend came out of the store and watched it with me. After another minute or two, it began to slowly move upward. I drove Sharon, the kids, and myself toward the object into the lot of a strip mall about a mile closer. I stopped and got out and we stared at the object until it became too small to see. It took about 10 minutes for the object to ascend out of sight. As it rose, it did not move to one side or another whatsoever. It just moved exactly straight upwards. I estimate the diameter of the object to have been at least 15 ft. and may possible have been 3 times that size. It was difficult to estimate it's size without knowing it's true distance from us. It could not have been a balloon of any kind, because a balloon would have moved to one side or another (or gotten larger or smaller depending on your perspective, as it rose. There would have undoubtably been air currents somewhere between ground level and 1,000 ft. of altitude which would have caused a balloon to move sideways to some degree as it rose that far upwards. It could not have been an aircraft, such as a helicopter, because it made no sound, and helicopters make a lot of noise with their large props, and can be easily heard from a few miles away.

They were irregularly shaped, lumpy, and fuzzy. The best way I can summarize their appearance is to describe them as glowing jellyfish. They seemed to changed shape as they floated silently together across the sky, finally disappearing into the haze above the South-East horizon.

I noticed a very bright light in the sky, southeast of my home, and southeast of Black Mountain (I'm pretty much on Black Mountain).  At first I thought it was a star, but since I had been looking at the sky for the past few nights, this ""star"" seemed out of place.  It was very bright, bluish white, and seemed to twinkle more than than other stars.  It was bigger than the other stars, and didn't have a star shape.   I went back in the house, and came out about 15 minutes later.  The star was still there... still bright... still flickering.  I dont have a telescope, so I tried looking at this object through binoculars.  While I couldn't make out any shape, this object was a bright, bluish white light, and I could see red flashes.  I thought I saw what appeared to be other color flashes of blue and green, but those might have been illusions.  I did see clear flashes of red light, however.  Very clear.  I had never seen this in a star, so I sat and watched this object for a good half an hour, both with binoculars and without.  It just sat there.  There were lots of planes out at that hour, and the visibility in that part of the sky was very clear.  I thought maybe it was just a plane flying off into the distance, and figured I would see the light get smaller and smaller and just disappear, but it didn't.  It maintained the same level of brightness, and the red flashing lights - appearing to come from various areas of the border of the light - were very distinct.  It was definitely an unidentified object to me, so I went into the house again to see if I could locate a telephone number to call and report this.  I didn't know who to call, so looked on the internet and found your site.  Still not sure of whether to report this, I went back outside.  At that point, what I saw appeared to be gone. I'm still not sure I should be sending this in, but I figured that maybe someone else saw what I saw.  If anyone was looking at the sky tonite, surely they must have seen this.  And if others reported it as well, then numerous reports would only lend to the credibility of the appearance of whatever this was that I saw. I dont need anyone to contact me unless they need other information.  But if there's someone there who can suggest a better way to look at such objects - e.g., an inexpensive telescope; or, what to do if I should see something like this again, well I would certainly appreciate any information.

There were 3 sets in all and showed up approximately 1-2 minutes apart.  The first set, there were 3 in this first set (if i recall correctly), was travelling from south to north, from approximately the Cetus constellation through perhaps as far as the tail of Draco before fading out as if they had entered the atmosphere.  They did not burn out or burst like a meteor might, the just faded.  I was looking straight up from my location and facing east.  If I had to guess at a speed, they were moving at somewhere over 3 times the speed of sound, but nowhere near the speed of what you'd expect a meteor to travel at, and being a poor judge of speeds that high I could be way off.  They were in formation and did not appear to move apart or together.  I saw 2 more sets that were approximately the same in charateristics.  They were in formation, and they were at the same speed.

The easiest description I could give of these objects were that they looked like the effects given to photon torpedos...ya, like in star trek!

The type of object that was seen was circular in shape.  It appears as a regular star from a quick look, but once you take the time to watch closely you can clearly see how intense the light coloration can be.  I recently aquired a long range telescope for Xmas so i decided to put it to good use.  As i adjusted the lense on my telescope i noticed two distinct rings around the object.  The object was luminating so brightly that it formed an outer ring around itself. It was very clear that the object was rotating very fast.  The upper half of the circle rotated to the right, and the lower half of the object rotated to the left.  The rings had a tendency to wave against eachother as if they were on some type of axis.  The object was moving at a fast rate from one side of my lense to the other.  I also had to adjust my lense down because the object was moving farther away.  The lights of the object were in very distinct colors of red, green , blue, white, and a slight orange.  The objects movements were very sporatic in the way it moved from left to right at a high rate of speed. This object has been seen by myself and my mother for quite some time now for at least a year and a half i have made various attempts to contact observatories and other support systems and have received no response or cooperation. I truly hope that this creates some type of interest and investigation. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect this may be a description of the star, ""Sirius.""  Just a guess.

Things have gotten rather muddled over the years, but the elements I distinctly remember are standing in the back yard with my mother at about age 2 years old, while an fiery yellow- white orb, about 10 feet in diameter, came down and hovered about 2 or 3 feet off the ground in front of us. After a little while, it flew away in a kind of wavy motion toward the southeast.  I also seem to remember laying in bed afterwards while my mom spoke to a policeman at the front door.  I'm not sure how this could have actually happened. I am sure my mother does not remember it.  Our neighbors would have had to have seen such a thing. And I doubt very much whether a police report of the incident exists. All the same, I have always been afraid to go in our back yard at night. When I was about 6, we added a family room onto the back of the house, and the area it was built on was the same area where the event occurred. I have always felt very nervous going into that room at night. Still, I don't think I ""remembered"" the details of this event until I was about 11 or so and started hearing about UFOs, so it may be some kind of false memory. I honestly don't know.

He had always been a down to earth man and I could not believe what he said.  I am searching for others who may know what he was talking of.   It was 1960 something, he was with his first wife.  They were heading towards Orlando on a main highway of the time.  They were passing a lake and saw a sphere hovering over it.   He stopped and got out, stood and watched the thing for 25 or more minutes.  He said it was sphere shaped and had lights circling it around its equater.   The lights started spinning faster and it rose up just a little.  Then he said it shot off into the distance.  He said it didn't disappear, he could see it as it went into the distance, but so fast it was as if it just disappeared.   He said there was no sound of machinery and no thunder as it shot through the air.   He went on to say that others who had seen it said they had seen a pole or something in the water and that it retracted before it rose up...as if it were taking on water.   He said he saw nothing of the sort and that he had a very good view.  This was in broad daylight and is very adament that he knows there is extra terrestrial life due to what he saw.   I have known him for 28 years now and the story is so uncharacteristic, I believe him.  Can anyone give me insight as to a particular sighting that this may have been?   He said others saw it.

Does anyone else remember this event??  PD)) Brillant light engulfs Mt Rainier Campsite (1966-67) Was told I should report this to the best of my memory by friends. My parents often camped at this campsite near Tootle River (Creek?)where my father loved to fish. One evening during the Summer Months when I was about 16 yrs old after we retired to our trailer (among about 6 other trailers)we were woke up by a brillant light that engulfed the entire campsite. I was on the top bunk where I had a small window (10X24 inches) to look out of.  The light was of emmense bright light that made the trees appear almost white ... there was kinda a ""sudden low base blast sound"" which is hard to describe when it appeared (There was no visible craft to be seen - only light).  The light seem to come from straight above the campsite shining over the entire area.  My parents were sleeping in the dining/converted bed area where they had the bigger window, I remember My dad replying ""What the SH&t is that?"" and wanting to go outside which my mother urged him not too because she had a bad feeling about it, So they both stared at it through the windows. I could hear other campers making sounds of alarm and some movement.  I tried to see as much as I could through my tiny window but it was hard. Then suddenly the light blinked off and we were in total darkness again (as there were no street lights in the area).  I then heard one of the campers yelling at his family to pack up so they could leave.....hearing them drive off later.  But other campers stayed the night til morning. When we got up the following morning there was a Forest Ranger going to each of the campers asking questions and getting names of everybody. When he went to talk to my parents he said ""I heard there was a bit of excitement here last night could you fill me in"". My Mom looked at my Dad and then looked at me & my brother and told us to go down to the River, so I was unable to hear any other detail. But when we went back to the campsite, the other trailers were gone except for ours and one other.  My father refused to leave because he was determined to have his fishing trip.  That following night we were woke again t! o someth ing shaking our trailer violently which suddenly stopped as it began. We left the following morning. I don't know if this incident is searchable through Mt Rainier records or not but if someone remembers this, I sure like to find out more.",,,

All I remeber was talking about all the stars, and how we are ants in an aquarian for others to watch. We decided to go into the house and get a drink. My companion and I looked out the window and spotted the savirical ship, it was gray metallinc in color, with a set of circular cube lights on top. The squares on the top were large and one blinked on and then the next. They were multiple colors. It gave the ship the appearence that it was spinning, but it was not. One light would go on and then the next in a sequence around the ship.  My friend and I went out on the porch to look at it.  I was amazed at how large it was.  I would have to guess about 3 football fields. Some of the other girls looked but freaked when they say it.  I stood on the porch and watched, when suddenly an extremely intense blue white light came from the center, bottom of the ship and hit the ground.  We all became frighted after that and hid in the house.  We told parents the next day, but no one believed us, we were only 14 at the time. We did report it to the airforce, and police, but no response.  The part that scared me the most was the small spheres of light that came to my window two summers after I had seen the UFO.  I knew they wanted me to come out, but I was so scarred I hid.  I have since ran into people that have similar experiences, especially the glowing balls outside there window that seem to becon one to come with it..I also remember knowing somehow that this ship was a minning ship and that it was minning quaritze crystals.  I remember telling my mom to buy all the quaritze she could find because it would be very valuable some day.

This occurred in (I believe in 1975). I should add that the sky was perfectly clear. The object in question was in a stationary position above a stand of pine trees at the intersection of the two main traffic arteries. It appeared to be approximately 40-50 yards above the tops of the pines. As I noticed something in the air in close proximity , I thought to myself,  ""That's  just an airplane - Danbury Airport is just up the road"". Turning towards my right (into the curve) I looked up again at the object with a deliberate intent of identifying the aircraft (I have always been fascinated by aircraft - and simply wanted to look at what I thought would be some variant of a Piper Cub). When I actually saw the craft, what I saw resembled a hovering 40-gallon oil drum -but I estimated it to be ""about the size of a contemporary Caldillac sedan"". It had a series of three rings of blinking lights - the top revolving in one direction - the middle revolving in the opposite direction - the bottom going in the same direction as the top ring. I tried to maintain a ""back-to-the-road-back-to-the-thing"" visual contact - but at my last gaze - it simply vanished. You may think this is flight of fancy or mistaken identity, yet the next day, the sighting was FRONT PAGE news on the DANBURY NEWS TIMES newspaper. The article quoted a Danbury police officer who ran home after his shift an retrieved his video recoreder shortly after dusk  in an effort to videotape the movements of the object. This officer was an aquaintance of mine (since he had married a college acquaintance of mine) - his name is indelibly etched in my memory. I saw the video not long after the incident, and it simply showed a very shaky image of a ""spot"" of light. It seemed much as if you tried to take a video of Sirius with a rather shaky hand. Yet the fact remains that the sighting was confirmed by a credited news organization and a police officer. Anyone can scan the (well the way they did it then) microfisches of the NEWS-TIMES for 9/75 and find the reference, unless the material has been supressed. I had for years, kept a copy of the paper , but as time has gone by cannot find it at hand.

I observed 3 seperate lights in the night sky. The first was a bright white light I mistook for a star, then I noticed it was moving or started moving from south to north at an airliner like steady rate. On first seeing the light I dismissed it until I saw a couple of airplanes flying nearby and realized it wasn't lit like an airplane just one bright white light. It continued across the sky until lost to view. At this time I had been laying on a concrete bench. I resumed looking straight up at the sky and noticed another bright white light overhead. This one, as I watched, got progressively dimmer as if going up. It didn't take but a moment to fade out. It wasn't a star and I'm aware that some stars viewed directly seem to disappear. The third was, obviously, at a very high altitude, also, going south to north near the area of the faded light. This one appeared to have a slight reddish caste to it. It was moving faster than the first. My background is in mechanical drafting and design and I am an air and space buff and like all forms of airplanes, rockets and spacecraft. I know what is flying around, generally speaking. This aroused my curiousity so I thought I'd find if the internet had a reporting site and it does.

Our flight left at around 9:30 am London time. The plane was in a steady climb. Our altitude was only around 10-15 thousand feet. We had just passed above the puffy sparse clouds that were in the area. I had two windows available next to my seat. I was looking out the forward window, looking as close to straight down as I could, I saw some sort of movement between the ground and the puffy clouds right below us. As I looked closer I could see that the ground was being distorted as this object passed above it. It caused a wavy appearance to the ground. Looking closer I could see a definite line where the distortion ended, it looked like a huge contact lens, or a clear plastic disk. I watched this thing pass under three or four clouds and always continue on the other side. I could only track it so far because of the small windows on a 777. I then leaned back and could still see it in the window that was in line with my shoulder. It was traveling in the opposite direction as the airplane, and going maybe three times faster than the clouds passing below us. I watched it until I could see it no more due to the small windows. Right after it was gone I noticed directly below us a nuclear power plant. This object was traveling away from the power plant. I believe this was not a reflection as it was observed from two different windows.  It took me a few seconds to realize that what I had seen was really there. It was. I am currently having my son who lives in London for a short time longer, find out where the nuclear power plant is located so as to figure out our position and what direction we were flying.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

I had just gotten home from school when I threw down my backpack and did my usual thing as a kid by running outside to play kickball.  I lived a stone's throw from the Edgewood Arsenal in Edgewood, Maryland so I was familiar with their routine paratrooper drops and helicopter activity around that area.  It was a sunny, beautiful day with bright blue skies and cottonball-like, low cumulus clouds.  I was standing on my front porch about to run over to play with friends when a bright reflective-like flash caught my attention.  I looked (east?) over the railroad tracks and saw a chrome-colored ball just sitting in the air.  I would guesstimate that it was approximatly 500-750 feet above ground.  I remember freezing in complete silence as I immediately knew that I was observing something peculiar.  I would best describe it as a ball bearing that was highly reflective, probably 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  I remember standing as still as I possibly could, because even as a kid I must admit that I was intrigued by UFOs.  I remember thinking, ""oh my God, just be still and watch it and don't blink your eyes!!"" My parents were not home as my mother got back from work usually and hour after me, so I couldn't call for anyone.  I'm sure that if someone else had been outside nearby I would have called for them to look at it with me, but strangely nobody was outside in earshot.  The object stayed completely still for approximately 30 seconds.  I remember thinking maybe it was a balloon or a Radiosonde, because I had found one of those in a nearby patch of woods years prior. I remember feeling almost paralyzed with an anxiety-like fear.  I knew I was seeing something I wasn't supposed to.  It's almost as if my body reacted to it also.  After remaining still, the object began to move laterally, from right to left.  It was almost like it was being pulled sideways on a string.  That made me even more scared because balloons usually drift up, ya know?  As it was moving to the left, it stopped,(like putting on the brakes)an! d slowly moved back to the right, and then I had this weird feeling that it knew I was watching it beacuse it changed direction again and disappeared behind a thick cloud.  I kept watching and the strangest thing happened.  I continued staring at the cloud in hopes of seeing it come out the other side, but it seemed to poke out barely from the right edge of the cloud, almost as if it were peeking to see if I was still there watching. I got the feeling that it knew I was there. (Weird!) I continued watching to see if it would come back out but it never did. The whole episode was probably less than a minute in duration. The object never moved up or down, just perfectly sideways. I never told my parents because they wouldn't have believed me anyway. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was probably no later than seven o clock, because it was very light. She was first to notice what appeared to be a tumbling, white object. It appeared to be disintegrating, but was not throwing off light. It was traveling S-N and seemed to be on a near level path. We were in busy traffic and lost sight of it. My girlfriend noticed it because she thought it was a plane crashing! But there was no report of any crash that day, and I was aware of no one else who witnessed the phenomena. I would have loved to have watched it standing on that road instead of navigating a car through busy traffic at 40 mph! I was amazed how similar this report was to mine, and was especially intrigued by the geographic proximity of the two sightings. I had always chalked it up to a meteor, but the lack of light and the fact no one else seemed to have seen it (it was really spectacular) always puzzled me. Now I don't know what to think!

On the evening of December 1, 2001, my mother (54) and I (35) were walking our dogs when we observed an unusual aerial phenomenon.  With the exception of some high, thin clouds, the sky was clear; major constellations, such as Orion, were plainly visible.  As we were walking north on Yale Road in Richardson, Texas, between its intersections with Blake and Linda Lanes, we observed a formation of two large fireballs in the sky to the north, perhaps twenty-five to thirty degrees above the horizon, apparently accompanied by several smaller streaks of light.  They moved across the sky from west to east, at a speed similar to that of an airplane; I got the impression that they were quite distant.  One of the two larger fireballs was slightly higher than and ahead of the other; the smaller streaks, which were very faint, lay between and behind the two.  Another thin streak seemed to lead the leading fireball a small distance. I got the impression that the fireball was attached to the thin streak leading it.  No such phenomenon was observed for the lower, trailing fireball.  The entire formation was moving at a very slight angle to the ground, only a few degrees at best; it seemed almost parallel to the ground.  We observed it only briefly before it passed behind some trees and was lost.  The presence of nearby streetlamps also affected our ability to view it more clearly.  We heard no unusual sounds during the experience. During the sighting I noticed at least one aircraft pass nearby, so there may have been other sightings of this phenomenon as well. The large fireballs themselves each consisted of a large, luminous head trailed by thick contrails of smoke or vapor.  The were primarily white, but toward the end of the sighting seemed to sputter briefly red/orange, then green.  The other, faint streaks may have been smaller fireballs. Let me stress that I am certain that these were not conventional aircraft.  We live relatively near both Dallas Love Field and the Dallas/Fort Worth airport (one of the busiest airports in the world), so we see planes constantly, and are familiar with their night-time appearance.  Neither do I believe that they were alien interstellar craft.  I thought at first that they were some sort of burning objects being towed by small aircraft, given the faint streak I saw preceding one of the fireballs.  However, I saw no running lights that would indicate the streak was an airplane. At the moment, I believe that the most likely explanation is that we saw a large meteor in the process of breaking up.  The annual Leonids meteor shower occured just two weeks ago.  In this scenario, the fireballs were portions of the meteor that included low-density icy or organic materials (common to the Leonids, which are fragments of Comet Swift-Tuttle, if I'm not mistaken), while the faint streaks were smaller, rockier fragments.  This would explain the impression that they were flying in formation.  The sputtering and vapor trails would have been caused by outgassing as the objects burned up in the atmosphere.  However, this explanation fails to explain why it was moving so slowly, or why it passed across the sky at such a shallow angle.  I do know a small asteroid has been observed to do this before bouncing out of the atmosphere (in 1974), and that there is theory that hundreds of mini-comets burn up in the Earth's atmosphere daily.  Clearly, I prefer to consider this a natural phenomenon. Other possibilities -- that this was indeed several planes towing burning objects (but why?) or we witnessed some sort of government experiment.  The latter theory seems overused an unlikely.  Why test something near a major population center.  I suppose it could also have been a satellite burning up in the asteroid, or even the space shuttle, except the next shuttle mission is on hold for the moment. No, I'm not an astronomer, though I am very interested in astronomy.  I am a technical writer with degrees in history and anthropology, and I worked for more than five years as a professional archeologist.

It was basically 3 streams of light that were blue in color. Two streams were originating from the cylindrical objects.  Within the light streams were gold looking objects that on first observation looked like sparks.  Intermixed within the sparks and blue rivers of light were many round shapes which were in reds and greens.  These objects held formation.  The blue streams of light appeared to be approx.1/2 mi long though it was difficult to judge the size as it may have been very large and far away even thought it appreared to be very low and close. The whole thing was humongous.  I guessed it to be 1 1/2 mile total length and moving at a very high rate of speed.  There was absolute silence as it glided through a cloudless sky.  This was preceded by two small light sources that looked like the eyes of the craft.  We were unable to make out any structure and could only clearly see the streams of light.  The light coming from ""the eyes"" was very contained and had no light between them and the craft, and the light source did not create a beam.  They appeared to be totally independent.  There appeared to be shades of red, green and blue lights around the cylindrical objects that we could see.  When we switched off the headlights and engine to the car, it flashed a green light in our direction. Fifteen minutes prior to this sighting, we had noticed a light in the sky falling straight down towards the earth that we thought was a meteor.  We were just East and South of Winfied by Strother Field (approx. 10 miles out) when we saw this.  We drove into Winfield, and were about 5 miles North of Winfield when we turned to the West and had gone about a mile down a county road when we saw this craft.  It came from the Southwest, almost out of no where and was going very rapidly to the Northeast.  From the inside of the car, the view filled the whole windshield. At first it appeared to be 2 B1B's Bombers flying in very close and low formation.  I got out of the car because I could not believe what I was seeing and realized there was no sound.  We watched intently for the next few minutes until it just disappeared behind some trees.  We headed in the general direction and never caught sight of it again.  We tried to use our cell phone but had a huge echo and a lot of static. I am a recently retired Numerical Control Programmer for Boeing aircraft in the tool engineering department.

I first saw a cone shaped object coming towards us from west to east.  I stopped the driver and we all got out and watched as it approached and then passed by at a fairly slow speed.  As it got closer we could see that it was not a cone but a grouping of lights with one very bright light and several smaller lights with tails streaking behind them.  When I first distinguished the individual lights I thought, could this be a formation of helicopters coming towards us with search lights?  But there was no noise.  As the lights passed we jumped back in the vehicle and turned around thinking maybe we would see it go down.  We were in an area southwest of Ozona and there are a lot of canyons and high hills.  We were able to see it as it went out of sight over one of these hills.  The hills were about five hundred feet above the road we were on and because the lights disappeared over their horizon very quickly, we believe the lights were at a very low altitude.  It did not seem to change elevation.  I don't know if it is possible but it was like a slow moving group of meteors of various sizes being projected in front of us like a hologram.  When I returned to my home in San Angelo, 120 miles northwest, and began to tell this to my family, my eighteen year old son interupted and related the same sighting in San Angelo at approximately the same time as he was returning home in his jeep.

I saw an orange light, but was unable to make out any definite shape.  There was a trail behind it, much like you would see behind a comet.

It was twinkling fast and white, disappeared for a second, and reappeared flashing red, green, and white.  I called my husband and grandson to come out to the balcony to see this;  my husband had a pair of binoculars (10x25)and used them to better see this thing.

We stood there mesmerized watching this for about 45 minutes. Using binoculars, my husband was better able to the action: he observed these objects rotating each other, with two white lights in the front, and the red  and green ones on either side of the shape. One appeared to be stationary, while the others circled it. One remained ,on what we think was the surface of the water for quite some time.

Standing at the front door of my workplace looking at a family of crows [mother feeding 2 young] on a light stanchion in the parking lot next door. Behind the crows, passed a 'dirty' white light. Light was cigar shaped and appeared to be some distance away [estimate 2-3 miles] at approx 20 degrees above the horizon. Weather was mostly clear with some low morning haze rapidly burning off. Light was first seen to the ESE and traveled noiselessly in a straight line at a constant altitude to the SW. As it traveled, the light seemed to elongate and contract slightly. Sun was at the wrong angle to be causing that much reflection. Light was 'dirty' or muted white not shiny as if relected off of metal. Without taking my eyes off the light, I shouted for a co-worker to come to the door. Before she arrived the light emitted [ejected a better word] a second object. Second object looked exactly like a star at night. Compared to the large light it was just a pinpoint of bright light. 2d object left the first to the rear or in the opposite direction from the flight path of large light. Small lights path was initially approx 45 degrees downward but arcing horizontally and flattening out before I lost sight of it in the treetops across the road. 2d objects rate of speed was very much greater than the large light's speed. Large light did not seem to pause or slow as it ejected 2d light. Co-worker arrived, I pointed out large light and she said ""What in the world is that"" Light shortly disappeared in the haze to the south southwest without ever changing direction or altitude. Hard to estimate size, speed or distance to light as there were no distinguishing features to judge scale. Guessing 2-3 miles distant at 5-10,000 feet altitude. At that distance, the size of the light would have been approx the same as an commercial passenger jet fuselage but had it been a jet I would have heard it at that distance. Very possible it could have been more distant thus larger, higher and faster. Estimate speed at 1000+ mph but this would be very dependent on actual distance from me to object. Would simply classify speed as ""rapid"". I am 46, an ex-air defense artillery crewman [Vulcan] and have experience observing numerous aircraft types, in various light [reflective] conditions including military jets on afterburner or emitting IR decoy flares as well as satellites passing overhead.

The object all at once slowed down as a B-757 aircraft departed Midway airport, westbound and flew past our position.  We were amazed at this behavior, as if the object was observing the jet. The object then accellerated to the northeast and disappeared in a wink as a B-727 came into view from the east. The 727 entered the O'Hare inbound traffic pattern, flying downrange and turning 180 degrees to begin a final approach. We stood  in disbelief to what we just witnessed.  It seemed that object was right on top of the 727 and then just vanished. Based upon my 25 years in the airline industry, knowing aircraft performance, physical characteristics and traffic patterns flown by commercial aircraft in this area, I have never seen such a strange object or vehicle in this area. I am quite certain the object  was not a military or commercial aircraft. Based upon the following observations: 1) Aircraft operating in the area were distinguished by familiar physical characteristics, dark in appearance with wings, landing lights and anti-collision lights easily seen and flying in a pattern. 2) The object was a glowing, gold/orange cylinder with NO wings and NO tail section, it  changed speeds, and immediately vanished. I have witnessed UFO's hovering near the ground, and flying at altitude in the western U.S.  I have never seen an object or UFO enter controlled airspace until this incident, and frankly, the episode was chilling. I am very concerned about the possibility of these vehicles colliding with commercial aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.  He has had considerable experience in the aviation/airline industry.

PD)) I originally filed this report on the filers files site but have not heard back. I wlill therefore briefly explain the event please contact the filerfiles for the original report as this was a definate ufo sighting and i have photographs of the event. It lasted for at least 30 minutes while it hovered and manged to get about 4 or 5 photos weith a Canon 35 mm camera sporting a 200 mm zoom lens. it happened at  early A.M. i got up for a drink of water and noticed an extremely bright star blinking in the sky which caught my eye from my kitchen patio so i went onto the balcony to observe it and there it was, a diamond shape craft-star sitting in the sky hovering for over 30 minutes probably as long as an hour. It was brilliant white, flickered somewhat and with the naked eye colors could be seen either rotating around the top or alternating flash sequences....green and red. I of course then watched it with the 200 mm zoom lens and called for my fiance ( an ardent skeptic) and watched through the zoom lens. It had a red and green revoloving light on top or near the top it emitted a bluish beam at various times and even released another smaller diamond shaped light from the side which travelled away from it. Neighbours were also out watching because i could hear them talking aand wondering what it was and of course my flash going off at 1:30 a.m as i took photos attracted attention. it just sat there really high almost like a star for over 30 minutes. A commercial aircraft i think flew by at one point in the general vicinity, it didn't seem to veer off or even notice the object, i think it may have been too high. My fiance agrees with the following....it was not an aircraft helicopter or any other aircraft it was not a star it definately rotated colors red and green it emitted a blue beam and hovered in spot for an extende period of time. My fiance thinks it was the international space station but only because if it wasn't it doesn't leave much alternative. I know it wasn't, i've seen the space station in ythe sky from mexico and i watched this object with the zoom lens I will let you know how the ophotos turn out or contact me and i will send them to you. the film is not developped yet it was -is kodak max. 400 asa. again i filed a report within the next 2 days on filer files so you could always retrieve the original report.

(It was a small light)  We all thought it was funny our friend would mistake an airplane for a firefly.   It caught our interest, and we all kept staring at the ""airplane"". It was blinking, more like pulsing,  a white light, and it was pretty dim, and there was no repetitious pattern to the pulsing, it was a completely random order.  It would blink a bit, then not blink for a few deconds, then blink a few times rapidly, and so forth, and something about it seemed odd to everyone there.  (Except one of us, who we later discovered was looking at a real airplane in the sky, and thought we were nuts. We realized he was looking way to the left of the object were staring at) I couldn't figure out if the object was moving or not, it seemed to remain motionless, but then i made the suggestion out loud to compare it to the tree level to see if it is moving right or left.  The trees were pretty far away, and there was an inch of sky between the object and the tree line from where we sat.  (You know what I mean)   So we all (except for the guy who wasn't looking in the right direction) were in agreement that it was moving to the right a bit.  But then it seemed like it was back where it had been.  We watched this thing for a few minutes, debating whether we were hallucinating or if was really was moving from side to side like this, but never the less something seemed very strange about it.  Then it obviously moved higher in the sky, before dropping back down and to the right in a very quick motion, so fast that it left a trail in our vision. It had moved about an inch to the right in the sky.  Then it was motionless again, while the three of us were all kinda freaking out and ""did you see that?""  sorta stuff.  Then it sank below the trees, reappeared about 20 seconds later, just above the tree line, when it changed from a white light to a pulsing red light.  Then it sank back down and was gone.  It made no sounds.  The whole incident lasted 5 minutes.  It in the direction of north in the sky from were we were sitting.  Northeast slightly. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:   I already submitted the report, but I left out the date and time, which is important I assume.  Also, it was a very clear night outside, and yes there were airplanes in the sky that night, one flying at the same time as the object we saw, this being the plane the 4th person was looking at, thinking it was the object we were all bugging about.  He made no suggestion that the plane he was staring at was acting in any strange way.))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,41.5112,-71.3778

Then I looked back and the huge star had moved way over to the right,and that's when I stopped and said ""oh shit! Not again"".It was the exact same thing my girlfriend and I saw 8 years earlier.It was a big blob of light hovering and bobbing a bit above the horizon line with another smaller ""wingman"" looking light lower and to the left of it.They were both moving around a little in strange bobbing motions.Sometimes they would appear to get to get bigger and then shrink back.I watched for about a half hour before noticing 2 more in the same formation in another area and not so obvious to the eye.Then I started trying to search the entire sky.They appear to be yellowish and sometimes blueish in color and unlike the actual stars around them.Alltogether I counted 10 of them (all in pairs).8 years ago we saw one pair of these bobbing lights but that time they came right up instantly and we got a full on close up look at the craft and we were absolutely terrified.We thought we were going to be abducted for sure.It came right at us.It had to have seen us atop a dune next ! to the w ater.It turned a bit though and went over the water in front of us then cicled in toward the houses and floated completely silently at practically rooftop level over the town area then reappeared down the beach where it came from originally(it was cicling the area).So then it came back for another run staight at us again.We were back to clutching each going,""Omigod, this is it!"".This time it took a left and floated out over the water and into the darkness.There was no more yellowish light in the distance after that.It was over.I'll never forget that.Definately the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.The actual craft looked like this:Basically a giant tic-tac,metallic in color with three ""windows"",two small ones on the ends and one big one in the middle.They had etremely bright light coming out of them.It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.On the front pointing down was like a headlight(oddly enough)and when it was flying low over the water the reflection from the light on the water showed that it was only about 100 ft. up(at the most).I thought for sure I'd be reading about in the local paper.Surely someone else was going to see it.It flew RIGHT OVER town at like rootop level at 10 o'clock at night.But nobody saw except us.Oh well.Last night when I saw the same far away lights I've decided to try and tell my story to whoever will listen.Thanks.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,41.31434324324324,-70.01144594594594

While (she was) observing the light, it 'instantly' came forward to the edge of the tree line...and the light could be seen through the trees. It then moved up a few feet in altitude and moved over the interstate directly over her truck. It then flew along I-40 for a few seconds."" By the time Ms. H reached mile marker 47, near Canute, Okla. (population 538), the mysterious light had vanished. She added, ""The light was so bright it illuminated the (truck's) cab."" Continuing with my sighting, the object appeared to be moving very, very slowly to the south. I watched the object as I got into my vehicle and moved to a better viewing spot. I also turned on my radios, (I'm a ham radio operator, KA5UFO), and tuned to the Clinton-Sherman ATC tower frequency, 119.6 along with the local airport channel, 122.8, hoping to hear the aircraft talking to the tower. No luck, then I remembered that the CSA field is closed to air traffic until 7 am. This helped me to rule out an aircraft. It wasn't a star, planet, weather balloon, blimp, or swamp gas. This object was in my sight for about 5 minutes when it appeared to make a fast turn to the east, and the lights ""winked"" out and it disappeared within 5 seconds. I saw no other aircraft in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Jim Hickman, noted UFO investigator from Oklahoma, for submitting this report.  PD))",2002-01-29T00:00:00,35.394,-99.45295625

I don't believe I've ever seen that in nature.  My second concern was the speed appearing to be about half of what you expect a meteor to be - especially those that wander in from between Mars and Jupiter.  I have not  calculated the estimated speed yet.  I need to sit down and do this, my calculation can only be a guess at best, using 'apparent' altitude.  If it was sunlight I was looking at, reflected from the objects, and it was 21:03 local, that makes the sun about 4 hours over the horizon, leaving about 1/8th of the earth curvature between myself and the sun, a rough guess puts the altitude at about 2000 miles for the objects to reflect the sun as they first appeared in the east.  I don't think they were 2000 miles away, unless they were really big!  For some reason I want to say they were above the tropopause, somewhere around 25 to 50 miles altitude.  If they were meteors, then the beginning of atmosphere would be in this region (but they would leave a trail, albiet even a short one - and no tail was observed).  Roughly, and with no figures to back this up, the objects covered over a 1000 miles  with an estimated altitude of 30 miles.  This makes their speed to be slightly over 6000 miles an hour - very slow for a meteor, but not necessarily for the US government.   Another thing that bothers me is that their luminosity remained the same, and did not change. This was an interesting sighting.  I will continue to figure on this one.  If I reach any conclusions, I will forward them to you, in the meantime please keep me posted. Thanks very much, ((name deleted))",2002-01-11T00:00:00,37.50631392405063,-120.85282405063292

They were walking and facing north, and a very bright meteor crossed the clear night sky, originating behind them and to their right, and traveling generally to the northwest.

The interesting part of the event is that both witnesses were able to hear the event at the same instant they were watching it, even though the object that caused the event, if it was a meteor, was many tens of miles above their heads.  Technically speaking, because sound travels at approximately 1,000-1,100 feet per second, the witnesses should not have been able to ""hear"" the event until many minutes later.

I ran and returned a minute later with 2 pair of high power binoculars.  I was now apparant that the object had moved north closer to us still at a very high altitude, however.  Through the binoculars we could make out the colors and shape of the object.  It was a brilliant, shiny, bright red hemisphere on the bottom surrounded by a bright silver band.  The band was like the outer edge of a traditional flying saucer like you might see in the movies.  We do not know if the sphere continued to the top of the object or not.  We never got a view of it's top side since it never rotated.  It was far above cloud level, so it must have been pretty big for us to see it.  However, I would not be surprised if no one else observed the object as it was very small in the sky at that high altitude and there were many contrails in the sky from planes. The object was slowly traking due north and was soon directly overhead.  It continued north at a slow steady pace and went eventually out of sight.  The Las Vegas strip runs south to north, so coincidently or not the object was tracking directly over the Strip.  My sceptical, scientific mind tried to reason that maybe it was a wierd high tech weather balloon.  But the wind was blowing east and the object's path was perfectly linear from south to north.  I can only conclude that the object was a craft of top secret government or Alien origen.  I wish I had a high power telescope with a camera mounted, but fate did not provide me that option.  I've never observed a UFO before and have been very sceptical about these t! hings, b ut now I really consider it likely that contact has been made  and they would rather play peek-a-boo than come right out with it.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

We were looking out onto Kapalua Bay whale watching, when two round lights appeared in the middle of the Bay.  At first I thought it was a boat as it started to move across the water.  The two lights moves together very smoothly, that I then thought it was a plane flying very close to the water.  As it moved steadily across the Bay I ran into my room to get my binoculars.  I then watched the two lights move from right to left.  With the binoculars I still could not see anything but two round lights.  There was not any craft or any kind of mass around the lights.  If it had been a plane, the object would have had to be coming in our direction.  As the objects reached towards the shore on the left of the Bay they rose like a plane, then disappeared.  At this point they were going away from our direction and they were still two rounds lights.  If it had been a plane there would not have been two round lights because of the direction they were going.  Besides I would have seen the outline of the plane while I looked through the binoculars.  All of this took only approx. 2 minutes.  Even a speed boat would take longer to cross the Bay.  It was a beautiful clear morning.  There had to be someone else who must have seen it as there are many tourists out whale watching around the Bay in Maui at this time of the season.  We left that same day for home, so I don't know if anything was reported.  I asked one of the employees at the hotel but she didn't know what it might have been.  I don't know what this was, if anything.  It puzzled me and I could not could not come up with a reasonably explanation for these lights.  I know there is an observation station on Maui whether it had anything to do with it.  If someone could explain it to me I would appreciate it.

I was in the house cooking the kids were in the backyard jumping on the trampoline while I fixed them some thing to eat in the kitchen, I could see them through the window because my backdoor light was on.  I saw them stop jumping and were staring up at the sky.  I was about to walk out and see what they were looking at because I live in a area that is surrounded by chemeical plants and casino lights so the sky is usually pretty lit up and I owe a telesscope and me and a good friend of mine had recently been seeing strange lights int the sky; but before I could walk outside the kids all came running in scared by strange lights they were seeing moving in the sky.  I quickly went out= side to see what they saw and sure enough above the treeline I saw a white glowing sphere of light that pulsed blue and amber lights.  It was dancing erradically in the sky.  You could clearly see it moving up and down, side- ways and it was as bright as a star in fact when it was still you could almost believe it was a star.  As we are out there looking at this my son(11)hollers;""Look there are more of them  only smaller they are moving too!""  I thought he might be caught up in the moment and was imaging it, but when I looked he was right.  The other objects looked like dimmly lit stars but were pulsing the same blue and amber lights, they were also moving erradically but almost like in accordance with the larger brightly lit object.  My husband and friend showed up and found me sin the backyard watching these crafts.  My husband who is a very skeptical was stunned by what we were seeing.  He could find a resaonalbe answer for the objects. The craft made no sounds at all and the larger one began to shot out sparks of light like a beam down towards the ground in the woods behind my house. At that moment we heard an aircraft approaching it was a big passenger plane coming from the airport from the front of my house it  passed extremly close to the brightly lit craft and the craft still continued its erradic dance in the sky.  We see aircraft alot around here and everyone who saw it knows it was a conventional craft.  The sightings of these objects is becoming more frequently in my area.  I decided to report this event only because of that fact.

Last night at approx. 10:00p.m. eastern time I observed an object flying southeast overhead accross a flight path to National Airport only a few miles out side of the District of Columbia.  What caught my eye was Military Road in Arlington has constant aircraft heading toward the Potomac River preparing for landings at Reagan National Airport.  The aircraft fly so low you are very accustomed to their sounds, different lighting, and even at times are able to read the company logos on the side of the aircraft.  Last night I was taking down draperies and as I looked up I saw blinking white then red then white again lights that were unfamiliar to any normal aircraft that we have seen.  These lights formed a somewhat circular pattern and would alternate between the red and white in this clear pattern.  This first caught my eye and as I observed if further it seemed to move in a pattern of front and back and then side to side but all the while moving forward, almost as if it was gliding or floating.  I pointed this unusual sighting to my  daughter and her friend (both honor students at G.W. University) where I work.  We then proceeded outside to the front yard and watched as this light pattern and movement continued.  As it moved closer and continued over the house, it was not close enough to determine the exact shape but as we closely watched the light pattern it seemed as though it was somewhat circular (most definitely not our usual jet or helicopter) and continued with very exacting movement and light pattern.  And then very suddenly we saw another one meet with it and they both seemed to instantaneously disappear.  Just a further note, I have never seen anything like this,  I am very well traveled and come from a military background.  This was most defiinitely some time of aircraft and what perplexes me is how something like this can fly across a flight path, so near to the district where it is heavily populated, and then towar the diretion of the Pentagon and yet we have heard nothing about this on the! news. I have to believe some of these pilots or our own radar would pick something this strange up.  Anyway, there is no doubt whatsoever in our minds what we witnessed last night.  I hope this helps and I hope I hear something more about this.  Thank you",2000-12-02T00:00:00,38.876008585858585,-77.09626457431457

After watching it a few seconds, it changed course to parallel ours and headed south for a few seconds, then resumed it's original course, then headed south and then it's original course again.  The object was making incredibly smooth course corrections, with no jerky motion like a helicopter, and I didn't understand why it was jigging right and left. After it crossed in front of us (and my girlfriend saw it too), it came alongside what looked like a dark spot in the sky.  We could see three white lights marking htree points of a triangle, a huge one.  It looked a little like the ""arrowhead"" ships from the Start Wars movies.  We could make out the outline, and we could not see through it (the night was perfectly clear, and in the rural area we were in, we could see all the starts in the sky).  The triangle was ""pointed"" west, left-to-right base-to-point. We pulled into a convenience store in Hooper.  I got out and looked back over the grain elevators where we had seen the triangle, and still couldn't see any stars.

This craft hoovered in the same spot for a very long time, about 20 minates before I decided to call the FBI. I was told to call the local police dept 911. I did so and one police car showed up within 4 minates of the call.  Then he got out and looked thru the binoculars and while doing so another showed up.  The first officer then went to his car and made a call, then without saying a word drove off like he was in a race. The second officer stayed there with us but walked away for a second to his car and made a call as well, at that time another police car showed up.  The third officer got out of the car and looked thru the binoculars as well and went over to the second officer and talked to him.  Then about 2 minates later the first car showed back up and jumped out and told me and my daughter who is 13 yrs old, that it was a weather balloon.

It was now lookimg sidways. About 10 minates after that another light of the same sort showed up right below it. I knew at this time this was not a weather balloon.

I remarked on how spectacular and bright it was. We noticed after a few seconds that this object was on a collision course with us looking as though it would smash right on top of us. I stopped the truck. The object stopped. I just hovered there without motion or rocking. It was absolutely still. We got the idea that it was wanting to take us with it. We both found ourselves muttering words like, ""Go away, we don't want to go,"" etc. Suddenly it took off as though it were shot from a slingshot going straight out into the night sky as far as we could see.

Well that night if you check the weather records in my area we had wind gusts of 22mph going southeast so this object would be going AGAINST the wind.

Last night (8/13/01) around 10:45 pm, my husband and I were sitting on our bed watching TV.  I got up to go to the kitchen, but my husband was in the middle of telling me something, so i stood, facing him, listening to him.  He was sitting up resting his back on the wall underneath our window, so when I stood up I was facing the window (we had the blinds up).  While I was looking at him, a bright light outside the window caught my attention.  The object was very bright--it seemed to 'twinkle', and was gold in color.  My husband noticed that I was no longer listening to him and asked what I was looking at.  I told him about the bright light in the sky, and just as I finished telling him, I looked back at the object and I noticed that it was now many colors--they seemed to pulsate.  I'm not sure of all the colors, but I know that one of the colors was green and another was red--whenever the red one 'blinked' it was brighter that the others.  Almost immediately after seeing the object start to blink, two other objects 'appeared'.  They were exactly like the first one I had observed, and all three together formed an 'upside down triangle' in the sky.  They were motionless for about a minute, then began moving slowly, staying in their triangle formation.  My husband also witnessed this.  We stayed at the window to see if they would come back, and they did in about a minute.  This time, however, they were not in formation and there were only two of them.  They were split apart--when the three were together they were positioned between 2 trees, so they were in clear view--this time there was one behind each tree.  Neither of the trees were thick with leaves, and the objects' lights were still blinking, so the objects were visible.  They stayed behind the trees for a minute, then went way, then came back about a minute later, then went away again.  We did not see them after this.  My husband doesn't really believe in UFOs, so he keeps telling me that they were just airplanes or helicopters or something, but I ! used to live in Latrobe, near the airport, and also near a hospital, so I know what helicopters and airplanes look like, and believe me, these objects were neither airplanes or helicopters.  Also, my cat was acting really strange all through the night and this morning.  She got under the covers last night to bite and scratch one of my feet (which she has never done before).  In fact, she got so aggressive that it woke me up a few times.  Also, this morning when I got up she started hissing at me and making weird sounds and her fur  was standing straight up, like she was spooked.",2001-08-20T00:00:00,40.443091945513764,-79.97424169381107

At about 11:10 pm on August 13, 2001, I was driving north on IL Route 40 toward IL Route 90 which was a few miles ahead.  My wife also saw it as she was sitting in the right front seat.  Our son sitting in the back seat behind me did not see it.  It was a very clear night and the massing of the Milky Way could be seen just by looking out and up.  There were several private airplanes out and about with flashing lights that were easily seen (but not near the object).  From my vantage point, in front of me and a little to the right (at, say, one o'clock there came streaking down with a long tail (at 15 to 20 degrees from vertical) a small parallelogram with sharp angles, for the corners did not look to be right angles.  I remember that the parallelogram was a double image but I attribute that to the hour of the day and I could not blink to clear my vision or I would have missed it.  My wife did not recall a double image.  If this were painted on my windshield it would have been about 1/4"" long and 1/8"" wide and the tail would have been 9 - 10 inches long. The sides of the parallelogram on the right were lower that the ones on the left. To me the color looked blue green, object and tail.  To my wife, she said it looked more toward yellow.  I did see it though a windshield that had a tinted top edge, but I could not reproduce the color by looking at white road signs.  It looked big enough and close enough that we thought it was going to hit the nearby fields and make an explosion or something.  It did not.  It lasted long enough for me to say,""Geeezz!  Look at THAT! and for my wife to respond. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be quite credible in his presentation of the facts surrounding his sighting.

It stood still for a few seconds till the other one to the left moved upward to. The center craft did a zig zag pattern while moving down the shorline and covered what must of been a few hundred miles making very destinctive zig zag patter in less than a second or to. The third stood very still and then shot strait up very fast and than just simply dissapeared. I could see the first moving object turn sideways and is appeared to be spinning in place. The lights on then at the time were just white. They all went under the horizon. And did'nt come back for probably two minnutes. But the one appeared again.

At this point the object started to have very un- even flashes of light and moved north and dissapeared into the land. Still flying very, very low.

It was apx. 11 pm when I went outside.  I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a bright ball of white light come flying by me about 30 ft away.  There was no noise, and the light was traveling extremely fast, so fast if you blinked you'd miss it.  It was very low in the air, about treetop level.  The light came from the west and sped across the lake ( I was standing about 100 ft from the lake) and then disappeared.  About a minute later, another bright light appeared about 25 ft in front of me, sped  off inbetween some trees and it too disappeared.  Both times I saw this ball of light it was flying west to east.  About an hour later, I went back outside to see if I could see the light again, and this time I saw the same ball of light, a little bit higher in the sky traveling southwest and then disappearing.  It looked to be about the size of a basketball. It left no trail behind it, but because it was going so fast, it almost looked like the trail ( if you could call it that) preceded it.  There were planes high up in the air that night, normal looking plane traffic. There are no city lights where I was at, and except for the stars in the sky, it was very dark. I don't know if this was a UFO or what it was, but I definetely DID see this ball of light speeding by three times and disappearing.",2001-08-20T00:00:00,,

A friend and I were star gazing. We noticed flashing lights off in the distance, 1 foot above the western horizon; red, blue and white lights flashing. It appeared to be a satelite at first. As it approached us, we began to think it was an emergency plane or helicopter. It was travelling very quickly. It flew/drifted almost directly above us, and as it did, 2 more lights became visible for 10 to 20 seconds. It had a pyramid shaped bottom. Then as it passed by, the 2 front lights faded, and 4 lights were visible again, but in a reverse pattern. The wind picked up at about the same time as it was above us, so we don't know if it made any sound. We watched as it dissapeared 1 foot above the eastern horizon. Whatever it was, it came toward us from a point above the horizon, and went away above the horizon; it did not follow the curvature of the earth. It was very, very high in the sky while above us. It was visible for a total of about 5 minutes. It never stopped or slowed down. We don't know if it's related, but we also saw a bright flash in the sky, shortly after this craft went by. The flash was bright enough to dimly light the sky and ground. Neither of us has ever seen anything like this before, and we tried to think of what it could be. I've personally seen many aircrafts flying above me at night, and can tell the difference between a star and a satelite. This we can't figure out what it is. The aspect that's most puzzling is that it didn't follow the curvature of the earth. It went by the earth in a straight line.",2001-08-20T00:00:00,47.3833,-79.6833

The traffic had stopped and I directed my full attention to what I was observing and noticed that although that it was stationary it was spinning. I couldn't determine the color of the object as the sun was casting a orange/red color upon it.

My mom was upstairs lying down and i went downstairs to me room to watch tv.  My mom yelled down the stairs ""Katie did u see that light out of your window"".  I thought she meant something in the yard but she said look over the mountain in the sky.  So i llooked out my window downstairs which faces the mountain and i looked at it.  It was very bright. My mom thought it was a planet but after taking astronomy i am pretty sure with the visible eye a planet is not that bright or close to the earth.  So i took my mothers pretty strong binoculars, and looked through them.  The object was white colored and looked like many dots put together.  It was outlined in thin red.  It wasnt visibly moving yet it did look like it was a little more North then when we first saw it.  It got lower and lower as the half hr or so went on. Again we couldnt see it drop but it got lower. At 8:30 it finally dropped on the other side of the mountain and it was no longer visible to us here.  I tried to take pictures and draw some quick sketches but i realized as i kept observing it that it changed shape.  It was somewhat of a disc shaped a little deformed,, then it looked more like a cigar, then it looked round.  The shape looked like it was a formation of lights but it was definetly something i have never seen before.  My mom said maybe it was a sattelite but again it was pretty clear and visible to be a satelite.  My mom and I both believe in UFO's but i wasnt planning on ""looking"" or seeing any tonight.  For me to write a report about it means that i really do believe it was something.  It did not look like a planet, nor has the sky been very visible lately.  It was not a airplane,, but it is possible it could be a satellite im really not sure. It eventually dropped lower to the horizon and over the mountains so we were not able to see anymore, ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect they may have been observing Venus, but that is just a guess.

As I was about a tenth of a mile from my apartment building on Bushman Street, Oakton, Virginia I looked at the moon which was bright and low on the horizon.  To the left and below of the moon I saw an amber colored light moving slowly from right to left, approximately over the A T & T regional headquarters building compound.  At first I thought that it was an airplane taking off from Dulles Airport which is about twenty miles away in that direction but I realized that it was far too low on the horizon for it to be an airplane and it seemed to me that it was almost at tree top level.  I realized that it was quite near. I made a right turn on to Borge street and noticed that the object had turned towards my vehicle.  It blinked or pulsated once, and then held a steady amber color. It seemed to stop and hover over the edge of a small childrens playground.  At that time I had turned left onto Jermantown road and had to concentrate on my driving,though I was still looking towards my left where it was hovering about 200 feet away, at the height of a street lamp or so. I had to get gasoline and after that, about ten minutes later I again passed the spot where I had seen this object, and it was no longer there.  At first I thought that maybe I had seen a street lamp or something as it was earlier for me than usual but the object was no longer there on my second pass by the area, so that was not it.

As we arrived, the sky was a mostly cloudy but we hoped it would clear.  It was very cold (mid 30's Fareheit) outside.  As we sat in the car, we were facing directly east.  As we were looking for meteors, my wife commented that all she saw was an airplane ""or something"" just above the horizon, due east of us.  When she mentioned it, we started observing it also. It was too far away from us to make out any details of a craft.  I can only guess, but I'd say it was ~5 miles away from us.  It was a white light, looked about the intensity of landing lights on a commercial airliner.  It was blinking very rapidly with a very consistent strobe-like rhythm.  The strobe frequency seemed almost like an everyday jetliner, however it lacked the tell-tale red nav light on the top. Since we couldn't see any meteors due to the clouds, we watched it for a bit.  The light moved a bit from the north to the south (approximately 3-4 degrees) and maintained what appeared to be a very low altitude.  I guessed it might be a car driving up a road and the headlights appearing to pulsate due to roadside trees crossing their path.  Just as I said this, the light jumped straight up ~10 degrees above the horizon.  The movement was deliberate and VERY swift. This was certainly not a car and no aircraft that I've ever seen could have ascended this quickly.  It moved an apparent 5 degrees in much less than a second. We were somewhat surprised at this movement, but as we are all fairly skeptical and scientific minds, we again guessed this must have been some sort of aircraft.  As we watched it began to move south, but as it moved, it bounced up and down very, very quickly.  Again, I can't stress enough that common airplanes or helicopters do not move this fast or in this fashion.  As it headed south it slowed dramatically and then headed north again, it appeared not to even stop when changing direction.  It accellerated just as quickly as it decellerated after reversing direction. This change of direction was simply amazing.  It seemed to have the dexterity of a small insect.  It moved up and down and north to south for several minutes as we watched in awe, all the time trying to understand what the heck we were watching.  I suppose the natural thing to do is to try and explain it away, but there was nothing that we could think of that could maneuver like this. After a few minutes of this, it travelled deliberately south/southwest of us and passed behind a hill that obscured our vision.  The other side of the hill that we could see was the town of Parker, which had many lights of its own and made it difficult to track.  We saw many lights that seemed to match this one, but couldn't be sure as they didn't appear to move. We stayed for three hours at that location and eventually saw the meteors.  The light we were watching was very clearly *not* a meteor.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,39.68000198902607,-104.7929670781893

The object was crescent-shaped, colored a medium grey (judging by the color reflected from the city lights below), and seemed to have a texture like it was made from dozens of small balls or spheres. It flew very slowly from north-northeast to south-southwest, and was accompanied by a very faint rumbling, engine-like noise which I could make out over the normal nighttime sounds of downtown Seattle.  Once it was nearly overhead, it turned slowly west and faded from view, and the rumbling noise faded away with it. The size was approximately that of a thumbnail held at arm's length, and it flew with the rounded portion of the crescent shape aimed forward.  There were no light emitters of any type visible on it. Its height could not be accurately estimated; I have only the amplitude of its ""engine"" noise to base any guess upon.  And if I tried to guess using only that, it would have been at least 5,000 feet in altitude. I'm on the approach path for commercial airliners, and I know what they look and sound like from varying distances.  This was *not* a commercial flight. According to my handheld GPS, I'm located at 47°36'23N by 122°19'51W.  This is in downtown Seattle near the monorail terminus. This is the first of three unidentifyable objects I will be reporting on tonight. Incidentally, from my decidedly poor vantage point, highly restricted viewable area, and severe light pollution conditions, I still observed approximately 150 meteors between 1am & 4am; with only one being very substantial. The projectile itself glowed an eye-piercing whitish violet and was surrounded by a darker violet coma; and the long tail was green & white with violet & blue-violet along its edges.

While observing the meteor storm, and about ten minutes after sighting a large, crescent shaped object (see previous report), I spotted a yellow-amber colored sphere or circular oject flying slowly from east to west.  There were no apparent lights on it, so at first I figured it must have been a balloon or a plastic bag caught up in a breeze. It flew slowly in a straight line, and slowly disappeared as it flew out over the water.  Plastic bags usually don't do this and aircraft normally have lights on them (this did not), so I shot at it with a 11.6 milliwatt 632nm (green) DPSS laser while it was moving away from my position, but did not see any light reflected back. Since I can see the beam from this laser slicing through the sky at night, targeting was not an issue; it simply didn't reflect any of my green light back to me. About a minute later, I saw another, smaller one; going in approximately the same direction at approximately the same speed and in approximately the same flight path as the first. I shot this one with the laser as it was moving off as well, and *did* manage to hit it several times as I saw the green dot light up on what I believe to be its underside.  After I'd hit it four or five times, it slowed down to almost a stop, abruptly turned to the north, and started moving again; only more slowly.  I half expected the thing to start shooting back at me; but instead, it slowed down again and came to a complete stop. By this time I'd thrown the laser to the floor and kicked it under the bed. Then the UFO just hung there stationary like a one of several of the other stars visible near its position. After observing it stationary in the sky for 25-30 seconds, it simply winked out as if somebody kicked the plug out of the wall. There were no visible light sources on them (they appear to have been illuminated solely by reflected light from below), no sound was detectable, and no moving parts were visible.  Their color was sodium yellow; so they may have actually been white or light grey in color; and reflecting light from the sodium vapor lamps illuminating the streets in this area.  And both objects had a slow and rock steady flight; not fluttering, rocking, wavering, rotating, or changing speed/direction except as noted earlier. The size of the first one was approximately that of a small dress shirt button held at arm's length; the second one appeared to be about half that size. The laser I used has an effective range of only a few thousand feet with this amount of light pollution in the area, so the altitude of the object I actually hit had to be ~3,000 feet or below for me to be able to easily see the spot on it. Both objects traversed about 50° worth of sky (a mile or two if they were at this low an altitude) before disappearing. I attempted to take pictures, but neither object was large or bright enough to show up on my cheap digital camera.  The pictures came out as just digital noise. I watched the meteor storm & the sky intently for approximately another 90 minutes after this sighting, and did not see anything else out of the ordinary. I am a full-time museum curator & product evaluator, I do not use drugs, and I haven't consumed any alcoholic beverages since mid-September.  And I know I wasn't just seeing things.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

I went out onto my front porch at just after 3 a.m. to try to view the meteor shower.  Immediately I noticed a bright light to the south and a little west, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  This light was continuously moving up, down and sideways in both directions. Since I could not tell how far the object was from me it is hard to say how far it was moving.  It was not darting across the sky, but it was moving in a tightly contained area, like a firefly in a very small jar.  If I had to guess I would say it was at least a half a mile away, possibly even several miles away, depending on it size. Over the course of the time I observed it, its position slowly moved west and possibly farther away from me, as it seemed to become dimmer.  Its shape was hard to determine because I had no binoculars, but I got the impression of a triangle, and I seemed to see colored lights at times, such as red and green.  The light also seemed to increase and decrease in intensity at times, although it was always quite bright.  My attention was also drawn to another light to its right (west) and slightly closer to the horizon. This light did not appear to be moving and was much dimmer.  It may have simply been a star, but I thought it was interesting that its distance from the first light seemed to stay about the same, even as the first light moved slowly west.  I also got the impression of seeing other lights moving around in the vicinity of the first light, but they were very fleeting and faint.  If this was a conventional aircraft, I cannot understand its movements.  I wondered if maybe it was a helicopter or a balloon, but the quickness of its movements would seem to make this impossible.  There was no particular wind that night that I am aware of.  My home is in Lake Forest Park, but the object was probably over the city of Shoreline or possibly even Seattle.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,,

12 burnt-orange lights -- each zipping from DIFFERENT directions --  maneuvered around an oval  black shape.,Las Vegas,NV,2001-03-22T00:40:00,formation,3 minutes,"Occurred : 3/22/2001 00:40  (Entered as : 03/22/01 12:40) Reported: 3/23/2001 14:17 Posted: 4/1/2001 Location: Las Vegas, NV Shape: Formation Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17021.html,"12 burnt-orange lights -- each zipping from DIFFERENT directions --  maneuvered around an oval  black shape. Three of us outside Starbucks coffee shop parking lot at Paradise and Flamingo avenues in Las Vegas very early Thursday morning (12:40 a.m.), 3/22/01, saw an amazing display of a squadron of burnt-amber lights -- each coming from different directions -- zipping about a black oval shape in a highly coordinated, interacting, maneuvering display. To the south, the Luxor Hotel's laser beamed straight up, and we could see nighthawks illuminated in the lower part of the beam, but those were not the UFOs we are describing in this report.  There were no clouds. We were looking up at a 45-degree angle and to the northwest.  At arm's length, the entire system appeared to cover no more than an inch. Witness #1 first saw the lights moving like a wave like a sine wave, then changing to individual burnt-amber dots in a straight, non-waving line like a string of beads, then changing to a circular formation.  Then each light spread away from the others, weaving in and out from each other in highly coordinated maneuvering, each moving at the same speed but from different directions.  In this last configuration, the 12 lights were all zipping around a contained oval diameter, but the startling aspect to the movements was the highly coordinated maneuvering between the objects.  The entire system slowly moved north and perhaps upward until it was too far away to see. Witness #2 (this writer) saw the formation only at this latter stage, when the 12 burnt-amber lights were simultaneously zipping around the ovoid shape but each one coming from a different direction and going to a different location about this black ovoid shape.  All 12 lights stopped momentarily before again zipping around in different directions and not in sequence, but all around this black shape. This was done repeatedly for about two minutes.  The movements were fast, including very fast but rounded turns -- no zig-zagging. Mike Castrada, chief of the Public Affairs Office at Nellis Air Force Base, told me he has no report of this, which he would not have if it were classified, but he ""wishes he were there"" and that if Project Blue Book were still open, this report would probably be a case they would put into it. Castrada said that it appears we were looking at the Western part of the Nellis Test Range. Castrada said that ""various FAA and Air Force radars control all that air space -- about 12,000 square miles -- from 3000 ft. about the North Las Vegas Airport to infinity, and all the way to the Utah border."" Castrada said that Special Forces was there on an exercise but only from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.  He said that if they were flying at night, they wouldn't have their lights on because that would defeat the purpose.  He said Special Forces might have had perhaps four but not 10 to 12 planes. Witness #3 viewed the object thhe same length of time as Witness #1 but has not yet been interviewed in detail.",2001-04-01T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

At the time of this incident, I was only 14 years of age.  Still, to this day I am fully aware of what myself and four friends had seen. It was a warm, clear summer nigh's sky, no clouds or haze.  My friends and I were sitting in an area of a local cemetery, which borders a one-block area of homes, and then another cemetery.  We were sitting approximately 100 yards behind the cemetery fence at the entrance to a Family Mausoleum when I noticed a slowly moving, (almost hovering) object which appeared at what seemed to be directly over the fence of the other cemetery.  At first I thought the object was a helicopter slowly moving from right to left along the approximate fence area of the adjacent cemetery.  However, I then realized that there were no flashing (strobe) lights, nor was they're any sound at all.  Although, there was a very bright light (white/purple) at the center of object and one smaller illuminating light on each side of the center light. (At this time, no shape could be determined) We, at this time, moved to the fence area of the cemetery in which we were sitting.  By this time the object had moved slowly to about half way down the adjacent cemetery fence.  We all then realized that this was not a known aircraft of any sort.  The object was no more than 500 feet away from us at an approximate altitude of 75 feet in the air.  This was most apparent from the scaling of the homes that were between the cemetery, which we were in, and the cemetery fence, which the object was apparently following, and the tree line of the adjacent cemetery.  It was at this time I could just make out an outline of the object.  (The lights were so bright, that it was most difficult to see thru them).  I also realized that there was still no sound whatsoever. At this time, we all ""jumped"" the cemetery fence and ran as fast as possible around the end of the Block, (approximately 10 seconds) so that we could get even closer, if not under the object.  When we arrived, it was gone!  I visually searched the Sky and realized that there was nothing in sight, not even a distant airplane; the entire sky was void of craft.  Yet, it was clear starry night! I have created a digital rendering of what myself and my friends had seen that night which gives a good scale to go by.

It was bigger than a blimp size, more like 3 or 4 large blimps, but the wrong shape to be a blimp. The sky was very clear and there was no sound at all. Suddenly, it just took off toward the west, toward the beach area. It was as if one moment it was over our back yard and the next moment it was gone. We could see it go, but it left so fast, as fast as you could move your hand from in front of you to your side (holding your arm out straight).  I'm not sure of the date, but I was still living at home, so I had to be between 19 and 20, I married in Nov. of my 20th year. This was the third UFO I had seen. I think it was my Mom's first. I don't know about the neighbors.All three sightings were very different looking, however, all three were silent. This was by far the largest, the others were much smaller, and seen in the day too. This was the only one at night. After it left, I did call the newspaper, but they ! weren't interested, and didn't seem to know anything about it, no one else had called it in. I also called Miramar Air Base, and asked if they had anything that looked like this thing out flying that night. They acted like I was a nut. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This went on for about an hour until the both zoomed upward and toward the west until they faded from view. I had the impression they must have been over quincy or farther south.

The parking lot was on the other side of a tree line. We were on the other side of the tree line in an open prairie. The crafts were triangular in shape and were wider than long. I`d estimate they were 15 feet wide by 10 feet long. They were a light grayish brown with a very dark strip that bordered close to the entire back end. They were traveling 10 mph and were around 80 feet off the ground. The crafts flew in a straght line and made no noise.

Before I continue, I would like to say that I am a believer in the UFO phenominum, but I guess when you actually see something, it leaves you wondering if what you saw was a possible sighting. The 1st happened back in 1987 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the town of Bessmer.It was about 2:30 in the morning, it was sometime in the middle of summer. I was driving home on US 2; the weather seemed to take kind of an abropt change maybe partially cloudy evening to a fairly hard rain. Well what happened next is what I have ?'s about. At the very 1st instant I thought I was experiencing lightning, you know how it lights everything up. But after the 1st flash that seemed to last alittle to long, just after it a green colored flash lit everything up and lasted a couple seconds. This sequence of white then green happened 4 or 5 times at about 1 minute apart from each other until I got up to the source of where it was coming from. Off to my left side maybe 150 to 200 yards away, ahuge circular white light appeared partially blocked in the trees. Then in the same interval previously described, two green lights, half the size, and on opposite sides of where the white light was appeared. As I tryed to find a place to safely stop and turn the car around to get a better look, the sequence happened one more time then it was gone and I never saw it again. Could this have been an electrical storm? There was no lightning bolts coming from the sky. It took me maybe 10 minutes to get home afterwards, and as quickly as the rain started it had ended with just a partially overcast sky ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This sighting occurred during full-daylight, in a beautiful blue near-cloudless sky. I was traveling north on a popular rural route (Manhattan Road) in western Putnam County, when I noticed an object up in the sky probably many miles ahead of me at an altitude of several thousand feet. My first impression was it must be a balloon, but very quickly knew it was not one as it was completely motionless in the sky. While it was a fairly serene day, obviously anything in the sky such as a balloon at that altitude, would have been moving at least a little bit. Since it was in the sky ahead of me, I was able to try to watch it for several minutes, maybe as much as 10 minutes. But because I had a commitment that I had to be at, I couldn't stop, and of course I didn't have a camera to take a picture of it. The entire time I was viewing it, it never seemed to move. Rather it just hung there motionless in the air. I have never to this day have seen anything that could just stay motionless in the air, except this one object I saw in broad daylight. The best way to describe the shape of it is to compare it to a hockey puck. It appeared flat on two sides and perfectly circular in shape. The color was silver-metallic. I couldn't make out any features such as ""windows"", or ""engine ports"". The object's surfaces seemed perfectly smooth. While it looked like a hockey puck, it didn't lie flat in the sky, but was ""tilted"" at about 30 degrees. Once again, nothing about the appearance of the object during the time that I observed it changed. It never rotated on its own axis, or moved in the sky. It was clear to me that it was some kind of solid object, and not something ""celestial"" in the sky I was looking at. It finally was out of my view after driving about 15 miles, but when I was able to take a peak behind me in the sky, it was still there. I am an open-minded person, but always look for a logical solution first. This sighting to this day, still has me baffled as to what could just ""hang in the sky"".

First,  I need to tell you that I really feel funny giving you a report that had happened  to me more than 10 years ago. The only reason I am giving you this ""report"" now  is that I feel compelled to do so after I had heard a very similar report on an Art Bell program in June of 1999.  This report was given by, I believe, a pilot who had witnessed this at night near or in some wooded area that either he lived in or was camping near.  Sorry, I don""t remember the exact details except for his description of the object that he saw.  I was getting ready to be married in August of 1999 so I just procrastinated on getting this report to you. My story.  In October of 1990 I went hunting with three other hunting partners about 30 miles east of Prineville, Oregon in the Ochoco national forrest..  We made camp in an area that was fairly open and not too close to trees so we could avoid the risk of setting the area on fire from our much needed campfire.  We found an open area that seemed perfect for camping with a nice view of the surrounding  countryside.   The terrain of this area is somewhat mountainous but is a  combination of  tall pine and lots of open areas which is also fine for hunting.  East of the camp is the ridgeline of mountains that make up parts of the Ochoco national forrest and to the North is one of the main highways that run out of Prineville.  This highway runs parallel to a  river (the Crooked River, I believe), which runs east to west  through a canyon. On our second night there we had finished supper and were getting ready to get some sleep.  My other hunting buddies had already gone to  the tent to ""turn in""  while I was standing by the campfire finishing up a cup of tea ( I have to add this part about the tea because, to be honest with you, when I hear of UFO reports coming from hunters I really wonder how much they have had to drink when they see these things).  Anyway,  a few minutes passed and I was still standing by the campfire looking east towards the top of the mountain range  when I saw a very bright bluish-white light traveling at a very high rate of speed above the treeline. .  It was travelling downwords,  heading due north at about a 25 to 35 degree angle.   It seemed to be leaving a ""trail of light"" behind it , but I think that was more of an optical illusion that  it created because of the speed it was travelling and the intensity of the light. When I first saw this object I thought that is was a meteorite.  I couldn't tell anything about it's size or how far away it was from me because, at that point,  I didn't have anything to reference it to.   It was definately between the mountain range and our camp but that only narrowed it down to be no more than four miles away maximum. It wasn't until it ""travelled"" down towards the highway that I could make a reference to how far away it was from me (about a half mile, I guess).  When it got down to the highway I thought I would hear an explosion or something, but it just made a right turn and headed east up the highway.   When I say right turn , I mean ""right turn"".  There was no slowing down or anything. There was no ""easing"" into a turn like an aircraft would do but just a right angle turn. Then as the object headed east it ""lit"" up the whole area.  Before,  when a car or truck would travell on the highway at night we could just barely see the glow of the headlights because of the distance we were from them, but when this object went down to the highway and headed east it just lit up the whole canyon   I mean,  you could see every detail just like it was daylight except it had  more of  bluish hue to the light,  kind of like an arc welder. It was completely silent.  It made no sound at all, not even a sonic boom. Judging from the time it took from  near the mountain top and by the time it had arrived at the highway not more than 4 seconds had gone by.  That means that it had travelled about a mile per second.  When it continued to travel east it took another two or three seconds before it was gone and out of sight. After all this had happened I yelled over to my hunting buddies about the bright light that I had just seen but got a response about it was probably was a meteorite (yeah,  right!).  I stayed up for another few minutes hoping it would come back or another one might show up, but it never did. The campfire had burned down to glowing embers and to be honest I was getting just a little ""spooked"" standing out there by myself  so I decided to head to the tent to get some sleep. One of my buddies was still awake so I told him what had happened but I didn't know if he was really believing the story of what I had just witnessed. Anyway,  not much else was said and we decided to get some sleep. I was so ""wired"" I just couldn't think about anything except what I had just seen.  Then the really weird part happened.  While laying there sorting out what I had just seen,  a pack of coyotes started ""yipping and yelping"" and making the typical coyote noise that they usually make. But this was coming from just east of our camp (you know, from the direction of the UFO).    It got so loud that everyone of us was up.  I always carry a side arm and I was ""ready""  if  the coyotes were going to go  bezerk or something. I really thought that they might try to get in the tent. They continued making this comotion as they ran just outside our camp and headed west. I don't know if this coyote incident  was related to  what I had seen,  but in my many years of hunting and camping I have never had something like pack of coyotes come into a camp like that  with a fire still smoldering. It really did seem like something spooked them. I know that they always try to avoid human contact at almost any price. I didn't bring up the incident again but a couple of weeks later one of my hunting buddies said that he had read an article in the paper ( The Oregonian) about the ""light"" that was apperently reported by some other witnesses that were in the area.  Well... I did feel a little more credible.    I never did try to look for the article so I can't say for certain when it was in there, but it would have been in the paper the last half of October, 1990. I used to be an avid hunter, but that was the last ime that I went and I've never had the desire to go hunting again. End of my story.....I hope! If you have any questions please email me and I can either call you or email you. Thanks for listening, Terry",2001-02-24T00:00:00,44.1066,-120.66420000000001

It had no navigation light,wings or vertical or horizontal stabilizers.  Ther was no visible vapor trails or engine noise. I really think it was at or near the edge of the atmosphere. The size is hard to guess at because I don't know its altitude.To give some idea of its size though  it appeared to be about the size of a C-5A aircraft viewed from about 500 yards.  The two other aircraft approached the larger craft,one from the North and the other from the South. The two smaller craft appeared only as small white lights approaching the large craft. What really attracted my attention to the small crafts was the manouver one of them made upon nearing the large craft.  The one coming from the north came to the left side of the large craft An instant before the one arrived fron the southand the light went out. The craft from the south approached the same location at very hihg speed and at the last moment stopped and circled and entered the right side of the large craft.

PD)) Judy Moore and I went  to interview a family living on a farm near Von Ormy, Texas  that had an encounter with a U.F.O. one night about a month ago.  . . .  We interviewed the mother, a computer programmer in San Antonio, and her children, filling out MUFON forms and having them draw what they remembered seeing.  We also took photos of the area, and walked all around the area.  . . .  The sighting occurred around 9:30 p.m., or so, with the object first seen hovering over a large field in front of the farm house, shining lights down on the field (the field had cattle in it when we looked at it and is subleased to another family) when one of the children saw it, and with lights off but clearly visible when the mother was alerted.  It came toward the house 50 - 100 feet above the ground, coming toward one of the children (13-year-old daughter] outside, who ran, quite frightened, inside the house.  (When last seen by one of them, it was quite close to one side of the house.)  The mother ran for a gun, dogs, cats and nearby coyotes were making a lot of noise and reacting, and then the object disappeared.  When they were outside the house, with the object nearby, they felt a lot of heat. They speculated later that they may have been exposed to radiation, since they all developed colds just after the incident  , possibly because their immune systems had been affected.  (Or, this could have just been a coincidence.)  Later, in the middle of the night, a radio and TV (that have remote controls) came on further frightening them.  . . .  There were some indications that they may've been abducted.  [She and the daughter examined themselves for possible surgical implants, tissue removal, etc., and all she noticed was something like a mosquito bite behind one ear, that would'nt go away.]  She said she had had two ""false pregnancies"" when I asked if she'd ever had any. The woman said she'd meet with a local abductee support group, and is interested in being hypnotically regressed to see if anything can be remembered that  is perhaps being blocked from conscious memory.  . . .  Hearing all their stories separately, it sounded convincing that something unusual had occurred.  . . .  The craft had made no sound other than, perhaps, a low humming sound, that the mother thought she might've heard.  . . .  They called 911,  sheriff's deputies came, and deputies continue to check on them almost every night. The woman's husband's response puzzles me a bit, as well as the fact that she had made little mention of him when she first told us about the incidence.  He had not been at the house when the incidence occurred.  The woman said he had been supportive when I asked how he fit in.  While we were there he was working outside, came in later, we were introduced to him, and he went to sleep on the sofa by the TV.  . . .  Personally I am a bit puzzled as to why he didn't share at least a little of his excitement, puzzlement, amusement, etc. at what his wife   and the children were reporting.  . . .  Ron Johnson, in Austin, told me on the MUFON amateur radio net this morning that he had run into similar responses from spouses before and that the husband's response should be mentioned in the report.  He encouraged making efforts to document the false pregnancies.  Also, he wanted me to remind MUFON members to watch Dateline at 9 p.m. Tuesday, when Dr. John Mach will be interviewed. - Cliff Gieseke, May 21, '94 (From notes I made in 1994; I am no longer a member of MUFON; when I tried to report the incident to the Air Force at Lackland, they told me, to my amusement, to report it to the sheriff's department, which apparently now has the responsibility of protecting our air space -- Cliff Gieseke, San Antonio, TX)",2001-02-24T00:00:00,29.2891,-98.6445

My wife had been walking the dog, and came in to tell me that she had seen a strange blue light in the ski. She was concerned about terrorist activity, and wanted me to see it. I rushed out. I was it instantly. It appeared to be the size and intensity of a very bright star but perhaps brighter than the brightest star. It had blueinsh cast.  Over the ten minute period that I observed it, it moved very rapidly, yet erratically, over a broad area of the ski. Its movement seemed to be quite erratic, reminding me more of the movement of a bat (but not the appearance of one)in flight. It might move in a straight line for no more than a second, then switch directions for another second, and then continue this erratic movement. It was dark and just beginning to rain and I could not see if there were clouds. It did not appear to disappear behind clouds. It did not flicker, and remained totally visible unless I would lose sight of it behind a tree. When this happened, within a second or so, it would reappear from behind the object. In spite of the erratic and random nature of its movement, it did seem to be confined to a reasonably small area of the ski. I would estimate the horizontal boudaries of its excursion to be perhaps 30 or 40 degrees, and the vertical, perhaps a little less. After a minute or so of watching it, I ran into the house to grab a video camera and ran out to try to catch it on video. I was never able to get it into the view finder, a failure that I found rather disturbing, sine I am very adept at video movies. For what it is worth, not once did I get a glimps of it in the view finder. I speculated that the intensity was not sufficient or that it was moving too fast for me to catch it, though the latter does not seem to be a reasonable explanation. Eventually, it disappeared by moving behind a tree, down toward the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be an exceptionally good witness.

I am an experienced hiker/backpacker having spent more than 250 days out in the last ten years. On 6/26/93 I was back packing alone in Holy Cross Wilderness area. I had set up camp just at tree line in some scrub brush near a rocky clearing approximately 2 miles due north of Mt Holy Cross.  After securing food and smellables I retired to my tent.  I was awakened to the sound of ""animals?"" scratching the gravel and sand around the tent.  I was not concerned as it sounded like muscrats.. and I quickly fell back asleep. Sometime later I woke abruptly in a cold sweat unable to move or to hear anything (as though underwater).  I was able to open my eyes.  As I did this the sound began to come back but as though through a wall or from far away.  I was scared but thought it a bad dream.  As I lay not knowing what was happening the wind began to pick up and the tent seemed to billow and fall, as though breathing.  The sounds that had been outside previously, had returned and began to intensify.  Instead of one or two small animals though it was as if there were a dozen angrily digging/scratching at the ground all around the tent.  Still unable to move to look from side to side (I was lying on my back) I heard the scratching move from the ground to the tent walls on all sides.  As this happened the wind became more intense causing the tent to sway.  I suppose all of this could be explained by my having a bad dream and a wind storm coming up suddenly.  However, the next part I can not explain.  This whole wind/scratching/tent moving lasted for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Then as though someone had blown out a candle everything stopped and there was complete stillness.  Then the whole tent and surroundings became brighter than daylight.  A complete and encompasing white light entered the tent.  I was absolutely blinding.  I was still unable to move.  I light moved around in some ways but was always intense.  Then as quickly as it became bright it was again dark and as still as any quiet night in the woods.  There wa! s no mor e wind and no more scratching.  As soon as the light was gone I was able to move again.  Needless to say I was upset.  Checking my watch it was almost 03:30:00.  I got up and packed up my things and began my assent of Holy Cross Mtn two hours early.   I did not pass by my campsite on my way out of the preserve.  Rather I took an extended loop and spent the next three nights wondering if it would happen again.  It did not.  I did not see any other hikers during my 5 day outing.  After I left the wilderness area I drove to the nearest town to get some supplies and see if any one had reported any strange sightings.  No one else had seen or reported anything.

Pulsing, single craft at EXTREME SPEEDS. On a Fall night in 1997 I witnessed a pulsating object in the western sky. It was an extremely calm night. No wind. The object started out as a red light hovering very high in the sky. It stayed in that position for sometime. At this point it did not look suspicious. As we topped a hill, I called this object to the attention of all the members in our car. We stopped at the top and all 7 of us noticed a pulsing red light. It would also show some white pulsing. After about 10 minutes the object jumped across the sky due north. It appeared to travel at an extreme rate of speed. It burned a red light then shot across the sky. It also traveled up, way up to what seemed 40,000 feet or higher, higher than any aircraft we have spotted. It shot back at the same extreme rate of speed. The children were extremely frightened. This action did not seem reasonable for an airplane or any other known aircraft. We watched as it shot straight up and due north, then disappeared. I went outside later that night, the air was crisp and I noticed the lack of wind. I have spotted similar objects in the night sky, without the movement, always on calm nights without clouds or wind. I swear this sighting to be the truth. I am a teacher and would not have believed this had I not seen it with my own eyes. The exact date of the month I cannot recall, it was a week or so before Halloween. It started before sundown and continued for 10 to 15 minutes. Did anyone else see this? I was in central Texas and felt sure that any state west of us could have also experienced this. It was a single craft, with pulsing lights, red off and on. Very unusual. Very.

This object was sphere shaped and about the size of a pickup truck. Its elevation was about 1500 ft. lower than most cub piper aircraft cruising elevations.What really shocked me is that it stopped instantly and hovered. Suddenly it shot back south-southeast to a point almost directly overhead. This was aprox. 160 degrees back from its original course and at a high rate of speed. Again it stopped instantly and hovered. The sun light reflected off its surface showing that it was silver or metalic. I was in awe about what I was seeing and at the point of telling my co-workers ""Hey! Whats that in the sky"" when this object shot out of site over the north-northeast horizon. I then asked my co-workers hey did you see that, after a discription they all laugh saying I was seeing things.

There were several bright objects with long tails which appeared low in the western sky, which was outside the drivers side pickup window.  These objects are best described as a group of slow motion shooting stars with bright tails, only closer. These, 5 to 6 objects appearing in the west, low in the horizion, was the closest distance to the observer, these objects were maintaining the same pattern as they moved from the drivers left, across the north bound path of the driver, this would be a north-easterly direction coming from the drivers left rear and crossing directly across the drivers front windshield.  The pattern and spacing of the objects were the width of a hand held @ arms length. The length of the ""tails"" or streaks of light were approximately four times the width of the pattern, or a distance of one foot @ that same arms length distance.  The initial sighting was outside the drivers door window and the objects were within this viewing window. The objects kept a low profile or low distance which could be viewed without bending down to view from inside a pickup truck. The color of the light was white.

Approx 20 minutes after some of us saw a very bright meteor overhead we saw an object in the distant sky in the SE heading NW at a constant rate of speed. As it grew closer it appeared to be diamond shaped and an orange in color. It flew directly overhead and at its closest appeared to be about 1/2 the size, possibly 3/4 the disk of a full moon. There was a near full moon this night so I did try to make a rough comparison. I saw it pass in front of a bright star which confirmed to me that is was indeed a solid object and gave me a very immediate sense of depth that it was somewhat low in the sky but how far up it was I could not say for sure. It appeared to be luminescent in some fashion but illumination by the moon could not be ruled out as it was a very clear night out and the moon was bright enough to light up the lawn. Several people in the group described several small points of light, ""like the ends of a fiber optic cable"" said one friend (number varies between 6 and 7) offset but surrounding the diamond shape. I am slightly nearsighted with a -.5 prescription and unfortunately was without my glasses this night so I was not able to make out the surrounding lights personally but I very clearly saw the orange body of the object. As it passed overhead we heard absolutely no noise coming from the object. Minutes after the object disappeared from sight an airplane took off heading east over our heads from O'hare airport. The comparison to a low flying commercial airplane was easily dismissed as we observed blinking navlights on the wing-tips of the plane, take off lights and an audible engine noise. The observed craft had neither of these. As the craft receded from us a girl in the group grabbed her 35mm camera and attempted to photograph the object with her telephoto lens and managed to take two pictures of it. At this time it was pretty far away so we are not anticipating a detailed image. The group of witnesses of saw the object consisted of people between the ages of 24 and 30 working in fields from business to art. Some of the group are very admitted skeptics and others are believers in the UFO phenomenon but the group consensus from both sides of the fence was that no one had ever seen anything like it before and could offer no explanation other than possibly a blimp or a balloon. Before we got in to to much detailed description within the group I had two of the witnesses go inside the house and draw the object independently based on their own description. I personally am into astronomy as a hobby and have witnessed meteors and satellites many times to know exactly what they look like. I can identify all the visible planets as well as the star Sirius. I know it was neither of those. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be an excellent observer and reporter of the facts surrounding the case.

Whilst previewing these photos we have come across a photo that simply cannot be explained in any other way but to be an unknown object rather close to an historic church we were photographing. I have not had time to scan a copy as yet to send to you although i will asap and would like your opinion on the object. I am still in posession of the negatives and have full intentions of having a re-print done on this particular shot to see if it can be explained any other way. ((NUFORC Note:  Seagull.

My girlfriend and I went out into the country to look at stars. We usually go about 15 miles outside of town so the lights don't interfere with our vision. I was looking up and noticed a small point of light. It wasn't extremely bright or anything, but as I watched it it moved in multiple directions. I have seen low orbit satelites before, but this was nothing like that. It would move up, then maybe to the left, stop, and then it would go down and to the right at a high rate of speed and acceleration. Sometimes it would stay perfectly still but then begin to move again. The patters of movement seemed to be random rather than the same thing over and over again. I would ask my girlfriend, ""What way is it moving now?"", and she would confirm the same direction that I had seen, without me telling her beforehand. I knew I wasn't crazy at that point. I don't know anything about UFO's, I never really even believed in them. I just figured, hey, we are only a small miniscule part of the entire world. So I would be self centered and nieve to believe that we are the only ones out there. If you have an explanation, please let me know. The only thing that I could come up with is that it was some sort of remote controlled satelite. But I think it was too high in the air for that. And why would a satelite make strange movements like that? Aren't satelites all going in the same direction in orbit? Do they have capabilities to change directions like that? Please respond to me if possible. My girlfriend is from Chicago but lives with me in Bloomington/Normal. We have made arrangements to pick up her dad's telescope the next time we visit them. I want to know more about what we saw. Please respond to me if you can.

I was camping out near Mammoth Mountain by the hot springs when all of a sudden the crickets stopped chirping. I was awake at this time because I was staring at the stars. Out here you can see all of the stars without the city lights interfering. From the west, I noticed a dark disk shaped object slowly moving and stopping as it made its way towards my location. I wasn't sure whether it was my eyes playing tricks on me until the object got within 50 feet of where I was. I was inside my sleeping bag next to my girlfriend which was asleep. I did not want to wake her in fear of her possibly scaring the craft away by getting up and screaming. I was frozen in fear and curiosity. I watched the craft slowly slip by, stopping for a few seconds at a time and continuing. There was a very slight hum amongst the silence around me. It was very eerie. At one moment, the craft emitted a dull blue beam from the far edge of disc as though it was searching for something. When this craft, which was now clearly visible as a shiny disc, came to a complete stop again, I crawled towards it hoping it didn't detect me. I kept thinking that this craft might have infrared or heat sensors to detect any movement outside, but there was no deviation from its course/task. At one point, the craft got to about 2 feet from the ground and the humming became louder. I got back without causing any notice when all of a sudden, the craft seemed to become enveloped by the surrounding area. It's as though it became invisible but with a slight atmospheric distortion. I watched this mirage-like phenominon float upwards until I could not see it anymore due to the darkness around. After about 5 minutes, the crickets started again and I stayed up until the sunrise anticipating the return of the object. This has changed my life forever and makes me realize that we might not be alone after all. I just wish that contact with another intelligent life form wouldn't be so uncommon or so hush-hush. I can handle the fact that there might be other humanoid ! lifeform s that we can associate with and learn from. Why should there be fear in contact? It's not like it's an alien inquisition or missionaries! They are scientists exploring without trying to interfere with our future. Something like Star Trek's prime directive of non interference. Besides, we have more to gain from them than they do from us.

On Thursday Aug 2 2001 a Wausau WI-based radio station was flooded with between 550 and 650 phone calls from listeners who claimed to have seen a large green lite that would streak across the sky, hover, then appear to crash. Several people claimed to have also thought is was a plane crashing and so they reported the sighting to several police and sheriff's departments. PLEASE look at a map of WI: callers who reported this (remember: there were over 550 of them)were calling from Wausau WI, WI Rapids WI, Bowler WI, Nekoosa WI, Plover WI, Stevens Point WI,  in the middle of the state, all the way up to the northern part of the state: Minocqua WI, Phillips WI, Rhinelander, WI.  People reported having to stop in the middle of highways because this thing hovered 30 to 50 feet above the ground.  Police departments verified also seeing this, and also recieving the numerous phone calls reporting a so-called downed plane. Meteorologists have suggested the possibility that this could be ball lightening.  Ball lightening is one of the rarest natural phenomena, and if that's what this is, it seems strange that it was seen by that many people....How could something so rare travel from the middle of the state of wisconsin, basicly along highway 51, up to the northern part of the state? Does ball lightening hover over Dodge Durangos? The object was reported as being extremely huge, and VERY bright green. One woman said that as she looked at it through the small side window of her car (the one that is next to large window that you would actually roll down) the green glow filled the entire window. It was said to have a sort of red tail that could be seen as it was moving. Those who saw it hover closer to the ground said it was so bright, that it didn't appear to have any shape, except that looking into it, the center appeared black, surrounded by a blinding green glow, with evident lights at the bottom perimeter of it. It would move slowly, flicker, and stop, drop in altitude, then appear to either crash or land.

I got to my driveway and it shot across the sky again, as silent as can be.  There was NO sound coming from this object.  It went so fast it seemed like it didn't move.  Then it just hovered over my neighbor's field.  Where I live, the neighbor's have about 5-20acres if land and woods in the background.  But, It just sat in the sky, for about 4 minutes.  It didn't bob up and down or move in the slightest bit.  I ran inside to get my video camera (but the battery was dead), I went back outside and it was still there, over the field.  Then it was gone.  I have never seen ANYTHING go as fast as this object did.  And then come to a dead stop.  It was amazing!

There was a white light in each corner and a bright red light in the middle.  It hovered there for about 30 seconds.  As I came closer it shot over to the left (North).  The object was at a complete dead stop and it went so fast.  It didn't start slow or slow down to stop.  It stopped as fast as it went. It just sat there in the sky perfectly quiet.  It didn't bob up and down or anything, completely still.  It stayed there for about 1 1/2 minutes.  I turned onto my street (north).  I couldn't see anything for about 1 minute because there were trees.  When I did, it was at the beginning of my street, the south tip.  It was hovering over a house there.  It took me about 2 minutes to get home.  When I got to my driveway I couldn't see it anymore until it shot across the sky so fast.  I couldn't believe my eyes it went so fast.  I had never seen an aircraft go so fast and be completely silent.  It went over my house and went two houses down from mine (north) and hovered in my neighbor's backyard which is about 20 acres.  It wasn't very far from their house though.  It again just sat there in the air with no movement or sound, like it was watching me.  I sat in my car for about 2 minutes and watched it.  I was stunned.  I ran in my house to find my video camera but I had forgotten to recharge the battery.  So I was in my house for about a minute or two and ran back outside and it was still there.

I cought it early on and Couldn't make my mind up what it was, I was almost suggesting to myself that it could be a satellite due to the way it wasn't getting brighter, when it did just that. Slowly it started to fizzle like a firework, then it grew in size getting brighter all the time and seemingly sparking, then I saw a puff of green and then it all turned a really bright burning green. I past a few trees but could still make it out it was so bright, then I came out on the other side (I was looking pretty nuch North now) and the fire stopped and just this red glow continued for a second, then it was gone. But I do suspect there is a hole in the ground a few miles north from here. The object didnt break up.

Her findings suggest that the case may not be accurate and authentic.  Linda had a very difficult time contacting the alleged witnesses, who did not return her many telephone calls.  When she finally reached the principal witness at his place of work, he denied any knowledge of having submitted the report, he denied any knowledge of the incident.   Apparently, a second family member reported to Linda that they would contact NUFORC about the case, but they have not done so as of the date of this writing.   LINDA MOULTON HOWE can be contacted at the following addresses:    Some kind of object was floating over one of my cows. I went out to my barn, before going to work to check on a couple of my cows and check their water.  This is a big barn, with two sliding doors on the front, each about 15 ft. tall, and 7 ft. wide.  I leave the doors open during the summer so air can cirulate.  When I walked in the was a thing floating over top of a cow.  I'll try to describe it.  It was about the size of a tire, but square, and angled down on all of it sides.  It looked about 8 in. thick, and maybe 3 ft. wide, and it was black with some kind of grey markings on it.  The thing actually looked kind of beatup.  When I walked in, the thing just floated there for a couple of seconds, then went over my head, and out the door. It didn't go real fast over me, but I don't know where it went once it got outside, and it didn't make any noise.  I looked a good while for it, but never saw it again.  I went back inside the barn to check on my cattle, they go in and out, that's where they water at, and found the cow that the thing was floating over.  She looked and acted alright, but I found a place on her ear that looked like she had been poked with a needle or somthing.  There was just a tiny bit of blood there, and also her eye on that side of her head, had like a broken blood vessel in it.  I told my wife what I saw, and she told me that I was crazy, so I thought I would tell you.  I was also late for work because of this dawgone thing.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,38.2211,-82.4393

They circled the area before disappearing behind trees.  Their white lights were blinking, each with its own frequency that differed slightly from the other two.  When compared to a plane, these three white lights were reported as being much much brighter and moving much faster.  They were also following a path that was not similar to the usual flight pattern of airplanes in the area.  The observer is usually a UFO skeptic who would rather not dwell on the subject, but he was slightly riled up and excited by this sighting.  He repeatedly made the comment that ""that definitely was not an airplane"" and also said, ""I know that was not a weather balloon.""  It was clear from that reference that he was rethinking his thoughts on UFO's and aliens.  He also said that he had felt like he was being drawn outside to look for the lights after he lost sight of them.

I looked up and saw a very large triangle shape that was lit up by hundreds of small lights around the outside of the craft. I looked around to see if anybody else was witnessing what I was seeing but there was nobody around me except for the people in their cars on the street. The triangle formation was too tight to be a formation of planes, at no point did the lights move from oneanother or separate from their formation. I saw a smaller cluster of lights on the bottom of the craft and in the middle of the triangle. The cluster of lights began to flash and spin around in circles. At that time I saw a brighter light shining out from the smaller cluster of lights that were flashing. A beam of light very similar in size to a spot light began to shin down towards the ground. It was very unusual but the beam of light did not touch the ground, it stopped about 20 or 30 feet above the ground. I could not figure out why the light was not touching the ground but you could see where exactly the beam stopped. then after about a minute of watching this,it (the ufo) tilted upward and took off straight up into the sky from a dead stop where I saw it. Within less that a second the triangle was gone. As it took off there was a very faint streak of what looked like flames coming from the back of the ufo. This was not seen by anybody else that I asked on the street and I placed a call to the police and asked if they had recieved any calls about it but they said that they did not.

I looked out my window and noticed a very distinct, silvery object that I initially thought was an airplane. It had a cylindrical or cigar shaped body. Although the object was distinct, I couldn't detect any wing or tail features in the brief glances I made while trying to keep my eyes on the road and traffic. The object looked like it was at least 1000 feet or so above Boundary Bay (SSW of my position at about 40 degrees above the horizon. It was much larger/closer than my August 3rd sighting (about half the diameter of a dime held at arms length). It was aligned in approximately a north/south alignment and seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. There was absolutely no vapor trail. I kept glancing back at it trying to get a better view. On my third or fourth glance, it suddenly disappeared completely. One moment it was there, the next it had vanished completely. I tried scanning the sky repeatedly and could see nothing but blue sky. Then just as suddenly, it was there again, in about the same part of the sky I had seen it, less than a minute before. Again I got two or three glances at it and just as suddenly as before, it completely vanished. At this point I pulled my vehicle to the shoulder and stopped my truck. I scanned the whole sky and could find no aircraft. I kept waiting and scanning for  a few minutes but  no object reappeared in the sky.

All this one had was a series of white lights, of equal amplitude, that seemed to be spaced out all along and around the edges of the object.

We did this, quickly, and were almost directly underneath the object as it moved on its North / North-West path.

I was sitting in my living room Thanksgiving morning watching T.V. when I heard an unusual slow low frequency modulating hum. I looked through the sheer drapes that were closed at the time, and noticed quite a few lights directly east moving northbound. When I parted the drapes I had expected either helicopters or planes, but was stunned by the enormity of the ""one"" triangular object that I saw. The object itself was bigger than a football field, had one red light in the bottom middle with smaller white lights in each of the corners, was charcoal grey to black colored, and surrounded by a dull orangy faint glow of some sort. It moved what I consider to be slower than stall speed for an aircraft in a slightly northeastern direction. The height at which it was flying was in my opinion just high enough to clear a radio tower, of which there are several in the direction it was headed. The hum sound it emitted was neither a prop, or jet engine as I am familiar with both of these. I am a 38 year old music teacher, and have programmed sounds on synthesizers regularly, and relate it to a low modulating frequency with a slow sweeping resonance effect. I used up a little time trying to look for a camera, and decided to give up the search for one, and step outside to get a better look.  By the time I was outdoors it took about 20 seconds to disappear over the northeastern neighborhood rooftops. The conditions that morning were overcast, and still dark out at 6:30 a.m., and being right next to an interstate feel that surely someone else might have experienced the same event that morning.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,41.6604,-83.448

Visiting potential inlaws (year before marriage)in rural area a very few miles south of Merkel, near Abilene, TX.  After lunch, while family members visited in ranch house, I went checking promising areas along small stream for archeological remains.  Found site with surface artifacts a few hundred yards north and a bit west of house, which itself had surficial artifacts due north.  Site was across road from area north of house, perhaps 300 yards.  After about 30 minutes of exploring, I looked up and saw disc-shaped object almost directly overhead, a little north and east of me.  Note here that surveying surface sites requires intense scrutiny of the ground, and therefore occasional reorientation of the head and neck in order to avoid muscle pain.  I had looked up several times while changing orientation, but sometimes looked east, or west, or NE, etc.  This time it was due north.  Object was moving due north, not especially fast but easily at same speed as a commercial jet.  Shape was perfectly circular, with no visible evidence of thickness --looked to me as if it were an extremely thin disc.  It moved due north at regular speed with no variation at all.  Neve rmoved from course.  Color silver-gray, as if brushed aluminum.  Not shiny or reflective -- gray on bottom, which was obviously in shadow.  No glow, no lights, no features of any kind.  As object continued north, it grew more ""oblong,"" that is, its N-S dimension shrank in relation to its E-W dimension, which did change.  It looked like a dime held at arm's length, but somewhat smaller.  As it went north, it got smaller in both directions, but it never gave any indication of thickness and did, indeed, seem rather thin in relation to its width.  Also did not change color or shade, but did seem to get somewhat darker as it went north.  Object disappeared into some high, fine clouds at a point very far north of me.  Estiamte of speed -- 600 to 1000 mph.  Sound -- none.  Lights -- none.  Colors other than gray -- none.  Movement to sides -- none.  C! hange in altitude -- none.  Change in direction -- none.  Decorations or discernible features: none.  Protuberances -- none.  Shape -- perfectly circular but thin, not spherical.  Upper superstructure -- possible, just not visible.  Lower shape -- unknown; looked flat but could have been either concave or convex; if so, not by much.  Duration of sighting -- about 3 minutes maximum, probably a minute less.  I recall removing my eyes long enough to light a cigarette, look around to see if anyone else was in sight, and returnig my gaze until it disappeared.   No one else around.  Sky -- clear except for very high, very thin, very fine, long feather-shaped clouds in parallel orderly arrangements that some people now seem to think represent ""chemtrails"" or other manipulation of the weather.  Back then, we recognized these cloud features as being normal for summer or late spring.  Object was above these clouds, which according to qualified resources not given to paranoia usually appear in the 30,000 - 36,000 feet elevations.  That means object was higher than 36000 feet and therefore was pretty damned big.  Speed may well have been in excess of 1500 mph.  No other objects in sky.  Nearby to NE was an AFB with a SAC detachment.  No planes scrambled.  Note that the object was perfectly clearly limned or delineated -- edges crisply defined.  No wings, no fuselage, no engines, no cockpit, no rudder, no tail, and no question about any of it.  No contrails.",2000-12-20T00:00:00,32.4546,-100.0233

Essentially I saw a black diamond shaped UFO that was the size of a football field (no kidding). I was so close that the detail of it will never leave my memory. I happened to be camping in Banff National park, and I was hiking in a glacier valley when I saw the craft. It had a marble type smooth black surface, with triangular geometric interconnections, which when attached togehter made up the large diamond/triangular shape craft. At the base or bottom of the craft were windows that were lighted up , and positioned in each corner of the triangular craft were three rotating lights (blue/red) which were attached to long extended arms. The craft was silent and seemed to move as such a low speed that it seemed I could probably outrun it. It sailed gracefully in the sky, like it was floating.

Certainly not highway noise, and while similar to typical aviation noise, somehow much more ""otherworldly"" sounding.  This is such a subjective description, but is the best I can come up with.  We live along a creek banked by steep cliffs and have a deep ravine originating near our home that opens into the creek in a break in the cliffs.  I mention this because I believe this feature can amplify aerial noises.  I will also mention that I have been an avid sky watcher for almost exactly a year now, my interest originally having been piqued by stumbling across info on the web re: anomolous contrails, aka chemtrails.  Within a month or so of reading about them, they began appearing frequently in our skies, typically the result of what I would  say, from the planes I have viewed, are military jets doing some kind of exercise. In any case, this morning the skies were almost pure blue, but typically upon hearing that unusual noise planes will appear and the skies slowly haze over... This morning something totally unexpected happened. A cigar shaped object appeared at an altitude just under the few clouds (cirrus) in the sky, slowly moving west to east.  While the strange noise was coming from a distance through the ravine, there was no sound whatsoever associated with this craft. It was uniformly silver, with no wings and no windows that I could observe.  It had no contrails coming from it.  My best estimate as to its size would be that of a typical tractor-trailer only wider.  It had the shape of a medicine capsule, therefore I would call it a cigar shaped object for classification purposes.  Within approximately 2 minutes this slow moving craft ascended at perhaps a 15 degree angle and poof! disappeared from view.  I have been thinking about it all day - it was so unusual.  Within a minute of seeing this object, a military (I assume) jet ap! peared i n the sky emitting a contrail at about the same altitude.  Back in March, I was driving near my home looking at lingering contrails and noticed a jet - traveling next to it towards its rear was a silver orb a bit smaller than the jet.  I wished to observe this by following it in my car but had someone tailgating me, so I was unable to make a turn in order to observe more.  Other than that sphere and the cigar witnessed this morning, I have NEVER seen anything like these craft before in my life and would rule out explanations such as ""blimp"", ""weather balloon"" or the like.  I have never ""believed"" in UFOs but the sighting this morning, as well as the orb some months back, have me convinced that there are at the very least craft of whatever origin whose operating mechanisms are nothing like those the general public are privy to.",2001-08-20T00:00:00,38.8289,-91.9744

At about 10:45 PM driving west on I-70 near the intersection of I-70 & C-470, (Golden, Colorado) I saw what was most likely a large meteor or Space Junk. It first appeared to me just below the top of my windshield at about a 30 degree angle above the horizon, appearing to flare up at that point to a bright yellow-white color with a long tail and sparks and small chunks breaking off. It was about half to 2/3rds the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. It dropped almost vertically to a point just above the ridgeline of the foothills, and appeared to dim out just before disappearing. While very hard to estimate distance, if I had to venture a guess I would say 5 to 20 miles, though it could have been much further. It looked to me that it very likely hit the ground relatively near Denver. (A call to the USGS for seismic cooberation was quite unsatisfying) I had my hand held GPS operating, and checked the current heading at that time as 201 degrees. I am trying to confirm if that is magnetic or true heading, but the GPS manual does not specify. It appears to be magnetic heading based on my aeronautical chart and the road in that area. The object was just slightly left of straight ahead, so most likely about a 195-200 degree magnetic heading from that intersection. Plotting this on my Denver Area Chart (aeronautical chart), the line runs nearly through Marshdale, Silver Springs, and Bailey Colorado. (If my GPS course turns out to be True Course, shift the line 10 ½ degrees to the left, but magnetic course looks right on the map). This was one of the most spectacular, low and close objects of this type I have seen, and if my small plane were not in the shop I would go out looking for evidence. It may be possible if able to triangulate or get a seismic location to find a relatively pristine meteor or space debris. I don't know who to contact about meteor impacts, so perhaps you can tell me or pass this on. Perhaps NORAD/Space Command has some info on this object if they will share it with us.

To be honest, I was completely amazed at the lack of engine noise. This object was triangle-shaped. Similar to a boomarang but with well-defined sharp corners. We stood there about 2 minutes as it slowly drifted a couple more degrees southest and while still directly above us; accelerating and gaining altitude rapidly past the horizon in about 15 seconds. By the time we were able to get the camera and snap a picture it was too far away to get anything of use on the film. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The city of Louisville had its annual ""Thunder over Louisville"" that same night so this event may be related to the airshow. But I never saw any aircraft that low that didn't make an engine thrust sound or traverse 90 degrees of sky in 15 seconds. If anyone saw the same object, I wish they would post it here so as to compare notes; or confirm that it wasn't an illusion.",2001-04-28T00:00:00,36.939511475409844,-85.94517213114754

Around 3 this morning. I awoke to a sound unlike any I have heard before in my life--the only way I can describe it is to say, if you can imagine a gigantic, hi-tech helicopter that was the size of a battleship, that might give some idea. There had been a storm earlier in the night, but this certainly was not thunder--it was a steady but pulsing drone that was so loud and extended (and very mechanical sounding, VERY unlike thunder in that respect) I felt as though it must have spanned over a distance of five or ten miles. The entire house was mildly rattling at one point. So the next morning, I wondered whether I had simply hallucinated the entire thing, and asked someone who lives about a mile away if they heard anything last night, anything odd or different from normal. They said, ""As a matter of fact, around 3 in the morning, it sounded as though a gigantic helicopter was hovering right over my house. It woke me up."" I regret not looking outside the window when it happened--have no idea why. I even wondered this morning if it was an earthquake of some sort, as I've heard there can be unusual sounds associated with those. By the way, I called the local police department last night and they heard nothing about this. I have seen military helicopters flying in formation over a nearby region (there are several airports around here), once during the night--but this really didn't sound quite like that (the ""thump-thump-thumps"" of your ordinary helicopter tend to be spaced closer together, stacatto-like) --plus, there was quite a fog around here most of the night, and I have a hard time imagining there were many flights in the air as a result--but I can't say for sure. If you happen to know of any sightings or other odd phenomena that were reported last night in the midwest, I sure would appreciate hearing about it/them.

For the first half hour or so, it remained stationary. After that however, I started to notice it slowly moving to another part of the sky. It was very suttle to someone who might just be looking up, but it was definitely moving. It didn't seem to be of conventional origin for the mear fact that it moved so slowly. I was watching it by myself until my wife came in the room. She usually poo-poo's the idea of UFO's but when she saw it and saw it was moving, it kind of spooked her. We had binoculars handy so we watched it and saw a better view of the object. It was very bright, and every so often would change to part red. Sometimes more red than white. Now we knew it wasn't venus- plus it had moved so far. It took a little over an hour for the object to finally disappear over the mountain. When I first viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared as a huge ball of light. I could not see any indication that it was a conventional craft. I am not an expert, and have only seen something peculiar one other time, but this one stumps both my wife and I. Please let me know if someone else saw this object or somehow this can be explained away.

I was to meet some friends to watch the Leonid meteor shower.  After dressing in layers to ward off the chill, I stepped out onto my back balcony to see if I could see any shooting stars.  I saw three almost immediately.  I went in and excitedly phoned my friends - It was going to be great!, I said.  I stepped back out again, not wanting to miss anything.  I saw another shooting star, and then two large, luminous triangles appeared over the houses and trees from the north, headed south.  At first I related the illumination to the meteor shower, but when I looked directly at the objects an instinct kicked in that these were NOT stars, and I was witnessing something incredible. I live a block and a half away from the Naval Academy and I am used to Navy flyovers, Blue Angels, etc.  THIS WAS DIFFERENT.  The triangles did not project light to the ground, they themselves were yellowish, white light. Their edges were not sharp, they were slightly rounded with the glow of the light. The light did not fade or throb, it was constant. They appeared to be flying in formation - points facing down, close together, on a diagonal.  Together, they were about the size of a half moon. Their movenment was fluid and quick and they were SILENT.  My field of view is not very wide out my back porch, so I was only able to watch the objects for 7 seconds or so.  Soon after they disappeared from my view, I heard a boat horn sound twice quickly.  It occurred to me that maybe someone on the water saw the same thing, as the objects were headed in the direction of City Dock.  I met my friends on the back campus of St. Johns.  I told them I was pretty sure I had seen UFOs (a first for me, by the way) and quickly described my experience.  They reacted with friendly skepticism.  We were lying on a blanket, enjoying the wonderful meteor shower when I saw the triangles again in the southeast corner of the sky.  I sat up, pointed, and said ""Look!!!  There they are!!!""  Thank goodness one friend was ! able to see them.  They were much farther away - about a third of the size they were before, and not as luminous.  They were now reddish orange in color and continued flying quickly in a southeast direction.  Just before they disappeared from our field of view, one triangle broke out of formation and darted ahead.  It was surreal. It seemed as though the triangles were animated - right out of a movie.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,38.974446787148594,-76.52259959839357

It then stopped again and began a series of rough circles, stoping for a few minutes after each completed circle.  My friends reported smaller points of light leaving and returning to the object at one point in time (I was watching an appoaching plane, which I thought might have been a reconisance flight from the near-by air force base).

I estimate there were 5 to 6 bumps on the object. I watched quite closely to see if the object passed between my sight and any stars in the sky, and it appeared to ""blank"" out a few stars as it passed. In very quick order, I first thought they were birds; when I suspected a single wedge object, what came to mind was a stealth-type bomber (B2 or F-117A). The object appeared to be cruising at approx 500 - 1000 ft, and I suspect the ""wingspan"" was 100 - 150 feet. I can't estimate how fast it was traveling. It took a straight course from north to south, and I believe it passed in and out of my vision within less than 10 seconds. As I watched, I crossed further into the yard to clear the trees, and watched as the object simply faded from sight into the night sky, never changing course. I was struck by how completely silent the object was, and the night was very quiet (not unusually quiet; traffic could be heard in the distance, bird was heard afterward). If it weren't for the extreme quiet and lack of any engine glow or lighting, I would simply suspect it to be a craft from Miramar AFB (and I still think it may be).

I happened to glance toward the East when right in my eye sight I observed two faintly visible, white, dim, non-blinking lights moving to the East NorthEast at what I thought was an impossible rate of speed for even a military jet, which is rarely seen around here. My assumption at that time was it was one fairly long object with one dim, non-blinking light forward and one dim, non-blinking light at the rear at an undeterminable altitude.  No wing lights seemed visible although between front and rear lights a very slight dim, white illumination seemed barely noticable along the edges of its body. The observed object was at about 60 degrees from my vantage point and covered about two thirds of the sky within approximately 5 seconds or so. Suddenly the object slowed down so very rapidly it barely seemed possible.  It seemed to just ""coast"" slowly for a second and it then just vanished.

I saw two lights at first thinking that is was two airplanes flying side by side in unison.  Then I realised it was one large object when I saw a small red light beside the far right light.  As the object went out of view behind some trees, I followed in my car for about a minute and caught a better look from the rear.  It was three lights in a line with the small red light just a bit lower to the right. As I watched the object trying to see if there was any discernable shape to it, I noticed that there was absolutely no noise coming from it.   I live in an area between Reagan National and Dulless International Airport and am familiar with the types of planes ad helecopters that fly in this area.  For any plane to have been that size in my field of view, it would have been making a recognizable deep rumble sound.  This object was higher up in the sky and was bigger that anything I have ever seen fly anywhere.  It seemed to glide though the sky heading south when it went out of view.  I was surprised that nobody else saw this in my area given its large population.

Suddenlly after moving about three quarters of the way accross the sky it's shape appeared more cheveron like.

The object had no lights, or light pattern on it, yet it was somewhat luminous. It seemed to be white, almost siver in color. The object flew from east to the southwest at about a 60 degree angle from the horizon, and that's the opposite direction of the flight pattern of the commercial air traffic in the area.

The weather had a slight ground breeze and there was a slight haze in various areas of the skies due to airplane exhaust.  Other than that the view was well over 250 miles. I was sitting in the passenger seat and was commenting on the streaks of airplane contrails that were going east to west and vice-versa. I noticed a large 767 that was flying at about 40,000 ft going west to east just cross over and above a 737 going from east to west and was commenting about that also.  Then I noticed a larger than the 767 white object appearing to be stationary in the sky directly overhead.  I asked my wife to pull over and we observed the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly crawled across the sky at an estimated altitude of approx 50,000 to 60,000 ft.  It was not shining and was pure white.  It initially appeared to have small stubby like wings coming from the oval body but that was lost as the item was moving straight easterly from us.

We were stopped only 500 yards from the Prescott Airport (small planes only).  There is also a FAA VFR station approximately 10 miles NW of the airport.  There were a lot of commericial flights going east to west and vice-versa but those plane configurations were noticeable and identifiable.  I asked that we start driving North on Hwy 89 back to our homes at 1106 hrs and I watched the object as we progressed northward.  By the one mile mark past were we had stopped previously, the object not only had continued easterly but also had shifted to southernly view point.  That told me that the object was semi-stationary and since we were the ones moving that explained the object appearing to be more in the southern view. As we continued to drive north to our home, hoping to get a camera, the object was lost above one of the haze clouds from the lower flying aircraft.

As we got closer, we realized that it was comming towards us, and had what appeared to be blinking lights on the side. As we got closer to it and it to us, it became apparent that it was either close to the ground or very large, and had I believe 8 lights on it, 7 on the front in the chevron formation, and an 8th white blinking light in the back, located two inches(from my vantage point directly below it) from the frontmost light in the front. The front lights were varius sizes of cirlcles ranging from medium to large, with a red light at the ""nose"" of the object. The size of the circles were in no apparent order, but were symetrical in placement, i.e. a medium was across from a medium, and a large light was across from a large light. Once the object moved over the road, it slowed down to a nearly complete stop and shot out what looked like a faint spot light on the shoulder of the road at an angle of about 45 degrees from either the center or one side of the chevron. After the spotlight went out, it sped up, crossed the road diagonaly, and contined to move away from us towards the house at a fairly quick clip. At this point I called ((dleeted)) to tell him to get outside and see if he could get a look at what we had just driven under. I was on the phone with ((deleted)), who had answered ((deleted)) phone, for about a half of a minute when I looked out  the window and spotted another object, this time shaped like what I would call a classic saucer, only fairly  then what is normally reported.. like a sort of cigar, but more saucer shapped. It was moving over a field in the distance, complete with blinking lights that formed the saucer shape. It stopped over the field, sat there for about 5 seconds, then moved about three inches into what I presume was a different field, and stopped again, this time for about three seconds. Then continued its course in the same direction as the first object we had seen. My friend thinks that it was a helipcopter, but I havent seen helicopters with that many lights on it.. there may have been 6-7 lights on it, that appeared small from where we were. Also, from the distance that it seemed to be at, it must have been a very large helicopter, as it was about the size of a Altoid from where we were sitting on the road (we had pulled into a shoulder at this point to watch the object over the field). I was already extreemly excited over the first sighting, but this second one sent me over the top. I was yelling into the phone, ""oh my god what the hell is that, theres another one out there, look at that thing ((deleted))! Do you see it? Is that a helicopter? Jesus man its stopped!"" Then, as it sped away, I said something like, ""Holy *&^@! Holy *&^@! Christ man look at it!"" At this point I heard ((deleted)) say to ((deleted)), who must have been in the room with him, ""Damn man it sounds like ((deleted)) is flipping out, do you see anything?""

The best way I can describe it would be that of light coming out of a lampshade that angles downward. This object was not very high, had absolutely no other lights such as a tail light on helicopters or any wing lights, and made absolutely no sound, or no sound we were aware of. The object travelled exactly the same speed as traffic. As soon as I saw it and realized it wasn't a glare or reflection I asked my girlfriend what the hell that was. She looked and watched it in awe. As we drove down the road watching it, it suddenly literally just took off. Instantly flew forward out of view, I've never seen anything move so fast in my life. It was very eerie, I felt excited because I knew I saw something that is very rare to see and something some people simply can't believe exists as they haven't experienced it themselves. I dropped her off and she too was shocked and knew she saw a ""UFO"". I haven't seen anything of that nature since. However, in summer of '99 I was swimming in the backyard of a friends house around 3-4 a.m. when we saw a blinking light as far as the stars. Now, this blinking light we found very odd, especially the individual whose pool it was because he watches the stars a lot, because this light changed direction numerous amounts of times. We would watch this light blink once in one area of the sky. About a minute later it traveled I would say the length of the big dipper and blinked again.

My husband and I(at that time we were not married) were out taking a drive in the country on a nice night and I noticed a bright ""ball"" in the sky.  This light was pretty far away, straight in front of us, from our vantage point just peeking over the tree tops.  At first I thought it was an airplane tower light but it seemed too bright and high.  My husband asked, ""What is that?"" and we started to explain it away-plane, helicopter, etc..  Then it moved straight up and straight to the left and repeated this movement as if going up stairs a couple of times, until it was high in the sky, like a very bright star, in front and slightly to the left of us.  At this point we were talking to each other- is it some military helicopter or UFO or what? Also at this point we were driving on a straight road and we had slowed down considerably.  Then the light dimmed from a bright white to a orangish color and began moving in a straight line directly to us.  It was weird because it was very far away and we never took our eyes off it but it was right on top of us too quickly.  It was like it moved very slowly and steadily yet it got to us faster than it should have.  At this point we had stopped in the middle of this road and turned off the headlights.  There was no one else around. The UFO stopped and hovered directly above our car and slightly to the left about 20 ft.? above us.  I'm not that great with measuring distance but it was right on top of us. It was about 4 or 5 times the size of our thunderbird turbo coupe, Triangular with rounded edges, apparently black in color and had many lights on the bottom.  Because it was right on top of us we couldn't see the top but it did appear to have a ""windshield"" on one of the points facing the same direction we were.   It made no noise, created no wind that I could tell and even though it had lights it didn't give off light or light anything up.  It was slowly turning back and forth (left and right) but not all the way around.  From the time it reached us to the time my husband stuck the car in gear and went peeling down the road was probably only 30 seconds or so.  I felt like an animal, we were both crying and panicing.  The UFO crossed over the top of our car so that it was on the right side. To the right(out my window) was pasture and the UFO was flying at the level of my window-4 or 5 ft. off the ground (?) and seemed to be playing a game with us, it would stay along side the car, then back off and catch back up, shoot ahead and wait for us, etc.. this lasted about a minute or 2.  I was looking from it to my husband who was trying to drive and screaming at him to get away.  At one point I looked back and it was gone.  We made a right turn and I was looking in the sky and found it looking like a bright star again, about 1 minute after it had disappeared.  We made another right turn so as it was directly in front of us, high in the sky and it just dove down into the trees at an extremely fast speed.  That was it.   My husband is a plumber and I am a stay at home mom.  I wished for a long time that this didn't happen.  I've gotten past it now and try not to think about it too much.

A very very large meteor,North Cove,WA,1995-02-20T02:30:00,fireball,2 minutes,"Occurred : 2/20/1995 02:30  (Entered as : 02/20/95 02:30) Reported: 3/1/2001 21:48 Posted: 3/6/2001 Location: North Cove, WA Shape: Fireball Duration:2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16690.html,"A very very large meteor Living on the SW Washington Coast in an area of high erosion, in the aftermath of very high winds, and a very high tide, I went out to assess the damage in the light of a first quarter moon, shining thrugh a moderate cloud cover .  After walking along my property on the shoreline, I came to a road, which was once a highway, but now broken by the erosion.  I stood, looking in the dim light at the waves breaking and the driftwood being beaten on shore.  All of a sudden, I noticed a deep green glow.  I don't know exactly how it first caught my eye, but it became more and more apparent.  The intensity grew... and the deep green turned into an electric... or an increasing radiant green.  I was standing at North Cove of Willapa bay on SW Washington.  I was now looking into the entire 110 sq. mile bay.  The Hills at 2:30 AM were brightening and visible unlike anything I had ever seen in the daylight.  This light compelled me to look around.  I was wearing a baseball type hat.  Apparently, the brim of the hat kept me from seeing what I finally saw because I had to look.  Fifteen to twenty seconds into this electric green light intensifying experience, I finally looked up.  Through an opaque cloud cover, and over the moonlight, I saw a silver fireball.  (thinking, how could a silver fireball produce a green light?  But it was the way I recorded it.)  This object, from where I was standing, was as large as the moon, but moving downward from horizontal at about 15 degrees, and to the north (left to right)...  There was a period where I wasn't aware of any object, but saw some ground effect. Then there was the time I moved my attention to the object.  The total duration of the visual experience was around 20 seconds.  In retrospect, I'd divide the time to half observing ground light, and the other half to observing the object.  I have seen magnesium burn before.  The ligh emmissions of this object were magnesium like.  It trailed at a slight angle, from where I looked, located half way between Seattle and Portland. It looked to be a long way off and moving very fast.  Then it went dark.  As I pondered in the instant what had happened, I turned from the edge of the road and began walking up it towards a building I owned, located some several hundred feet away.  About a minute and a half after I started walking, about the time I was ajacent the structure, there came a crash which nearly knocked me off my feet. It so happens that I tuned into Art Bell the night after and heard him ask if anyone had any information on a sighting in the NW.  Two men from Everett Washington called, stating they had been out on break in the middle of the night when they saw this flash in the sky. Now understand this.  It was a miserable winter night.  No one had any reason to be out.  I was only out because of extenuating circumstances dealing with erosion on my property. Calling in the same hour I saw it, local law enforcement called it ""some loud thunder"". As I understand, subsequent to the experience, something hit the Gig Harbor area.  My personal feelings are that this thing came into the atmosphere around Portland, heading north/northwest.  Given the 150 mile covered in 20 seconds,  I'd estimate it's speed between 25 and 30 thousand miles per hour. ((name deleted))",2001-03-06T00:00:00,,

From the rocks at the end of the main street they are evident after sunset, and usually appear in the direction of Missisauga.  One, two or three orbs may be seen, often taking the form of a triangle (one object higher than two others).  They hang in the atmosphere, going nowhere but occasionally growing dim or blinking out.  They have been videotaped and computer-analyzed by members of a Buffalo MUFON group, and are solid objects.  There is a website (""Orbwatch"") devoted to them.  They are well worth investigation.  They are NOT airplanes, unless airplanes hover over lakes and emit non-blinking, yellowish light! The objects may be seen at any time of year but are more obvious in spring, summer and fall.

Anyway here is this triangle reflection traveling on the ground cross over the hood and keeps going. So I got out to examine the area or to see if there was a logical answer for this there was none no house around to cause a reflection there are no trains in the area. The sky was clean.

(it occurred 15 miles south of KCI airport).  As I was the passenger, I looked to the north and saw, against a solidly cloudy sky, what looked like a large dark boomerang.  I cannot really determine the size, as it was not close to any terrestrial objects near the horizon.  It was totally by itself in the sky.  As we were south of the airport, I have often seen airplanes, so I did a doubletake, thinking ""that's not an airplane.""

I work midnight’s and This was my normal day off, I usually try to stay up most of the nights I’m off since its easier on the body. I was listening to Art Bells show when the dogs started to act funny, this was about 4am central. I thought they wanted to go out so I headed to the back door. I live a couple of miles from a midsized city an hour south of Chicago on I-57.. Our subdivision is built in a large U shape with a farm field in the center. The houses opposite mine are about three hundred yards away across the field to the east. The filed is about six or seven hundred yards north south. We have had a very dense fog for the last few days due to little wind, a very deep snow cover and temperatures in the mid to upper 40’s. The Fog has been so thick that I could not see the houses across the field behind me, visibility has probably been 100 yards or less. As I approached the back door to let the dogs out I saw a green light coming from the back yard, actually from the field behind the yard. This puzzled me since the fog was still out side. I could see it out of the window in the front of the house from the room where my computer is located.  I grabbed a flashlight that was on a table and headed out. What I saw amazed me. I opened the door and there it was. A large object probably 40 or 50 feet off the ground. The center of the object, which had a small intense green light on the bottom was located about 75 or 80 yards directly behind my yard in a line with a point 5 feet to the north of my back door connecting the electrical box at the edge of the property. It was about 100 feet in diameter since it looked like it would touch the ground if it were turned 90 degrees and extend about the same distance upward from its midpoint. It looked cigar shaped but had point like extensions kind of like a star of David but eight of them equidistant around the circumference. I poked my head back into the house to look for a camera, my wife took up scrapbooking a few months ago and usually has a camera with film in it in the kitchen. I found the camera, but no film. I was going to grab the video camera but it was in a different room. What I did see to grab was my laser pointer from my brief case on the island in the kitchen. I kept the dogs inside and headed out to see this thing with my maglight and my laser pointer in hand. I only had a pair of slippers on but didn’t think much of it till later. I shined he flashlight at the object but the fog made it a big blur for lack for a better word. I left it on the deck as I headed out to the edge of the yard.. When I reached the edge of the yard and the end of the grass I stopped. I was still 70 or so yards away from the edge of it. It did not move. I shinned the pointer at the object then and could see my beam and the point it hit the objects belly. I then shinned it on the neighbors house to get some idea how far it would go and still be visible in the fog I could see it as far as 2 houses away but could not see where I knew the third house to be. So the visibility limit for the point was probably somewhere between 100 and 150 yards or so. I then shined the pointer on the object running it across the bottom  making sure to run it along all the edges to better judge its size. After a few minutes of this the light on the bottom of the object flashed once. It increased by at least, I’m guessing 3 orders of magnitude. Then it went back to its previous brightness the flash lasted maybe ¼ second and reminded me of a photo flash but green in color. After a  few seconds it flashed again but twice this time, each flash about ½ second apart. It did it again a few seconds later and this time it did three flashes then a few seconds without a flash then 5 flashes a period of  seconds then 7 flashes. It was then it dawned on me these were prime numbers. I still had the pointer and I shined 11 flashes at the green light then 13. The object then flashed 17 at me. We were communicating.  Then it stopped for almost a minute. At this point its easier to just write in the number sequence of flashes I have no idea what they mean. 19,7,8,18,19,6,16,19,21,11,21,12,13,20,23,21,24,8 	After the last grouping the light went dull maybe a magnitude or so dimmer than it was initially. Then at the tips of the star like projections green lights but a darker green or a little toward blue came on. The object started to lift up then moving a few feet a second at first then moving faster. There was no sound. It looked to be going straight up.  I shined the pointer on it until I could not see the point any longer but could still make out the 8 lights from the projections for a few more seconds then it was just gone. 	The whole event took maybe 10 or 12 minutes, I forgot to look at the watch when I went outside but know that it was around 4 am, it was just after 4 15 when I checked the watch. Then I went out to the field to the point that was under the center of the object. The snow in the field was kind of spotty but a circular pattern could be seen at the point I figured to be under the green light. The pattern was by stepping it off in my house slippers 45 paces a bit bigger I think than what I had thought the object was. My step count was 115 from my army days, this put the diameter of the circle on the ground at about 127 feet. 	I saw your site on Arts site so I figured you would like to know about this. I would rather not attach my name as I think people may find out about this and think im crazy. But I will give directions to the location without giving my actual address as well as my email, though im not sure thats a good idea. On I 57 take the 1st exit to kankakee southbound from chicago. Note sure of the exit number but there is a Wal-Mart near it along with a mall. Head south 1/2 mile to an intersection there will be a Dennys on the right and the Wal-Mart will be on the Left front. Turn left at this intersection. You will be headed East. The road crosses over I 57 and continues east. From the center of the over-pass the site is 1 mile further East just past the first creek that you will come to. From here you can't miss it.",2001-02-24T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

We were east of Phoenix, AZ in a place near the Superstition Mountains called Canyon Lake.  We arrived at an observation point that included a small parking lot and a roofed scenic looking area.  It oversaw Canyon Lake and its surrounding mountains.  We all proceeded to leave the vehicle and stepped out to the railing that protected one from a fall down the observation point's steep rocky terrain.  It was a very clear night with no wind.  It was warm enough where you would not need a jacket.  We then began looking towards the horizon line above the mountains where we noticed a formation of lights that encircled the canyon area.  Some of them were actually inside of the canyon.  We didn't say much at first because they were about a 1/2 mile to a mile away and shape and dimension were lost especially at night time.  We then pointed them out to each other speculating as to the nature of these lights.  Helicopters?  Airplanes?  There is after all an airport due west in Phoenix about 30-50 miles away.  We slowly began to realize that these UFOs were not moving in any conventional manner. we counted from between 10 to 12 of these objects.  And they began moving in a westerly direction right towards us.  The closer they got the more detail we could interpret.  Some of the craft appeared to be ""scanning"" the ground below with a white light beam and thats when we realized exactly what we were looking at.  There appeared to be about 10-11 ""disc/saucer"" type craft and one or two ""flagship"" type craft.  One ship appeared to our right and we could make out its very large size and the fact that it did not make ANY noise whatsoever.  This was one of the flagship type.  It was large, football field size, octogonal with a series of lights (white, blue and red) that went at differing patterns on the bottom and sides of the ship.  The craft underneath was whitish/tanish and the foreward area was very dark and shaped like a ""boomerang"".  (My speculation is that it protects the ship through high radiation activities and is! dark be cause it is thick lead plating.)  It had several compartments underneath and a ""command"" area of some sort.  It had no markings of insignias.  It moved 20-35 MPH and soon disappeared behind some mountains.  We became shocked into a half fear half awe state.  Another ship may have noticed this and came up from behind a ""Prudential"" looking mountain and emitted a blue light beam at us.  It then generated a great wind or force of some sort that coupled with the blue light had a very calming effect on us.  It seemed to energize us and we could feel our ""chi-energy"" accelerate.  We began doing ""tai-chi"" type physical movements while they seemed to communicate with us telepathically.  The images and messages to seemed to be sharing with us we later verified the same experiences.  It then stopped after about perhaps 5-10 minutes.  Then another ship that appeared to be ""scanning"" to the left of us stopped its strobing light beam, elevated and turned towards us very deliberately.  It began moving at us and we proceeded to reenter our car.  It slowly came right over our car.  We rolled down our windows and studied it while it went past.  This description matches the flagship from above.  Definitely octogonal with a series of lights and ducts or compartment passageways evident underneath with a ""command"" center complete with ""boomerang"" shaped forward area.  And again it made absolutely no sound. Somesort of anti-gravity drive to be sure.  Our car was not on and we had no other electronical devices so performance interference was not monitored.  It then went behind us and disappeared behind some mountains in the east.  The other remaining craft all slowly disappeared before sunrise.  We explored the areas that we could access and found no traces of their visit.  Perhaps they were searching for a mineral or have a base nearby.  Maybe they were sightseeing. We KNOW they were NOT any terrestrial technologies responsible for these ships. We returned every weekend after and experienced many more UFO encounters but have ! never th ought to bring a camera and two of us no longer live in the area.

It was about 8PM when I noticed a Bright light flickering in the distance out of my bedroom window to the Northwest.  I called my family into the room to take a look.  We watched it for a few minutes to try to figure out what it might be.  It certainly had no characteristics of an airplane or helicopter.  It remained pretty stationary for the few moments we watched, then I decided to get the video camera.  On the closeups the bright white flickering light became what appeared as a spiraling fireball with it still white in the center with two dots in the center and a bluish green tint around the perimeter.  As I was video taping my son noticed a second light identical to the first to the south of the first. Moments later as I turned my attention to the second light, there was a third to appear, right in the center of the first two.  All appeared to be at different altitudes. But all three lights had the same overall appearance from a distance, and all three lights are exactly the same shape on the closeups, and all have the exact same characteristics. The strangest thing is that the sky was very busy with aircraft flying across the lighted objects from south to north, as the 3 objects were in the west northwest sky.  When the lights disappeared the sky became quiet with not an aircraft in site for over 20 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed to us quite serious minded in his description of the event.  No other reports from Chicago for this date.  We wonder whether he might have been looking at landing lights of distant jets approaching Chicago for landing at O'Hare Airport.  Just a guess.

My wife and I are both college graduatates.  We were camping on the Steens Mountains for sight seeing and picture taking.  We drove to the top of the fault block mountain at approximately 9500' and sat on rocks to take a video and picture of the rising full moon. We were sitting on rocks on the edge of a virtual cliff with the Alvord Desert and remote roadless desert 3000' below looking east. Video and pictures of the large rising moon were taken.  My wife noticed lights on or near the ground while I was doing this. They were approxiamately 10 miles east of us and a little north of the moon rise.  At first glance they looked like headlights from a cars on a highway.  We had been at this vantage point several times before in years past and there were never any lights.  Also, the area in that direction is only accessable by 4 wheel drive and very rugged with isolated cliffs, valley's and sagebrush. We began to focus the camera, video camera and binoculars on these lights.  My wife watched mostly through the binoculars while I took about a 10 minute video.  Also, a 10 minute exposure by camera with a 200mm telephoto lense. The observations lasted about 2 hours until we became cold and went back to camp a few miles away. The cluster of lights to the right had a red strobe light in the center.  They were the size of peas held at arms length and amber. My wife referred to them as a ""string of lights"" as there were about 10+ lights on either side of the red light, moving slowly from left to right. Somtimes they appeared to not move at all. The lights, except the red one, would disappear at once, then reappear seconds to minutes later. As they moved very slowly left to right more would suddenly appear just to the left of the red light and the process repeated. Just a little north of this activity (several hundred yards? a mile?) were more lights, 1-8 at a time moving around doing various manovers. They were on or slightly above ground, never going obove the horizon. Sometimes they created triangles with just 3 lights other times triangles with 2 lights in each corner. One time, with about 10 lights visible, all went dark for about a minute, then suddenly three brighter lights were seen one on top of the other with a definate space in between each light.  This lasted several minutes before they disappeared and other lights reappeared. Wish I had more video but ran out of film after 10 minutes.  Amber, red and green lights show on the photo.  We never saw green lights when we were there. The lights are in streaks because of the 10 minute photo duration. There was just so much activity in ""a middle of no where"" place.",2001-01-03T00:00:00,,

While driving home from shopping, I saw an bright glowing white object.

I'd estimate it was approximatly 60 ft in length and about 15 ft diameter and it was cylinderical/cigar shaped. It was not moving very fast, approximately 100 to 200 mph and it was completely silent. It was heading in my general direction from the  south west. As it got closer I noticed a slight trail of smoke behind it but heard no engine sounds and observed no flames or anything else to accound for the smoke trail. The smoke trail made me think that someone might be playing a prank and sent up a small rocket with a light tube inside it. However, I observed no wings and it moved horizontally at a constant velocity and was not falling or descending as a rocket normally would without any propulsion. So I dismissed the ""prank-rocket"" and was left not knowing what it was. There were no marker lights, windows or any other lights aircraft normally have.   While driving south, I watched it through my windshield for about 1/2 minute as it got closer. Then I turned off highway 29 at the Dry Creek Exit to better observe it and to make sure I don't pass it. I watched it for a few more seconds and then I realized that I better park the car safely off the road to avoid someone rear ending my car. I took my eyes off it for just a few seconds to park off the road and get out of the car and when I looked up again it was gone.

First, I’ll start with the  sighting 13 years ago, in November of 1987.  While driving through the Blue Ridge Mts. Of West Virginia, as a truck driver, I was carrying a load of glassware that was picked up in Springfield, Ohio and going to Roanoke, Virginia.  That night I noticed the moon shining brightly to the right side of me.  It had just stopped raining and the sky was clear.  At exactly 8:45 p.m. I saw this bright light coming closer and closer. Thinking it was a head light on a plane or helicopter, I didn’t think much of it, but as it got closer, I started seeing the shape of it.  I began to slow down to about 45 mph (I was previously going the speed limit ), and that’s when it cleared the trees.  It was going 3 or 4 feet over the trees, just barely enough to clear the tops.  The craft was a saucer shape with a little round dome on the top and flat on the bottom. It had no windows, exhaust, rivets, or bolts—just smooth all over and one headlight shining in a downward angle. I let the windows down and couldn’t hear anything, it didn’t make a sound.  I t just fluttered the tops of the trees as it passed. 	Again, recently, on November 13th, 2000 around the same time, I was visiting my parents in North Louisiana, 40 miles southeast of Shreveport, La. The moon was shining just as bright as in the year of ’87.  I was driving in my mother’s car, visiting friends, when I came around a curve, passing the home of a childhood friend and saw these lights in a diamond-shape. It was hovering 25 or 30 feet in the air.  At first glance I mistook it for a new light tower, because it had been a while since I had been in the country. Then I saw it in it’s entirety over a cow pasture right near the highway about 20 to 30 yards away.  As soon as I saw it I pulled over and cut my headlights off.  I let the window down to see if I could hear any sounds it was making.  What I heard was a soft blowing sound, like if to blow into a microphone softly.  The craft was about the size of a city bus—at least 40 or 50 feet long.  It had a white light, at what I suppose, was the head of craft., also shining in a 240 degree downward angle, similar to the one I had saw 13 years earlier.  But this craft had 8 lights on it. At the three adjacent corners of the diamond shape, were red lights, and on the sides between them were four white lights.  It seemed as soon as I had pulled over and turned my headlights out, did it began to lift up, leaning to the left, then to the right, and then pulled away slowly. I saw it 3 more times over other wide spaces but could never see how the top of it was formed—just the diamond-shaped bottom of the craft. 	This must’ve been a active night for crafts, because by the time I had made it back to my parents’ home, about 11:15 that night, I saw a second craft.  I was standing outside of my father’s carport, just looking at the sky, still amazed by what I had just seen.  I then saw another craft flying at a much higher elevation than the first ones I had seen.  There were no lights on it and it was also flying at a faster speed. It was about as high in the air as an airplane. It seemed to have a triangular shape with a double-circle on the bottom-side of each point like possible exhausts.  It was flying northward. 	The most amazing thing to me about these stories is that these were three encounters I had had.   I often wonder, ""why me"", because there are very  few people who claim to see such sightings.  Whether it is coincidental or just a blessing, but I feel special that I had seen them.  I don’t recall any encounters while growing up in the country.

On the evening of August 8, 2001 at apx. 10:15 pm my girl friend and I were looking at the night sky while camping at the north shore of Saddlebag Lake (elevation: 10,000 feet)-- located apx. 7 miles North of the Tioga Pass entry gate to Yosemite National Park, and apx.15 miles West of the town of Lee Vining, CA. The sky was clear,and moonless. We witnessed a formation of three ""military fighter jets"", displaying normal navagational lights, and flying at apx. 15,000 feet on a due West heading. We clearly heard the familier sound of their engines. Trailing the formation of fighter jets (at apx. the fighter jets 8 o'clock position)was a quite large ""Chevron Shaped Object"". We were able to see shapes quite well, as the OBJECT and the Jets were being backlit by the starlight of the ""Milkey Way"". Using the fighter jets size as reference, we estimated the OBJECT size to be 100 yards from tip-to-tip of its Chevron Shape. The OBJECT had three ""white colored"" lights -- one at the apex, and one at each end(or wingtip)of the ""Chevron Shape"". The OBJECT did not display ANY OTHER navigational lights. The OBJECT matched the jets air speed and seemed to move more like a glider than a powered aircraft. The OBJECT and the jets were observable for apx. 2 minutes. My girl friend and I are very familier with the air traffic in the Tioga Pass area of Yosemite. There is a major East-West commercial air traffic corridor that follows the trace of Tioga Road (HWY 120). The steady stream of air traffic is quite familier and predictable in this area. Military flights are also quite common in this area. The flight path of the OBJECT and the three military jets we observed was south of and parallel to the commercial air corridor that follows Tioga Road. Neither one of us have ever seen an ""aircraft"" the size of the OBJECT we saw.

On the early morning of 03 Aug 2001 at approximately 0345 I had just went to bed when my wife came into the room and said that the strange lights were in the sky again.   (Sightings of strange lights were seen over Boise about 2 weeks earlier and I had seen one of them over Ontario and had mentioned it to my wife).   When I got out of bed and quickly went outside she pointed them out to me.   There were Two very bright lights in the North East sky about 5-10 degrees off horizon.    If you were to hold out your hand, they would be spaced approximately one palm distance apart. They were brighter than any star around them or any type of planet.   They were bright like aircraft Taxi  lights.    I thought that because of the brightness, they might be aircraft however the lights never changed direction as would be expected. I was in the USAF for 6 years as a Avionics Specialist so I've seen hundreds of aircraft coming in for approach.  Within less than a minute or so I ruled them out as being aircraft coming in for a landing.  (There were no Airports in their direction anyway). Object (A) was Left of Object (B) and slightly lower over horizon.   It was dimber and yellow orange in color.  It was still much brighter than the stars. Object (B) was much brighter even than Object (A).  Its color would change from yellow to white.  Its intensity would also change.  I was looking at it though binoculars.  It seemed to pulse at irregular intervals.   This could also be seen with the naked eye. We stood outside and watched them for a half hour.  I took pictures of them with my camera on time elapsed exposure.   As time went by they were were not moving upwards as normal stars would be but they were moving South.   It was slow movement.   I could tell this because I was resting my camera on the roof of my parked car and the objects were creeping slowly  south torward a near bye neighbors tree and eventually into it. The neighbors tree is East of my location.   I called New Channel 7 in Boise and reported the sighting to them at approximately 0400. I also called a man at a nearbye prison who works in a Tower there.   He could also see the lights. My wife stayed up and watched the lights until the sun came up and then stopped observing them.    I went to bed at 0430. The next night on 04 Aug 2001 at 0400 my wife went out to check on the lights again and they weren't there.

READ!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We presume this report comes from a serious-minded witness, but we have no other reports of the event.  PD)) Friday night was cool, rainy, and a little hazy, so myself and three other people were hanging out at one of the their  house in rural Georgia.  Around 12 midnight, the power went out, so we just lit some candles and chilled out.  Around 2:30 am two of the people went out on to the front porch to smoke, while myself and the other person stayed inside.  About 3 am, the power came on then flickered and went out again.  Immediately following this we heard the two on the porch scream:  ""Oh my God!  Ya'll get out here!""  Myself and my companion just ignored them and then a few seconds later we heard:  ""Oh my God! Get out here now!  You have got to see this!!""  So myself and my companion ran out on to the front porch and our friends told us that they had just witnessed to flashes of light that covered the ENTIRE sky.  Myself and my companion didn't know what to make of what our two friends had told us. My companion went into the house while I stayed out on the front porch with the two others.  About 20 minutes later, the electricity came back on, flickered, and went out, then i saw the most amazing and unexplainable thing i have ever seen.  The ENTIRE sky, from as far as we could see to the left to as far as we could see to the right, from the horizon to as far as we could see up, was lit up in the brightest white-ish yellow flash i have ever seen.   I jumped out of my seat and began to scream for my companion in the house.  About this time a second brilliant flash occurred, this one too, encompassing the ENTIRE sky.  However, this flash was a brilliant flourescent dark green and, too, covered everything.  But this flash had a darker, almost black, center in the middle of the sky that didn't have any distinguishing boundaries but just flowed and blended with the dark green glow that was everywhere, but no sound whatsoever followed the flashes.  Now, we were just stunned and screaming for our companion.  She finally came out and we tried to explain what had happened.  So we all waited on the front porch again and about 20 minutes later the same sequence of events happened again.  The power came on, then flickered, went off, then the bright flash followed by the dark green flash.  Now we had all seen it and were stunned and going hysterical.  The bright light was like the kind you see when a nuclear bomb goes off, and the green glow was something never before seen by any of us.  So we all ran out to the highway that is maybe 30 yards in front of the house so we could get a better view. Across the road are hills with a some trees on the tops and backsides of the hills, while fields make up the front sides of the hills that were visible to us.  There is probably 100 to 150 yards worth of visibility to the top of the hills, then it goes to the backside.  When we reached the road we were just waiting to see it again when we noticed something over the hills.  We could see about 4 or 5 beams of light moving around like people walking with flashlights or spotlights on the backside of the hills moing towards the top of the hills.  We knew noone should be over there with lights, especially at 3:45 in the morning.  Then, all of a sudden, we saw a beam of light come out of nowhere from the middle of the field about 50 to 75 yards away, like someone had all of a sudden flipped on a flashlight.  When we saw this, we quickly ran back to the porch.  When we got back to the porch 15 seconds later, we could not see one light anywhere from the fields or anywhere over the hills.  About this time, the power flipped on again, flickered, went out, and then the two flashes came again.  So we ran back out to the road to get a better look and waited.  About 15 minutes later we looked right up the road about 50 yards and noticed a car that was just sitting on the side of the road next to a vacant lot.  Then the pattern repeated itself:  power on, flickering, going out, then the first flash.  When the first flash went off, the car all of a sudden flipped its lights on and began speeding towards us.  We began to get into the road and wave him down.  Initially it appeared he wouldn't stop, but he slammed on his breaks and stopped just as the second dark green flash was going off.   When he stopped, everything was green from the glow, even the inside of this car. We ran up and asked:  ""Are you seeing these lights???!!!   What do think is going on???"" The guy initially looked at us like he didn't know what we were talking about, despite the fact everything was green, but then he answered in an extremely weird, non-chalant kind of way:  ""Oh, that's just the beacon.  Its there so planes won't crash.  Its usually white lights but sometimes it can change to different colors.""  Then he said:  ""The regular paper guy won a contest.  I'm the district manager just filling in for him.  Do you get a paper?""  then he handed us a paper and drove off. We watched him go on, and instead of delivering more papers down the road where there are many more houses, he turned into the next driveway turned around and sped off in the direction which he had just come, without delievering any more papers!  Granted, the flashes alone freaked us out, but the paper guy and the beams of light just added to our confusion.  First of all, there are absolutely NO BEACONS anywhere in that area of rural Carrollton, i am positive of that.  Right as the guy sped off, our power came on and stayed on the rest of the night, with us seeing no more flashes, leaving us with having seen 5 two flash sets in total in 1.5 hours. We spent the rest of the night trying to figure out what happened.  We definitely ruled out swamp gas, beacons, and power transformers blowing.  The only explanations we were left with were other worldly or, more possibly, some type of government test and coverup.  The guys with the beams of light and the convenient paper guy with a cover-up story just as the event ended just added to our belief in gov't involvement.  The next day i was relaying the events to my mother, and she was having a hard time fully believing me.  Then a few minutes later she came in and showed my something she just read in the Saturday paper.  It was an aritcle in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution that read:  ""Solar Storms could disrupt power in U.S. :   Earth is likely to be bombarded with an unusual rapid-fire blast from five solar storms that could disrupt power grids, communications and airplane navigation in the northern United States today and Sunday, space weather forecasters warned Friday.  But they said the same machine-gunlike geomagnetic blasts also could pull spectacular Northern Lights sky show farther south, where more people will be able to see the colored lights dance in the northern sky.  There's an 80 percent chance that the storms will cause minor to severe disruptions to satellite communications, radio and television transmissions, and electric power grids, warned the Space Environment Center in  Washington, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The ""storms"" are stron surges of solar winds - electrically charged subatomic particles from the sun - that make changes in the Earth's magnetic field, much like charging a small magnet with an electrical current.  There's a 40 percent chance the storms will cause major or severe disruptions and a 40 percent chance their efforts will be minor."" I have to say that those that winessed this are not crazy Georgia rednecks, we are all college graduates with well respected jobs who did not make up the event that we can't explain.  However, we do know this article is b.s.  For one, why did this article appear the day AFTER it happened.  If they knew friday it was going to happen, why didn't they tell us on friday so we could be prepared instead of telling us on Saturday.  Secondly,  this article provides an excuse for almost every aspect of our experience.  However, these excuses also seem to be b.s. and a little to convenient.   I've seen the Northern Lights and what we saw definitely in no way shape or form resembled the Norther Lights.  These were blasts of light.  One bright white, one a dark green glow.  We are all still voting for a Gov't coverup...the people in the fields, the guy in the car, and the article from Washington...it just all points to the government covering something up, but what they are covering up is the question. Any, and i mean any, insight into this situation would be greatly appreciated, as no one we have talked with can offer a feasible solution.  I must reiterate that this is IN NO WAY A FALSE REPORT.  This truely and definitely happened on the moring of Saturday November 25, 2000 from 3:00 am till about 4:30 am.  Someone please respond.  I do not want to initially release too much info about myself as i am in a sensitive line of work.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,33.57161942446043,-85.09630359712231

It was just another white dot like all the other dots, only it was moving! It's impossible to say how much area it covered or how far away it was, but I'd say that it seemed to be travelling in an area about that appeared to be about four inches by, maybe, 6 inches of the sky, from my perspective.  I guess this would mean that it was happening quite far away.  It moved very ""slowly"" in an up and down meandering sort of way as it weaved a path between the fixed stars.

This area was a commercial area of the town. High traffic area. The sky was absolutely clear and not a cloud to be seen. I noticed a flash approximately 150 to 200 feet in altitude. My first thought was that this was simply a plane and I glanced up. I saw two saucer shaped objects. They were about 50 feet apart from each other. The objects were silver colored on the top half and black on the bottom. The saucers had no lights, no windows, emmited no sounds, and were seamless. As I watched for a few minutes, the objects were hovering and moving in unison. It was as if they were acting as one, maneuvering in exactly the same way. I estimate the diameter of each object to be perhaps 50 feet or so. As I watched I was under the impression that I was also being observed. It was lunch time and this being a high traffic area, I was amazed that no vehicles were seeing this event, so I tried to stop traffic as I pointed up to the two saucers. during this time the objects were ascending and descending slowly as they moved from side to side, circling. They had a slight wobble and were not spinning. I decided to try desparate measures to get someone else to see this, so I was about to step out into the oncoming traffic, and at that moment I watched the objects take to space at a tremendous speed.

It was around 10:00 in the evening.  The object was basically triangular in shape though it was pointed something resempling an arrow.  The underside had three very bright white lights equally spaced in the corners.  In the center was a flashing red light (smaller). The right side had what appeared to be illuminated rectangular windows. there were two rows of either three or four on the horizontal. The rear of the object had three more very bright white lights in a linear line-up. THey were so intense that they gave off a prizmic effect.  They also sort of pulsed which also gave a random moving effect.  They seemed to be located behind some kind of a grid. Two other aspects were that it was very large, though my perspective was difficult having nothing to measure it against. It just appeared large.  It was also very quite and gave off a magnetc sound.  A humming as it were. We were all very surprised and had no idea as to what it could have been.  A flying wing perhaps? This was back in 1978.  One other point I wish to make, I consider all of us to be of sound mind.

This was something they did for the kids who stayed two weeks in order for the new kids to check in and old ones out. It was an optional trip. After dinner and campfire, we went to the tents. I was restless for some reason. We were all in two-man tents. I'm not sure if it was just a dream, but I remember noticing a very bright light outside the tent. I tried with all my might to wake up my sleeping companion. His eyes sprang open ,but they were motionless. I mean they stared straight out, as in death. I then heard the zipper of my tent open. I had thought at first it was one of the campers with us, but it waved at me and I felt motionless. I felt no fear. I remember that it must have been approx. 3.5-4 feet tall and a very almond colored skin. It had two large bug like-eyes and no trace of nose. I could detect an indention were it's mouth should have been. I heard something in my head. Not a voice, but more like an emotion. As if by autopilot, I was motioned outside the tent by hand. I was surrounded by white light. I felt a pinch in my arm. And I faintly remember an emotion I was unfamilar with at the time. As though I was geneticly diferent somehow than everyone else and needed special watch.The rest I remember is being carried and set down where I was sleep (my tent).The next morning I only remembered being set down.

I was a passenger in the back seat of a 1985 Dodge caravan (prety big windows).  We were southbound on an interstate highway entering the outskirts of Tulsa.  I do not recall the exact date or time, but I know it was mid summer of the year I turned 15 (in april).  There was some kind of municipal airport we were approaching through the valley (into it?).  That day there were an unusually high number of private aircraft flying that day (most of them were ""unpowered"" ""light"" and ""ultralight""private aircraft).  I remember watching the gliders soar in thermal updrafts for a long time as we got closer(20 min. at least).  There was one ""glider"" in particular caught my eye.  Not because it was vissually extra ordinary, but because it appeared to have no angualr momentum.  I observed the craft for about 4 min. marveling at the skill of that pilot to keep riding the same current for such a long time.  ""Those arent glider wings!""  Suddenly the craft I had just been watching for a realllllllly long time looked like a silver disk.  It was late afternoon, because the sunlight reflected brightly in a radial patern from each side of the center of the disk.  From a great distance these reflections looked like a long wingspan ""white"" glider (the kind that get towed up by powered aircraft).  The moment I realized what i saw, I told my Dad to try to pull over.  we could not because by this time the landscape had become decidedly urban (I had not been watching the road for quite a long trip).  I watched it for as long as I could wishing the video camera was ""assembled"" (2 piece camera/vcr system) so that i cluld be taping this un-beleivable event.  My view was obstructed finally by an overpassing highway onramp.  When the obstruction cleared, the craft was gone.  I remember there being a refinery or some other heavy industry site that appeared to be the same distance from me as the craft, but on a Southerly vector. The craft: Silver disk with a bulge in the middle. it was about a hands width at arms length North of the refinery. The altitude is hard to guess, but it was about as high as 2.5 the height of the refinery. It was tilted on axis both toward me and 45 degrees to the side. (i could see the entire top except the part obscured by the ""dome"" in the middle. It appeared to be hovering...or moving verrrrry slow. No sound apperent (caravans windows do not roll down in the back though), ((NUFORC Note:  We feel compelled to comment that it is not unusual for a glider to remain virtually motionless in the sky, particularly if it is flying in ridge lift or an atmospheric wave.  Glider pilots dream of such situations.  However, we have no explanation for why the object would change its appearance.

It had a few lights beneath it around the outer rim area that didn't seem to be on the whole time we were watching it, suspended in the sky just behind our home.  I pointed to it and the children and I continued to observe it for another minute or so. Suddenly we heard the noise of helicopters coming from behinds us; two (possibly three) appeared on the scene and seemed to be after the UFO (chasing, investigating it or supervising it) when it began a rapid zigzag movement away from us and the helicopters (at many times the speed of any jet)and before the UFO was out of site, it just dissappeared. This was not a sighting of something that looked like a strange object, from where we stood, it was in plain sight and in broad day light. Our house bordered near two highways and I was sure many would have seen it too but when I called the police department and asked if they had received any calls of any strange sightings, they said no and I didn't report it.  The children never spoke of it again and I too forgot about it. Maybe the word isn't ""forgot"" but ""brainwashed"" because when it came to mind, I couldn't believe why I had not shared it with my husband or closest friends emediately. When I approached the kids to talk about it after months had gone by, they didn't feel comfortable talking about it.  Today, after about 10 years, they still remember it clearly but didn't want to be reminded...""so strange"".  I almost feel there was a ""force"" silencing us... or maybe it's just a ""normal"" fear that overtakes us because of such an extraordinary/paranormal event.

Upon arriving home and stepping out of our car, we continued to watch the object as it hovered well off in the distance, quite possibly over New York City.  Again, the distance was hard to estimate.  When we looked back towards the west, we were startled to see that 3-4 other similar ""strings of lights"" were hovering almost directly over our position but far up in the atmosphere.  We went inside to further observe the original craft, which still hovered in the east.  Its lights seemed to pulsate/strobe in intensity and change colors (red, blue, green, white).

I saw nothing remaining after they faded out, and I never heard any sounds. I noticed that a car had stopped down the street.  After the lights faded out, the car drove over to the three of us and stopped. There was a couple in the car who had been watching the lights as well. They said they had seen them from the nearby freeway, and had pulled off to watch. They said they had watched for about 5 minutes total, and that there were three lights initially. Apparently this third light had started out stationary and then slowly moved to the right, away from the other two lights and disappeared before I had come outside. We all agreed that they were much more orange than the red broadcast tower lights visible to the east, and too orange to have been red airplane lights. The couple speculated that the flickering orange color looked like fire and may have been candles tied to balloons, except that all three were moving in different directions, which seemed strange. There's a very slight, variable breeze outside at ground level, and the clouds aren't moving noticeably w.r.t stationary objects. The weather is cloudy--no stars visible--and the lights were below the clouds. When they disappeared I couldn't tell if it was because they entered the clouds or because they faded out. There's a lake about a quarter mile to the south. I didn't think to ask the couple how far away they thought the lights might have been. Maybe it was just a prank, but I figured I'd report it in case anyone else saw anything unusual. I would guess that others probably saw it too since it was visible from the freeway.

Growing up I was an Air Force dependent and spent three years in the US Army 1966-69 serving a year combat tour in Vietnam. On the morning of Sunday, March 11, 2001, my wife and I took four of our dogs to Sarasota, Florida, approximately 10 miles south of where we live, to walk them at a place called Robarts Arena.  This is an area covering several acres and is where county fairs, rodeos, etc., are held.  I was walking about 50 yards in front of my wife when I simply heard the noise of a small single engine plane overhead and looked up to observe it.  When I first located the plane another object caught my eye.  This object was light gray and circular.  Seagulls are common here and I thought perhaps that it what I was looking at but it did not waver or move erratic as they do.  It was obvious this object was moving in a direct line westward.  I then noticed another object of the same description in what appeared to be about a quarter mile apart traveling same direction and speed as the first.  Other than the small plane's engine, there were no other sounds of aircraft.  There is an airport located in Sarasota and a McDill Air Force base located 50 miles north in Tampa.  However, my years around all types of aircraft left me with the certainty that these two objects were not normal aircraft.  When I turned to my wife and pointed to what I had seen, the objects were no longer in view.  After several hours of thought, I felt it should be reported to this organization.  There were no distinctive markings, lights, or other features; just to very light gray circular objects. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be a quite credible witness.  His description of what he and his wife reportedly had seen was quite precise, and described in unambiguous, objective terms.  We deem this to be a quite good report.

On the morning of 3/12/01, at about 7:45 a.m., my Daughter and I saw a white, cigar-shaped object moving slowly, and at low altitude, from the southwest toward the northeast and then it turned slightly north, toward Mt. Diablo.  At times, it seemed to stay in one position, as if to observe something below, then moved forward, again.  The day was a bright, clear, cloudless morning.  The object was moving through the air at a lower altitude than I have seen many single engine planes fly.  It made no noise whatsoever.  It had no wings, no visible cockpit, no rudder, wheels, propeler, no cables or anything on or protruding from it.  I am only certain of what it was NOT: it was not a plane, not a helicopter, not a blimp, not a balloon, not a glider, or any ordinary object I have ever seen in the sky.  It appeared to move intentionally.  I did not have the benefit of binoculars, but with the naked eye, it appeared that it may have had narrow band of dark-colored metal very slightly bisecting the middle of the object, which gave the hint of an indentation or slightly ""segmented"" body, but I cannot be sure because it was further away from me, at that point.  Mostly, it appeared to be made of a smooth, cigar-shaped, bright white, non-reflecting material, i.e., not a ""shiny"" metal.  Because it had no visible means of propulsion, I was amazed at how slowly it was moving.  It's length was about the width of my thumbnail, held at arm's length.  The object was still in sight, when it was followed by a single engine plane that flew overhead, in the same direction (toward the northeast), but the plane was flying at a lower altitude.  So, for a brief period, perhaps 30 seconds,I had both the plane and the silent, cigar-shaped object in view, before they both passed behind the buildings and trees, and out of my line of sight.  The strange object was moving much slower than the single engine plane behind and below it.  It would seem to me that any observer in the small plane would have had a clear, much closer view of th! e cigar- shaped object.

I would like to add that i've got valuable knowledge when it comes to aircrafts and i am involved in astronomy as an amateur for asteroids detection. I remember that clear morning on the beach around 20th street, my friends and I  were swimming in the warm water of the Atlantic ocean. It must have been 7:00 (sun was already up) when I noticed 2 objets south of us and parallel to the beach. They were flying in  military formation so I told my friend that this could be 2 helicopters flying towards us from south to north. About 5 minutes later I looked again and told my friend that they wey flying super slow at a low altitude( less than 3.000 feet compared to the hotels) And that's when I noticed that they weren't helicopters but grey and ovale objects. That's when I started to get excited and looked at my watch, it was 7:05 am. A few moments later I told my other friends who were in the Ocean but they said it was some birds and kept on playing in the water. My friend and I kept on sterring at the objets as they were getting closer. Let's say it took them almost 10 minutes to go from the southern tip of South Beach to approximatively 10th street. At the closest point we saw them they were still at the same altitude and we could almost see a pulse or a vibration from left to right and back and up. (Please excuse my English) We saw no strobe lights or id number. At that point my eyes started to be tired from sterring and I had to look somewhere else for a few seconds. Then 7:10, both objets caught up altitude  heading east toward the horizon and stopped in mid-air (I couldn't say how high) I was pretty hard to see them but I used a boat that was right below to find them when my eyes would loose them. That's when one of my friends said that he could see a third one at a higher altitude coming from the south. This third object stopped as well but at a higher altitude. They kept steady for 5 minutes. Then at 7:15, they disappeared in one snap, leaving no sound, no trail. Since that day, I think about it everyday (almost) and I know i wasn't the only one to see it.

I was so shocked because I observed I was about to witness a mid-air collision.  This very very shiny object, (like shine coming from a high gloss metal like chrome) went: (AS THE JET WAS TRAVELING EAST) 1. North 2.

My friend thought it was venus, but it seemed so large and bright, and it seemed to be lower than most stars and the only star in the direction!  I thought it was the north star but realized we were facing east.  As we were about to dismiss the object as a star or planet, it suddenly darted left (straight north)  for about 3 seconds but seemed to cover a lot of ground in that short time.  We lost sight of it but then turned left as it was the road towards home anyways.  We passed some pines that blocked our view but then came to an open field and saw the bright object again.  It was hovering but then moved upwards quickly and the light totally went out, then came back on again about 10 seconds later.  The odd thing was it was a clear sky, every star was visible, so i figured it couldnt be a plane going through clouds, and the light seemed to large to just be a plane.  We watched the object for another 10 miles, and decided to go just go home cause it was now higher in the sky.   However when i got on my road i could still see the strange object, i tried to video tape it casue i had my camera in the car but the battery died about 3 seconds into taping it,  so we went in my home got my dad and drove back west down my road.  we stopped the vehicle got out and stared north northeast where the object was.  It now was a brilliant blue and red, the lights would flicker much like that of a plane, but it hovered in the same spot for 30 more minutes!!!  Plus i spotted a plane in the south western sky moving east, and it became clear the object was definately no plane.  The strangest thing about it was that it also had 3 white lights, which if connected would make a triangle.  but the triangle seemed to appear, then go away then come back once every 20 seconds or so..  we  watched it  until 11:15 and then decided to return home.  This is the! strange st thing ive ever seen and i hope to see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite credible and convincing.

I had to look back to the road and when I looked again it was gone.  The glow of the clouds had also dissapeared. My friend did not see it but I asked him if the moon should be where I saw it and he said no.  Also, the next day I found out it was a New Moon, so that was probably not what it was.

As is approached the sound increased in intensity but was then also accompanied by a jet engine sound. Not a jet engine in flight, but a jet engine idling. As the first approached we noticed a second craft in the distance coming from the same direction.  The first craft passed almost directly overhead and was probably less then 500 feet off the ground and flying slower then 100 mph, probably slower! Slower then any aircraft i've ever seen.  I've lived near an airport all my life so i know what planes and helicopters look like.  This didn't fit either description.  I saw 4 or 5 whitesh yellowish lights. Some of the lights appeared to be spinning to me,  but my friend could not recall them spinning.  The lights looked like standard aircraft lights, but the position of these lights on the craft looked strange. I could not make out the shape of the craft.  Though the most noticable thing about it was the strange noise it was making and it seemed to float across the sky rather then fly. After the first craft flew overhead, a second followed about 30 to 45 seconds behind. On this craft we could only see 1 light of the same white yellowish color.  It too was flying very slow and directly overhead in the same direction.  Though i don't think it was making the same strange hum the first object was.  It sounded like a jet but was flying way too slow.  And it did not sound like a helicopter. No strange electric or magnetic effects were objerved.  My guess is its probably ours, a craft which still uses conventional jet engines while also having some anti-gravitic technology integrated in.

On Tuesday, April 24th, I was walking north to my truck.  Out to the west I saw what appeared to be a large bird which I assumed at first to be a soaring eagle.  I watched it glide for a few seconds before deciding it must be a guy hang gliding.  It was below the skyline of the mountains.  It was to the west of our home.  What I assumed to be a hang glider because of its shape and proximity to the mountains was earth-toned, brown, beige and white.  However, these colors seem inadequate in describing the colors I saw at first.  As I continued to watch what then appeared to be a hang glider swoop side to side dipping and circling it then began to spin and rise flopping end over end. Then, trying to make sense of what I was seeing, thought it was a large piece of debri being blown around by the wind because its movement was so irratic.  I watched as it rose higher and became smaller,about the size of a large star. It then stopped for maybe 2 seconds.  Then it traveled at a high rate of speed to the west, it stopped and traveled at a high rate of speed to the east.  Its shape had changed to round and white or silver.  I then saw 3 more what now appeared to be orb like spheres or balls the size of large stars darting back and forth in incredible directions and formation.  These objects where perfectly round and appeared to be silver metallic as they reflected or shimmered a little light.  I watched these 4 continue to interact until they were the size of pin heads and then no longer visible.  It was a perfectly calm day with beautiful blue clear skies and no wind.  I was left very excited, awed and wowed.  The total time elapsed from when I first  noticed this object was approzimately 2 minuted maybe longer.  The size of the object was aproximately 1/3 to 1/4 the size of a full moon and became smaller the higher it rose.

It had a long slender body that appeared to attach to the large set of triangle shaped wings that made up the back end of the aircraft. These wings which actually looked like one big assembley were cut off straight on the outermost angle and were straight across the back end. I could see that they were thick at the back end .They appeared to me to be at least 2to3 feet thick with what looked like two engines in the very center of the rear of the wing assembley. These engines were not mounted on the wing assembly but a part of it. I never saw an intake. The short stubby wings were a short distance from the front end of the fuselage. This was a long very large aircraft. It looked almost like a flying wing with a fuselage stuck on it and a short set of wings on the other end of said fuselage. the plane was a silver color with the large wings appearing to be a darker color of silver. The engines made a whining noise not your common jet noise. They sounded like a small plane in a dive as heard from the ground. I thought that it was going to start to rain any minute, the clouds were black and hanging low.I expected to hear thunder at any moment. This plane came crusing over below the cloud cover and I saw it good for at least one minute,then the trees broke my line of sight. I tried to look this up on the web but the closet thing I could find was an artists rendering of the so called Brilliant Buzzard which wings and engines do not match what I observed.

After passing overhead, three of the craft broke off and changed heading to approx. 070. The other three maintained course for approx. 1-2 seconds, then joined up on the first three. Perfect separation was maintained at all times. No sound was heard. The craft dissappeared several seconds later, still headed approx. 070. At first I thought they were birds, then jets, since I used to fly jets in the service (A-4's). What got me was the sudden brake off movement of the first three, with no roll movement observed when they changed course. They seemed to simply ""translate"" over, for want of a better word. Also the speed seemed very high, and the separation was too perfect. I have seen many flight demonstration teams, but nothing like that.

I do live in a city which has a lot of Military and flying aircraft which practice out of Oceana Naval Air Station which is is the general direction that this ""object"" was heading, but I see and hear these jets all the time as anyone who lives near me will say too. This was not a fighter jet! Nor was it a helicopter. Before I witnessed this ""object"", I could hear plain as day other aircraft in the far distances which were miles away! This thing was within ""rifle range"" of me and wasn't making a sound. Every aircraft that I have ever seen in my lifetime has had at least one blinking (beacon) light on it, and/or at least one white light. What kind of ""craft"" flies around with 4 solid red lights on it, and no beacon light?! Lastly, and most certainly, I mentioned that this ""object"" was roughly travelling over the interstate highway...well the vehicles which were occasionally travelling in the same direction as this thing (east/southeast) were moving much faster in the same general direction than the ""object""! So my guess is that it was probably moving at about 30-50 mph.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,36.837301342710994,-76.06194814578005

A woman who sounded like she was in her late 30's-early 40's called in to ask if anyone else had reported an unusual light in the west. The station's talk show host disregarded the caller, but I ran outside and looked to the west. It was a very clear night sky. Low on the western horizon was a very bright light that was magnitude 1 in brightness compared to the rest of the night sky. It was very slowly drifting to the north-northwest. After getting a winter jacket, I ran from my backyard to a better vantage point. I positioned myself on the Capital Blvd. bridge over I-5 and sighted the object in the west. It was just sitting low on the horizon and after a few minutes, it would drift north and then stop again. The bright light was white in nature with an impression of red, but at my distance it was difficult to tell. I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft taking off from the Olympia airport to the south and I noticed that several planes had taken off, but changed their flight patterns from the normal pattern that would have taken them within close proximity of the object in the west. The planes were all banking sharply to the northeast. After about 10 minutes, the object had drifted behind some evergreens in the foreground. I decided to run back home for a pair of binoculars. Upon reaturning the object was no longer in view from the bridge. I changed position but still didn't see the object again. I did notice that several more aircraft had taken off and still they veered to the east. I thinking that since I heard of this object on the radio I'm not the only person who witnessed this light.

At 6:20 pm on February 13, 2001, I viewed an unusual light in the SW sky as I was looking at Venus in it's early evening brightness. My sighting was made in the parking lot of my apartment building on a very clear early night sky. Traveling in a more or less straight line from west to east were two lights in close proximity, one red, one white. They were blinking on and off in rapid stroboscopic fashion. As they moved at a fairly fast rate of speed (faster than a jetliner trailing contrails) the lights moved in unison in rapid jinking or zig zag movements along the straight flight path axis. The very swift directional zig zags veered of the flight path axis about 20 degrees above and below the flight path. Directional movement angles were extremely high, approximately 60 to 90 degrees every one or two seconds. I watched these lights move along the fairly straight flight path for approximately 30 seconds until they disappeared behind the roofline of my apartment building. What caught my eye away from the bright light of Venus was the rapid and severe directional zig zags of the lights as they moved forward. Their changes in direction were instantaneous. I've never seen a light or discernible object in the sky make such quick movements. There was no shape or object visible in the darkening sky, only the white and red lights moving as a unit. I am a writer and illustrator who specializes in aviation and space technology and history. I've had 6 books published on the history and technology of aircraft and 8 books on space exploration technology/history and astronomy. I am very knowledgeable about the flight capabilities of existing (officially acknowledged)aircraft and spacecraft. No current aircraft or spacecraft is capable of the very quick directional movements that I observed. I don't know what the lights were, but they were not the lights of any known vehicle.

I am a sane, sober 51-year old professional who has always been skeptical of UFO sightings.  However, last night I saw something which I cannot explain.   As I was walking my dog at 2:55 a.m. (this is not my custom, but I had fallen asleep on the sofa earlier), I looked up to the sky to see if I might get lucky and see a straggling meteor from the Leonid showers of November 18th.  The night was clear and calm, without a cloud in the sky.  A beautiful, starry autumn night in Florida.   Suddenly, I noticed a glowing pale orange ""shape"" rapidly moving across the sky from west to east, very faint so as to be barely discernable.  I couldn't see an actual body per se (such as an aircraft), just the unbroken shape of orange light which seemed almost translucent, as if I could still see the stars through the shape.   The shape was somewhat like a boomerang or chevron, except the leading edge was straight across (as opposed to ""V"" shaped on this front edge).  It was perfectly symmetrical across its width.  I have difficulty determining the true size or speed, because I couldn't judge the altitude.  However, I observed it across a radius of approximately 100-120 degrees and it covered this distance in approximately 5-7 seconds.  This seemed to be an unbelievable rate of speed.   The object made no sound at all, moving with absolute silence which defied my mind's ability to comprehend.  The moon was not visible but if it were, I would judge the width of the object to be about 5 or 6 times a full moon's diameter.  The length of the object from front to rear was perhaps 1X a full moon's diameter.   It bothers me that I will probably never know any answers to this event.  I only know what I saw and am 100% convinced that the object was not a natural phenomenon such as a meteor or a cloud.

Video in U-matic, VHS can be provided.  Unfortunately there is no info regarding the inclination of different video sources to extrapolate distance.  Though this can easily be calculated based on wide angle shots that cover the horizon and local mountains.",2001-04-01T00:00:00,,

Two dull lights moving in tandom across the sky. The trailing light moved closer to the leading one at one point.,Valencia,CA,2001-03-26T20:10:00,light,1 minute,"Occurred : 3/26/2001 20:10  (Entered as : 03/26/01 20:10) Reported: 3/30/2001 16:23 Posted: 4/1/2001 Location: Valencia, CA Shape: Light Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17056.html,Two dull lights moving in tandom across the sky. The trailing light moved closer to the leading one at one point. There were two lights flying in unison that were star like but duller than a star. They seemed to be at a very high altitude. They were traveling in a northwest to southeast direction. I thought it was one object with two lights until the trailing one moved closer as if catching up to the other. There was no sound associated with them. They crossed the sky in less than one minute. They were not aircraft as they had no strobe lights or colored lights. I first thought that perhaps it was a satillite until the trailing one moved closer to the leading one. I have always beleived that there are too many sightings for UFO's not to exist. I have never seen anything like this before. Usually I can explain what I saw. Usually it turns out to be an aircraft or what I would assume is a satillite. This time however when the second one moved closer to the first and the dullness of the light I cannot explain what I saw other than it was a UFO.,2001-04-01T00:00:00,34.42961198156682,-118.57039631336404
