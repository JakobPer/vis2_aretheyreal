The light was bright white and appeared to be 2 lights on the same craft. The upper light was almost the full length of the craft, the lower light was square and connected by something black or dark, about the same size. I only saw lights and the dark connecting piece. It was so bright I believe it would be visible in daylight. The lights moved completely in tandem. They were each the same color and brightness as Venus. Both lights had a twinkle effect like stars.  The object was about 1/2” tall at arm’s length, a narrow vertical rectangular light moving erratically within about a 1” x 1” area: north, south, east and west, gradually moving to the West. If the object was 1/2” tall overall, it would be about 3/32” wide. The bottom light would be about 3/32” square. The black area between the 2 lit areas was also about 3/32” square.  I moved around making sure of what I was seeing. It was not a reflection on the glass or on the clouds. I heard no sound, my cat did not react, I didn’t open the window. The object gradually, still erratically, moved west behind a tree in my backyard. At arm’s length it moved about 1” to the West before it was no longer visible. This took about 1-1/2 minutes.

The two white lights appeared in loose formation coming from the northwest over Richmond, Virginia. When the two white lights were equidistant between Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia, they turned south coming directly towards us at the 12 o'clock position. Again, they were way, way out in the distance and moving fast. Shortly thereafter, the two lights then turned left towards the northeast. The lights faded from view as their turn commenced. They disappeared from our view and nothing else was seen. Duration of our sighting was probably 2-3 minutes.  The two lights did not exhibit navigation lights, strobes or rotating beacons like a normal aircraft. As it was 00:35 hours on a Sunday night/Monday morning, we surmised the lights were probably not part of a military mission or in-flight refueling. Additionally, as the lights would have been above 39,000 which is extremely high, in-flight refueling would not have been a normal occurrence at that high of a flight level.  We asked the air traffic controller if he had the two targets on his radar. He said no and we explained to him what we saw.

I immediately noticed 2 bright stationary star-like white lights (brighter than any other star or planet then visible) at about 10 degrees west of straight up or at an altitude angle of 80 degrees from the Western horizon. The lights were aligned in North and South direction and were spaced about 4 to 6 diameters of the moon (2 to 3 degrees) apart. The moon was quarter crescent.  They then faded out beyond visibility within about 15 seconds at the same time as if there were coordinated.  I thought I should report this because it is the second time I have noticed this same type of event.  About a year ago in the Spring I saw the same thing happen with a pair of star-like white lights in the evening about 8:30 PM at an altitude angle of about 45 degrees above the North horizon. Those lights were spaced about the same and were aligned East West.  Maybe these were both satellites but they must have been in high orbit because they did not move perceptively.  I have found references to Iridium Satellite flares being seen in pairs but they were moving fast enough to leave a streak in the photo taken of them.  http://www.astropix.com/images2/beginner/iridium_flares.jpg  I have seen many satellites in low Earth and they move quite quickly.

This is not A UFO sighting. This is an abduction/ physical encounter. On the night of August 1st/ early morning of August 2nd I believe I was visited by extraterrestrial being(s) in my apartment bedroom. I have experienced sleep paralysis numerous times in my life and this was far from it. I slept with my lamp on. I awoke to looking at my lamp in my bedroom which was closest to my bedroom door. I was unable to move and I was able to see white medical tubes all over my body similar to an IV. There were atleast 2 people or entities walking around the left of me out of my view. I felt as if someone took a needle and put it in my arm and gave me something that paralyzed me. But I was awake to the point where I could see and hear my entire bedroom. It also felt as if something was draining blood/ energy from my body and dehydrating me. I moaned and moaned and was unable to turn my head but I was focused on my lamp and I could see and hear people moving in my bedr! oom closest to the wall where I could not turn my head. It was if I was raised or proped up off of the bed because I was able to hear and see my phone ringing. It was my ex girlfriend calling. I started to cry because I felt I was going to be killed or drained completely of blood or whatever was happening to me and that I would not be able to make a phone call or call out for help. I was able to make eye contact with my phone and see that she was calling, it was 4am which is the time that she wakes up and goes to work. I was able to slightly turn my head towards what was moving in my room but not enough but I could still hear my phone ringing and vibrating. I could still see white IV like tubes all over my body and it was painful. I could not stop moaning from the pain but did not have enough strength to scream. I would blink ever so often as it felt like something was physically sucking liquid out of my body through these tubes and I felt the weakest I have ever felt in my! life. I could hear an air sucking noise similar to a tire def! lated in my ear which would last for 3 or 4 seconds at a time. I had decided to try and struggle as much as I could, I felt that I was going to die if I did not get to my phone or call out for help. I was awake as I am now but was physically unable to move and I could feel see and hear everything around me. This lasted close to 15 minutes.I remember not being able to stop moaning from how much pain and dehydration I was feeling. I could still feel rustling and walking all around my bedroom which scared me the most because I could not do anything about it but all I could see was dark shadows on the wall from someone moving in my bedroom but my eyes were still able to see the lamp. I took a deep breath and blinked and all of the tubes were off of my body. I was able to move. I sat up and grabbed my phone and saw that my ex gf called and I decided not to call her back till the morning. I was exhausted my body was dehydrated as if I did not drink water for a week. It hurt. My arm had 2 ! small scab/prick marks as if I was poked with a 2 pronged small needle. I was not nervous or scared anymore. It did not process to me what happened until the next morning when I called my ex gf back and talked about it. I have never experienced anything like this, I do not want an explanation. I just wanted to share an experience which happened to me and I truly believe that I was visited in my apartment bedroom in Greensboro NC. I did not witness any bright lights or see a UFO.

The sphere was red and orange in color. Although, the object was a sphere in shape, it did not hold a solid outline, almost as if it was a fireball radiating.

I spotted what I thought was one and excitedly pointing it out to them. It was single white light like a typical satellite and was moving straight above our heads from the N/W to a S/E direction. My girlfriend spotted it but I had to help my neighbor spot it. It took him about 5 seconds to locate it.  A few seconds later my girlfriend and my neighbor turned away and that’s when a few seconds later I saw the light take an instant U turn. I screamed out “It did a U turn”. They both look up and acknowledge that it was going in the opposite direction. As all three of us watched the UFO going in the opposite direction and In a matter of seconds it stopped moving and stayed in one position above us. I yelled out”It stoppe! d”. They agreed with me that it had stopped.  They watched it for a short time and then turned away but I kept my eyes on it. After 10 minutes my neck started to hurt from looking up for that length of time. The light never moved and I kept on telling them that they don’t realize what we were witnessing but they didn’t seem as enthusiastic as I was about we had just witness.  We went home and it had never moved as I entered my house as I watched it until then.

It was shortly after midnight, when I left my sister’s place. I proceeded to drive west on RT 22. After thirty-five, perhaps forty minutes, I approached what appeared to be some kind of accident scene. Both the east and westbound lanes of the highway were brilliantly illuminated. Although, I couldn’t make out any vehicles that were involved. As I got closer to the scene, which was about 1 AM, the engine failed. Engine, battery, lights, everything quit, and I found myself having to pump the brakes in an effort to slow down.  After rolling fifty feet, or more, the car came to a stop; and it was then that I noticed this fog, similar to the fog created by dry ice evaporating. It was everywhere, bathed in the white light that illuminated the surroundings. No sooner after the car stopped, this figure, resembling the Michelin Man, as if made of stacked tires, and wearing goggles, or something like that, stepped from the fog and approached the driver’s side of the vehicle. I was startled when the figure placed a gloved hand on the open door. I wasn’t aware that I had opened the door, let alone lowered the driver’s side window. My next recollection was of the digital clock on the dashboard, it showed 4 AM. Seconds later, after fumbling around in the front seat, I found the car keys in the ignition. Having turned the engine over the lights came on, and it was then that I realized that the front of the vehicle was pointed eastbound. More baffled than frightened, I assumed that I had passed out. I was at a complete loss to explain my experience. I couldn’t account for the preceding three hours, let alone explain the fact that I was parked on the shoulder of the westbound lanes, but that somehow the car had been turned around.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,40.6821,-74.3588

I was laying on my back with my feet pointed to the South and Orion was crossing from East to West on the horizon. The space station had just passed directly overhead and I was watching it go down in the West when I was distracted by a white light which appeared to be coming straight at me because it was growing brighter. The light continued growing brighter and began moving to the East. It was low enough on the horizon that it disappeared behind my house so I couldn’t get a good look at it. An hour later I saw the light again and it was traveling at the same low point on the horizon but this time it was traveling to the East. It was closer this second time and I got a better look at it before it disappeared behind my house. I saw multiple white lights and also noticed a red light this time. I was almost waiting for it to come back when I saw it the third time and this time it was really close. It came out of the Southeast and was traveling Northbound about 100 yards to the East of my house. I thought it was maybe a drone at first because it was behind some trees but then it got closer and I realized there were actually five white lights in a X pattern with one red light in the center. I took off my headphones and heard a soft roar that immediately threw out the idea that it was a drone. The noise it gave off was most similar to jets flying over Lambeau field before a game but much more quiet like if the jets were moving as slow as they possibly could. The five white lights almost made me think that there were five different jets flying in the same direction possibly chasing the red light at the center but they were flying in perfect unison at around 80 miles per hour. At this point the UFO was the closest to me all night. It flew out into the open about 200 yards above my head and I knew I was looking at something incredible. I finally noticed a massive spherical cabin in the middle of the lights. The cabin definitely had a reflective coating because it was very difficult to see and if I hadn’t seen it shimmer, then I wouldn’t have seen it at all. It appeared to be 300 feet long, 150 feet wide, and 80 feet in depth. It was by far the largest flying object I’ve ever seen, probably by a factor of ten. The red light on the UFO had a circular shape and appeared to be on the bottom side of the cabin. The UFO continued Northbound past my house then abruptly turned East and took off at a much higher speed. It seemed to change directions as easily as a drone and was propelled by the five white lights and possibly the one red one. I can’t say for certain how fast it took off but it was gone beyond the Eastern (possibly Northeastern) horizon in about ten seconds . I saw two of the greatest meteors that I’ve ever witnessed, but all I can think about was the UFO.  They’re here.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,43.6606,-70.5321

It was a cold and windy night, around 10:00, me and my friends were watching TV. Out of the corner of my eye I see out of the window a giant blob in the sky that looked the size of a planet, but had the blinking properties of a star. The more that I looked at that, the more it became a mystery to my mind. Since it was very windy, we thought that maybe it was a few tree branches making it blink that much, so my friend went outside to see if it was the branches. He comes back and reports that it was not the branches and that it was just like that. He starts speculating that it was something different, such as a drone or a satellite. We already ruled out the option of a plane since it was stagnant in the dark moonless sky. Soon after we ruled out a satellite since satellites are orbiting the Earth, and just like the plane’s reason, it wasn’t moving at all. Even more curiously, it just moved faster than my eyes could see to the right. One minute it was in perfec! t view out of the window, then the next you had to be outside to see it. It was still blinking, and had the same properties as it did before. I don’t know why aliens like cows so much, but I have seen stuff on the cow mutilations that take place around where I live, and to make things scarier, cows were/are on the property.

The video then switches to an outside view of the sky above our home and this time, 3 orange/yellow orbs could be seen.

And then once a triangle formation was formed between them! , the orb on the right slowed down and the orbs then continued to move steadily in a formation away from our home.

While stopped in traffic at light at intersection of Fairfax Drive and Glebe Road, facing East towards Washington, DC, I was surprised to see multiple objects in front of me, at an elevation of about 45 degrees and at a height of about 1,500 feet. Ultimately, I counted three objects. Each of which was followed by a long, twisted, winding contrail, of perhaps 1,000 feet or more. The contrails were identical for each object, but were not the typical contrail from condensation of water vapor. Rather, they were brown/reddish in color. The three objects moved helter-skelter, crossing each other's paths. I initially thought that they might be helicopters that had been struck by surface to air missiles (very reminiscent of a scene in ""London has Fallen.""  But there was no sound.  Then I saw what appeared to be a regular airplane in the nearby area, flying--it was a mid-sized plane with! what appeared to be a fixed (non-retracted) nose landing gear. This led me to think that perhaps the objects were ""sky divers"" or hang-gliders.  But the airplane was oblivious and was flying in a direction different from the three object.  In an instant, two of the objects--and their contrails--vanished.  Only one object remained.  Then the last object and its contrail also vanished.  I had a smartphone and thought of taking a picture; but I fumbled around unable to figure out how to use and it was too late anyway.  I called my friend as the matter was unfolding and asked if he was aware of what I had just seen.  He was not and said he would check the news.  Very odd as I thought the objects were in restricted airspace.  I suggested that maybe it had been a publicity stunt.  I'm reporting for what it's worth in case no one else does.

On the night of Friday, 8/20/2021 at 7:58 pm, I was walking toward downtown Salem, after taking pictures of the beautiful sunset and (almost full) moon. I just happened to look up to my left (in the northeast direction;  almost subconsciously knowing/sensing something was there, but had no other reason to look up) which is ironically, in the direction of the Salem power plant, I see almost a seemingly small, black disk/saucer type object, slowly moving toward the power plant, (where the first, original report was sighted on 7/16/1952, 69 years ago, almost to the day; I surprisingly had no knowledge of this sighting prior to this current experience, and weirdly enough, a few days days later while watching a show on TV,  it happened to mention/discuss and inform me of that 1952 Salem sighting, by US Coastguardsmen) as it seems to be slowly descending down toward that area/shoreline. In my video, you can only hear a few cars passing by, as I’m walking down a main street (Bridge St in Salem, I’m also taking a left turn onto Lathrop St, while passing through the parking lot of the business of Brake and Clutch) there seemed to be almost a eerie silence, as I’m watching this black object passing by in the sky, mesmerized.  As mentioned before, it was black in color, which had no lights, and can’t really make out the outline of the object, other than it looked a black disk/saucer/sphere. Also, as earlier mentioned, didn’t seem to be making any noise; it didn’t look like a plane, helicopter, or drone, and didn’t seem to have any recognizable features on it, like you would see and/or hear. The Beverly Airport is in the opposite direction (in the northwest direction), as well as Boston’s Logan Airport (in the southeast direction) and where this object is heading, there is nowhere for anything to land in that area due to the ocean and power plant being there. As this object is descending, right before it reaches the tree line and seemingly goes out of sight and “disappears”, the object seems to be turning onto it’s side, where it looks like it might be rotating in a way. It also left no condensation/“chem” trail or eminence of the object, like a plane would. I stood around in disbelief, trying to f! ind the object after it disappeared (at least from my view), as if it may have just vanished or descend into the water. This experience was less than a minute long, and strangely as if the object noticed me videoing it, seemed to pick up speed a bit, and started to turn/rotate onto its side, and head toward the water/plant, almost looking like it was still rotating, after I lost view of it, behind the tree line. . As mentioned before, I never saw the object again. I stood around for maybe a minute or two, trying to locate it, then continuing to walk down Lathrop St, in the direction where the object seemed to head toward and/or maybe land. A few things that stood out the most during this event was the fact that it seemed to be turning onto its side and continue rotating, that it was completely silent, and the object seemed to be smaller than a regular “craft”, which had no recognizable features that I could make out, other than it looked like a small, black, seemingly  rota! ting saucer-type shape, that descended out of sight, either in! to the w ater/somehow “land” by the power plant/or disappearing altogether.  I also read in the earlier reports from this site this month, that on 8/1/2021, around 10pm, in Beverly (where I live and the northern neighboring town over, which is connected by a bridge) had a sighting there, a little bit over 2 weeks before my sighting. I love taking pictures, and always take nature/sky gazing shots. Recently, even though I don’t have the photographic evidence, I have been noticing some weird, flashing (and not flashing) bright lights in the sky, both during the day/night. I was always confused and bewildered by them, and just discounting them as something else, assuming that there was some type of explanation for it. Now, this experience has me so blown away by what I saw in my video, and I keep rewatching it to see if I notice anything else I missed, try and make out exactly what the object is or what it could be. Lately, there also has been very unusual weather patterns; spectacular sunrises/sunsets, strange/ominous looking clouds, bad storms, and som! ewhat rare and amazing views of the moon (in all its phases; it was almost a full moon that night, with the actual full moon being a few days later, but otherwise still spectacular), and wondering if it was maybe the reason why the “craft” was there, also sky gazing like I was previously, or if there even is a reason at all.  In conclusion, I am basically still in awe of what I witnessed and captured on video, trying to make sense of what exactly I saw. Obviously, I would be super excited and elated if this really was a UFO, like I believe it is.",2021-09-07T00:00:00,42.5195,-70.8967

The direction was looking approximately 200 degrees south west.  In all the 24 years I've lived here I've NEVER seen a light in that window from that direction. It hovered ABOVE the trees.  My boyfriend and I stared at it for 30 mins, wondering: ""is that the Fire Camp's helicopter?"" ""why isn't it moving?"" ""if it's emergency vehicle lights, why are they bright white with no red or amber?""  The area is covered in at least 30 foot high oak trees and this light was above them. It appeared as large as if it were a helicopter less than a mile away, but blinding lights, not a single beam of a helicopter you'd see searching for something underneath.  I fell asleep and by 10 pm it was gone.  The light was pulsing and so clear bright, it blasted across the canyon to the other side (approximately 1.5 miles across).  I called the Fire Camp 8 this morning and said: ""I'm making a crazy lady call, were you doing helicopter training last night?"" I told the captain what I saw and he said ""no, the helicopter was not being used last night.""  He also told me that the fire captain in San Diego had a similar experience recently and everyone thought he was nuts, but there was no other source of light from a vehicle, plane, helicopter.  I don't believe in conspiracy theory. I don't necessarily believe in Martians (but I suppose there must be life out there somewhere).  What we saw made no sense.

Ahead, somewhat ahead of the headlights, there was something straddling the middle of the highway, which I originally took to be wildlife. I was sure it had to be wildlife, only as we got closer it became apparent that this was a ball, a metallic gun metal gray ball. More of a half-dome shape, which sat on several legs. I couldn’t tell just how many legs because there were all these connecting rods that ran between the legs. So the ball, this half-dome sphere, it was at least 5’ around, and up near the top, maybe a quarter of the way down from the top, was a red light that ran from side to side. Not very big, more like a diode, it started on the left and ran to the right, then back toward the center, where it stopped, before going back to the left side. I slo! wed down, and that’s when this thing lifted up. The dome sat about 4’ off the ground, on the legs, and when the thing rose it drifted toward the left, as if it were caught in the wind. It continued like that, gaining altitude as it moved to the left, which was toward the south. There were three of us, one in the back of the cab, and then the contractor, who sat to my right, and we watched the thing as it took off like that, and after a moment the contractor said, “what the fuck.”",2021-03-02T00:00:00,,

This encounter happened shortly after that. It's hard to talk about this because they were in my house, when I saw the UFO at least it was outside, I was scared then too, but this seems crazy. I don't know what to feel.  I woke up to see 4 beings, I couldn't move and my wrist and ankles felt like they were bound but there was nothing there visually. I was laying on my right said so my back was to a wall. There were 2 beings kneeling on my bed looking over my body at my back. One had a cylinder he was moving up and down my back, the second one seemed to be watching, like they were examining me. There was one standing close to my feet watching to 2 examining me. The one closest to me, saw me open my eyes. He nodded his head at me, then he touched one that was bent over me. He looked up and got off the bed. All 4 kind of nodded at me like they were saying it's ok. They then backed out of my room and faded into the darkness of my hallway and were gone. My body became free as the left.  I was scared and tried to get the lights on quickly but they were gone. They were short, maybe 4'5 - 5'0. They had a larger head but not like you see on movies. They were almost proportional. No hair, large eyes, small nose, small mouth, and no ears. Their bodies looked strong, like lean muscle. Their skin was a dark gray but when they were in the dark hall, there was a dark dark forest green tent as they faded away.  I had a hard time going back to sleep but, I got to thinking maybe they didn't mean to scare me, maybe they were just interested in the tumor. Maybe they were trying to help me or something. So with that I was able to relax a little. They didn't hurt me, it's just scary to wake up and find 4 beings in your bedroom. I don't know why I would have an encounter as a child and then have one at this point in life. Maybe they are just watching me. I just don't know what to think.  However, it got even stranger, I wasn't going to tell anyone what happened because I just thought it was so abnormal. You know why me. But my roommate that morning said ""Did you have someone in the house last night, Gwen (the dog) seemed to be really upset."" So, I broke down and told him what happened.

An object of great vibrant color changing illumination completely silent, hovering in one location to the north east in accordance to my house position.  30 minutes has passed, comparing the object to the east edge of my house, my reference point has not changed. Completely still in the same location the object has not changed position in reference to the edge of my house.

The lights displayed pure radiant energy.  Completely amazed and in utter disbelief, I realize that the object is nothing I have ever witnessed in my entire life.

Two hours has passed and the objects stillness questions who revolves around who. My aunt and cousin speechless with confusion. All I want is a closer look. My aunt leaves to return with a pair of binoculars. Winding the focus lense my jaw drops. Centered in my view the object forced vibrant light in split seconds. Red flash, elongated speckled light triangle, green flash, speckled hexagon diamond, blue flash, assortment of speckled lines, white flash, solid speckled perimeter, yellow flash, center and trip to tip.

My mother and I were sitting outside enjoying a beautiful day. It was pleasant for Texas and partially cloudy so we got to take advantage of my lounge chairs that lean all the way back. Since we had some clouds you could see very clearly into the sky because there wasn't blinding sunlight. It was around 2 in the afternoon. I watch the flight paths of planes coming into Bush International Airport regularly and enjoy monitoring jets, birds, whatever. I had been watching the birds when a black object caught my eye. It was moving in a straight line (unlike birds). It was also too high for birds. Just skirting the low lying cloud bottoms. It appeared to be round and black. No wings. No contrails (wasn't high enough for that anyway). It almost looked like a black basketball but considering how high it was, it had to be decent sized. Someone would have to do the math but I guess it would be the size of a smart car? It was moving at a good clip but not blinding spee! d. It slowed for a second and then returned to full speed. Very straight perfect line. I alerted my Mom and started to point and that's about the time it disappeared behind some branches on our magnolia. She sorta laughed thinking I was being silly. I went inside to get a cup of coffee. When I came back out my mom was standing and staring in the direction I originally saw the ball. She said ""You aren't going to believe this but I just saw it."" Same situation, it had just disappeared in that same area going southeast towards Lake Houston and the Eastgate/Huffman area. It seemed to be coming at regular intervals and sticking with the same heading, speed and altitude. I have no way of knowing if it was the same object or three different ones.

What I saw was similar to something I have seen decades ago but what occured was unlike anything I have ever experienced in my life.  Approximately 1,000 feet above us, was a silent aircraft with lights colored white, green and red, flashing in a circular motion.  I remained outside, watching the aircraft approach, while my fiance went inside to get his cell phone.  As the craft approached me overhead from the West, I was approximately 4 feet away from my doorway, on the sidewalk area of an ""L"" shaped apartment building, looking up.  Suddenly two green beams of light emerged from the aircraft and the same color but much less dense filled the space in between. The distance of the two light beams widened as they approached me, forming somewhat of a triangle, the base of which was sweeping the ground directly in front of me and towards me, nearly enveloping me.  I stepped backwards as it and the lights approached. I felt I was its target, being directly in the center of its two beams and field of light which continued to approach me, quickly.  My door was still opened. As I backed up, I grabbed my door in fear, yelled to my fiance, stepped inside & closed the door. I half jokingly told my fiance I almost got swept up by aliens and he told me that was what happened to him before he came to get me, only the aircraft was traveling East to West when it happened to him, while he was standing at the far edge of our property, approximately 70 feet away from our door.  So, the aircraft traveled East to West, 'scoped' my fiance, then traveled West to East towards me and did the same.  Together we exited our apartment shortly thereafter and watched the aircraft travel farther East, still fairly low to the ground and silent, but without beams emitting from it. Only the red, green and white lights continued to flash, as we watched it travel farther away. He took pictures at this time, as well as immediately after it 'swept' me.  I ran back inside to get my phone and car keys. I took video at this time but it was rather far away. We decided to try to get closer to it by using our vehicle.  The aircraft began to fly South as we began to drive East. We pulled into a sidestreet and I attempted to take video of the aircraft again. It remained silent, without emitting beams and continued to fly South, farther away.  When we arrived back to our parking lot, I searched online who to call for a ufo report. I called the number and the gentlemen suggested I & my fiance write separate reports and submit them.  It is now 2:29am, April 9th and I am still shaken up a bit, wondering if anyone else has experienced this or saw what took place just a few hours ago.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,26.136914681280647,-80.21914075569657

She asked me what was that thing in the sky, if it was an airplane. It was a rather large, bright/glowing red/yellow/orange (kind of like a golden glow), cylindrical shaped object. It didn't have any flashing lights on it and it seemed to be moving at a relatively slow speed, slower than an airplane. Suddenly it stops mid-air and when focusing on it as hard as I could it looked as though it has hovering in all directions in the same place, as if it were vibrating. It begins to move farther away as if going exactly in the direction we were looking at. It was just getting smaller and smaller as if it wasn't moving on an X or Y axis. When I try to start recording (I say try because it was hard to concentrate on anything except at whatever I was looking at) as ! soon as I point my iPhone’s camera at it, it suddenly moves to the left at a speed that I have never seen anything move like in my life or movies alike and disappears. I’m still in shock of what I had just seen with my friend, so while we were walking back down the beach going west I didn’t take my eyes off the sky looking around at every area of the sky I could see around me to see if I could still see it. Suddenly my friend N says look up behind you and I see the same colored glowing object I had seen just moments earlier (approximately 18°27'25.5""N 66°04'15.9""W), although this time it seemed much closer to us where you could even see some details about its shape and depth (about half the distance compared to the first sighting. This thing was huge). It was moving approximately towards the same location we saw it moving towards the first time (East-Northeast) at a very slow speed. I started recording. We then see a plane (distinguishable plane outline, dark gray with blin! king red white and green lights) coming from the direction of ! the SJU airport and we were certain that the object was 100% different than the airplane or any drone I have ever seen. Once the plane gets closer the object starts moving at a faster speed, still noticeable to the human eye (note: slow movements/speed of object appeared slower than the movement of the airplane) getting farther away and smaller every second that goes by. I lose sight of it maybe three times before I finally lose sight of it completely never seeing it again as though it simply vanished. I was pretty amazed at what I had seen and it is still hard to wrap my head around the unexplainable phenomena I saw happen. I will attach an illustration of what saw and try to represent it’s relative size and distance from where I was standing. I’ve seen the Empire State Building standing from Hoboken, NJ and this object seemed like it was farther and higher than the top of the building whit the size of the object still being rather noticeable. At it’s farthest visible point it appe! ared to be like a bright star in the sky around the size of the eye of a needle being held with your arm fully extended. Maybe smaller than anything I've ever seen with my eye at a far distance yet it was still noticeable due to its glow/brightness. Feel free to contact me with any questions. I have a pretty good memory and I don't think I’ll ever be able to forget this either.  E",2021-11-15T00:00:00,,

It then disappeared beyond the window frame. It came from the south and it was heading north.  I rushed outside to the front deck and caught another look at it as it disappeared around the side of my house. So I ran and followed it and there it was in front of my neighbor’s house; I was now parallel to it and it was silent, moving at a steady consistent speed, not moving up and down, and not moving real slow but not at super high speed either.  I got a good look at it; it looked like the size of a basket ball but it was not a sphere and not a perfect circle but circular-like, and opaque, soft edged, and it looked like liquid energy - like amber colored mercury but bright and glowing and less dense than mercury.  And it would morph a bit; intermittently there would appear a whiteish and more translucent perfect circle mingling within or around the amber mass.  One thing is for sure, this looked like an organic mass of energy that did not appear mechanical.  At this point I ran up my neighbor’s stairs (a good friend) and pounded on his door, and I pointed and said, “what is that?”  By the time he was able to get outside it had gone a lot further north and much higher into the sky and it was becoming a pinpoint of light, and then disappeared.  My neighbor didn’t catch a good look but we stayed outside and talked about it.  Within I’d say less than a minute but more that 30 seconds, here comes another one from the same direction - same type object, same speed, shape, and color, and heading north on the same path as the one before it.  One thing worth mentioning is that it slowed and paused, par! allel from us, before it went higher and further away, as if i! t’s obse rving us but I can’t say for sure that’s what was going on.. it just seemed like it.  And at that point we both had a very clear view of it, until it flew higher and eventually became a pinpoint of light, and then disappeared into the same area where the first one went.  Then approximately 30 seconds to a minute later,  here comes two more in closer proximity, not really close together but moving in unison.  To make a long story shorter, we agreed that in the end we saw at least 7 objects total - I lost count but my neighbor counted seven and I agree it wasn’t less than 7.  The remaining objects came and went just like the ones before them; except one of them seemed to appear from nowhere and initially flew lower in the sky near the tree line, and then came up and gave us a good look, and ultimately took off into the sky on the same path as the rest.  We pretty quickly discerned it wasn’t like anything we’d ever seen before, with no “flight-lights” like familiar aircraft and! no sound, and all the familiar explanations became impossible to apply to what we saw. I’m guessing we had approximately 10 minutes to observe them multiple times; it was quite a show - and no matter what they were it was an awesome experience.  Note: my neighbor had grabbed his phone and took video, but we agree that it doesn’t look anything like what we saw.. and doesn’t do it justice, and does’t depict how close and/or the actual size, and he was moving around so the video looks like the objects were dancing around, which wasn’t the case.  It’s challenging to take raw video of a night object with an iPhone and expect too much.. maybe with more experience, but I don’t expect to see anything quite like that again.

Sunday, November 7, 2021 at 9:42am I was driving my car eastbound on Bush St. I just got on the 1700 block to turn right onto Gough, when I looked up into the lower left of my sunroof. I saw in the bright blue sky, a silver southwest plane flying overhead to the west and behind it, bright flashing lights higher in the sky close to some wispy white clouds moving to the west. If I had to place where they were flying over, i would say it was over the Pac heights neighborhood. My initial thought was the lights were airplanes higher in altitude, but I quickly realized they were in a fixed triangle formation and were flashing light between the grey body color and a bright white, like reflection of the sun and they were moving together. But the silver plane that flew by earlier wasn’t reflecting any sunlight in the way the ovals were. They were 3 ovals fixed with each other in an equilateral triangle and they floated very slowly and I could tell ! because they were moving and the cloud behind it they were up against was sometimes coming in front of the ovals as they passed through it. They flashed sometimes at the same time and sometimes alternately. The best way I can describe the flashing is if they were coins and when they flipped around they flashed light. The flashing lasted maybe a half second and then went back  It wasn’t quite regular. The whole experience lasted maybe 20 seconds while I was waiting for the light to change behind several cars. When I looked down to drive, a couple seconds later I looked up and they were gone.",2021-11-15T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

Simply put, I was only taking a picture of the beautiful sky then later upon reviewing the picture saw the UFOs. The picture I have was taken in “live” mode on my iPhone, meaning the picture doubles as a mini video and can be broken down by multiple frames. There is no chance of window glare as I took the picture while walking to my car, thus I was not inside a car at the time. Reviewing the picture on live mode shows 3 UFOs slightly moving together in a tight formation, the! n the last few frames show them moving in rapid acceleration. The picture shows the Walmart store and the parking lot itself in the background, as well as a moon near the UFOs that help provide a sense of size and movement.

My German Shepherd starting barking like crazy.  She is not much of a barker unless someone is on our property. I took off the headset and all I heard was LOUD helicopter sounds coming from the side of my house. (my house has 40 windows so I can see any which way). I stood up because it sounded like several helicopters and I could see 4 bright lights just above the tree line. I used to be a helicopter mechanic and the lights seemed kind of close together.  I could not see shapes of the objects as it was dark out and I had no outside lights on. All I could do was hear the thunderous noise and see the lights. The noise sounded like they were hovering and at first, I literally thought we were being invaded.  Then I thought, they are going to crash because the sound was so loud and close. I ran to the other side of my house at the front (I was on the back side) to the parlor and looked out the front window.  I could see one faint light positioned towards my house.  With the helicopter sound still going,  I saw 4 sets of lights pass through my front yard and just over a telephone pole.  I am telling you, they were no more than 20 feet above the tree line / telephone pole. I cannot honestly say it was helicopters. As I said, they seemed really close together for a standard helicopter. Now, they could have been that close if they were Cobra helicopters as those have a thin design.  I called my husband who works in aviation (and was at work) and told him and he said to call the police. I called our local police department and they said they knew of nothing going on and had no other calls about it. I told the police that they were flying so low, I really believed that they were crashing. The white lights reminded me of a spotlight. It was really bright. I don’t recall seeing any other lights (red or green). The sound was definitely that of a helicopter (several). It was so loud that it reminded me of my days in the Navy when I was on the flight line launching helicopters.  As I said, I don’t know how they were that close together. And when they passed through my front yard, it was like each passed in a single row and took about 2-3 seconds to fly 50 feet or so. I looked on facebook and online to see if anyone in local areas heard anything, but nothing. I do live in a remote area. My husband said it could have been military helicopters. What bothers me is how low they were to be military and secondly, how close they were together.  Whether or not it was a real helicopter or a UFO, I cannot say, but it was something not normal. I think whatever it was, my loud barking dog scared them off. I havent had a chance to look around but when I get home from work tonight, I am going outside to see if I see anything abnormal or disturbed.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,32.7474298578199,-97.79460473933649

Moving very fast and seemed to disappear into thin air. Around 6:50pm : ball of bright light flying what appeared to be downward before disappearing completely right before it looked as if it was going to hit the ground. Wasn’t too far away from us and we didn’t hear any sound of crashing or engine noise. Everything seemed to be silent during and after sighting. We were driving through backroads surrendered by flat corn field land and didn’t see any type of crash. The orb seemed to disappear in thin air. It was a very bright light and seemed to be artificial light and led like. I would say the size of a basketball (maybe a tiny bit bigger). Hard to estimate though because of the speed it was flying at. We almost thought it was a shooting star falling from the sky (because we could see stars that night) but it was much bigger and much brighter. The light was not blinking and was moving in a straight line. It didn’t seem to have any glow to it and it didn’t leave any type of trail of light. It was a solid ball of w! hite light. We didn’t notice it until it came in view from the front windshield. We didn’t notice anything from the rear view or the side windows. This was not a cloudy night as the moon and all stars were visible. It was moving very fast... the actual sighting only happened in about a 3 second time frame. And the technological difficulties for about another 1 - 1 & 1/2 minutes. Although It did feel longer (more like a 10 minute time pass). Right before the sighting the bluetooth in my car cut out and my phone disconnected. It took a couple miles before we were able to reconnect and get the music to play again. That’s never happened before. We take these back roads to Dixon a lot and have never dealt with the bluetooth not working. Our phones also began to not work. We both had no signal for a couple miles before it kicked back in. My friend (the other witnesses) was unable to even unlock her phone. It seemed to have just froze.

I called my sister after the sighting and she said whenever I was about to explain something the sound would cut off but she could hear me fine with everything else I said. Only when I started to explain what we had saw. I did not feel sick before, during or after the sighting and neither did my friend who was in the car with me. We both did not feel dizzy or any type of tingling. My friend, an alien skeptic, has no explanation for what we saw. Me, a huge alien believer, knows what we saw.

I've had and filmed many UFO's over the years, this is my first report and I will remain anonymous. Las Vegas, NV Feb 17, 2020 at 3:14 PM UNLV parking lot behind Thomas & Mack Arena, near the Student Center. I checked the pilot weather. Mccarran Airport, a mile away from the sighting,  was reporting broken clouds at 25,000 feet AGL. It was a very thin layer. The objects I saw were at or slightly above the cloud layer and smaller than the airliners flying at the same altitude. I saw 7 fire colored objects in a delta formation and the 7th object right behind slot object. It looked like an arrow formation. There were also two white orbs to the left and right off the objects in the wing positions. I did notice there was a rotating white light from some of the 7 fire colored objects, but no green or red lights like you would see on a standard aircraft setup. Then in an instant they all scattered in spilt second reverse directions. Nothing in our military arsenal can make such maneuvers, that I know of! Seconds later 20 or more appeared and disappeared into thin air. It seemed l! ike they phased in and out of this dimension. One fire colored object and one white orb remained, kinda dancing around each other doing crazy maneuvers. At times the fire colored object looked like it had 3 lights on the bottom of it, similar to the triangle shaped UFO I hear about all the time. The white orbs were just pure white plasma like I've seen many times before. Other objects would appear and disappear during the sighting. This went on for exactly 10 minutes. I filmed a lot of it with my phone camera. As good as it films UFO's, this one too high and the sky was too bright. I'm gonna see if I can filter the UFO's out in Photoshop like I've done in the past. The rotating white light makes me wonder if they were some sort of secret military craft. I'm not that far from Area 51. Maybe it was some kind of joint Alien/Military exercise! Whatever they were, I'd like to pilot one!!",2020-02-25T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

One of these times, I saw a light that seemed to be moving across the sky. It was too low to be a plane, and had no sound. Just a strobing light. Fast forward to about a month ago, when I decided to start actively looking out my window. The sightings of these strange lights seemed to increase. They cannot be seen at all times of the night, so I decided to sample every so often each night. Sometimes I would see them, sometimes not. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I decided to buy some binoculars to see if I could make out the craft attached to these lights. After locating some lights on a few nights, I managed to lock on several times with my binoculars. There is no craft attached to the lights. They are just strobing lights floating across the sky in odd ways. Fast forward to about a week ago. I started consistently looking out the window to find the lights. To my amazement, they had stopped. I had been seeing them at least once every 3 days. Therefore, I decided to take it easy and stop consistently looking out the window. Fast forward to the reporting date. On a whim, I decided to look out the window. I assumed it was mostly done, and I would not see anything more. To my amazement, in plain sight - 3 strobing lights. I was caught off guard. All of the lights were just strobing across the sky, starting from different points. I decided to grab my binoculars to see if I could lock on to one of them. I picked one and tried to keep it in view. As soon as I did, it started to zip around. Every time the light strobed, it would instantaneously zip to another position. I had a hard time tracking it, but didn't think much of it because it was in the view of my binoculars, therefore it was not going very far (perspective). I went away from the window to try and process what happened and then went in for another go. Since the binoculars weren't doing me any favors - there is no craft attached to the lights, I decided to look with the naked eye. Again to my dumbfoundment, this is where things got eerie. There were still 3 lights. All throughout the sightings, the strobe pattern had been gentle. It is very much like a standard plane strobe pattern. One light started strobing crazily. Its strobe pattern sped up and started zipping left to right in the tree line. I located the other light near the ground and it started to strobe much faster. After about 2 seconds, it shot 50 feet into the air instantly at every strobe. At this point, I was scared, so I stopped observation and shut the window.  I cannot ascertain if these lights know that someone (or me) is watching them. Additionally, these are not planes or UAVs. For one, there is no visible craft attached to the lights. For two, there is no sound. And for three, planes and UAVs cannot perform the maneuvers being seen. Since the appearance of the lights is almost daily outside my window, it is safe to say this is a hotspot (in my opinion). I am inclined to get the correct gear to video tape these lights; however, I honestly was too scared to go outside and do so this time. Furthermore, what about next time? Will I be too scared?  For reference, I live in the Woodbury Knoll apartment complex. CT 64 is right outside my window at a distance of some feet. Across the road there are some buildings. This is seemingly where the activity is taking place. I do not have a good idea of the range at which the lights are from my window, but they are very low to the ground and fairly close. I am performing the sightings from lat / long coordinates: 41.526603, -73.181202. If you draw a line from the origin coordinates to lat / long coordinates: 41.525573, -73.182087, you will see where I am looking to see the objects.",2020-02-25T00:00:00,41.5606,-73.2062

On Friday 8/6/2021 in Frisco, Colorado, I was sleeping in my bedroom on the 2nd story of our condo. I was awoken at 3:25 AM by bright, flashing blue lights coming through the window. When I sat up to see the cause I saw 2 flashing blue lights that seemed to be in the distance a few blocks away. I initially thought it was police cars.  I laid back down but then the flashing blue light was even more intense. When I sat up this time, it was flashing outside my window across the street from me. The height of the light was at the top of my window, and it was about 30 inches in diameter. The light was so bright that it hurt to look directly at it. As I sat up further, I could see that whatever the object was went down to street level. There were 2 brilliant red lights of the same intensity and size at the bottom of the object on the left and right sides. There were additional smaller flashing lights on the left side and scattered around the bottom of the object. There was no noise coming from the object.  It was not a police car, truck, drone, fire truck or any other object that I could identify. I was scared and so crawled out of my bed to the floor to get closer to the window to look out. The window had a sheer curtain, but I was also able to look through the window in the middle where there was no curtain. The entire object continued to flash. I decided to get my iphone to take a video. I was afraid of being seen by whatever was with the object so the video I have is filmed through the sheer curtain. I did see a white pickup truck pass slowly by the object. It did not stop.  I then went into the living room around the corner from my bedroom to see if I could make out more from the sliding door window by the deck. In looking from that view, it was much the same and I still could not identify what it was. I decided to go back to the bedroom and as I was walking away, I heard something shut like a solid door. As I approached my bedroom I could see before I entered that the object was gone. There were no more flashing lights coming in the window. I went to the window, and nothing was there. It was only about 6-8 steps from the living room to my bedroom. I could now see across the street and the road and buildings that had been blocked by the object. There had been no noise of a motor or anything else. It went as quietly as it came. At that time, it was about 3:45 AM.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,39.5744,-106.0975

While stopped in traffic at light at intersection of Fairfax Drive and Glebe Road, looking Eastward, I was surprised to see multiple objects in front of me, at an elevation of about 45 degrees and an elevation of about 1,500 feet. Ultimately, I counted three objects. Each of which was followed by a long, twisted, winding contrail, of perhaps 1,000 feet or more. The contrails were identical for each object, but were not the typical contrail from condensation of water vapor. Rather, they were brown/reddish in color. The three objects moved helter skelter, crossing each other's paths. I initially thought that they might be helicopters that had been struck by surface to air missiles (very reminiscent of a scene in ""London has Fallen.""  But there was no sound.  Then I saw what appeared to be a regular airplane in the nearby area--it was a mid-sized plane with what appeared to be a fi! xed (non-retracted) nose landing gear. This led me to think that perhaps the objects were ""sky divers"" or hang-gliders.  But the airplane was oblivious and in an instant, two of the objects--and their contrails--vanished.  Only one object remained.  Then it and its contrail also vanished.  I had a smartphone and thought of taking a picture; but I fumbled around unable to figure out how to use and it was too late anyway.  I called my friend as the matter was unfolding and asked if he was aware of what I had just seen.  He was not and said he would check the news.  Very odd as I thought the objects were in restricted airspace.  I suggested that maybe it had been a publicity stunt.  I'm reporting for what it's worth in case no one else does.

It slowly circled over the complex across the street and then circled a bit north as a crow came from the east and dove at it. I went outside to watch. As I did,a tiny white object caught my eye.  The object was east and a bit south of the birds, but much further away and higher in elevation. It was flying from south to north and maintained its speed, direction, and elevation.  It was white or looked white against the blue sky and appeared round.  I could not identify what it was.  It had no tail, no wings, no prop, no rotor, and I did not hear any sound from it. I saw no other color except white and looked but could not see any lights, appendage, or anything on it.  It did not emit anything, no exhaust, smoke, light, and didn’t leave anything either, like a condensation trail. I looked to see if anything else was flying near it, but! I did not see anything.  I watched for as long as I could see it but eventually it became difficult to see.  I lost sight of it as it went further north and faded from view.  I looked for them, after, but could not spot the hawk and crow. Unfortunately, I had left my phone inside, so I did not get photos or video.  Perhaps a minute or two after my sighting, a small commuter plane flying southeast to northwest flew overhead but it was closer to me and much lower in elevation than the white object had been.  Afterward, I made sure to note the time and estimated that I probably watched the object, all total, for not quite a minute from probably 2:14 to 2:15pm PDST.  I checked and the Flightradar24 app and it shows no return for the east side of Bainbridge Island or over Puget Sound to the east of Bainbridge in its radar record, for 2:14 – 2:15pm.  I took a screen capture of the 2:14pm radar map.  The next radar return that would be visible from my front yard (2:17pm) is the commuter plane that I saw about a minute or two after I lost sight of the object.  The commuter was Maverick Airlines Flight APC 690 in a Cessna 208B Grand Canyon flying from Boeing Field, Seattle to Port Angeles at 3800 feet, flying at 153 kts. ground speed when it was overhead, according to the same app.  I captured this too.  At 2:14pm PDST, the approximate time of my sighting, the conditions on my street on Bainbridge Island, Washington were approximately 61° F, sunny, and blue skies.  Some low clouds passed overhead during the day, but none were visible at the time of the sighting and there was no wind.  It was mild and there was only blue sky.  I checked but the Heavens Above website’s database of all satellites’ flight paths, online, shows no satellites (of any kind) flying over my location from 2pm to 3pm, June 9, 2021.  If I had not happened to go outside to watch the hawk and crow, and if they had not been where they were in the sky, relative to me, I never would have noticed or had reason to notice the object.  Nothing would have drawn my attention to it.  The small white object could have been a drone, but its speed was impressive for its small size and lack of exhaust.  I still do not know what it was.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,47.6476,-122.53639999999999

But it was not moving like a plane, it was stationary. I told my husband and we looked at it through binoculars and it was indeed changing colors. We decided to go out with a camcorder to check it out closer. We stood on our dock on the pond. While he filmed we also noticed at least 2 other distant “stars” over the tree line doing the same thing - blinking red and green.

It hovered above the tree line and then slowly rose upwards and started to move in a North Easterly direction to cross the lake. It was changing colors as it moved along. The light was so bright it reflected on the calm water. It was totally silent and moved across the pond, over our neighbors cottage which is only 100ft away from us and then over our cottage before we could no longer see it because trees were blocking our view.  We were looking towards the West and a little bit SouthWest when we first saw the orb. The object moved toward the NorthEast. We watched the bright object for at least 7-8 mins. The camcorder pictures do not show the object as large as we saw it with our eyes. I believe the time frame for this sighting was between 10:30-11:00 pm EST.

Fayette, Maine, June 10, 2021  At about 10PM my wife and I were listening to music indoors when she spotted an object that captured her attention. It appeared to be quite distant and was low in the sky above the tree line on the opposite side of the lake from our summer camp. There is no development on the opposite shore of our camp. Only many acres of forest. The object was flashing and changing color. She and I both watched it for awhile with binoculars before deciding to get dressed and go outside to get a better look. The object was to the right of our camp as we looked westward over the water.  As we stood on our dock watching and filming the object with a camcorder, a similar object appeared directly in front of us. It was again above the tree line on the opposite side of the lake and at what seemed like a great distance. It appeared for only a brief time, and then disappeared. My wife said it streaked away. I was looking through the viewfinder of the camcorder and only know that I suddenly lost sight of it.  Immediately after, a large brilliant orange disk rose above the tree line and across the lake, again looking westward, slightly to the left of where we were standing. It appeared to be quite low in the sky and very close. We could not determine if the actual object was disk shaped or a sphere. Also, it was not possible to determine it's size, as we could not judge its altitude, especially at night. The evening was clear, cold and completely quiet. The lake is only about a thousand  feet wide in the section of water that's directly in front of our camp. The object was completely silent as it hovered over the trees for maybe 30 seconds or so before slowly crossing the lake eastward in our direction. As it traveled, it changed appearance (still photos taken from the video will be supplied to the Director). It passed onto the shoreline very near to where we were standing on the dock and went over the top of our neighbor's camp just beside us. It then took a sharp left turn and f! ollowed parallel to the lake passing over our camp and then our neighbor's camp on the other side of ours. At this point, it was heading north. All three camps are lakeside structures within maybe 100 or so feet of each other. It then went out of our sight into the tree coverage.  From doing some research, we have come to think that the original, distant flashing objects may have been stars that are low in the sky and that the refracting light caused the color changes. So we will focus this report on the large object that crossed the lake and was clearly not a star.  My wife will file a separate report of her observation.

On the night of june 11th my lady and I decided to go stargazing as we usually do. Now while we usually see a few things here and there that we cannot explain, last night there was an unmistakably great number of lights forming triangles in the sky, not only that but there were many smaller singular lights floating around and even seemingly coming out of these triangle shaped objects which were absolutely massive in size. There were also a great number of regular planes, drones, helicopters and what else have you that we could definitely tell were human made, trying to follow and observe these objects. My lady and I both witnessed these objects firing blue beams of light in all different directions, not only that but we saw massive flashes across the entire night sky as if it was sheet lightning as well as hearing loud explosions the likes of which did not sound familiar to fireworks or gunshots at all. In an effort to try to make peaceful contact I took my ! phone out and began using the flash on it to try and communicate with one of the triangles directly above me. It was then I realized I was definitely not hallucinating as the massive triangle would follow the direction of the light I would place either on the ground or facing directly at it. It would absolutely mirror every movement of the light on my phone, so in an even greater attempt at communicating, we decided to close our minds and try to consciously connect with them, even sometimes out loud asking them to sway side to side or even make drastic movement so we knew we were not making a complete fool of ourselves, and to our surprise it actually listened!!! Not just one of these triangles but a few of them actually communicated back If you would call that a form of communication. I also saw a dark disk shaped ufo only a trees length high doing flips and spins through the air as it passed over the night sky directly above me. This was after I asked them to send somethi! ng or someone closer so I could know the truth about this.

Because people don't believe in these things often and I messed up too many times trying to educate people on how to communicate with spirits in your home or anywhere else. Instant crazy guy reputation lol thank god I couldn't care any less what people think. I have seen 15 foot tall shadow monsters that make the oxygen itself die from how evil it is. I once helped a 10 year old child that my friend accidentaly ran over in the 80s. That child haunted him from the day he died all up until I took him back to his mom and sister 3 years ago. I even got pulled over and he possessed the police officer so I didn't do jail time. Otherwise our plan would fail. But the moment I asked for a sign ! that night to prove to myself I'm not nuts. A craft that had to be miles long uncloaked in the exact spot I knew something was cloaked in. It was just a type of bright white light I had never seen before. It was the shape of a DVD or CD if you will. Perfectly round and flat top and bottom. Impossible to see any other detail due to the white light it was made of. It tilted about on a 90 angle and shot diagonally upward in a split second and stopped instantly. It would have killed any living human being instantly at that speed and instant braking. Then It corrected itself back to hovering straight  and either shot upward into space or it teleported. That movement was way to fast to know if it flew up or just teleported.i have also witnessed a bright white cube almost in the same area that could duplicate itself multiple times while sitting still then pull them all back into 1 craft in just a quick moment. Weird digital looking futuristic movements hard to explain. And it uncl! oaked right as a shooting star was passing above it. Almost lo! oked lik e that craft did something to deflect it away from earth. But the massive circle craft was something unimaginable it was definitely not human and they could hear my direct thought and respond to my request instantly. I asked them to show themselves and they did that instant. I was petrified and amazed all at once and didn't move my body for at least 5 min straight because I was just starring blank and very confused and afraid. That picture has not left my mind for 1 sec since. It has scarred my mind for good. There is not a single min where I'm not seeing that craft in my mind and trying to grasp the whole situation. I'm not the same person anymore. I no longer have any friends or family and have isolated myself from society. I am completely ignored and alone forgotten to the world. And my mind is so fucked up that I actually prefer it now. I have seen shit that would kill you with fright itself. I have seen creatures that have never lived on earth. Ghosts you can't see but ! they can throw things at you and slam doors in your face and physically do harm to the living. And my life has been saved at least 20 times by spirits. Or I would not even be here to type this. I don't give a fuck who believes what or who thinks or says what. I was lucky enough to spend 20 years doing jobs that don't pay you in sheets of dried paper with numbers on It. I don't have a penny to my name I no longer get along with other people and have lost all interest in having friends or family. All this I typed is Disney channel compared to many other things I have encountered. I'm not trying to prove shit to anyone. All this shit has fucked my life up for good and ruined my reputation. After all that I just want my stories heard by someone who is awake. I'm not a sheep in pecking order like the rest of the world. If I died cold, poor, homeless and starving on a park bench tomorrow. I would die just as proud because I didn't waste my time collecting pieces of paper while on! earth.

This event took place at work (largest nuclear power plant in the nation, located west of Phoenix, AZ) The night is clear, full moon, not airplanes in the area (restricted air space). At about 0235 hours, I was on top of one of the main building roofs (I’m apart of facilities “protection”) I was walking around to stretch my legs. I noticed a light from a distant mountain, so I took out special night enhancing opticals (I can’t say exactly what they are, it would be a breach of security). The light proved to be nothing, but for the heck of it. I took the optical and looked at the moon to see how it would display. When I did this, I saw what appeared two circles or dish flying by the moon. I looked without the optical and saw nothing. I once again looked through the optical and saw them again. I watched them head northwest flying in aridic behavior. One made a right angle turn while the other went out of view.  I ran over to the office/post on the roof to get my partner. He came out with his opticals and we both started looking for these objects/lights. We located three far west over the mountain range. These objects/lights would speed up and slow down, disappear and reappear through our optical at no point in time could we see these with the naked eye. My partner then discovered a spot in the sky were there were many in one location. We estimated them to be about 10 to 15 thousand feet in the sky, we also eliminated the possibly of them being aircraft, bats, owls, drones, etc, because the right angle turns, speeding up and slowing down, we even googled how high can bats and owls’ flight. Lastly, one mode of vision on our opitcals allows us to see edges of objects these were clearly round.  After about 15 mins of watching these objects in the highly populated spot, we took a break from using the optical because of strain on our eyes and necks hurting from looking almost directly up. As we took our break, we looked back to the spot with only our eyes and one of disks appears. The disk appeared to be semi translucent made no noise traveled from northwest to the southeast. There were no lights on it, but the surface appeared to look jellyfishy. We both think either the dish was picking up light from the facility or the moon, which allowed us to see it. (leaning more to facility light, because when the dish started flying over the open dark desert, we lost sight of it) The was the agreed description among us. The dish literally appeared out of nowhere and quickly faded out of sight. While it was moving, I yelled to my partner who had his optical still on. He quickly looked at it under “edge mode” and he said it looked like a donut. We estimated the object to be no ! higher than 8 to 10 thousand feet, while the other objects were now thought to be 30 to 40 thousand feet.  We both once again looked at the spot where we say many flighting around and there were only a few, plus they were flighting very slowly or were floating. After several more minutes when by the remaining high-altitude object disappeared. During this event I was able to take my cell phone place into the optic to video record and take a series of photos of the many objects, I was not able to get the picture of the actual dish but did get another series of photos of some type of light/dish appear in photos moving but can be seen with the naked eye.

We were staying at a holiday destination in Tapeka Point, Russell, New Zealand when we noticed two green lights next to each other around 200 meters from our house up at the end of the beach.  The lights were above the water’s edge and around 50 meters above the water.  They were both stationery for 30 minutes, then started moving at 90-degree angles down to the water and back up to their original positions.  Additional lights seemed to come from them, flying around in erratic movements.  The green lights shot beams of light down to the water and there were other lights moving upwards from the water through the beams.  Another much larger very bright white pulsating light appeared above the green lights.  This light appeared to grow and morph in shape and changed colour between white, orange, red.  This intense bright light made its way along the beach front like it was searching for something, all the while pulsating and lighting up the trees, beach and sky.  At one point the white light object landed on the beach with pulsating white and orange lights.  We also saw figures at three different occasions walking around the beach and nearby park. These figures were seen when the bright light was lighting up the beach and the next-door property which is a park.  It seemed they were warning us off with bright flashing lights beaming into or near our section while we were watching them.  We called the police and we were on the phone to them for a considerable time throughout.  This was a hard call to make as it sounds crazy, however we had to make it as we were all very scared and had young children in the house and did not know what to do.  The police did not come out in the end as it was a two-hour drive and we agreed to call them if things escalated.  This whole episode lasted for four hours.  There were three of us watching this unfold, from the house and front deck and trying not to be seen.  It was very scary as we were so close to this event.  Around four in the morning, the green lights disappeared, and the pulsating white light stayed a short while after then slowly moved away towards the deeper waters and disappeared into the water.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,,

This thing, it was, well it had to be at least 12’ in diameter, and the light source appeared to be coming from within the interior... in other words, it glowed. You could say that it had an aura, and there were moments, as the thing preceded the truck, when the aura changed shape, and appeared to surge ahead of the object.  Not sure what I was dealing with, I got on the radio and told the security car, which had probably driven a mile ahead of me, to haul ass back to my position.

It was traveling quickly, as fast as a plane would, but it was well below where planes and jets fly, maybe a few hundred feet above the boat.  I pointed it out to my friend who confirmed he saw it too, which was a coincidence because we had discussed recent news reports of UFOs earlier in the evening.

Again, it move eastward and vanished in approximately the same location as the first object, but instead of fading away, I would describe it as vanishing instantly.

The best description I can give is was it seemed to twinkle or glisten. I could see no real shape, just light. Moreover, as I stood staring at it, I saw it move.  It would drop down a short distance, then move back up to about it's original position. Then down again, only then at about a 45 degree angle. then up again at slimmer angle. Then it moved in a straight line a short space to it's left. It repeated this pattern again and again.

The two of us watched this thing for about 15 minutes, and it terrified her. We have lived on this property 33 years. We often sit our on the deck nights looking up at the sky.

My boyfriend was driving our truck and I was sitting in the passenger seat looking out the window.  As we crossed a bridge over Chigger Creek in Friendswood, on FM 518, I saw two glowing orange/red dots outside my window that looked to be hovering in the direction of League City and/or Dickinson, TX.  The dots were sitting at a low enough altitude that we could  not see the orange/red dots in the sky from street level in Friendswood - due to the trees.  We tried driving elsewhere to a clearing in which we could spot them again, originally I had seen them when we crossed a bridge, which provided us visibility from the surrounding tree line - but, we were unable to locate the orange/red dots again after the initial sighting.  The dots did not really depict a shape from where I saw them, it more so looked like a straight line. When I described what I saw to my boyfriend, while we were crossing the bridge, he immediately said, ""it sounds like what was recorded in Dickinson the other night.""  He pulled up the Talk of Dickinson Facebook page and showed me a video that was shared on the page.  Sure enough, the same exact lights had been spotted and recorded two days prior - on November 5th.  The video depicts 3 orange/red dots that are in the sky.  Only two lights are visible on each side... if there is a shape.  If you watch the video, it looks like there are only two orange/red dots in the sky, however as the driver continues driving you will see the third dot (maybe as he got closer to the object/dots?).  The dots appear to make a triangular shape... possibly a square shape in the sky.  As the video continues, the dots dissipate or the tree line cuts off the dots... to me it seemed like the dots were dissipating. I wanted to share, because it reminded me of the orange/red lights recorded over Las Vegas a while ago.  They also did not seem to be flares since there were multiple dots in which seemed to be sitting relatively symmetrically from one another in the sky.  They were hovering - however, the sighting time/duration is unknown as I saw them while we were driving and they may have moved out of my visibility due to where we were.  The duration of the actual event may have been longer if you were closer to the lights.  Additionally, the duration of the lights may have been longer than the shared video recorded.",2021-11-15T00:00:00,29.4568,-95.0185

It should go to notice that the flash from the meteorite was vast apart as it was over the horizon and the ufo was closer as it seemed to be below clouds.

What got our attention (me, wife, daughter) were the 3 red lights outlining the craft. You could see the lights as it approached and as it passed overhead a little in front of where we stood. The lights formed a triangle on the bottom extremities of the craft.  What was unusual, there were no green lights, no white lights, no flashing. It was dark and you could not really see any distinct shape of the craft other than it looked like a triangle. The other oddity was the sound and the slow speed.  It sounded like a muffled jet, no high pitch whine, very quiet.  Another unusual thing was the speed and height. It was traveling way too slow for a jet and could not have been more than 150 to 200 feet off the ground.  This craft continued up the valley toward Letterkenny Army Depot and out of sight.  Triangle, black, 3 red non blinking lights.  Three or four years ago, we seen a  boom-a-rang  shaped craft coming down this valley.  We drove north of Lemasters to get a closer look. It had a normal white light on the front, which looked like a landing light. As it neared the end of the mountain range at Parnell’s Knob, it laid over on its side and traversed the end of the mountain.  It made a very unusual maneuver. As you looked at the craft coming toward you and for it to turn to your left (its right), you would think the right side would tilt down slightly as it made the turn. This thing laid over perpendicular to the ground, left side down, made the turn and came back to a  level plane and continued flying west over Fort Loudon and beyond sight.  When it made the turn on its side, you could see a white light at the center front and each end.  No colored nav lights, no flashing.  Based on the size and the close distance of observation, this thing should have fallen out of the air it was moving so slow. There was no sound.  As to the height, it was slightly lower than Mt Parnell as it made the turn.  Boom-a-rang, no tail, color black.

The lights were off, car was running. She says she was observing the anomaly for approximately 30 seconds, noticing the unusual brightness put in the distance. Dumbfounded, she turned to be and asked me what it was.  I looked up to see a bright white light in the distance a couple miles above the horizon. Observing the object for about 10 seconds, I assumed it to be the north star... but then I realized that the North Star would be behind us due to the car facing the southern direction.  Before I could say this to my girlfriend, the light immediately shut off as if a light switch was being flipped. And about a second later, the tiny dot that could have been what was shining so bright, shot off to the southeast, and was gone.  We pondered all the possible options as to what object could be, but couldn’t not determine it’s identity.  There were radio towers in the distance but much closer to the ground, and far less bright and consistently blinking on and off. There were planes in the sky, but much father away or higher up, also far less bright. The north star was not even nearly as bright as this object but was the closest thing I could have concluded the UFO to be. However, stars don’t just stop shining like flipping off a light switch; on top of this, the north star was behind me from how we were positioned.  This occurred just as towards the end of Twilight; so it was perfect to identify differences between stars, planets, satellites, radio towers, or planes.  This was not any of them. This is not my first UFO encounter, but it is the most unique and clear event I have observed yet.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,42.3458,-71.5506

I will say as a long time resident of the Adirondacks over the years there have been hundreds of sightings of anomalous events. I grew up in a town which is smack middle in the Adirondacks, if your unfamiliar the Adirondacks is the largest state park by continuous land mass in the entire United States, while populated there are vast vast regions of it which is forever wild and is extremely parsely populated in most regions. While growing up it was very common for everyone to report sightings of interesting lights, formations, hovering objects, pretty much everyone I grew up with can attest to being in the woods and at some point observing some sort of unexplained phenomena, to the point where it no longer became an event of interest between us kids, it was just part of living up there.  Here is just one example of series of sightings in that region: https://www.syracusenewtimes.com/2000-ufo-adirondack-formation-lights/  https://www.newyorkupstate.com/western-ny/2020/02/ufo-sightings-in-upstate-ny-grew-in-2019-where-were-the-most-reports.html  https://www.newyorkupstate.com/news/g66l-2019/01/19183adc03d74/-there-were-65-ufo-sightings-in-upstate-ny-in-2018-did-aliens-visit-your-town.html  https://patch.com/new-york/larchmont/151-ufo-sightings-new-york-so-far-2019-what-they-saw  The description of these sightings follow the same pattern of many of the eye witness accounts I heard about all threw childhood and even observed myself. I've had friends, family, staunch I don't believe in that shit to oh shit what did I just observe eye witness accounts. Whether or not this specific encounter can be explained as natural phenomena there are other events which are frankly unexplainable massive orb like objects hovering in the air making erratic movements and speeding off at speeds much faster than any known conventional aircraft.  In the Gore Mountain region there is both an active and old Garnet Mine in North Creek NY. This seems to be of specific interest to these objects. I've had an eye witness account which observed a massive orb like object extending a metallic arm over the active mine, when this witness observed the object he said he was paralyzed with fear at its sheer magnitude, he said after he observed it, it quickly recognized him and the object which was the size and circumference of at least two football field, started to deploy a clocking device. He said the object started to get wavy at the edges and he observed that in the span of 5-10 seconds the entire object being engulfed in a ripple that made it completely camouflaged with the sky behind it, to the point where it was invisible. The man the ran inside and discounted what he saw only to realize that what he saw was real. This is the most in-depth knowledge of specific details on the structure of these crafts. Again they were descri! bed as a large shaped dome with a smaller dome underneath but instead of completely spherical there was ""a large jut liked rectangle extending below the bottom dome and a small metallic like arm structured with a prong at the tip""  Additional the large majority of the sightings of these crafts are in LOW LYING areas, I would say that 5% of my ""interviews"" with locals is that these craft have been observed barely hovering over the tree lines of hills 90% have been these people observing these objects hovering directly over low lying bodies of water in the various lakes around the park, generally in some sort of formation, almost all encounters say that they're an orange red like orb, my theory is that when these objects are in a ""flying"" state they omit light, the other 5% of observations are at the mines themselves it seems when they are mining they do not omit light but can cloak the craft with some sort of camouflage, all the sightings of the crafts at the mines are at night. All other sightings of the craft when observed not near bodies of water seem to be in the hills surrounding the mines which seems to suggest that the garnet may be used as an energy source for these craft whe! re they mine small amounts in a deactivated state and then reactivate after mining.  Now onto the only photographic evidence I've ever managed to find of these craft this was reported yesterday by a long time local and respected member of the community whose lived in an isolated area, they are literally the only people living on one hill which is surrounded by forever wilderness i.e. they're basically the last people in between civilization and 10 million acres of wild -- no humans. Here is the pictures I did my best to upload the series as they occurred:  https://ibb.co/gzqNbs7  https://ibb.co/7RDZt8F  https://ibb.co/nrj7Gr8  https://ibb.co/FJQsR2C  They sent me these photos, while the moon is in the ESE direction they observed that this craft came over the hill hovered and then lowered again and then disappeared. Also notice that the moon is in a waxing crescent phase and can not be simply explained as part of a full moon lunar cycle. The craft is the size of other encounters which is about 2 football fields, and is located in the vicinity of and old garnet mine Here is the vicinity of the observed craft: https://www.google.com/maps/place/South+Mountain/@43.7079083,-74.0557715,3942m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89df9abc66c75387:0x8cb17f602dfdeb81!8m2!3d43.7106204!4d-74.0451355  Here is the location of both the new and old garnet mines:  Old mine: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garnet+Mine+Tours/@43.681181,-74.0587279,1370m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sbarton+mines!3m4!1s0x0:0x760d0cb4cf4464d5!8m2!3d43.6829799!4d-74.0593743  (Active) New mine:  https://www.google.com/maps/search/mine/@43.7313656,-74.1131728,2054m/data=!3m1!1e3  There have been at least two encounters of the same looking orb in the same vicinity on opposite sides of the mountain 2 years apart, the one two years ago however was observed in a formation of 3 objects in a v formation here:  https://www.google.com/maps/@43.7002856,-74.0533241,9678m/data=!3m1!1e3  This lake has also seen multiple sightings:  https://www.google.com/maps/@43.6914682,-74.0851313,9681m/data=!3m1!1e3  I will also note that there is large occurrence of traditional military aircraft in this area too from F-16's, Apaches, Drones, Black Hawks etc going in and out of the wilderness: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Siamese+Ponds+Wilderness/@43.5677055,-74.4279141,53051m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89df9fe5c1982411:0x6814ae93312d63e9!8m2!3d43.5677055!4d-74.2315292  As for this picture evidence it seems the orb moved in a SE fashion towards the old Garnet mine, it then was reported to hover an abruptly move backwards to the west, you can see with the dimming sunlight in the back that the pictures support that the movement from E to W is valid as the last photo which shows it moving to the W is in a chronologically older time frame. The total occurrence of the observance was 15-30 minutes.  All I am looking for is maybe some recognition and explanations as to what people are observing here. People in this region are very comfortable with the observations most just joke its the aliens again and is pretty well accepted that just ""weird"" shit happens, almost nobody speaks up for fear of being labelled the mountain man nutcase. I will tell you though that there is an absolute hot bed of UAP/UFO activity in the Adirondack State Park.  If there is a natural explanation for this I'd like to know thank you.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

At first, we thought they may be airplanes, but as we got closer and the UFOs got lower, we realized this was not the case.  As we progressed down the road, we came closer to one of the two UFOs. It increasingly lowered, and at one point I thought it was going to land right in front of us. The other UFO headed northeast and was soon out of sight.  The UFO we had eyes on was hovering over a nearby residence. We pulled into a parking lot right across the street and stepped out of the vehicle to have a better look.  The UFO was practically silent upon getting out of the vehicle. There was a faint hum and that was it for noise. It was rectangular in shape with two white lights on each side and a blinking red light in the middle.  Within a few seconds of us getting out, the UFO stopped hovering and quickly moved away from us, heading over the Hillsborough County fairgrounds. The pattern at which it moved away was strange and like nothing I had seen before.  The UFO moved side to side and up and down. It did not fly in a straight pattern.  As it moved away, we headed up to a nearby hill and watched these two objects hover in the distance for nearly 20 minutes. The movements they made seemed unnatural, choppy and sporadic. Soon several airplanes were in the sky and were seemingly looking for something.  It was definitely a strange occurrence that is unexplainable and like nothing I have ever seen.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,42.9783,-71.6856

As we approached the rounded end of the track the UFO very slowly and very quietly - mostly silent - moved overhead going from North to South. It was what felt like only a stones throw away, maybe 50 ft above moving through low hanging fog.  My spouse and I stopped walking and both agreed it was not just a plane leaving from Paine Field. It was dark and difficult to see the shape, but had red lights on the bottom in the shape of a circle, which also was a confirmation it was not a plane. I want to stress again, the speed at which the UFO was moving was extremely slow, and seemed to be only about 5 MPH or less as it went directly over us. Our dog sat down at our feet, and we all looked upwards. My spouse and I were both nervous, and held hands.  As the craft moved South through the low hanging fog, the fog was very thick at one point almost completely covering the view from the lights. As it emerged from the other side of the fog into clear view again, it had shape-shifted into the shape and full appearance (lights and everything had changed) of a commercial airplane, was moving much faster, appeared much higher in the sky, and continued onwards South in a straight flight as if it were simply an airplane flying over from Paine Field.  Over the years, I have shared this experience confidently with others who either agree it sounds like we had a close encounter with a UFO, but some non-believers think I’m eccentric and exaggerating. What I saw that night was very clearly not an airplane, and I knew immediately it was magical or otherworldly as it was so low, and so slow.

It had a green light in the front like a boat would have. The road goes straight and then turns so we had a good amount of time to look at it. There was nothing at all unusual about it at all, until it shot to the left at about the speed of a race car accelerating. Not fast for a car but for a boat it was very harsh. It picked up out of the water about 4-6 feet but the underside was still in the water. It went further into the cove behind trees. The road turns right where the “boat” would have gone. By the time we got there, around 10 seconds later, there was no boat, wakes, sound, or lights. The lake had no boats in it further out in the lake so it’s not like it drove off we would have seen it I’m 100% positive of that.

On the above date and time my wife and I were casually backyard stargazing, looking at Venus, which was getting low in the sky.  From our location, we can observe numerous aircraft constantly come and go in various approach patterns to both John Wayne airport and Long beach airport, and we are quite accustomed to seeing these.  All aircraft display navigation strobes and can be tracked on OpenADSB, which I use for fun.  To the left of Venus we noticed an unidentified light in the sky approximately 5º above the horizon.  Neither of us had noticed the light just a few minutes earlier, and there was no additional detail that would suggest a distance from us.  The light was larger than any of the stars in the sky and indeed bigger than Venus itself.  It therefore appeared to have mass, and it was illuminated, alternating between red and green solid light - not strobes - with a period of approximately 1 second or less. The light was located in the direction of 240º from Corona Del Mar, CA.  As we observed it, the light ascended vertically approximately three times the distance from the ocean from where we initially noticed it.  The ascension took approximately 1 to 1.5 seconds and was clearly not aeronautical in nature, as airplanes do not move vertically in such a near-instantaneous manner.  I called to my 15 year-old son to join us, which he did, and he began observing about 5 seconds after the initial, vertical move.  Approximately 5 seconds later, while all three of us watched, the light descended again to its original location, and then, after a second or two, plunged out of site, presumably into the ocean.

My brother says “Look right look right what is that?” And I look and we see this blue light flashing very fast, almost like a strobe light. I continue to look at it and notice it isn’t going behind us, as if we were passing it. At that moment I realized the flashing light was off road in the desert to our right and traveling the same speed as us. He was going about 60mph but once I noticed it was traveling along us I told him to speed up. He started speeding up and the flashing light stopped and behind us two bright lights appeared and almost resembled headlights. There was something off about it and I knew they weren’t headlights, I rolled the window down and noticed the lights were not on the paved road we were on, but they were behind us and off to our right in the desert. I also noticed there wa! s no light being illuminated on to the ground like normal headlights. I told my brother to go as fast as he could and get us out there. My brother got up to 90 in his  jeep and the lights were catching up to us from the desert. There’s no way it was a dune buggy or any other type of off-road vehicle traveling 90+ off road with tons of bushes and badger holes. We were in that desert previously with his jeep and our top speed was 20 off-road. We approached a downhill grade and this is how I knew they were coming after us. As we went down hill I looked out the window and waited for the lights to come over the hill and they did and they were getting closer. Eventually one of the lights separated from the other and 2 more lights appeared. My brother was coming up on a T intersection onto S Cloverdale road and if we went right it was eventually a dead end and so we went left, towards our house and residential areas. He made the left going 60 MPH and as he was turning there was ab! out 10 lights coming at us from the desert, that road stared g! etting i nto residential areas and the lights started backing off and going back into the desert. Once we got by houses we pulled over and could still see at least 10 lights out in the desert. Poen road is a rural road and has regular traffic during the day, but at night little to no traffic at all, we were the only car on the road and whatever those lights were definitely weren’t civilian. They were either government or not of this world. It scared me and my brother to the point where we don’t wanna go hunting out there at night anymore, and we have been out there 30+ times at night and nothing like that has ever happened. We went back the next day into the desert to check it out and it’s nothing but desert. About 5 miles from the road is Initial Point, Idaho. It’s a little mountain out in the desert and my brother believes that’s where the lights started coming from and racing towards us on Poen road.

I was walking along the Oakland harbor in the afternoon. The sky was deep blue with no clouds. As I was walking, I glanced up at the sky and noticed a round white shape in the sky. It could have been a sphere, an egg, or something along those lines. I did not see any features at all on it, although it was quite far away so it is possible that I just didn't see them if they existed.  It appeared to very high up--perhaps between 5,000 and 25,000 feet high.  When I first saw the object, it was hovering in one place. Then it started moving in an erratic zig-zag fashion. It instantly accelerated an moved at an angle, hovered for a second, then moved at another zig-zag type angle with insant-seeming acceleration, hovered again, and repeated this for perhaps half a dozen short jumps or so. It was generally moving in the direction of the bay/ocean.  I would not have thought much of this object at all had it not been for this strange jumpy movement. The best analogy I have for it is that it reminded me of someone moving a mouse cursor around a screen. It just kind of clumsily and quickly jumps to the new place on the screen where you point it. So while the hovering could be consistent with a quadcopter type drone or something, the sudden erratic jumpy behavior was just unlike anything I've ever seen before. There was no smoothness to it at all. Just: jump! Hover. Jump! Hover.  After the jumping behavior, it hovered in one spot for about 5-10 seconds. I was staring at it the whole time and had stopped walking at this point. While I was staring at it, it disappeared after the 5-10 seconds. For the entire rest of my walk I had my eyes up on the sky scanning for it but I never saw it again.  Within about five minutes, I noticed a helicopter flying around the city that had not been out before. It passed by me twice. The helicopter was much much lower than the UFO. I also saw a small low-flying white airplane pass through this area as well. It did not look like a passenger jet--it seemed much smaller. There is an airport several miles to the south (which is also the direction the UFO was), so the small airplane coming from that direction could just be a coincidence.  I did not have my phone on me because I don't like to take my phone out on walks.",2021-09-07T00:00:00,37.80316672771673,-122.2309960927961

A fellow musician was invited to play music at a private party on the rooftop of a home and  I played percussion that night. During the time I was not playing I struck up a conversation with a beautiful long white haired woman in a white dress visiting from CA. It was still fairly light outside when all the sudden I noticed a really bright planet and pointed it out. We both sat marveling at its beauty. As I scanned the sky as I often do at dusk to my left between Lookout mountain and Elder mountain I could see the aquarium and Olgiati bridge. Then I noticed an even brighter light but it wasn’t yellowish In color like the previous planet/star I had been eyeing. Nope this was different. This array of light was right between Lookout and Elder,that’s how low to the ground it was. This clear silver white,bright light was neither a star nor a planet. Almost like a spotlight on steroids. ‘do you see what I’m seeing,or is it just me?’ She replied ‘oh no,it’s not just you I see it too.’ I was like,’have you ever seen anything that bright before?’ She said, ‘I can’t recall ever,maybe it’s a satellite.’ ‘No, satellites are way way way higher up in the atmosphere. I have seen satelites before this thing feels like it’s right in our face!’ ‘Maybe it’s the North Star?’ It was located South West and within the earths troposhphere so it couldn’t have been a star. I just kept carrying on how unbelievably bright and BIG it was. The shape looked like a mix of great heptagram,irregular polygon and heptagram. It never moved from that one spot. It was a single object for sure. It did not sway side to side nor move from the spot we first began seeing it at.  It was literally like a hole was ripped into the atmosphere. It didn’t move. Didn’t budge. I ran to get my cell phone to film this and by the time I pulled up my camera I watched it start to fade.  Then flicker almost as if someone was blowing out an electronic candle. Slowly this light was disapating until the shine was completely out. It’s like it just withdrew itself from the universe. Almost like it was never there to begin with. Another way to describe the shape and color  was like the sparkle on a diamond ring. No it wasn’t cloud cover that made it fade away. This brightness was not a plane nor a helicopter.

I have recorded about 12 videos and taken 1 photo. In almost every video, an object can be seen shining brightly above the lake. As it slowly descend, a trail of smoke can be visible over it. When it is near the water, another object lights up above the first one with the same pulsating intense light and a trail of smoke. Few seconds later the first object's light slowly go off. Then minutes later the second object does the same manoeuvre and its light goes out. There is a pause of activity for a few minutes, and then the same spectacle repeats, each time the objects seem to be travelling away from me (w! estwards). It was a windless night. I could clearly see the light bouncing off the clouds and the surface of the lake. Its shape appeared to be oval, with the left side of the craft giving off most of the light, and on its right side there were few other bright lights, but not as bright as the main light. These details are not easily distinctive on the videos, but I could see them with my own eyes. Even though I only saw 2 crafts at a time, I assume they were the same two, in all the videos.

The string of lights looked as if they were the same altitude as the satellite I had been watching. They were moving in the exact same direction and at about the same speed as the first satellite.  Here is the approximate formation and number of the lights: .  … .. . ..  ….  . . . …  .. .. … . . . . …    ….  . . . .. .   ..  . . … . …   … .   .. . ..  .  .     ..   …  .. . .   .  .   . .  . .. . .     .   .   .  .    . . My camera on my phone would not have captured the string of lights as they were too high. There were no aircraft in the area, no clouds and no ground lighting that would have reached that altitude. There was no sound. The string of lights trailed off one by one, but the leading lights continued toward the southeast all in the same straight line as the original satellite.  I would be very interested to know if anyone else saw these lights over the Phoenix area.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,33.63271552511416,-112.37252283105023

As I was traveling about a half mile of where I live in the country in the southwestern part of Vigo county outside of Terre Haute IN, I saw what I first thought was a peculiar looking drone flying over the big farm field near the corner of Curry and Sullivan moving West. The colors and size as it approached me was too different to what I have ever seen so I quickly pulled over my car and opened my car door for a cellphone picture. I then realized it was aware of me as it quickly changed direction moving back East. It had a circular rotation of the center four lights that turned independent to it's flight path. I couldn't hear any sound as it slowed down from maybe at most 30 mph to almost stationary observing me taking pictures. All were blurry except for the one I will send you. The photo has the same two colors of bright neon like Pink and lite Blue. The two rectangular Pink in the front were po! sitioned lengthwise and the other 2  behind them were lite Blue and also lengthwise but smaller. For some reason the photo merges the other lights in the center but you can still see the same colors and circular shape. I had to leave because there was a car coming from the intersection nearby as I was outside of my car, so I left. I did some searching on available drones for sale and nothing that I can find remotely looks like that. Also it's hard to judge distance but I would say it was about a 100 feet high at it's closest to me and would have been bigger than any drone, about 10 feet wide at most.

It was very windy all day but eventually settled down after the sun set. I brought my telescope but did not even bring it out of the car as the sky was completely free from any clouds and was incredibly dark to where I could see every star in the sky. The first thing I began to notice in the sky as it was darkening was the incredible number of satellites moving in the sky. Every satellite had a clear path and speed. I made it a point to notice satellites and any aircraft (sound, consistent speed, consistent light patterns) in the area so that when it got dark enough to see without trouble, I would be able try and identify what was in the night sky.  The first occurrence happened just after midnight. I had thought to look at my phone to check the time but cannot remember the exact time. I had forgotten my tent for this trip and ended up sleeping in the back of my SUV with my dog by simply lowering down the back seats and lying flat in the back. As I was resting on my back at this time (feet at the hatch and head towards the engine), I looked out of the back passenger side window (looking North-East direction out of my car window towards the Sand Dunes mountain range) and saw what was the color of the northern lights – a green that wasn’t a solid color but seemed to change as if it were the northern lights) but that color was in what looked like the shape of rings (almost like sonic the hedgehog rings) or disks. The green color was only around the edge of the disks (or at least it appeared the darkest around the disks). The inside of the disks appeared to be dark, like the color of the sky, or was transparent. I could not! make out this detail in enough time before it had disappeared. The rings were moving and bouncing sporadically but as if they were bound within a container, almost as if contained within a large bag in the sky. The space within the container but outside of the disks was that same green color but just much fainter, and I honestly could not tell if it was naturally that color or was just because the disks were moving so quickly back and forth that it made it appear that color). Just as I noticed it, it had disappeared by going over the view of my car, and I did not see it after that. There was no way for me to even estimate a size of this object or have an idea of how far away it was as it was a completely clear sky and was in view above the mountain range, but if I had to make a guess, I would say that if I stretched out my arm and held my index finger out that it might have appeared around the size of my first finger joint (from tip to first joint). I am 5 feet 5 inches ta! ll.  The next event was most likely sometime between 1:30am and probably 3am. The time I cannot be exact on, as I did not look at my phone to get the time. When looking out of that same window as the first event – what looked to be almost the same location as the first, there was what I thought was a star. I felt a bit more gravitated to look in this spot not only because it was more comfortable laying down and looking in that direction, but because I had also seen something through that window already. The ‘star’ did not seem to twinkle like I would expect stars to do but honestly just looked like any other star in the sky otherwise, but as I looked at it longer, it had started moving slowly from its location in the sky (or at least appeared to move slowly since it was coming towards the direction that I was camping). As I kept an eye on it as it approached closer towards the campground – coming from the North-East direction of the mountains and moving in a South-West direction)! , it then appeared to have accelerated very fast (but gradually as it reached a fast speed if that makes sense) and flew out of view. When it flew somewhat overhead of the campground, I never noticed a sound. I had noticed some airlines flying overheard while in my car previously that night and was able to hear them somewhat, so I was carefully listening for a sound as it had flown overhead, but never heard anything or felt anything like a rumble. The only detail I could make out about the object as it flew overhead was that it seemed like it was maybe spherical or oblong and could have been white or possibly silver – almost as if it was a dimmed star. It appeared to me to be fairly low in the sky – appeared as if it could have been lower than the airliners that had been passing overhead from the mountains all day and night.  Around the same time period – I can’t recall if I had seen this object before or after the one just previously mentioned - I had also seen another star-like object in the sky. This one was not seen in the back passenger side window that the other objects were seen through but was seen through the passenger side window. It appeared very bright white in the sky, just like a star, but just a little brighter. In fact, it was just above another star in the sky, which helped give me a reference point. I knew that it was not the star Sirius as it was on the opposite side of Orion in the sky and quite a distance away from the Orion constellation itself. As I watched it for only just for a couple of seconds, it slowly faded out – probably within the timeframe of 3-4 seconds. I guess it could have been an aircraft, but I had not seen an aircraft come from that direction all night and felt that aircraft's light would not slowly fade out and would just turn off and on like a normal ligh! t switch. My other thought was that it was an aircraft with its light on and made a turn while the lights were on, but the light itself dimmed and went out to a single point rather than a light being on in full display and turning to the side. I thought that I saw an object that looked the same as the previous white or silver move away from that location immediately following the light going out, but I am not certain of that as it was fairly far away in the sky. I have no idea the distance away the object was or how large the object could have been.  The final occurrence happened at 4am. I did look at my phone at this instance to check the time. In near the same exact spot as the first and second event, I saw the same northern light-colored green and bag-like, container shape in the sky. The only way I could describe it was that it looked like a flying nebula (basically looked like the first object but you removed the rings or disks). I only caught a quick glimpse of this object – about the same duration of time as the first object - and it followed the same path as the first and went overhead from my view while I was in the car. I got up and honked my car horn in hopes that I could wake up the neighboring campers to alert them to wake up and look out at the sky, but don’t think anyone did. As soon as I honked, I actually jumped out of the car to try and see if I could see it, but unfortunately, I did not see it again. I did, however, see any even darker sky than I thought possible from earlier that evening. The milky wa! y was visible and unbelievable. I would compare the distance and size of this object to that of the first object. For this object, just like all of the others, I did not hear any sound or notice any rumbling as the objects travelled.  This concludes what I witnessed at this location. This is my first-time reporting anything like this as I did not know how to report, or that I should, up until recently. I did experience another object, very large and red right next to my home, just through the tree line – no light that emitted from the object…it was as if the light was contained within itself and made no sound. After about two seconds, it then went out, slowly but not too quick, as though someone turned off a circular LED ceiling light. I noticed that there was very clear and defined detail about the object as it dimmed/turned off. This occurred sometime between June 2020 and August 2020, but I am not sure of the exact date as I did not take note. I recently found a video of exactly what I saw that evening posted by someone online in a different country on the other side of the world around that same time. I am available to be contacted if someone would like more information in regard to this event and mor! e details.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,,

We pulled over and watched as it flew across in front of us, below the Moon, heading NW, and I then looked out my window toward the west and watched it...when it got directly across from us it seemed that I could see some sort of squarish structure or hazy ar! ea?? below it but the structure was so faint I couldn't tell what I was seeing. I rolled my window down and my husband opened the cars sunroof and we could hear absolutely no sound from this object. It then  promptly dimmed and went out.

We continued home, which was less than a quarter of a mile away, and when we got in the house I looked at our weather station to see which direction the wind was blowing and the wind was SSW 5, which meant this was not something that was blowing in the wind because if it had been it should have been flying to the Northeast and not the northwest.

I was about to go to bed when I noticed (through my bedroom skylight) a twinkling and color-changing light sort of hovering around, not moving too far in any direction; it was almost like it is swaying, more dramatically moving every now and then. It is flickering different colors, including blue, purple, red, greenish, and some in-betweens. I turned my light on and I could still see it. I wanted to make sure it wasn’t just a reflection of some holiday lights or something similar so I walked downstairs to my dining room and could still see it in the same spot at any given angle through our large bay window. I decided to wake my brother up and show him. He was obviously confused but still got up out of bed since it’s VERY much unlike me to say something along the lines of “hey I think I see a UFO or something” at 3 in the morning.  He followed me to the dining room and was shocked when he saw it too. We decided to sit and watch it together and we’ve continued to do so for the past 20 minutes. He’s better than I am directionally and told me that it is in the southwest. It just keeps “hovering” around and what appears to be rotating in place. We were both super tired and honestly getting kind of freaked out so we just decided to go to bed (after watching for approx. 20 minutes)... and here I am typing this. I hope this information can be of some use. This is super bizarre to me as I’ve never really considered myself to be a person who cares about or believes in this sort of thing. The only thing convincing me right now that my brother and I aren’t both hallucinating is the fact that my dad once mentioned that he saw one while fishing in the middle of the night (like he does almost every night).  I could still see it a few minutes ago (25ish minutes after noticing). I really need to go to bed so I went back upstairs and got in bed. I took my eye off it (could see through skylight) while typing this. I just now looked again and it is nowhere to be seen. Freaky.  Just a little background: I am a 19 year old girl home from college for the holidays. To put it simply, I’m quite a “normal” young adult. My brother is 16 at the moment yet has always been extremely mature for his age.

One would think that it was the clouds reflecting a fire below, this is California after all, but it was far to bright to be a reflection of a fire or any kind of light.  This section of cloud was glowing orange constantly, no fluctuation in intensity or color.  In the center of this cloud there was an indent.

It large in size but appeared to be very far away.

On March 16th, 2016, I was taking my car for a test drive after I had the battery jumped due to leaving my hazard lights on at work. All was running smoothly under the hood after a short cruise south on *Flagler Drive (*a waterfront road stretching the length of the intercoastal waterway, on the Atlantic Coast of S.Florida.) As I prepared to make a right turn heading west onto P. Beach Lakes Blvd; something bright,shiny, white & INCREDIBLY FAST caught my eye. Driving parallel with the object I could see clearly against a blue, cloudless sky; that it was a white or silver disc, heading West, presumably from off the Atlantic Ocean. Realizing what I was seeing, I quickly pulled into a CVS parking lot & parked facing the object. At this EXACT time, the disc stopped completely. Sitting stationary in mid air. Before I could think, blink or click a pic, the object literally & almost instantaneously, changed from a white disc into dark grey/silver disc. It stayed this way for maybe .06 seconds, before dissolving/dissipating into what I can only describe as a smear of dark grey smog/smoke. The smog/smoke had an odd form, horizontal with a slight upward angle, . Before I could think about it at all, it changed/morphed AGAIN. This time into a perfectly white, fluffy, “nothing to see here’” CLOUD. This blazingly fast, white then silver DISC, dissipated into a smear of grey smog (for a split second) then changing one final time into the white cloud.  A seemingly normal, white cloud, that wouldn’t solicit a second glance from anyone.  My excitement & adrenaline was definitely  elevated after this sighting,  due to the fact that my Husband & I FINALLY saw our first UFO (TicTac!) one month before this sighting. Early February 2021, we spotted the white/off-white ‘TicTac’ coming from the East (Atlantic Ocean) heading west, inland. The size, speed & maneuvers were unmistakable to me & convinced my husband, who is an engineer with 15  years of experience of all things-in-motion, that we indeed have some pretty intriguing visitors here is SoFla!",2021-03-31T00:00:00,26.70504529494382,-80.13514009831461

I saw a bright flashing white light and a dimmer flashing red light close together.  I assumed it was an aircraft coming into the airport that is less than a mile away from my house.  I stepped outside the house to see if I could spot the crescent moon.  I saw that the sky was completely could covered.  The lights I saw were below the clouds, and moving from the west to the east.  What puzzled me was that these lights were completely silent.  The lack of sound gave the object the impression of gliding.  I waited for it to bank toward the airport but it continued moving to the East.  Again, this object was below the clouds, which were low level clouds.  The object was close enough to be heard in my opinion.  I watched it slowly move to the East, hoping to hear the sound of the object following behind it.  Nothing was heard.  Yes, this could have been an airplane.  I could only ! see the flashing lights.  I did not see a form.  But having lived near the airport since the 1956, I have a pretty good understanding of the sounds that aircraft make when I see them fairly low in the sky.  I’m documenting my observation just in case someone else, either west or east of me, might report this object.  As the object was going out of sight, a plane took off from the airport.  It was a prop plane and it’s noise reminded me that the object I saw was very curiously devoid of noise; noise that I’m sure should have been apparent.  As I’m writing this, I can easily hear the sound of a jet high in the sky.  I just went outside and I could not see it because of the clouds.  But I know it there even though I can’t see it.  As I write this, I’m more certain that I should have heard the sound that the object was making.  It wasn’t that far away from me.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,41.6529,-70.2828

There are very tall pine trees in neighboring yards, the sky was a medium night sky blue with little grey clouds, and this unknown object was hovering right above the top point of a pine tree. There were few clouds out that night and the object was in front of a small, grey cloud. I thought I saw it slightly moving and thought, “ It’s just how stays shimmer.” I was mistaken, I froze in a sort of fear and every time I saw the object move, I became terrified, shouting, “No!” Every time. The object was a little bigger than a star, it seemed to look like that on purpose. It was diamond shaped, with the bottom coming to! a point. It would move side to side and up and down; as it moved side to side, you could see the outline of the shape of the object. I felt as though this was something most people weren’t supposed to see. I’ve never felt this way about anything. It was intelligent, with its moves and shimmering, like it wanted me to notice it, like it was playing a little game. If shined bright like a diamond, like a star, no lights, no flashing, just a simple object replicating a star. The next day, I noticed two small places in the area looking for something. There are no coincidences. There’s always a small aircraft flying around my neighborhood, we see it every night. This object I observed was not something I’ve ever seen before.

Was using an iPhone 11 Pro - 4k/60fps to record this. To set the scene;  The first 1minute and 40seconds is the original video shot from my iPhone 11 Pro, while standing out on my balcony earlier this morning.  The ""star"" focal point if you will, is what drew my attention to begin with.  I noticed it was flickering more prominent to my naked eye than usual, so I stepped out onto my balcony and decided to start filming out of curiosity.  Within 25-28 seconds in I notice a second light source, orb like shape, that had appeared.  However this second light source seems to be demonstrating some movement.  It begins to dart around erratically. 1 minute 42seconds begins the recording of my laptop screen where I had uploaded the original iPhone video for better viewing/ a more zoomed in view. This is where I point out the second light source with my finger and try to follow it around on my laptop screen a bit. The temperature was around -9 degrees celsius (negative 9 degrees celsius) which makes me think it was too cold to be a bug. I was recording while out on my balcony, therefore I don't think is was any lens flare either (was not recording between glass). The sky was pretty clear for the most part as you can clearly depict the focal star in view, therefore I do not believe it was a laser either? Maybe a drone? Satellite? The movements are quite peculiar.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,,

As I drove down the street on my way to the store at 8:11 pm on the evening of 1/8/2021, I glanced up from my windshield as my car drive in that direction down 17th st, and saw 3 strange lights in the spaced aprx 100ft apart from each other and grouped in the shape of a triangle.  I immediately assumed it was a radio tower when I realized I had driven down that street 100’s of times before and there is no radio towers within that line of sight from that vantage.  As I slowed down my car trying to figure out what I was seeing, I noticed that the lights in the shape of a triangle were almost drifting, but clearly steadily moving away from me, under power, with the leading end of the triangle angled down at what I think to be roughly a 30 degree angle as it flew horizontally, much the way a helicopter would fly with the nose slightly down.  The red lights didn’t look like normal lights as they slowly pulsated and looked more glowing hot  unlike aircraft lights.  I then assumed I! was seeing 3 drones spaced apart moving in unison.  As the triangles got closer to the cloud bank I could see a black triangular mass in between of each of the three glowing pulsating lights that was clearly what the lights were attached to. At this point I can honestly say I felt I was looking at something I have never seen before. I come from a family of pilots and have been in aircraft big and small, am familiar with a range of different types of fixed wing and helicopters (more than the average person) and have seen aircraft lights at night from the ground and am able to identify these vehicles at night quickly. I am also familiar with drones and know what they look like in the dark and their flight characteristics. Again, my estimate of the size of this object was roughly 100’ between each point of light and my guess at its altitude would be 300’ to 400’ max. As it slowly moved over the area near a local supermarket a quarter mile away, I lost sight of it as it entered! the cloud mass. This cloud mass was moving S West to N East a! s the ob ject was moving at a Northern  trajectory, intersecting the cloud as it moved almost true north towards the Mowhawk hills north of my position. I want to make it clear I have no opinion of what I saw but It didn’t strike me as organic or man made in flight characteristics or appearance, I do not believe one way or the other when it comes to UFO’s and other supposed paranormal activity and I lean more towards the skeptical side of the phenomena. But what I saw disturbed me especially given its size. It looked as if it was flying into the cloud deliberately. I’m reporting this in an effort to ascertain if anyone else witnessed this and reported it and would appreciate someone contacting me if that is the case. This entire event transpired over the course of 20 seconds and I have no video footage given the fact I was behind the wheel.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,44.073170796460175,-122.93638849557522

I have a pair of binoculars that I use during this endeavor.  On the night of June 15th, 2021, I saw an aircraft taking-off around 2300 hours. It was traveling in an easterly direction, and was about 45 degrees above the horizon, when I focused my binoculars on it. At this time I saw two lights, which looked like what you would expect when seeing satellites, traveling above, and in the same direction as, the aircraft. I then saw each light bank-away from each other, and take-up a position behind the aircraft. It looked like a classic fighter maneuver to get behind an adversary aircraft. The lights ""tailed"" the aircraft (closely, but not close enough to be a hazard) for a short distance before they both climbed upward at a steep angle. I lost sight of the lights before losing sight of the aircraft.  Other than the engine noise from the aircraft, no unusual sound was heard. They lights were a solid, white color. They had no other lights that were visible to me (such as collision or navigation lights as should be seen on an aircraft). I do not think they were drones, at least in the conventional/non-military sense owing to their speed and maneuverability.  I should also mention that I have good knowledge of aviation and aircraft.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,35.702364150943396,-83.98648396226416

It was a cloudy and windy day.  I noticed in the sky, maybe a mile away up, a black shape floating. At first, I did not pay attention, thinking it might be a black plastic bag, or a drone. But as we kept talking, maybe 30 mn after noticing the shape, I realized that it did not move, or at least barely.  My gf confirmed that she has not seen it move. And by move, i mean moving up or down, left or right. It was static or moving very slowly, like hovering.  I decided to grab my camera and zoom in, hoping to confirm it was a plastic bag or a drone. But the video got me confused: we see a static black shape that is constantly changing its shape (boomerand shape, round shape, and a similar shape that we see in one of the recently released video from the goverment).  The thing that confuses me is: when I zoomed in, I noticed some kinda of ""pulse"" from that shape (you can see it on the video) that even got the camera unstable for a second (kind of like energy released around). You can even see a halo around the changing shape.  The shape then kept hovering above Williamsburg, moving very slowly from left, going back to right, before disappearing up in the clouds.  I am not saying it is a UFO. But I would assume tht an empty plastic bag, given the altitude and the wind that day, would have followed a different and unpredictable path. That thing, whatever it was, was rotating on itself, and not following winds at all.  I will be attaching the 2 videos taken - I apologize for the quality.  Best, Sofiane",2021-07-31T00:00:00,,

This is a remote area and I would have heard it if it was a plane but there was no sound. It was a dull gray but glinted in the sunshine. It was not moving like any aircraft I’ve ever seen; it just seemed to be hanging stationary in the sky.  I slowed my car but rounded a bend where trees obstructed my view.  I knew there was a clearing around that bend and pulled over when I reached it because it would give me a clear sight line.  I got out of my car and turned around to see the craft without tree obstruction and it was gone.  It wasn’t more than a minute from my point of vision to arriving at the clearing – how could something that big just disappear from sight when it didn’t even appear to be moving?,2021-09-07T00:00:00,,

While driving down a road that I drive down almost daily a bright object caught my eye, I was curious instantly. I could see the edge of what looked like a disk but at first you could distinctively see lights on what seemed to be the underside or bottom of the saucer. My immediate thought was there are no red or blue flashing lights and the object was flying too low to be any plane. As we got closer it started to show itself more. It was clearly hovering and not only do planes not fly that low around here... Planes dont hover! it proceeded to slowly move north. From my perspective it was hovering over what seemed to be the area of the hospital more so toward the Newport Naval Base. The object seemed to turn or slowly flip to where i could distinctively see 3 circles of light that werent perfect circles and they where glowing blueish white light that was bright enough to outline the shape of the object. It was a big object bigger than any drone and any plane ! or helicopter that flies around here. As soon as it showed the three lights that where shaped like if you connected them they would make a perfect triangle, the bottom light flickered a couple times. The lights, to me, seemed like some kind of propulsion system like thrusters and the lights were some sort of fuel/power source. The object had some sort of cloaking capability because you could see the 3 lights/thrusters and the outline but the bottom of the ship seemed to camoflage with the sky. The way this object moved and hovered alone was unlike anything ive ever seen and i have been to air shows and have seen the most modern of planes fly, ive seen the f-22 raptor up close and a b-52 bomber. This object possessed technology and abilities that werent anything from this planet. In no way shape or form did i feel threatened by this object and it seemed to be showing itself on purpose like it was staring directly into the car. I was with two other people and i was not the dr! iver so my eye was glued to this object the whole time. it slo! wly move d and the driver was too dumb to follow so it went beyond the line of site and dissapeared. This thing was big. the two other i was with saw the object and it was real, it was the most intense thing ive ever seen. knowing just about 100% that what i saw no doubt was a UFO and was most likely piloted by Extra Terrestrials it absolutely blew my mind and will forever. The object was soo big and vivid it was undeniable what i saw and believe me or not i know what i saw and i believed before that they may exist. After last night there is no doubt. It has peeked my curiosity and im craving more. Seeing this object would have made even the most skeptical of skeptics believe, i am skeptical and i dont just assume i thought of all the possibilities on what it could possibly be before i thought UFO. Theres nothing on this planet that can move and be as big as that object. I hope people start to believe more and accept these beings because who knows how much they can help the human rac! e.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,41.48576530612245,-71.30778163265306

I've googled everything and have not come across anything similar to what my wife and I witnessed.

This evening my daughter and I had been out feeding bottle lambs in the field.  We had to get them back to the rest of the flock and also sneak away so they would not follow us.  They think we are their moms, but if they cannot find us then they will stay with the rest of the sheep and the guardian dog where they will be safe.  The sun had just gone down completely so it was hard to see so we used that to our advantage to “disappear”. We walked through the flock of sheep and circled around to walk along the fence knowing they cannot see that well and will loose us in the other sheep if we walk quickly.  As we circled around to the entrance of the field I heard a couple of stray bottle lambs calling so we stopped.  We have 13 of them and the smallest ones are harder to escape from.  If we kept going they would have made us so we waited.  I was counting on that they would eventually follow the direction we had left them and also the sound of the other sheep be! cause they don’t want to be left behind.  We stood there quietly listening for a few minutes as they called to the sheep and made their way towards the flock.  I got bored quickly and started looking at the stars while still listening to the lambs as they made their way.  I quickly noticed a formation of small lights that were very high in the sky. They were moving steadily from east to west.  We live near an airport so I first just assumed they were high altitude planes. They were moving at that speed, maybe a bit faster.  Then quickly realized they were not flashing at all, several high altitude planes did appear and it was easy to tell that was not what we were looking at.  As I mentioned we live near an airport and there is a lot of air traffic.  So, then I thought they must be satellites.  Though,  I thought it was odd they were in a trapezoid formation.  I pointed them out to my daughter who was with me.  She is 13 and she started watching them too.  Then I realized there was 5 in formation then another two out front and then another two appear towards the rear.  They traveled at a mostly steady rate and constant light.  Then! my daughter said, “did you see that?”  I said, “no what?”  She said the one I the rear of the trapezoid was doing something strange.  So, I focused on the one and saw that is was actually wobbling.  Moving up and down as it was tracking with the others.  She said yes it is, but that’s not what she saw.  She said it had flirted around really fast.  So I kept watching and then I saw it too.  It would zip at light speed backward or in another direction for just a split second.  Sometimes so fast it just looked like it just faded out or disappeared and flash behind  it appeared then it was back. This happened In different directions, not always behind.  So that solidified they were not satellites either.  For reference these moved across half the sky in no more than 5 minutes then stopped after we were commenting on them.  After they stopped I pulled out my phone and checked my star app and it said that I was looking at the constellation Leo.  The “stars” did line up with it b! ut, unless stars now forget their place and cross half the sky! in five minutes to get back in place and they also wobble and flit around while they do it... THEY WERE NOT STARS. We realized they were pretending to be stars and that was the reason for he formation.  Yet, even then after they stopped the back “star” was still moving around in the sky not holding still.  We were now alert that things were not as they seemed and we stated looking at some other “stars and satellites”. The two in front of the formation were no longer visible.  The two behind the trapezoid formation had kept moving after those stopped and then one just faded out and disappeared. The brighter one kept going for a minute then stopped. We turned around and saw two bright lights over one of our big oaks out in the field.  They were so bright I thought those ones HAD to be planes so we watched for a minute.  They never did flash and didn’t get closer or farther away.  Other airplanes headed for the airport  flew by and it was clear they were not planes.  I checked my star app and it said it was part or Aries. Then the lower one started to quickly drop  in the sky and first faded out, and then  brightened back up and got so low it disappeared behind the tree.  At this point I messaged my husband and told him we were surrounded by UFOs and he came out on the quad to se! e what was going on. Then the higher one started moving quickly across the sky at a steady rate to the south.  When we commented on it, it stopped.  When he got he got there we told him what we had seen and he of course didn’t believe us.  So I pulled out my star app and the “star” that had been in Aries was now saying it was part of Apus.  So the “star” had “flown” past Cygnus and into some harp constellation I had never heard of before.  I told him just wait a minute and watch.  Sure enough, soon my daughter spotted another “star” obviously dancing around in the sky.  It was not a part of the original fleet but in a similar part of the sky.  We all watched it weave and swing and dip every which way. Then the bright star behind the trapezoid formation started moving again towards the “Leo” trapezoid formation which was still holding still. Then another “satellite” started moving west to east in the same part of the sky.  Joey said for sure THAT ONE was satellite, until half way across the sky it disappeared.  At this this point his mind was pretty blown but I said, “I bet there are more” so we turned around to the north again and ANOTHER light I had taken for granted as star started dancing around too!  So, we watched that for a minute or two as it dipped and weaved around.  Then we turned back around to the south and I looked suspiciously at “Leo.  I took out my star app out again and their cover was blown because while they no longer lined up with ! “leo”! They had not moved with the constellation as it would move.  The “star” furthest east no longer lined up at all.  They accidentally held too still!  At this point my daughter and I had been out there watching this craziness for darn near an hour, and I had to get back in to get the little kids to bed and what not.  We headed back toward the house.  Then I remembered I had not given one of our guardian dogs her medicine so I went up to the barn to do that.  I noticed she need water so went out to fill her bucket and while it was filling I looked up at the sky again to see another very bright “satellite” booking it across the sky faster than any of the other had been until my view was blocked by the barn roof above me.  I checked for the “Leo” stars on the way down tot he house and they were still there, still pretending to be a constellation, but even further out of line of where the actual constellation was supposed to be in the sky.  I am 38 years old, I have never before seen anything that I could not write off as an airplane or satellite in the sky.  I don’t drink and have never so much as smoked a cigarette since they are my number 1 asthma trigger. I have an undergraduate degree in environmental science, and a master’s degree in biology.  I own and operate a 127 acre sustainable and regenerative farm with grass only beef cattle, sheep, goats, turkeys, chickens, and ducks.  I don’t spend a lot of time looking for UFOs, nor do I have time to even if I wanted.  But, I sit here now wondering how many times have a I looked up at stars were not actually stars?  Why would UFOs pretend to be stars or constellations?  What is the purpose?  These questions disturb me nearly as much as the fact that I have witnessed indisputable UFOs.   What are they doing and why are they pretending?  And why SOOO Many!???  Just, why???",2021-05-20T00:00:00,40.3548,-80.23639999999999

I watched a rectangle shaped ship go from the bottom of the moon that was lit up by the sun and up to the dark part of the moon. The ufo moved very quick and traveled the surface of the moon in about 3 seconds. I also noticed it was fairly bigger than most of the craters on the moon and it left a shading on the ground as it traveled. I came to the conclusion it must have been massive for me to see it as i did. It had the shape of a rectangle if you rounded off its edges and thinned out the front of it.It caught me off guard so i didnt get many detailed on it but it was dark like black or smokey gray.The ufo had no lights nore did it leave a trail. I watched for several hours after that to see it it would come back around se! eing as it moved so fast but never did. I use the telescope alot to take a look at the moon. its a decent telescope and like i said i get really really close detail to the surface and never seen anything pass by the moon like that or that size or even leaving a shadow on the surface.

We observed several bursts projecting in the same linear direction and it was very bright.  Then a few more in another direction originating from what we had thought to be a star it grew brighter and appeared to dance between 182-184 degrees by my compass. Then as it began to apparently fade a bright something neared it’s proximity and then darted quickly from the area in witch we believed we were seeing a supernova. Then object that moved off quickly seemed to have a solid burning white omission and traveled on a heading of west by northwest until I lost sight of it in the horizon. The fast moving object was oval-ish and very bright. It had went straight for the star from below the tree line. As it neared the star like object it grew brighter. It was extremely fast at times.

At approximately 10:15 pm on Tuesday April 13 2021, a pair of faint pinpoint lights resembling satellites traveling in formation approached from the south. I have seen the ISS pass overhead before, when a craft had just recently undocked and was slowly moving away, and this was similar, in that the lights were traveling along adjacent parallel paths. As the lights grew closer, I noticed that there was an area of distortion between the two small lights. A faint shimmer of light was projecting forward from each of the lights, angled toward a centerline between the two lights, but not reaching far enough forward to intersect each other. The closer the lights came, the more confusing the distorted image between the lights became until the lights passed directly overhead. At that moment of closest approach, with the object directly overhead, the distortion seemed to resolve into a black triangular shape, with the lights appearing at the trailing points of the triangle. As the craft passed between myself and the stars, it obscured the stars behind it, but there were starlike points of light that were present on the underside of the craft. They did not match up with the stars that were in the background but appeared as though it were a type of camouflage mimicking the starfield. The craft continued north and the distorted area quickly disappeared and the parallel lights faded into the distance shortly thereafter. The entire observation was only about 10 seconds. If the craft was above the atmosphere, it was gigantic and moving very fast. If it was within the atmosphere, it produced no contrail and it was totally silent. No engine noise whatsoever. I checked the NASA website and while there was a resupply and docking on 4/9/21, the orbital path of the ISS was not overhead on 4/13/21.

My husband (54) and cousin (50) were sitting on the back patio after the super bowl.  They saw 4 orange lights that came from the south to the north, one after the other.  The lights were low.  At first thought perhaps it (they) were an airplane heading to the small county airport north of us.  But there was no sound.  Nothing.  They glowed orange.  Came northbound and then would turn east, speed up and just disappear.  EACH one of these lights followed very similar paths and ALL did the same thing. My husband and cousin came inside to tell me the story.  I was getting the baby to sleep.  (I am 53 years old - the baby is my granddaughter).  I laughed and told them that was a wild story.  So I went outside with them (baby too) and they continued to talk about how odd it was.  At this point they had seen 4 orange glowing balls of light.  We were speculating on what it could possibly be!  My husband did say with one of the glowing balls of light that he thought he could make out some kind of structure to the craft. All of a sudden, another orange ball of light appeared.  This was identical to what they had seen.  Same path, same turn and disappearance of the object.  I was stunned.  But then more came, one after the other.  We saw 5 orange glowing ball shaped objects when I was outside and a total for the night of 9. We recorded 4 of them.  It was difficult to get a good image on the recording.  The light doesn't show the orange we saw.  We recorded them on our cell phones. Both my husband and I are veterans of the USAF.  We have seen many types of planes, even hot air balloons, but we have NEVER seen anything like this before in our lives. We would love to know what they were.  Is there a logical explanation?  Have you heard of this type of sighting before? Thank you",2020-02-07T00:00:00,31.1961,-94.74470000000001

As someone who likes watching the ISS I stopped to watch it and quickly noted that it was 1) too big to be the ISS, 2) too orange to be the ISS, 3) moving too fast to be the ISS. As soon as the first object (that is, the first one I saw) moved out of sight behind my home I saw flickering behind the trees and a second object made its way from behind the trees into the clearing, loving in the same direction as the first, at the same speed, but seemingly farther away. This repeated several times and I saw 5 objects in total. I was unable to film the one of the objects as it was behind the trees but seemingly below the horizon. This object was not high enough to appear in the clearing.  I did a quick Google and Twitter search and found Tweets and web posts from FOX23 NJ and PIX11 — both NYC-area news outlets.

I was outside smoking a cigar in the middle of the night in front of my garage, which faces my neighbor's woods. Kept seeing bright lights through the trees, which is very abnormal. The brush and canopy are thick and it's tough to see anything through them even in the day.  Looked like two lights to me. I went toward the treeline and started thinking it was a car on the road parked on the hill outside my driveway. Turned back to the garage and quickly grabbed protection (an axe handle, about baseball-bat shaped) because I thought it was a potential robbery. Nobody would ever park on that hill unless they were trying to hide from being seen. Went back, watched more, just had the sensation something wasn't right. The lights kept getting brighter.  I went inside, grabbed my phone (Pixel 3 XL), and came back and started recording, and was still thinking it was a car on the road. As I walked down my driveway I realized it clearly wasn't. I realized what I was looking at was above my other neighbor's property across the street. A big field with a few trees deep in it.  At first it was one bright solid light, but as I moved toward my garbage dumpster, it came into view as several other lights. For some reason I started thinking it was a fire in the sky. Couldn't make sense of it. Just kept recording and watching it for about 10 minutes.  It seemed to get dimmer, then brighter. I couldn't figure out the shape. Only after watching the video did I realize that it seems to have been several different objects. My guess is three. After a while, one disappeared, which made the overall appearance dimmer. Bit later, another disappeared, leaving just a single glowing orb. Should've mentioned earlier that these primarily appeared red-orange to me, but the color absolutely shifted. They/it were solid white like a star at one point. Then, the last one rather than simply disappearing seemed to quickly fly off.  I couldn't upload to imgur. No clue why.

March 19th 2021 at around noon I was driving on us36 westbound through Missouri. I pulled off the highway in Hannibal, MO. To look for a UPS store and both my wife and I saw what looked like at least 100 floating gray and white “orbs”. They were floating through the air like a school of jelly fish at an altitude of around 300-500ft elevation. They were very dynamic in their own individual movements while staying together as a group. The whole group was moving eastbound seemingly with the wind current, but each individual orb was moving up and down and all around each other. They were not balloons. They had no protrusions, or wings, or anything at all coming out of them. They were not perfectly round, more of an oblong or beachball size football. The longer ends always pointing up and down. They seemed to have a gray side and a white side. They seemed to be turning around to show their white side, but all at once, and when they turned to show their gray side, it looked like they all had vanished completely. I don't know if they were actually turning. For all I know, they could have been spontaneously changing colors. At any rate, they all changed colors at the exact same time. There were 4 orbs that stayed apart from the group at around the same altitude. I'm not sure what they were doing, but they seemed to be some sort of parents or chaperones. There is a conservation area just to the east of where we were, called “Steyermark woods conservation area”. When they were over that area, what I thought at the time was a park, they formed more of a column, getting very close to the ground. We were in a huge hurry at the time and it was at this point we had to continue down the highway and it all became a memory for us. In conclusion, my own personal thoughts on the matter is that they were biological lifeforms almost like jelly fish. They moved as part of a cohesive group, but made their own individual movements within the confines of the entire unit. I've seen videos online of the exact same lifeforms in Korea and Mexico, and it makes me wonder if it's the same group or are their different schools that travel in their own wind currents.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,39.6834,-91.4364

At most we saw 13 red lights at the same time in various formations, but most often it was between one and four red lights at a time. We watched the horizon for over half an hour. On three or four different occasions there was a big white explosive burst of light in the sky next to a red light. This white light expanded to a bigger circumference than the red lights, and also faded as if it were a cloud of smoke dissipating. Around 8:35pm we saw two red lights zoom away from each other rapidly and then fade to darkness a second later. This was the first time we noticed they could move, which was really exciting. All the other times, the lights faded in and out in stillness, but this time it was clear that they were floating in the air and could propel themselves to move very quickly.

I watched this “star” for a few seconds, and it then rapidly, erratically shifted its position in the sky, from its original position to other positions in the same vicinity of the sky, returning briefly back to its original position, during these rapid movements, and coming to rest again in the original position after ~5 seconds of rapid, erratic movement. The “star” sat in the original position that I first took notice of it in for another moment, longer than the movement had lasted for. The star then moved from the original position again, in the same manner it had done previously - rapidly, erratically, seemingly randomly, and back to the orig! inal position again. This cycle repeated for less than 5 minutes. My dogs did not react to these events.

I don't think it had aliens in it or anything like that because it was too small, it wasn't like a spaceship. Kind of reminded me of the flashing lights in a school zone at least that was the shade and light consistency. Best example I can try to explain the shape of it is this. Imagine a hockey puck, now stack about 8 hockey pucks on top of each other, (the same way you would stack cans of tuna) except make them significantly larger like 8"" in diameter and 8"" thick stack them on top of each other, then lay the stack down horizontally and space all the pucks out! evenly about 6"" apart and instead of them being pucks they were orange lights.

I am 51 years old and consider myself an amateur astronomer.  I was observing the Perseids meteor shower with my mother and father in the front yard facing a north to north east direction.  Most of the time when I am observing meteor showers, I use a 1x third generation night vision scope as I have found I can usually see triple the number of meteors compared to when I am observing naked eye. I had seen a fairly bright meteor about a minute before my sighting.  Many times, meteors come in pairs, so I was observing a specific area of the sky waiting for a second meteor.  The star Capella was observable in the upper right corner of my night scope.  From the right upper corner of field of view, I thought I sensed movement near Capella. When I focused on the spot, I could clearly see a dark object moving very fast.  As I started to track the object, I realized I was looking at a triangle.  Besides being a triangular shape, there are several things which I found unusual. 1.  There were no lights on the craft.  Even the dimmest light would have shown in the night vision. 2.  There was no sound. 3.  It must have been flying fairly low because it looked to be about the size of my thumbnail held at arm’s length or was very large flying at a high elevation.  I sensed it was flying at a lower elevation since it appeared there was a slight glow or haze to the object, maybe from light reflecting from the city lights on it. 4.  It was not an equilateral triangle.  The 2 sides were narrower than the back end.  All the sides were flat. 5.  It was a dark aircraft.  I could not sense any details other than the general shape of the craft.  Generally, if I see an aircraft through the night vision, it is light in color and much smaller compared to this object. The object was moving from north to a generally south direction.  I tracked it for about 10-15 seconds until it disappeared behind our house.  I estimate I tracked it for about 85 degrees of sky. My first thought was that maybe I was looking at a B2 Bomber.  I could see the object good enough that I could tell the back end was perfectly straight, unlike the B2.  Perhaps it was another military craft that I am not familiar with.  I don’t know if the military is allowed to fly without any running lights. I have observed many planes through the night vision.  It is very unusual to see a plane flying low enough at night that I can see its silhouette.  Usually, I just see the lights with a slight hint of an aircraft between the lights and I always hear the aircraft, especially if it is flying as low as this one appeared to be flying.   This is only the second time I have seen a plane flying without running lights.  The only other time I have seen a plane flying at night without lights was immediately after the 9-11 attacks.  While observing the object, I immediately started telling my folks what I was observing.  Neither one of them were able to see the object. I know this was a short duration sighting and maybe it was just an unknown military craft, but I thought I would throw it out there.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

It was moving relatively slowly and when it hit the tree line I could no longer see the light. It seemed like the light simply went out. I would say it traveled at roughly a 45 degree angle.  It’s hard for me to estimate how high it first started above the trees. Maybe 100 feet? My first thought was meteor due to its brightness. But because of the proximity I knew that didn’t make any sense. I would akin the brightness to a professionally lit baseball stadium light. I don’t even really know how to describe it. I was dumbfounded.  But I was even more shocked when maybe a minute or so later the light came back. It was back at the general area where I had first seen it (unless this was a second separate light?). Roughly 100-150ft above the trees (?) But this time as it descended it suddenly moved up in the air.  It sort of puffed/floated up maybe 50-75+ feet then descending down into the tree line where it was no longer visible again.

What made it strange was it’s erratic behavior. It was stopping and starting, sometimes it would reverse in the opposite direction, but rarely. It would zig zag and change speeds. It reminded me of how electricity / water follows the path of least resistance, or how a drop of water falls down a wall in a shower, sometimes it would slow down and then speed up, etc.  The phone camera couldn’t capture it as the object was too far away.  I would just like to know if anyone else saw it, because it should be obvious to anyone looking up at the stars that night in the area.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,44.74263214285714,-73.46204107142857

I looked away from the object and focused on a star that was nearby. The object kept going and I was able to clearly follow it across the sky (west to east). I yelled at my wife “Do you see that?

As I scanned the sky I noticed several hairline 'contrails' but not as left by a normal jet. These were rapid, then vanished. I saw about four of these very briefly, just two or three seconds. These lines converged at a similar point, moving at ultra high speed and head South across the Channel.  The next sighting was shortly after. Two White/Silvery objects of undefined shape but NOT round, possibly near rectangular, moving almost side by side. One object slightly larger. The forward object was jinking up and down a tiny bit. The heading distance was South. Altitude unknown, but possibly above 30K Feet. These were visible for around three seconds. They were not 'plant seeds' like dandelion or round airborne seeds which we used to call 'fairys' in the UK. At a guess, bearing in mind the possible height, these two object could have been travelling at around 2000 mph or thereabouts. Shortly after but higher up, not by much, a brief contrail streak appeared...slightly wriggly looking , perhaps by Vortex, lasted about two seconds then instantly dissolved to nothing. At a guess, the contrail could have been around the height of a normal contrail, perhaps much higher.  Nothing more was seen in that region although I did notice a similar white object drifting West but these were airborne 'Fluff'. The Binoculars were focused to be clear at jet trail height. Any white 'fluff' close too would be blurred away. They were NOT Birds due to the extreme speed. They were not Eye Floaters which I suffer from, but there are not white and do not race South. Unless you were sharp eyed or had Binoculars trained on that section of sky, you would have missed them, even through 7x or 8x Binoc's.

Through the binoculars, the light appeared to be a single steady point of light with no colored navigation lights or strobing.  The light traveled in a straight line, moving at a steady speed from the southeast toward the northeast. It was visible for at least 90 seconds before fading in the distance. I thought it might have been the ISS, but checking with tracking apps showed the ISS wasn't due to be visible in my location in the NORTHWEST sky until several hours later.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,42.94334184327255,-85.64301557417448

A pretty crescent moon was reflecting in the lake, so I went down to the beach to look at it.  While there, I looked to the Northwest area of the sky, where I was puzzled by a straight row of lights in the sky.  Upon closer inspection, there seemed to be cylindrical shaped craft hovering in the sky there, about 30 degrees above the horizon line.  There was no sound, and no exterior lights visible on the craft.  The light appeared to be coming from windows which were placed in a single, straight row along the entire side of the craft, and appeared to show the light from INSIDE the craft.  The light from the windows was steady, white light, not flickering or pulsing in any way.  The spacing of the apparent windows were as follows, from the rear of the craft (most clear), to the front of the craft (somewhat hazy):  2 windows, then a space with no light, then 3 windows, then a space with no light, then four windows, then a space with no light, then perhaps 2 more windows? (this part was less clear than the rest of it was).  After about one minute of viewing said craft, I was debating about whether to try to run inside and get another witness to come out and see it, but then the craft started moving, very slowly, toward the east.  There was still no sound from the craft, just birds and frogs and other lake sounds as usual.  I decided to watch where it would go, instead.  It was visibly moving slowly east for another 2.4 minutes, until it faded from my view.  The fading started at the front, where it was less clear to begin with, and then slowly tapered to the back, until it was no longer visible.  I can not be sure if I would call it disapparating, or whether it simply changed its angle in comparison to me, or if it just got too hazy there?  The approximate distance it traveled in my view was from a location visually “above” the constellation of Cassiopeia to a location visually “below” the constellation Lyra.  The craft appeared quite large to me, and closer than the stars – perhaps twice as far as a regular plane would be?  I took three photos of the craft with my cellphone.  They do not show a lot.  The first two are quite blurry, I used less zoom on the third one, and it is somewhat clearer.  I also took a photo of the crescent moon reflecting in the water before the craft appeared, and a photo of the brightest lit area on shore, a local Inn, afterwards, to indicate that it was not some weird reflection upward of it’s lights into the sky.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,,

My distance to this craft was too far to hear any sounds.  I speculate that it must have been quiet.

That would make the sun approximately 90 degrees away in the sky. The moon’s terminator was not perpendicular to the horizon and I was thinking about the spatial geometry as I looked away towards the light side of the moon. That’s when I saw an object in the sky.  The object was bright. And as I watched it, it seemed to be hanging in the sky and not moving. I grabbed my phone and took some pictures. It appeared long and cylindrical or cigar shaped. Then I perceived it to be actually moving albeit slowly. I watched it for a few minutes and decided to run over to my parent’s house to use their binoculars. They live behind me and we have adjoining properties.  Looking through a pair of 16x26 binoculars I observed the object to be long and vertically oriented. There appeared to be three lights or three sections of high reflectance. The top was orangish. The middle was greenish. And the bottom was orangish; The same color as the top one. The underlying structure appeared to be black.  I pointed out the object to my parent’s neighbor and asked if they wanted to see a UFO. She came over with her two children. I gave the son the binoculars and he looked at the object. The neighbor remarked that she heard there may be meteors and I said this is moving was too slow. My mother came from the bottom of the garden and my father came out of the house. I pointed and said, “It’s a UFO”. They said it’s not a UFO. And I said it’s not identified so it is an Unidentified Flying Object.  We watched for about 15 minutes as the object slowly made its way over us in the sky. It was fairly close to passing directly overhead. I will approximate +/- 15 degrees North-South from zenith. The object seemed to move constantly from East to zenith. At which point it became hard to see and was lost in the sky. This makes me think the object was reflecting light from the sun.  The sky was cloudless. The weather warm 65 degrees F.

No blinking, just solid glowing red ball. My first thought was it was Venus, but it was much too large and of course moving across the sky at a steady moderate pace. No change in elevation that I could see. It traveled almost due west and disappeared. Start to finish approximately 30 seconds for it slot eventually disappear, still traveling west. I was pretty sure I must be seeing something explainable, but it was like nothing I’ve ever seen before. I decided there must be an explanation, and was going to write it off as something unusual but not necessarily important. Then another large red glowing object appeared in the east, approximately same position as when I saw object 1. It was following the same path as object 1, and quickly a 3rd red glowing object appeared but further east, like they were traveling together one fol! lowing the other. Their speeds seemed to match. At this time I woke up my son who was sleeping and told him to meet me outside. When we got outside on the deck 10-15 seconds later, only one red glowing was visible. We watched as it passed by above the tree line, moving to the west the same as object 1 did. It was 1:30 am and the neighborhood was very quiet. I wondered if it was helicopter, but it made no noise. My son noted there were no blinking lights, it was just one glowing big orb ball type of share, very red and almost like it was on fire. We watched until it disappeared, and waited a few more minutes but no more appeared. We went to bed. In the morning, my son told me he saw one more go by, one of his bedroom windows faces north same as the window in my bedroom where I first saw object 1. He watched it move to the west, then went to sleep. I don’t know what we saw, but it was really odd. I didn’t bother trying take a pic, didn’t think they’d turn out and I didn’t wan! t to miss seeing them while looking for my phone.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,44.8054,-93.6248

They were in only what I could describe as a string of lights running North to South in a sloped line with one staying to the left of the formation. Two of them moved or floated, the one on the left went from left to right and the other from top to bottom while the rest stayed in one place. I told my friend that I could not believe what I was seeing. I actually became very emotional and hung up on him. I then attempted to film it with my camera phone however the quality was pretty bad during dusk ( I still have the video). So I ran to my right to try to get a clearer shot and started seeing a couple of them vanish. I pointed the camera at them and hit record but to my dismay the phone defaulted to camera and not video I snapped a picture of t! he horizon.

It was partly cloudy outside, but I saw the UFOs when I happened to look up at a portion of the night sky which was not covered by clouds and saw two light-looking UFOs. I thought it was weird that two satellite-appearing lights were moving together so close, but suddenly one of the lights sped off into the cloud cover. The other light stopped moving through the sky suddenly, but then changed direction and began taking off towards the other light into the cloud cover.  I've seen satellites and airplanes move in the sky and I know with 100% certainty these lights were moving like no known human aircraft. They made zero noise and moved far too fast, from zero to the speed of light it appeared in milliseconds. And they were far too high in elevation and moving too quickly to be drones of any type.  What worries me is the fact that these things come off as looking initially like your average satellite moving in the night sky. I feel like most people would have probably glanced at what I saw and thought these lights are just satellites and brushed it off and looked away, since at first they were moving just like satellites. It was when I stopped for a few extra seconds and really took a closer look at them moving and thought to myself oh my god these are definitely not satellites.  It makes me wonder how many events like this happen, where most people are so used to assuming these UFOs are ""just satellites"" and end up looking away from something which might actually be a UFO. But I understand why this would happen, since these light UFOs come off as your straight-forward satellite moving across the starry night sky at a typical speed and trajectory as a standard satellite. It's only when they ""go off"" trajectory would anyone notice they are even UFOs. Absolute insanity!",2021-03-31T00:00:00,43.4836,-124.16330000000002
