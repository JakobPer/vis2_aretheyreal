The last one we saw was going in a completely opposite direction the rest of them seem to be going in the general direction of the first one sighted. Birds could be seeing flying away in the opposite direction in large numbers. Entire event started at approximately 1900 hrs. and continue through approximately 1934 hrs. The last object was seen by myself my 10-year-old son and my wife. We took a picture with her cell phGone and when you zoom in it does look like a silver saucer like object still.

I posted it to FaceBook and said I would zoom in and crop the picture later that evening. I did not see the object when taking the pictures, it wasn’t until a bit later that I noticed it in the photo. When I got home, I looked at the pictures on my Galaxy S4 phone. On that particular picture, I hit edit, then crop.  I zoomed in on the original to the spot in question then slid the crop outline over there and saved the “cropped” image.  I posted it to Facebook. Next, I took the “cropped” picture (which now had a .png extension) and did the same thing, zoom, crop and save.  I did it a third time and Posted both of these to FaceBook.  To me it looks like some kind of flying saucer. I have the original picture on my camera (.jpg extension).  Clicking on the “details” button, it shows the date, time and sequence number of the picture. I will email the original picture to the address given along with my FaceBook address.  If someone wants to verify the picture, I’d be happy to show them. ((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows an amorphous, blurry, dark object above a distant ridge.  We cannot confirm that the object is a genuine UFO.  Moreover, we suspect that the object, because of its asymmetry, may be a bird in flight.  PD))",2016-10-11T00:00:00,45.7884,-114.2462

While i was walking over to the woodpile i noticed a bright white light over the mountain in the area where the Mountain Side Resort is from a WSW direction. At that time i didn't pay any mind to it cuz i just thought it was a aircraft or maybe the planet Venus. Venus can get real bright at times and could fool someone too. So after bringing a load of wood in i went back out to get some smaller starter wood with my bucket and i noticed again that this light had gotten closer and now was over the southern area of the lake. This was no planet. At that point i stopped to take a good look at it but i couldn't tell if it had stopped or was continuing to come in my direction. This thing was bright and it looked like there was a smaller but just as bright light just under the main light. To find out if it was moving still, i a lined myself (my eyes) with a telephone cable that hanged from a street light across from my property in such a way to see if it would appear from behind the cable.  Sure enough it came from behind the cable so that told me it was moving but not fast at all. Keeping my eye on this thing, i went into my car to get a pair of  field glasses (maybe 10x25) not too powerful but enough to see it through the lens.  All i could see was these lights that were too bright (blob), no markings or anything, couldn't make out a shape to it at all, it was just too bright. No sound at all, no vapor trail, just floating along in a ENE direction, at a angle that would have put it right over my home. As I'm looking at it coming closer, all of a sudden it just disappeares!!, like someone just hit a switch and turned the lights off.  There was no clouds anywhere in the sky.  The moon was up but it was futher to the south.  The sky at the time was i guess what u would call in twilight.  The stars were just starting to appear, dark but not real dark.  Not sure of the time but it was around 1845-1900 hrs. I've seen other things in the sky at night, ISS, meteours, shooting stars etc, but nothing like this object or anything this bright.  I suppose it could have been a drone that someone was flying but at night??, no sound from any props, and the distance this thing traveled from, with one hell of a big light or two.  I don't think so. It just disappeared.  I looked further to the ENE direction to see if it reappeared but nothing.  I continued to scan the rest of the sky in all directions but still nothing more. One min it was there and the next min it just disappeared, gone!!  I'm beside myself cuz i've never seen anything close to what this was. Weird, real strange, WOW!",2016-10-11T00:00:00,41.5183,-72.713

Four identical objects observed Near OAFB by two adults.,Bellevue,NE,2016-10-08T20:10:00,oval,~20 minutes,"Occurred : 10/8/2016 20:10  (Entered as : 10/08/16 20:10) Reported: 10/9/2016 8:19:35 AM 08:19 Posted: 10/11/2016 Location: Bellevue, NE Shape: Oval Duration:~20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/130/S130521.html,"Four identical objects observed Near OAFB by two adults. START TIME:  Approximately 2010 Hrs   END TIME:  Approximately 2030 Hrs  I took my dog out to relieve himself just before going to the store, when I noticed an object with flight characteristics which were not similar to any usual air craft. The object was ovular in shape and had lights that were intermittently visible.  The lights were an orane-red and yellow color (normal aircraft, even military, have green or red on either wing tip).  The object was dark grey in color and seemed to sort of vanish and re-appear suddenly.  The object rotated about 240 degrees along its longitudinal axis while maintaining a steady trajectory from SSW (Somewhere west of Platsmouth) to NNE (towards downtown Omaha/Missouri River).  It is also important to note that the craft was not uniform in shape, as it rotated, it revealed smooth flat sides along the forward and aft sections of this exotic object. I immediately ruled out celestial bodies such as stars, planets, meteoroids and so forth due to the altitude which I estimate was about 5,000-10,000 feet from ground level. The object emitted no detectable sound despite it's proximity and high rate of speed.  I was able to confirm that it was in atmosphere due to the fact that it was passing between the clouds and myself.  I could also rule out any sort of illusion or phenomenon as the object was in plain view the most of the time I was observing it.  When it seemed to vanish, I was still able to predict where it would re-appear and begin tracking it again as it moved steadily. I observed this first object until I could no longer see it all the while, trying to get my wife's attention who was inside getting our kids ready to go.  She finished that about one minute after the initial object disappeared.  After about two more  minutes pass by.  At this time, as we are loading the kids in the truck, both, my wife and I observed a second object matching the description of the first.  This object exhibited the same behaviors and travelled what I perceived was the same route. Upon seeing the second object my wife and I changed our plans and decided to drive around in the rural area two miles south of Bellevue Nebraska.  Upon beginning our drive, going west on Capehart toward 36th Street, we observed two more objects matching the description of the aforementioned, flying on the same path and a similar altitude.  This previously mentioned observation occurred approximately 4 minutes after the second object left visual contact.  Upon driving around in the rural areas we observed no further objects. Additional thought tells me that if there were only two objects, they would have to begin traveling from the point of final visual contact to the point of initial contact at an amazing speed while deviating significantly from their originally observed path.  It is much more probable that there were a total of 4 objects. To the reader:  Be advised that I am a seasoned military member who lives near an AFB.  I see various craft on a daily basis at all hours and during all weather conditions yearly.   While this occurred after sunset, the sky was mostly clear and there was near maximal lighting from the moon.  I am well versed in aircraft and discerning between any sort of optical illusion or phenomena.  Based on these circumstances, I conclude that these were some form of manufactured, atypical craft which were intelligently controlled.  I draw no other conclusions. I attempted to record the second occurrence on my phone but as you can imagine the video quality does not do the event justice.  I do however, still have the video.",2016-10-11T00:00:00,41.13068108108108,-95.92197162162161

Hello,  I was sitting in my ground level apartment this morning at approximately 11 am, when I hear a sonic boom.  I've lived near airports before, so I've heard sonic booms before, but this one was unusually loud and long.  It last approximately 13 seconds, and was done so close to the ground that I could feel it though my wheel-chair.  It’s very unusual for us to have sonic booms where I live, although the Salem airport does have military vehicles, and aircraft, it is located almost directly south from my apartment. The boom had an odd characteristic, I don't know if it’s from how close to the ground it was, but there seemed to be a low level rumble that preceded it by a second or two followed by the usual explosion of sound a boom creates.  From how it sounded it was going from south to north, and as I said it took nearly 13 seconds for the boom to begin to fade.  Unfortunately, I wasn't dressed well enough to step outside to see what created the sound, but I can safely say I've never heard a boom happen like that before. I'm lived in the apartment I'm in for 4 years, and lived around airports most of my life.  I lived near the Salem airport for 7 nearing 8 years, PDX the Portland International Airport for 10 years, and 10 years due west of the Hillsboro airport where the Blue Angels flew overhead during the airshow all 10 years I lived there. I’m no military expert, let me say that out front.  I’ve worked in customer service most of my life, but have seen several different military vehicles living near the airports I’ve lived in, and while I couldn’t ID them, I am familiar with the booms they make.  I’ve never heard one quite like what I heard today between the preceding rumble, the odd vibration to the boom, or the feeling of the chair under me vibrating slightly from it. Hope this helps with all future ventures in to investigations.",2016-11-11T00:00:00,44.9901,-123.0262

I saw a very strong, twinkling spherical light over the woods behind the turbine.  I initially dismissed the object for a star, but quickly realized that it was too bright and moving too quickly at much too low an altitude to be a star.  Having photographed Chinese lanterns before, I knew that this object could NOT be one, because it lacked the proper light diffusion pattern within the object.  The light was also too bright, almost white, and looked solid.  There was also a small airplane flying in the vicinity, at a much higher altitude.  I walked all the way to the turbine, while attempting to get better photos of the object.  I took as short exposures as! possible while also using a tripod. I set the camera on a timed shutter release to prevent motion blur.  It made no noise, and had a flight pattern that was almost completely against the wind at the time (very strong winds on the ground that night,  I had to hold my tripod). I took several photos and am very unsettled by the lack of an explanation.  Zooming in only furthers the mystery and I would like assistance in finding out what this object was.

I was driving on 684 South and immediately upon passing White Plains Airport, after realizing it was a beautiful clear night, I decided to look up into the sky.  After seeing 2 sets of planes that were very close to each other and not making anything of it I saw another object just a little bit above and to the right of the right two planes that were in my field of view.  Staring at this object for the first 10 seconds I didn't think much of it other than that it looked like a plane on it's side.  It was the exact shape of a cross and at the ends of the vertical line which was longer than the horizontal line intersecting right above the middle point, there were two abnormally bright red lights at each end.  On the horizontal line there were smaller white lights on each end.  This very clearly formed a cross shape to any observer who had the same point of view.  My first guess was that it was someone flying a private plane on it's side and was therefore waitin! g for it to eventually turn into the traditional horizontal form that a plane displays. I decided to speed up on the road since this object was just sitting in the sky and looked a little bit bigger than the average size of a visible plane.  Upon making a left turn towards Purchase the object started to move and dropped down rather quickly diagonally to the left and very clearly was heading in the same direction that I was about to.  After making my left turn I sped up and tried to keep up with this light, never once losing sight of it, still having the cross shape and red and white lights.  I realized now that this was definitely very odd and bigger than I would have guessed.  Still, never in my life would I have guessed that I was about to see what I did in about 1- 2 minutes.   As the object started to be buried by the upper foliage of the trees on the right of my road I watched it's light pattern glowing and dipping down suddenly to the right.  At this point I said scre! w it, I'm not going to Purchase, this is weird, I'm going to s! ee what the hell this is if I can.  I sped up as fast as I reasonably could and made the first right that came about on this road.  Finding a right turn I immediately jumped into it and started to slow down so that I could keep track of this glowing light that was still piercing and poking through the foliage of the forest like area of Harrison.  At this point I was driving about 5-10 miles per hour so I could gage where the object was going since I was so worried I was going to overshoot it and miss it forever.  About 10-15 seconds onto this road a car pulled in and I started to have to drive faster since it was tailgating me.  Driving fast and starting to shake a little bit, all the while constantly ducking under the windshield of my car and looking out the left side I kept track of this mysterious light.  Finally after about 15-20 seconds the car behind me made a left turn and I was able to slow back down.  Almost immediately within seconds, on my left the glowing light was seen ! to pierce through the trees and foliage and to my amazement I had a realization that I was going to see whatever this thing was.  Instantly the light got bigger and very red, white and a little bit of yellow, and all of a sudden, so big and boom....right over the trees on my left side...for a solid 2 seconds I saw a massive perfect circular disk with 8-10 massive crystal clear, blue, green, and red circular lights encased within the the circumference of the underside which now covered up about 75 percent of my field of view.  Shaking beyond belief, with my jaw dropped, I had not a single thought other than that I saw a perfect flying saucer fly right over my head as clear as day.  The lights were absolutely huge and the hood of my car and nearby area of the road and trees were lit up in glowing rainbow like colors.  As it passed over me and over the trees on my right I drove faster while simultaneously looking backwards and watched it clear the trees and spin out behind it ! and to the right in a circular motion.  I sped up in my car, r! ealizing this could have been the dumbest thing I've ever done and made the first left turn I found.  While turning around in the cul de sac I immediately grabbed my phone and called my friend and told them to go outside and see if they could see anything, as I was freaking out more than I could ever have imagined in my life.  Darting back up the road I watched the light pass through the foliage on my left side and start to disappear.  Upon getting back to the main road where I initially made the off course decision to chase this thing down, I lost all sight of it for good.  I never once expected to ever see that, and had I known that I would have seen a saucer over my head with perfectly clear colored circular lights in a circle underneath it, I never would have tried to follow it.   I would also like to note that this object made absolutely no sound.  This is singlehandedly the strangest thing that has ever happened to me and I hope it never happens again.

I could see it just above a line of tree tops, moving rather slowly to the north, until it disappeared behind taller trees. In about a minute, maybe less, it appeared again, moving back in the opposite direction. I watched until it again disappeared behind the trees. Its shape was almost oval, except that it was more flat on the bottom, and was raised on the top, which made me think it might have been a disc shaped craft. I couldn’t be sure how big it might have been since I had nothing to use as a reference, and I couldn’t be sure how far away it was, but it seemed to be rather low in the sky moving slowly and I thought maybe it was looking for something.

While the kids were swimming I was laying on my back in the grass.  After a few minutes I observed what looked like a 6 inch soap bubble a hundred feet or so off the ground.   After twenty seconds the object transformed into what looked like a small jet at 10,000 feet more or less.  After fifteen seconds the object became a white dot that faded into the blue sky.  The trajectory of the object was a strait line until it disappeared.  The direction of the object was southerly, toward Point Mugu, which is an area having multiple sightings per month seemingly exiting and entering the Pacific Ocean.   Common thought relates these sightings to the mysterious booming sounds heard centered around Alhambra (LA).  It is hypothesized that an undersurface excavation is occurring under Los Angeles.

Extended UFO Sighting over Burlington International Airport. At Approximately 6:15 PM on Saturday, September 24, 2016, my wife, son and myself were in close proximity to the Burlington International Airport inspecting some commercial buildings in a wide open field.  I am a licensed commercial small UAV (drone) pilot.  And I was scouting the location in preparation for an upcoming drone shoot. We were about a quarter mile west of the airport and I witnessed an airliner making an approach and landing on runway 33—this will be important in a minute. My son is 5 and absolutely loves airplanes.  We routinely drive by the airport and hope to see aircraft take off and land as it’s a thrill for him. As we proceeded to drive over towards the airport my wife and I spotted a slow-moving unidentifiable aircraft coming in towards the airport from the north.  I estimated the aircraft to be at around 2,000 feet in altitude and moving incredibly slow.  This was alarming to me because I made a mental note just a couple of minutes earlier that airliners were utilizing runway 33, which meant that general aviation (small planes) would have been utilizing runway 1. This would have put the unidentifiable aircraft directly into the path of a departing airliner.  As the unidentifiable aircraft was in Class “C” airspace, it would not have been permitted to fly over the airport at an altitude of 2,000 feet, let alone on a heading that put it into the path of departing airliners. By this time, we are at the airport driving through the terminal and my son is enjoying the airliners.  My wife and I are trying to keep track of the unidentifiable craft as it is literally right above the airport STILL at an elevation of around 2,000 feet and moving ever so slowly towards the southeast. We lost the UFO in the clouds and thought that was the end of it. We proceeded to the cell phone waiting area on the north side of the airport where people wait for phone calls to pick up their party.  My wife found the UFO in the sky and it had changed directions completely.  It was NOW heading back the way it came from towards the North West.   I got out of my truck grabbing my cell phone in the process and tried capturing as much of it as I could.  I wish I had better footage to show you, but it’s regrettably not great.  It was already moving too far away.  BUT, the craft had no anti-collision lights.  NO strobe lights.  No noticeable engine sounds.  Far, Far too large to be a drone.  It had a fat oval mid-section, not a long cylindrical aircraft shape. Don’t know…  Thank you!",2016-09-30T00:00:00,44.4524,-73.18410000000002

But, he agreed with me when we talked and he thought about it that there are no towers in that direction.  The location is Macungie, PA just west and south of Allentown, PA.  South Mountain is about 5-8 miles from here so the lights were that far away.  They were probably 10,000 feet high or about that.   My dog did not react to anything outside.  It struck me that as soon as I spotted them and then when I swung my camera in their direction, they disappeared.  It was almost like they knew I was trying to video them.

I had arrived at the park around 20:00hrs and had just begun the workout, doing one sprint, and then while doing the recovery walk back to the starting point, I looked up into the night sky and saw a formation of three objects.  I was facing north, and the objects, numbering three, were flying low, in formation, going from west to east.  These objects were whitish, luminous, but not overly bright.  In fact, if I had not been looking up, it is possible that I may not have noticed them.  The objects were orbish in shape, luminous yet translucent, having a spectral aspect to them, and although the sighting was brief, it caused me to be very alarmed.  The lights did not resemble airplane lights, but had a spectral, unnatural appearance to them.   Alarmed, I walked quickly back to my vehicle and exited the park, as I felt threatened.  They were low and, having read accounts of abduction by ufos, I did no! t wish to be added to the list of abductees.  I was alone in the park, it was very dark, and I felt vulnerable upon seeing these objects.  Also, there was no sound emitted by the objects as they flew overhead.  This encounter left me shaken and anxious.  Early the following morning, before dawn, many dogs in the neighborhood were uncharacteristically barking together.  I was still jittery the following day, and had a very bad night's sleep after this encounter. Although I cannot recall the exact date or time, approximately two or three weeks earlier, my wife and I were returning from grocery shopping one evening, heading northbound on a street in Ingersoll, when we both noticed an unusual object in the night sky. It was approximately 22:00hrs.  The object was an orangish orb, and it was maintaining a steady position approximately 200 feet above a subdivision.  We observed it while driving closer to its position.  I said that we should go into the subdivision so as to get a better look, and when we went into the subdivision, it disappeared from view.  This earlier sighting was approximately one mile north of the second sighting, several weeks later. A few days before this sighting, my oldest son was having a cigarette on the patio before leaving for work in the morning.  It would have been approximately 05:00hrs. While having the smoke, he heard a humming noise in the air above him, although he was unable to see anything that may have been making the noise.  He went inside to tell my wife, but when they went outside together, the humming noise had stopped. As a background, I served four years as an auxiliary police officer and as a part-time jail guard.

While flying quad-copters for the day at a school on Saturday afternoon, I turned to the north and noticed 2 lights in the sky that were distinct from the high clouds.  At first, I believed these to parachutes or para-motor type craft, but was confused, given the fact that the winds were beginning to make our flights difficult on the ground, and when I called attention to it to my friend who was flying quads with me, she too saw the same two craft and we immediately began to try to match it to known aircraft or explanations. The two craft were seen at an elevation of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and were due north of my position.  The craft were moving in relation to one another with the top left craft from my position being brighter while the second similarly shaped craft was less distinct and even somewhat translucent.  After a time the second craft was no longer seen and the brighter and larger craft stayed in view for many minutes.  I attempted to film the craft with my on-board quad-copter camera but the lens for both this and my camcorder I had were not at all appropriate to this kind of a sighting and thus nothing was captured.  In fact, the quad-copter camera mysteriously did not even have a record of the flight even though I had made certain to activate the camera and there was plenty of space left on the SD card!  Early on in the sighting, the two craft were moving quite erratically and in revolutions clockwise around the other as if they were orbiting one another.  My first thought was of a parachutist or para-motor craft in trouble with a bad chute then I realized how high these objects were and that it couldn't possibly be one or more chutes.  We couldn't identify any noise coming from these craft.  The lights were constant in brightness at first and there was no variation until the smaller craft began to fade from view. As we watched, the motion of the bright light transitioned to a smooth rotating motion clockwise and slightly descending to the lower right towards the other object which seemed to rotate with it.  The other object maintained it's distance from the larger during this change of altitude.  When the brighter object suddenly stopped its rotation, the shape for both was seen as a diamond shape for both craft by both of us.  The distinct edges and structure were then apparent and it was obviously a pair of physical objects. The objects were behind the high thin clouds at times (still easily seen through the clouds) and my estimation of their height would be in the thousands of feet in the air. Other conventional aircraft in the air before, during and after the sighting were seen and this was definitely lower than commercial jet traffic but higher than the thin clouds. Given the distance and elevation, these had to be of considerable size. A commercial jet I saw during the sighting at 30,000 feet or so to the west had about the same apparent diameter as the larger bright diamond shape, so the object we were watching would be estimated to have a size approaching 50 to 100 feet as a very unscientific guess. The other object which ""dissolved"" from view was of a smaller size and perhaps was 75% of the size of the larger brighter diamond shape.  I also considered that the sighting might be a jet coming towards me with navigation lights on, but this was ruled out when the slow orbiting motion was observed. No jet or prop aircraft would do this since this would mean a aileron roll to the pilot's left or 45 to 60 degrees (to match what I was seeing) which would then have produced strong movement to the right from my point of view (unless the pilot was doing aerobatics which definitely was not the case here). Additionally, both objects had a long period of hovering in one position coupled with a slow movement to the east by 10 or so degrees over a period of minutes mystified me and made me rule out normal aircraft. I also considered if this was a balloon, blimp, glider or a helicopter. The observation of the two objects satisfied none of these explanations as we both attempted to ascertain what we were seeing.  I also considered astronomical causes. No meteor trail was noted. It was not a planet, since the ecliptic was to my back since I was facing due north during daylight hours. It was not a supernova, comet or any other natural sky-borne phenomena that I have ever encountered. Around 14:05 hours Pacific, I pointed a camcorder towards the object and was marking my position in relation to it.  The sole remaining diamond shape object was clearly visible with only a few whispy clouds near it and I turned the camera away and then back to the position of the object only to find is was nowhere to be seen.  In a matter of seconds, it had vanished. One notable event occurred some minutes afterwards.  A lower altitude Cessna or similar style aircraft that appeared to be completely painted black appeared from the north and at a much lower altitude.  If overflew us directly at an altitude of around 1500 feet and was flying extremely slowly.  I cannot say if this was related, but it certainly caught my interest given the direction of travel and behavior. I have spent a lifetime in around rocket and aircraft systems and have spent 30+ years in amateur astronomy.  I have flown in fighter aircraft as a civilian and know the full range of U.S. and foreign civilian and military aircraft from past and current fleets.  This matched none of the craft or natural astronomical phenomena I have ever seen or have knowledge of.  I cannot say what we saw, but it was certainly an unknown and my hope is that someone else in the area saw it and can add their testimony to the sighting and perhaps identify what it was.",2016-10-27T00:00:00,38.6153,-120.9768

On October 22, at approximately 7:40PM Central standard time, we saw an unidentified flying object (UFO) over our home in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. We were having a campfire in our backyard and I was looking up at the clear, starry sky as we often do.  I stood up to warm myself by the fire and continued to look up at the sky.  About a minute after I stood up, I noticed something strange coming from the west over the trees in our neighbors yard.  When it went over the pine tree in our yard, I said something like ""what is that?"", and my wife and daughter began to look for it.  My wife suggested it might be a meteoroid as there was a shower expected, but then she saw it as well and knew it wasn't a meteoroid.  Shortly thereafter, my daughter saw it as well, and they both saw it long enough to identify it in a way similar to what I was seeing. The best way I've come up with to describe it is like this:  Imagine the night sky reflected in a still, dark pond.  Now imagine dropping a single pebble into this pond and how the waves created alter the reflection of the sky.  The UFO looked like a single one of these waves, but cut into an arc of about 1/4 of a circle, slightly pointed at the center of the leading edge.  As it moved across the sky, it obscured the stars causing a small amount of refraction, with only the leading edge clearly visible.  I'm not sure if the leading edges visibility was due to it emitting or reflecting light, or if it was just a more intense distortion of the night sky. The objects speed and direction was constant, and it moved silently. It's hard to judge the altitude and therefore the size of the object, but it was at least 200 feet above the ground because it was above the trees.  If it was only that high up, then it was approximately 16 feet across from wingtip to wingtip.  The total time the object was visible to me was about 8-10 seconds, in which time it traveled from behind my neighbors trees to behind our house as it moved west to east.  This is a distance of about 50 yards. Jamie and Libby picked up the object as it was about half-way through this path. At first I thought it was an optical illusion, a problem with my vision or perhaps due to me standing up too fast.  I also considered that it could be related to smoke or heat from the campfire.  However my family's observations, and in particular their descriptions matching what I saw (before I described it myself) ruled-out a problem with my vision as the explanation.  The other explanations (smoke, heat) didn't make sense as we continued to see the object long after it was beyond the range of these local effects. Other possibilities we considered were animals.  The general shape was not unlike the V formation birds fly in, but you don't usually see flocks of birds flying at night, and the shape was too smooth to be made up of group of birds.  Also, the effect it had on the starlight isn't something that would be created by flying animals that I'm familiar with. I'm familiar with most civil and military aircraft, and the shape, speed and translucency of the object was unfamiliar to me.  The fact that it was silent would indicate that it was either unpowered, or so far away as to be unheard (which would indicate that the object was of gigantic proportions).  Experimental aircraft may be an explanation as we frequently spot military aircraft flying nearby, and we also live less than an hour from the Oshkosh airport, home of the Experimental Aircraft Association. At this point a clear identification or explanation isn't available.  The most rational explanation I can come up with is that it was some kind of cloaked/stealth glider, using one of the recently described optical cloaking mechanisms.  This would explain the shape, motion and visible signature of the object as well as its silent flight.  That said I've never heard of such a vehicle, and if it were a glider it would have had to have been dropped from an aircraft as there are no natural high elevation points nearby.  It would have also presumably landed within a few square miles, and so far I haven't heard any other reports of the object being sighted in the city of Beaver Dam. There may be other environmental explanations as well.  Being a clear, cold night I'm not aware of any such explanation but I'm hoping that by sharing this story others with more knowledge of the subject can contribute additional possible explanations.",2016-10-27T00:00:00,43.4588,-88.8052

They even move up and down but stay at a close proximity of where they initially begin to hover. They have been doing this that we know of at least a couple a week's ago, but could be longer. We didn't discover then until a drone was spotted at a very visible level after we heard a buzzing one afternoon over the front of our property. Once we spotted it it flew off to the back of the woods . I believe I heard another one flying in the woods on the same day just a few minutes after but never visibly seen it. Another drone, could have been the same one as before was also spotted again flying over the property line as it hovered above tree line. Of course not sure these are related but the drone was what opened our suspicions where we noticed the lights in the sky that are fairly low and definitely not normal. I believe to of seen tiny white droppings of light fall from one of these objects but no one else has noticed and I'm aware because of the creepiness my mind could be playing tricks on me. Although I am a firm believer in UFOs I'm hesitant to say that this could be one because of the fact they appear every night around the same time and they are at a constant hover.

While camping in Loop D of Greenbelt Park, I was awakened by what was the sound of animals walking in the woods surrounding our campsite.  At the time, there were no generators on nearby, no traffic sounds coming from the nearby roadways, and no airplane or helicopter sounds--just the sounds of insects and the continuing sounds of what were probably just animals moving in the woods. While laying awake, though, unable to fall back asleep, an unnatural, pulsating, humming sound grew from among the natural sounds I was hearing.  The sound grew louder and louder, sounding like it was approaching the area in which we were.  It reached such an immensely loud volume that I couldn't believe my wife hadn't awoken.  The overwhelming sound continued at this discomforting volume for what I believe was several minutes. Honestly, I was scared.  I continued laying there in our tent, only looking out the tent's mesh portions we left uncovered for the night breezes and not leaving the tent to actually take a look up or around.  I didn't see anything from inside the tent, but the sound was haunting.  Thankfully, as I thought at the time, the sound receded back into the the more natural sounds of the night, sounding like it had traveled away from the area, and finally leaving me in peace, but unable to fall back asleep for some time. During the entire experience, I had attempted to wake my wife up without being too loud because I didn't want to sound ridiculous.  The following morning, though, she told me she had heard me, but just went back to sleep.  She assured me, however, that she had heard some sort of sound like what I described to her, but in her sleepy state just figured it was a natural, insect-like sort of buzzing.  I've since assured her that it was not.  It was nothing I've heard before, nothing natural, nothing heard any other night during our stay at Greenbelt Park. I reached out to Greenbelt Park via email after returning home from our long drive, as well as to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center via Twitter.  Greenbelt Park has since replied, but had no answers for me, assuring me they would contact me if any information become known to them.

I was tired and leaned onto my railing to rest as I looked up to see what constellations were visible, when I noticed 2 planes( blinking red then white/repeating) that looked as if they were going to run into each other a couple thousand feet above the Gunnison airport, as they approached I could see that one was actually higher than the other and as they crossed over each other I suddenly heard what sounded like a huge muffled blowdryer (air humming or pulsating) and was instantly looking around in the sky directly above my house and didn't see anything at first, but then a huge round, very bright (led light/blueish white, like a star or led) gracefully flew into my sight from my roof area to the northwest of me, maybe only 500 feet above my house heading south as it moved from east to west very gracefully, all at the same time.  When it passed, still heading so! uth, it only made it to a Willow line maybe 1000 ft from my house, at that time I realized I couldn't hear it anymore, freaked out and darted under a porch overhang I have and as I did it literally flew out of view as fast as lighting just to the east of the milky way.  I ran inside freaking out to my spouse, thinking they (who/?) saw me, whether it was government or alien, I don't know but I do know they saw me and I didn't sleep all night, thinking whoever it was was going to come back for me, as stupid as that sounds.  Two days later, Oct. 19th, I'm working near the gunnison airport and hear aircraft, like multiple choppers going all morning but never see anything, so I called a friend who works there and apparently the county is renting out our airport to the British military right now.  I go home, tell my spouse what I found out and that perhaps what I saw was a military aircraft that turned its led lights off and shot a laser beam of its same color toward the milky way, so ! anyone watching would think it was a UFO and that it was gone as soon as I'm telling my spouse this he asks me if what I saw looked like that and we were both watching a repeat of my experience much further away to the south of my porch.

Date 10/20/16   My name is ((name deleted)),  I am 23 years old, I was formally a server trainee at ((restaurant name deleted)) until recently.  I live in Gainesville, Florida, where these sightings take place.   Earlier this evening, at around 10:00 pm 10/19/16, I went outside to enjoy a cigarette and lurk at the stars.  The sky was clear.  Within 5 minutes of being outside I had seen what appeared to me as a satellite.  It was blinking blue and white light and coming from the north heading south.  It was completely silent and too far to be an airplane, also it was moving quite fast.  It went from the north horizon to the south in a matter of about 2 minutes.  I thought nothing of this, I was certain it was a satellite.  I continued to watch the sky, just moments after the first object had disappeared into the distance, I became aware of another blinking light coming from the north heading south.  This light was blinking red and white. It behaved similar to the first object I had seen.  No sound, very distant, yet fast.  Every blinking light I saw after this was red and white. Things became stranger, as I layer out in my front lawn I kept seeing the same blinking object move from North to south like clock work.  As soon as the light had become to distant to see I would without doubt expect to see it reappear in the north again, and it would. I saw what appeared to be the same object fly across the entire sky and reappear close to 20 times.  Each time only taking about 2 minutes to go from one horizon to the other. Then a few minutes later would appear again. At this point I was at disbelief.  My niece who is 21 saw the object I was looking at and reassured me it was a satellite.  I am convinced this is not the case. She was very uninterested. At a certain time during my observation I noticed not 1 but 2 blinking red and white lights within my sight.  There were multiple objects all the same but there is without doubt no way these were in orbit.  There is no way this was of human design.  They would always start north and head south and as I observed it became hard to tell if they where traveling in a straight line or hovering freely.  At one point I took my eyes off the object only to find that when I had looked back it actually had moved further back north in a matter of seconds.  It had jumped from one area of the sky to the other.  I know because it was going behind a tree then suddenly it was visible right above me again. I continued to observe for a couple hours.  Every time I walked outside I could find the blinking light coming from the north.  However they stopped reappearing and it was surprising to me.  I had seen the object nearly 20 times. It seemed around 1:30am the operating time for these machines came to an end. It was hard to see anything besides just the blinking red and white light.  It seemed as if at times the light would become dimmer or more vivid as it moved.  Although I did capture some video evidence I was more focused on observing it with my own eyes.  I managed to obtain 4 short videos of 4 different appearances of this object. In other words I would start recording every time I saw the light coming from the north on 4 separate occasions.  All together I saw this event unfold before me a total of about 20 times. After one too many cigarettes and mosquito bites I decided to write my report and end my observations. personally it seems there were far to many satellites to be satellites at all.  And they reappeared to often to be in orbit. https://youtu.be/gXxK6Rpr7AU  Here is a youtube link of one of the 4 videos.

Friend noticed something odd in the night sky at around 1:50am east of our position. It appeared to be right over Vail, AZ, or our suburb of Rita Ranch.  It was rather odd, when we noticed these three lights, that could form a triangle.  The three lights began to move our direction without breaking formation, and then halted in one spot. It did not move from the position, but instead seemed to blink their lights and stare at us.  I can only assume that they knew of us and watched with caution.  The interesting thing about these lights were that they seem to be blinking in a pattern of sorts, and the left light happened to be the color green, but the other two lights were typical bright star-like lights (although far brighter and clearly closer).  There is no full moon out, nor was it a new moon; the moon was not in my view when looking east toward these lights. The strangest thing was the coyotes were noisy, far nosier than usual.  Typically you may hear a few coyo! tes yipper and howl, but only once in a blue moon (pun intended); this time every coyote was at it.  I thought it may be a party down the wash since it was Fri/Sat, but it was rather late.  Anyways, my friend an I viewed this mystery for a few moments and normally I'm able to point out whether or not it was a plane or helicopter, of course three lights flashing in a strange pattern is a little odd.  The left green light was curious as you never really hear about colored lights unless it pairs with other colors (notably red, because then its a human craft).  The lack of sound didn't help, nor the stationary position it developed.  I wasn't going to wait around any much longer and told my friend to step outside and make sure I enter my house safely (I live across the street in the direction of the mystery), yeah, I was spooked and it was still there when I had entered. I want to point out however that Davis Monthan Air Force Base was to our north and northwest, but what we viewed was directly to the east.

The object appeared to head from Northerly direction east of ELMA to a Southerly direction towards Oakville, over the tops of hills that are about 500 ft in elevation.  After about 3 seconds, it turned to a black color, and dropped in altitude, and became obscured by a closer hill. Never saw object again.  Did not hear any sound. Unable to determine distance and size of object from my vantage point. Speed was significantly faster than a standard prop plane.  Also, there were no noticeable aircraft flying even though there is a small airport nearby, and this is in a flight path for military aircraft as well as SEA-TAC International airport. I've seen many planes, ultralights and helicopters on a near daily basis in the area, over many years, and this was not one of them.

I watched it for about one minute before it started moving erratically at a slow, often jerking motion.  It was moving like a fish or a snake at times, and at others it was hardly moving.  It could make abrupt 180 degree turns and other maneuvers not possible with today’s modern aircraft.  With some binoculars, it looked like a single bluish white light with the intensity of a bright star.  Broken high altitude clouds were moving thru the area and its light would be obstructed as it flew thru or above the clouds.  It appeared to be at or just above the clouds as its light would dimly reflect off the clouds. 	I first saw the light around 9:20 p.m. Alaska Standard Time.

I was looking further across where the cloud came from and then I saw another cloud coming that was similar to the one we had initially seen.  This cloud, however, seemed to grow in size significantly as it left our view.   At this time, I noticed a small black dot which I had first nearly disregarded as being a bird.  Upon closer inspection of it, I noticed that it had a light that blinked, which then made me think it must be a plane, but I noticed that there were no wings whatsoever, and then I saw the glint of the sun off of the right side of it revealing it as a perfect sphere.   I tried to point it out to my girlfriend, but before I could get her eyes on it it had moved behind a tree out of sight.  I have never reported nor SEEN what I believe to be a UFO and I am a Marine Corps veteran, fully aware of most aircraft that should be flying in the sky.   I hope this report can be useful to anyone else who may have seen what I saw over Brooklyn near Avenue M and Ocean Avenue is my general vantage point of the sighting. The best description of the object I can give is that it appeared dark, as it first appeared to me to be a black dot.  It was metallic in nature because I saw that it had a metallic type reflection, once the sun glinted off of it.  It was perfectly spherical and had a white blinking light that went off periodically with absolutely zero sound accompanying it.  It was not very flashy at all very basic seeming.   The most bizarre thing to me was that I think it may have been generating its own form of cloud cover, as the clouds that were very nearby it seemed to be growing in size in a very unnatural seeming way that I had never witnessed before.  I was unfortunately unable to grab my camera in the timeframe of the sighting due to it only being visible from where I was for a very short period of time, I didn't even have enough time to get my girlfriend's eyes on it before it moved out of sight.",2016-10-11T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The dusky light made it difficult to discern an actual shape.  There were three lights on the object; one on the nose of bright white magnitude -7 appearance, one at each ""wingtip"", port side red, starboard side amber, each of similar magnitude to the front light.  At first the object seemed to be a fighter jet at an approximate altitude of 500 ft traveling directly over the suburb of Goleta.  It traveled over the top of our vehicle on a banked trajectory at which point I told my daughter to look up and out of her side window.  She immediately located the object and noticed that only the wing lights remained visible but in a matter of seconds appeared white in color.  There were no flashing lights.  The object's trajectory became due north and, instead of planing off as a typical jet aircraft will do, the object seemed to maintain a strait line up at about 10 degrees and continued due north becoming seemingly a hundred miles away in a matter of thirty more seconds or so.  It eventually curved a bit before disappearing still well above the northern horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I stood and watched a moment.  I immediately noticed that it was barely moving---  way slower than a jetliner would be going......  it also appeared very bright and large as well.   I had binoculars just inside the door of my shop.  I grabbed them and watched the object.  (7x50)    It showed to be perfectly spherical and a bright white light evenly distributed over the surface.  The light was a pure white-- not the red-orange that is reflected off satellites just after dark.  It seemed to be moving very slowly across the sky.  Jupiter (or Saturn) was just setting in the western sky--- and the object was was about 1 to 2 times the diameter of the planet.   The objects speed seemed to vary from very slow to all most stopped. Judging by the very slow speed --- a satellite at that slow speed would have to be several thousand miles out to go that slowly----  and to have THAT angular diameter at that distance---  it would have had to be many miles across. However I don't believe it was a satellite- as it was the wrong color and the brightness did not decrease as it went off zenith towards the far horizon as a satellite would have.  I watched it from just north of zenith at about a  020 compass heading------ and  ended at about 150 degrees near the tops of the far pine trees. I estimate I watched it through about 60 degree arc ------ and  for about 2 to 2.5 minutes through that arc.   I watched it move very slowly along the above path.  as it approached the top of the trees to the south-east----  it slowed to nearly a stop---- and then it changed direction to going straight down and behind the trees.  I did not see much decrease in brightness except that would be consistent with the object getting farther away gradually.  It did not ""wink-out"" like satellites do ( which they do long before they get near the tree line)  I am a physicist by degree and have piloted airpcraft.  The object had NO navigation lights of any kind and no tail beacon.  The light did not have the look of a bulb ( a tiny point) either a nav light or a landing light. I compared its color to several passing airliners which were about 10-20 miles away. The aircraft's white lights were more orange than the object.   It was a bright white sphere with the illumination evenly distributed across the whole surface. there seemed no way to estimate how high it could have been.

At first I thought it was a vehicle shining lights on the trees or the barn, but longer I looked the more I realized it wasn’t a vehicle. I could never really see the source of the lights as there is a tree line between our properties, but they were in multiple places in their pasture and beyond to the woods behind their property.  I could catch a glimpse of some sort of white light moving about.   They must have been staying close to the ground because they kept up- lighting the trees. The lights turned on and off, sometimes fading out, sometimes shutting off like someone threw a switch.  They moved around, they made no sound.  One thing I did notice was right above that area was some small lightning bolts every now and then. There was no thunder. When I looked up all I saw were stars.  We did have storms come through although not until after sunrise. I watched the lights for more than 3 hours.  I was moving from window to window trying to figure it out.  I woke my husband up to look at them.  He did see them and went back to bed.  I was too worried to go back to sleep and too afraid to wander onto their property alone to try to get a better look. I went up to check with the neighbors (after sunrise) and they heard and saw nothing.  They were in bed. After I thought about it, I believe I saw those lights once before.  I wrote it off as the neighbor being out on his tractor late at night.  I guess it wasn’t so.

I am a veteran of the military and an amateur astronomer so I am pretty good at aircraft identifications and where lights should be in the sky.  Last night, 09/25/2016, at approximately 20:15 I saw what looked to be a triangle shaped craft over the city of Eugene, Oregon. I had just stepped out on my balcony for a smoke and sat down in my chair facing East overlooking most of NE Eugene and N Springfield.  Looking in the sky above and well beyond the neighbor's house at the sight line of the power lines I saw 3 orange lights equidistant apart and in a triangle.  It occurred to me that there shouldn't be bright stars in the sky in that area that time of night and time of year so I  looked closer. As I  looked closer, I saw the bottom most of the lights moving and then I thought to myself:  that makes sense it is commercial aviation.  So I looked back at the other 2 lights and saw they were moving together too and that it was one triangle shaped craft rotating on its center axis.  All the while I noticed the bright orange lights were shining through what looked like heat shimmer coming off the desert floor. Very much like a scene from the movie, ""Predator,"" the ""cloaking"" around it wavered for just a brief second and when it did I saw a large triangle shaped craft with smooth sides and a smooth metallic bottom with a smaller circular abutment in the center with a light bluish glow.  The craft stopped rotating and it looked like a harrier jet pulling up its nose on a vertical takeoff and then it disappeared.  It did leave but as it was leaving the ""cloaking"" kicked back in and it disappeared from sight. Like something out of the X files 2 helicopters showed up within 30 seconds of the object disappearing.  Eugene is a small city and helicopters are fairly rare here with just a couple of overflights a day but these stayed on station for the better part of an hour circling over the Eugene/Springfield area.",2016-09-30T00:00:00,44.039544983277594,-123.12515735785954

At about 8:45, my friend pointed out some lights in the sky.  They were about 50.  They were in a loose formation that resembled birds flying in a flock.  They weren't blinking or flashing.  However, they were dimming and brightening at regular intervals.   The color of the lights was a blue-white and made me think of glow in the dark.  The reason I say they weren't blinking or flashing is because the way the lights dimmed and brightened looked like something was alternately blocking and then not blocking the light.  It looked like birds flapping their wings.   The lights moved slowly but at a constant speed.  When a helicopter flew in to the University hospital, it appeared to startle the lights, because the stragglers moved a little faster and the lights in the middle of the formation moved faster and clumped around the lights in the lead.  The lights continued on a straight northwest path until they faded from view.  The whole thing lasted about 10 minutes.  We didnt lose sight of them becuase of the hills behind the concert venue. We lost them because they went beyond the horizon.  They weren't planes: planes do not fly in formation that close and these lights had no blinking red lights.  They weren't birds becuase they were flying too high and this is the same reason they weren't balloons.  Also, they were too many and the sun had set over an hour earlier.  People around us were all trying to get pictures but the distance and low lights made our phone cameras useless.   After the concert, I asked the two officers at the exit if they had seen the lights as well. They both said yes, that neither of them had ever seen that before, and that they didn't know what it was either. We discussed this with our friends as we drove home.  We concluded that it couldn't  be remnants of the Chinese rocket because they weren't falling toward Earth but appeared to be traveling around it and the lights never sh! ot like meteors.

Every night at about 10pm I step outside for a cigarette and to see the Texas stars. Tonight, some sort of craft, which literally had no sound flew in an odd pattern overhead. Large planes, small private craft, and at times helicopters fly over, but obviously they all have sound.  This was some sort of aircraft with a lit arc on top that was visible, with about 3 to 4 spread out lights underneath that appeared to be rotating.  I was in the USAF – and I’ve NEVER seen a craft like that, whether from the flightline or up in the sky. Plus the flight pattern was extremely swift and “rounded” without any sound.  It actually made me feel strange to watch it…like a sinking feeling - I’ve never experienced that with visualizing aircraft before. The arced light was like a constant bar/stream, and the lights underneath were rotating.  It wasn’t a toy, because I work in advertising, and I know what toy or drone craft look like.  So for me, this was something completely unidentifiable/odd/unknown.  Out in Springtown, if it were of conventional technology, I would have heard some sort of noise from the aircraft –but it was silent. It flew in like a slingshot style of pattern – not a conventional straight overhead pattern.  The lights never “tilted”.

On Sunday, September 25, 2016, I was in my backyard and saw a bright object in the sky and  went into the house and told my wife that there was a drone flying over our yard.  It looked to me to be about 600-700 feet in the air, above the mesa behind us.  I watched it move slowly along the mesa from west to east until it was out of sight. The following day, Monday, the object appeared again but was higher in the sky.  My wife came out to look at it, and I called some neighbors also.  This was approximately 3:30-4:00 pm.  One neighbor had a rifle with a high-powered scope, and some binoculars.  He said that the object was definitely not a drone, but looked like a disk.  He described the object as having a red light and was glowing.  His estimate was the object was at about 1500 feet.   He apparently took photos, but unfortunately he left town for his work, and we do not have access to his photos yet. I took pictures with my everyday camera but there is not a really good shot.  The object appeared to change shape from round to triangular.    I found an old pair of binoculars that were water damaged. I did manage to get a better look.  My wife and I both saw the object as a glowing orb; it was luminescent and slowly shifted its shape and colors.  Our small camera picked up bright pink “auras” or “energy waves,” which were also sometimes visible to the naked eye. At one point a low-flying jet appeared out of nowhere, and not on a regular flight route or elevation. It looked almost like two aircraft were flying together, one just above the other.  A few minutes later, another plane flew by.  My wife describes them as “ghost” planes, because they were  so out of place and looked like they were in a haze. The object moved slowly, almost imperceptibly, towards the west and the setting sun.   When the sun disappeared behind the mesa, the object remained in the same place above the mesa.  I made a small fire and stayed outside well after dark to watch the object.   Around 8:15 pm, I saw it become slightly larger and brighter, then it suddenly extinguished.    My wife and I are over 60 years old, and neither of us has  seen anything like this ever.

As we approached the Bull River Bridge on Highway 80 we could see a bright red ball high in the night sky.  My wife noticed it first and attempted to point it out to me.  I glanced up and saw it as well. It took a moment for us to orient ourselves to its height in the sky.  Within a second it disappeared completely from our view.  I noted that there was another aircraft in the sky…something that looked to either be civilian or military. As we passed over Bull River Bridge onto Wilmington Island, we noted that the second aircraft that we saw seemed to be roaming the sky and not on any particular trajectory. It should be noted that the red ball also did not have a downward trajectory.  From what I could tell the movements were subtle or stationary as it glowed and then disappeared…therefore it did not seem to be a meteorite. This was a brief sighting so it would be difficult to speculate on what the object could have been, but the situation was odd to us, nonetheless.

I needed to slow it down and watch it over again (which I did about 20+ times) at about 1/6 of the normal speed and pausing at different times.  I noticed at this 1/6 speed that it was on camera for less than 2-3 seconds total which indicated to me that its speed was unbelievably fast.

Unfortunately, yet very awkwardly, is the fact that this airport is approximately 10-15 miles from providence and in the same direction of this probable aircraft, however I do know for a fact that given its speed it was NOT coming in for a landing and it was definitely NOT some plane taking off as I have seen 100's of planes do both of these and this aircraft was flying at extremely High rate of speed that I can't even explain in words.

We then saw a few more less bright ""moving stars"" following behind.   I pointed them out to my friend because he didn't think the first one was a craft saying stars move.  I explained that they don't move like that.  '' About a minute later, we saw another six crafts in a different formation.  I commented that they are really moving under the cover of the clouds in our area.  When I scanned the sky again I saw two crafts in front of the original very bright craft that initially caught my attention.  I have seen many crafts moving in the sky, but never this many - this close together.  My friend said they were likely planes.  I explained planes do not fly that high.  Possible that they could be drones operated remotely, but I do not think this many in these particular formations or! at these speeds.  Possible that it could be satellites but again not in these formations moving at these speeds or this many at one time.  The crafts were moving from North Easterly to South Westerly direction.

The ceiling was low due to rain clouds.  This also prevented any visual confirmation.  The sound was loud and intense.  I judge that based on how long it took, it must have been a slow craft.

As I looked up at about 15 degrees, I observed a single star which appeared to be of great distance due to it's brightness.

Being in the seattle area I am able to identify every aircraft day or night by its light patterns.   tonight I was in my work parking lot near the auburn park and ride.  My attention was first brought to a craft which lights were similar to but not consistent with any craft I have seen hovering over the sky about in the airspace of fife, WA.  After just a few moments of watching the solid red, blue, and white lights I noticed there were too many white lights and suddenly the red and white lights were eminating its source outward toward the sky around it.  They were red and white lights almost pulsating and changing direction much like a a police car pulling over a car.  Now I first tried to see whether it was in fact airborne as I live in the valley.  I was hoping that perhaps it was high on a hill, however it was not. After about 5 mins of watching these pulsating lights (which as a result looked as though the craft was elongated or disk shaped) its colors changed to solid white and blinking red like an FAA approved aircraft. It began to move north west in the directing of the olympic pennisula rather that the sea tac airport as I would expect such an aircraft to do. Ill be honest in all of my days observing aircraft day, night, shipboard, on land, and at sea I was frightened and concerned for the aircraft I could see preparing to land at sea tac. It maintained the same altitude while it moved from its hovering position with a slight decent maybe 1 or two degrees which is consistent with a craft going further from view. It was dark, but I have never seen an aircraft emminate that many lights so irradically. I hope that you people can maybe try and find a logical explination for this. Yes I know it was dark, yes there is airtraffic for both lewis/mcchord and seatac however this wasnt any aircraft light pattern I have ever seen. I sho! uld have recorded it however the truth is the resolution would! nt have been ideal at the distance i was from the object. I wish I would have, but i was focused on gathering all information i could to reject the fact it was a ufo.",2016-09-09T00:00:00,47.29995649484537,-122.18088288659793

We're new to the neighborhood, so we are diligent about opening and closing the door silently as not to disturb the neighbors who often have their windows open during the warm summer months. Being a sound engineer, I immediately noticed a deafening quiet that was unmistakable to me.  No crickets, no wind, no cars, nothing. I whispered ""Wow, it's really quiet out here. A little too quiet"". My wife said nothing. It was dark enough so that you could not see the sky behind the trees. I realized we had a huge moon the night before, so the 'no moon' darkness had struck me as weird. Elapsed time we were outside was about 2-3 minutes.  We were both facing west toward our neighbors house when we both saw a single spherical light appear, with no dynamics in luminosity. Nothing at first, then right to full-on brightness. The singular amber / orange glow was the same exact color as the street lamp but much brighter, and the shape was spherical instead of oval, about the size of a baseball or softball.  The street lamp seemed to be about 10+ feet directly behind the object we saw.  The object kept an altitude approximately 5 feet below the street lamp from our perspective. The glowing sphere never stopped moving at any point since it appeared. It moved at about the speed of a house fly, in a perfect counter-clockwise circle, with a slightly accelerated figure 8 pattern every few revolutions.  The object moved in a circle pattern that was about 2 feet in diameter.  It left a trail of light behind itself in the same color that faded linearly, but was overrun by the sphere again before the light trail fully dissipated. I whispered, ""Do you see that?"". Standing slightly in front of me, my wife leaned toward my viewpoint on the patio and said, ""Yea, what is that?"".  It seemed that once this object felt us notice it's presence, it disappeared with no fade, instant off and gone.  The object was gone even before I could open my Camera app. I noticed some trees between the object we saw and our patio. So I waited until daylight this morning to see if it could have been street lamp light refracting off of a bunch of shiny leaves, but there are barely any leaves to obstruct the view apparently.  We never saw anything block the perspective of the object while it appeared and danced for approximately 15-20 seconds in total. After it disappeared, I came to my senses and opened my Camera app. I was surprised to see a Camera flash to our far right from across the street.  I was sure the neighbors saw the object too and were taking a photo, while forgetting to disable the camera flash.  When I looked over, I saw another 5000k temp flash in the gloss of the neighbors car, but no light hit the street or tree next to where the source would be.  Neighbors were asleep with all lights off an nobody was outside at all. No activity so far yet tonight.  But I will be ready for it next time.",2016-09-15T00:00:00,42.5899,-71.9887

I noted that it was about the same brightness as the surrounding stars except that it was moving across the sky at the speed of the usual satellite in a SW direction. When it was aligned in front of and above me, at about 95-100 degrees, it appeared to suddenly shoot straight down towards me at a high rate of speed growing larger and brighter (bright white) the closer it came, maybe to about 10x the size it had been, not any larger than a dime.  I thought to myself that if it continued in that direction it might hit me.  Then about ½ way down it suddenly reversed direction and went back up to the approximate altitude that it had been, continuing on its course in approximately the same SW direction.  The up and down trajectory lasted not more than a second or two.  A friend of mine was walking towards me, from behind, whe! n I exclaimed, Whoa! in regard to the object coming towards me.  He did not see the object until I pointed it out after the fact. So what he saw looked like a normal satellite traveling across the night sky.  We watched the object as it continued SW with no more unusual activity.  So what was the object: a military hologram, an ET spacecraft, something going on with my eyes (doubtful), or what?

I went outside still on the call with the individual I was speaking with.  I came out the garage looking west across the street, and witnessed the lights in the sky that were over South Mountain from our driveway I could look West and over the garage and the neighbor's house you can see the orbs that were flashing in the sky they would get brighter and then diminish in brightness.   I got off of phone.  I opened my video camera on my phone and started getting what I could of what I was seeino.  It was pretty amazing.  I've never seen anything like that ever!  5 orbs all hovering in the sky.  Together not moving.  In a second at 2216 the orb on south side of group vanished.  At that point there was now 4 of them together in the sky 3 looking like a stoplight figuration stacked and then one look as it was moving towards the Southwest because it got smaller and higher and then you can still see there was three that still look like they were stacked on top of each other and the way that they were stacked it didn't look like they could be aircraft at least not commercial planes anyhow.  Tthen two proceeded rather quickly to continue out into the North Area of the sky ratherrather.  They just went out of eye sight. the other one just kind of hovered in the air and then went up and disappeared. that I got  on video.  for a while you could see it flashing different colors before it was gone.  Then, I looked to the north again.  Out of nowhere there were 2 very bright light that flashed and they look like they were hovering in one spot their brightness was very noticeable.  Much like dimmer switch. they were in one spot then would separate. and then they proceeded to get even brighter and I was able to get that on my camera then I came back to look in the same spot over across the street in the sky.  And it was back!  Bright and it looked like it was getting closer and bigger and brighter and then it started to get smaller as it look like it was climbing in elevation on a 60* angle, across the sky coming towards the east.  It moved across the sky above our north  corner of the house out here in Apache Junction I watched it come all the way from the other side of the valley over South Mountain toward my home, and its lights just disappeared.  The lights cut smaller as it got closer and went up.  There was no sound no nothing. It was gone like it went right up.  Nothing like an aircraft when it goes by over head, you hear jets.  I was coming back in and then all the sudden I heard this loud deep rumbling and you couldn't see lights or anything just a odd void.  I have it on video.  Then I started looking up airport flights etc to rule out planes.  I could not believe I witnessed this.  I began to fill out report sitting on my truck when my neighbors friend walked over asking what that noise was.  He was waiting smoking a cigarette, and asked if I seen the weird lights. and then I heard that odd deep rumbling again.  The guy was looking around to see where it was coming from.  He could not see anything nor could I.  That was at 2249..I was working on report so I looked at time on phone.  I and this other guy witnessed a black void go across the sky fast towards the east like the other one.  Only a little further north. It looked to be above the houses next to field.

After the third such occurrence in an estimated 15 minute window, I exited my house and attempted to locate the source of these aural events.  Upon looking to the northeast sky, I observed two slow moving, flashing red lights in what appeared to be a loose, staggered formation traveling away from my location in a northeast direction.   The lights pulsed with only a saturated red color in a slow, steady pattern, similar to a communications tower at night.  They were quite intense, despite the perceived distance but were not blinding--certainly brighter than any aircraft I've witnessed.  The lights also flashed in perfect unison with each other but, given the distance separating them in the sky,  I have no reason to believe they were in fact attached to the same craft.

I was able to watch it for about 2-3 minutes before it became obscured by trees. I rode on approaching the west side of the I-35 overpass, and came to a high, open spot giving me the opportunity to see the ball of pulsating light again. It hadn’t moved, changed size, or direction in the 3-5 minutes since I had seen it last.

About 10 p.m. on the night of Sept 27, 2016, I was in my back yard smoking a cigar and watching the sky when I noticed an orange reddish light to my West to a little Northwest streaking down from high in the sky to down low in the horizon.  The object began to move back and forth in a way that was not conventional away from me until I could no longer see it.   Then another identical light streaked down and did the same thing as the first light and after I could no longer see that one a third one streaked down and did the same as the first two, each time this happened it took maybe 10 seconds each at most from streaking down, dancing and disappearing.  Then I saw nothing for about 10 seconds and I threw down my cigar and rushed into my house to get my phone to see if I could get any video of this.   I ran back outside into my back yard and waited about 1 minute and the light returned but this time suddenly appearing motionless like a star in the horizon and then moving down low like before but instead of moving into the distance away from me the light danced up and down and back and forth sometimes appearing in two places at the same time. I tried to shoot video but I can see nothing on it but lights from a manufacturing plant across the street and some traffic.   After about 15 minutes I then noticed to my Southwest a group of 3 white lights appear and streak across a small portion of sky and immediately followed by small groups of white lights moving streaking sideways across the same small portion of sky sometimes as many as 5 at a time in some weird formation.  I thought theses lights were a long way from me maybe around 10 miles out but then one moved between me and a telephone pole that was only 30 feet away from me.  I thought at first that my eyes were playing a trick on me so I moved away from the pole and only one of the white lights to my Southwest moved and for about 15 seconds stayed between me and the pole.  This scared me sli! ghtly so I moved completely across my back yard to put some distance between me and the light which and I tried to get my neighbor up to have a second witness but she was in bed.  In the meantime the orange reddish object is still doing the same thing as before but now there is one white light with it and they dance up and down and back and forth sometimes appearing as 4 or 5 objects at one time and then quickly back to two one on the left was white the one on the right was orange reddish.  If all that was not strange enough for a few minutes these lights mimicked my movements both up and down and back and forth, this further scared me but I am a muscular masculine man who will not scare easy but that was weird.  I am 51 years old and have been a sky watcher since I was a child and I have witnessed some things that were hard to explain but with proper homework I have explained every weird thing I have ever seen in the sky until last night.  I tried to convince myself of drones, birds, bugs, laser pointer and even cobwebs but this was none of these things.",2016-09-30T00:00:00,32.59603047619048,-83.63209333333333

At approx 5:45am, whilst out walking my dog with my wife before we set off on a trip to Angelsey in North Wales, we noticed some rather strange flashing in the sky to the South of Shrewsbury about one mile South of coordinates 52°41'16.4""N+2°43'58.4""W.  We were walking on a field that between the edge of town and the A5 bypass, the sky was very clear and we could clearly see the Orion and the Plough constellations.   Whilst standing and looking at these my wife and I both noticed two large solid black triangle shapes appear over the hedge line to the South moving slowly.  As they approached us, I would estimate that they were approx the same size as an RAF Hercules transport plane, and they both made a slight humming sound at around 500ft altitude.  The slowly came across the top of the field when they both started to fire red/orange lasers down onto the ground from the front of them.  The laser made a crackle as it hit the ground so our dog and us we clearly scared and decided to run back towards Oteley Road and Rowton Road area.  The two triangle craft then moved above us and the humming was really clear but the lasers then shot down onto number 8 Rowton Road and made the roof glow a redish colour.  Three cars stopped on the road and saw what we were looking at with one female driver getting onto her mobile phone to make a call.   Suddenly, both triangle turned on their axis in a 360 degree fashion and after moving forward a little tilted and shot straight up into the sky.  There was another flash and then they were both gone!  We called the polcie who met us at 6:30am but they said it was just aircraft from the local airbase as there had been a nightime exercise taking place a few hours earlier.  We specifically argued the point about the red/orange lasers but they said it must of been a reflection off street lights!   I can tell you now that they were in no way any reflection and having spent 20 years in the RAF myself these were no aircraft I knew of!.   This was a strange thing to witness and we have contacted the local press who have said that some other people had seen the same things in the sky but South of Shrewsbury over a village called Cound.

I am a retired community college instructor with an engineering background.  I have an interest in astronomy and have built several telescopes. From 9 pm till 9; 15, I watched a very bright light (brighter than any star or planet) shimmer and vibrating low in the western sky.  I live 30 miles east of Asheville.  It never changed position and finally set with the surrounding stars beyond the horizon.  I am an amateur astronomer and have never seen any star or planet this bright.  The light flickered and shimmered but the surrounding stars did not.  It was a very clear calm night, no moon, with the Milky Way quite bright.  Associated with this light were smaller red, green, and blue lights that detached themselves slightly at times,  The little lights seemed to blink very fast (faster than aircraft lights). The phenomenon seemed to be very far away and beyond the distant mountains a mile distant.  It was unlike any light I have ever seen in the sky.  It was unlikely to have been aircraft landing lights because it was stationary for over 15 minutes.  As it set with the surrounding stars, I watched it through binoculars and it did not move in relation to the horizon.  Even with the glasses, I could see no physical object but I clearly saw sparking, shimmering, and smaller flashes of color (almost as if it was emitting sparks). It set with the stars without changing its position with them. Note; Venus and mars had also set in the west, just after sunset (hours earlier).  There were no other bright stars in the low western sky at the time of the sighting.  It was a clear calm night. I live far out of town in a rural area (I cannot see any other lights or houses from my home). I enjoy a great unhindered view of the night sky.

I was driving from Stephenville to Fort Worth.  It was a clear night without any clouds or rain. I was on I-20 heading East.  On the eastern horizon I saw a bright blue flying disk heading towards me and flying directly over the road.  It was flying very high at a planes altitude.  Slightly  lower and to the right of the blue flying saucer was a small plane. The small plane had a red light on the left wing and a white light on the right wing.  The plane's lights were flashing lights on both wings.  It was much smaller than a commercial plain.  It was triangular shaped and flying at a plane's speed while following this blue flying saucer.  It was not directly behind it but flying slightly lower and to the right of it.  The plane did follow the flying disk, going the exact same route. The bright blue flying saucer was twice as large as the plane and flying higher.  It was as bright as a star and was flying incredibly fast.  The saucer came from the East and was directly heading West.  It seemed like it was going as fast as a shooting star, but it had no light trail or haze.  The saucer flew directly parallel to I-20.  I watched it directly pass over me threw my sun roof.  I saw the bottom of the flying saucer.  It apeared to be a perfect circle with a clearly defined blue rim.  Even though it was very bright it was not fuzzy around the edges like a light or a star.  The saucer kept the perfectly defined circle shape.  It flew at an impossible speed, making it from as far as I could see on the Eastern horizon to the Western horizon behind me in 1 to 2 seconds.  The small plane followed behind it but at a much slower plane speed.  The flying saucer flew in a straight line.

I am ex Navy and stationed on the USS Midway back in te mid 80's.  I worked on the flight deck identifying aircraft so they could set the arresting gear for the correct plane landing (I know my aircraft) - you use the color and shape of the pylons on the aircraft to identify it.  This was way slower and way lower than a regular plane would fly. It was much smaller too.  Perhaps 800 - 100 ft up and maybe 20' - 25' long.  Listen, they were on a flight pattern almost right above, not in complete uniform but close.  The 3rd or 4th one was right overhead in fact my wife grabbed my arm as I joked that if these are real UFO's one might beam me up and she was deathly afraid that it might. I got to see inside it pretty well.  It looked to me like the outside was opaque (see thru) down the middle inside was a dark (spine or pencil) running the length of it.  Imagine the top 3rd of a Christmas tree looked like the propulsion as it was glowing, mainly orange, red. It looked like it was on file but a controlled fire that never got out of control.  Heck, I did a lot of research and many say it's those Chinese lanterns.  No, waaaay to big and at the end. First 3 or 4 came, than the other 4 about 5 -7 minutes later.  There was also the 9th UFO? that stayed out a distance that never came to close to recognize the color or shape.  You see, I like fairly close to O'Hare and the flight pattern is pretty similar location and we were seeing lights and after a while they would get closer and you could make them out but the 9th UFO? never got too close or on the flight pattern of the regular aircraft. It was close, I mean close enough and closer than the videos I see on you tube for me to see inside and make it out really well.  Funny thing was it was a rather calming experience.  I mean if you were to tell me that I would see a UFO I would normally be afraid and here I was looking at what I think were UFO's and I wasn't scared.  Like I said I went underneath and said ""go ahead and beam me up!""  I just never felt that it was threat to us. I believe it was unmanned?  Not sure if unmanned is right word there?  Anyway, I believe it was just gathering information. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Hi Peter, Not many clouds in the sky as it was pretty clear on 8/20/16 in Chicago. The altitude of the few clouds were at least twice that of the ufo's. I don't know how to triangulate altitude but I do know from just checking google images of pictures from 1000' altitude that that is really close to the height (perhaps less and 800' is probably closer). Our location seeing this was Hermosa Park. If you do a quick google or view of the park we were in the field between the baseball field and the playground. The formation came from the baseball field to the playground which is from West to East (Lake Michigan is due East). I just wish like a computer my memory from this event could be accessed so you could see what I saw.. I did some research after seeing this (after checking to see if I could find other reports about this particular incident) and found this to be the closest thing to what I saw - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2ppoJIexY. The only difference was my vantage point. We were probably 3 times closer than his view, right underneath the flight pattern. Crazy thing to me was after researching the internet was seeing so many reports of similar sightings. I would've just brushed these people away myself before this happened as I'm a see it to believe it kind of person but I can tell you I'm a believer now! I really not sure how to contact the local press about something like this but myself or my wife are not afraid to say what we saw. We are very straightforward people with no agenda so if I'm contacted I will talk but I'm probably not going to seek out any press myself. I'm willing to continue any dialog about this Peter, as I'm still so curious as to what this was?!  Let me know any thoughts or if you have a similar report from others.  This happened in Chicago on a Saturday night in the summer in a busy area!!!  Someone saw something that we did I can tell you that.

My boyfriend and I honestly felt crazy,, and were not going to post anything, until we saw a startlingly similar sighting in our town, same area *the beach,* at nearly identical time, August 19th, around 12:50 am and on. We walked down to the beach and sat by the water, we are sitting now and see to our right (about 150 yards away) a white blinking light close to the ground, running uncomfortably fast towards us.  We had our dog, a Doberman, and assumed maybe it was a puppy with a blinking collar for night time.  Regardless, it freaked me out a bit an we ran back to our beach access (approximately 0.3 of a mile).  When we felt we were at the safety of our access and close to our home, we turned around and saw not just one blinking light, but now two.  Sprinting from the shore all the way to the top of the beach, back and forth at insane speed.  The blinking lights are going into the water-about 5 yards, and seem to have no trouble sprinting back and forth without stopping.  At this point, we realized their speed and how the second light came out of nowhere, it could not be dogs. At this point, I was very uneasy and told my boyfriend I would like to go home.  He insisted on watching and figuring it out.  When I told him again I was leaving, the two blinking lights shut off.  After 3-5 seconds of darkness, the lights come back on but now there are more, maybe 5 separate sources of these blinking lights, running quickly from the shore to the top of the beach. We turn around to go home and DIRECTLY in front of us, 100 yards AT MOST, and 3 stories high there is a bright orange/yellow LARGE light (looked like it could have been a plane) until it began rushing towards us and would change speed-when we turned around it was racing towards us but when we saw it, immediately slowed.  It was directly over us at a point and there was a white light in the middle of it reflecting down over us.  We looked where it originally seemed to be speeding from, and there WAS a small smoke trail.  We started screaming and ran back to the street.  We tried understanding what it was, but couldn't.  There was no start or end to the object-it was glowing, it had a glowing aura about it.It made no noise whatsoever.  It was right above us and we hard nothing. Neither of us were intoxicated and we consistently walk the beach at night as we live so close. We have never seen anything like this. When we were on the street, we looked back at the apartment building and could see the object hovering over the beach access where we left.  Literally just hovering.  As we were running home, it would go behind the building so we couldn't see it, but peek back out the same side. It did this 2-3 times and disappeared, not coming back out from the apartment building again. I'm not sure if these are unrelated experiences, but at the time it felt the blinking lights were distraction to turn around and have this terrifying, unidentified object so close to us....

They looked like a football on its side.  If I could describe it, I would say it looked as if they were showing each other their moves or just taking turns. My first impression was that the sunlight was reflecting off this ""thing"" as to why I looked up. So as I was on the phone, I started to look where the sun was located. The sun was located over my right shoulder and house. However it wasn't a constant reflection. It seemed as if it was rotating sideways and every time it rotated, it would reflect or flash. I cut my conversation short with my Dad and told him that I needed to record something that was happening right before my eyes. They looked like 3D objects. As I am making sure my eyes were not deceiving me and that something that I really can't explain was occurring.  Due to the fact that this happened about 6 yrs ago, same place, I wasn't prepared at t! hat time because it was hard for me to record through my phone.  Those objects were white and it looked like a box with a circle on top but it was connected.  Those objects stayed on a smooth path across the sky, very low. My wife and daughter saw it with me.  So this time I wanted to make sure.  Once I figured out what I was seeing was real and unexplainable, I ran inside and told my wife.  She was in the bathroom and we started watching the objects from the bathroom window.  I then said, I have to record this! I then went back on my steps and thats where my footage starts. We were just watching what these 2 things were doing and I was making sure to point out every movement to her to make sure we were on the same page.  There were 2 objects kind of like floating and rotating kind of slow emulating each others movement to the best of ability to describe it.  Everytime it looked as if it made a full rotation, it was either reflecting the sun rays or flashing.  All of sudden, one of the objects just floated up and disappeared, leaving the other one looking like a transparent circle, or sphere with a hole in the middle of it. As I am recording, you can see it move, blink, flash, disappear, reaapear.  At one point, a plane flew in view of the recording very close to this object.  It looked as if the object took cover or hid in a jetstream that they were flying around.  As soon as the plane passes by, the object went into the clouds and stopped blinking.  After that, the object just stayed in that area and after awhile, it vanished within the cloud. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Did anyone else have a sighting in Toronto, Sunday night between 10-10:30PM?   Approximately 10PM EST, Sunday August 28, 2016, over Newmarket, north of Toronto, Canada, two of us were sitting in the backyard facing East (see the photo below where the sun is rising the next morning with StarTracker Lite App superimposed to show the sky from Sunday night). Traveling from North to South (left to right in the picture above) across the eastern sky at a speed that was like a shooting star was a craft that was oval in appearance, seemingly wide like a plane, at a height approximating what a commercial jet would be flying overhead. From our sitting position on the backyard deck, it passed slightly above the trees as it sped South for a count of “1 and 2 and…” then continued with its view obstructed by the trees in a slightly wider field of view than the photo above.  Initially we asked ourselves if this could be a meteorite but having already seen two a little earlier, it was clearly uncharacteristic of a meteorite. It was oval as if it might have wings but they were not perceptible wings.  It was more like an energy pulse extending to each side like wings.  It appeared as a quickly pulsating, oscillation with long, oval arch to each side.  The rapid pulsing to each side of its center was extremely fast. Imagine for a moment, as if the pattern of a tiger’s stripes was energetically oscillating at an extremely fast rate.  That is how it appeared to me, though to Alison sitting beside me, it was more like a subdued yet oval light swishing across the sky in a dark halo surrounding it. Unlike the meteorite that arched down from the sky towards the horizon like the two meteorites that we witnessed earlier, this UAP flew straight across the sky at a speed that is comparable to a meteorite.  The energy was electric.  The sky was the clearest we have seen all summer. Approximately 30-minutes later, at 10:32pm, we saw exactly the same phenomenon in the same exact line of vision, but this time traveling from South to North.  Notably, it was moving approximately at half the speed of the original sighting for a count of “1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and…” then the trees obstructed our view.  At that speed, it was speeding much faster than a jet fighter would across the sky.  There was no sound at all. Again, there was an electric, energetic feel to the energy filling the air, possibly our own excitement from what we saw. This is the sky photographed on my iPhone 5s taken immediately after.  Though the phone was in my hand, the craft moved much too quickly to take a shot. I believe these are the solar systems and stars that were visible, though I am not 100% certain of their exact placement, according to the StarTracker Lite App on my phone.  Very grainy shot, but it offers perspective of where we were sitting and what we saw pass across our field of view. The next morning at approximately 7:30am I went outside to photograph the sun rising in the exact same spot we witnessed the sighting Sunday night, to have a clear perspective of where we had witnessed the UAPs for this report.  Upon downloading the images to my computer, one of the shots taken had a bright spot above the sun. When enlarged, two objects are revealed.  What is particularly interesting is that the seeming light source is at the top, north side of the spheres and they exhibit a shadow to the bottom south side. While I have won awards for my photography and work in television, I am not an expert with Photoshop nor do I have proper tools for analysis.  My question to the readers out there:  Is this image typical of lens flair?  Is it something else that is naturally explainable?   Or, is this a genuine capture of an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon or UFO?  That daylight photo aside, what we saw Sunday evening took our breath away.  Never before have I seen anything like that or even read about craft resembling what we saw.",2016-09-02T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

The craft moved very slowly going toward the East, somewhat hiding in the tree lines.  It then made a very smooth turn, heading toward the West this time, and came back into our view. The craft then very slowly hovered right past our window, there was probably 8 to 10 yellowish-white lights on the side we could see, and at least two red lights on the belly of the craft.  This thing was literally at the height of the power lines, made virtually no sound until it was passing right next to the house.  It made a very faint humming sound - we live really close to an airport so we're pretty familiar with airplane sounds and their landing lights. It was a black triangle shape from what we could make out. It was insane how close we were to this thing.  You could've probably pegged this thing with a rock, it was flying so low. And at the speed this thing hovered, any other aircraft would've definitely been stalling out.  I didn't take any pictures because my camera on my phone has awful quality.

I kept looking at it and noticed it appeared to be not one light, but multiple lights, at least 3 lights and perhaps 4.  All together they were in the shape of a perfect triangle, with the point toward us consisting of perhaps 2 lights close together.  The lights were colored yellowish.  The UFO was approximately due west from us, elevated approx. 40 degrees up from the horizon.  My best guess is that its altitude was perhaps 3500-5000 feet above ground, and maybe 4 miles from our position.

After about 5 minutes of looking, we went back to our apartment to get my monocular, binoculars, camera, and to make a quick report on Facebook, in the hopes that others saw it too.  That took about 3-4 minutes, then we went back outside to the place we had observed the UFO.  We could not locate the UFO again and noted that the sky appeared to be hazy now and clouding up some.

I take a nightly walk every night down the same street, so I would consider myself fairly familiar with the different land marks of the area.  I have lived in this neighborhood for 10+ years and know what to expect from neighbors lighting off fireworks or a plan flying overhead.  It was a very clear, cool and calm night with lots of stars out, no breeze, low humidity and no clouds in the sky. On this nightly walk I had barely rounded the corner on the block headed away from my house and heading east when I noticed an orange glowing object in the sky.  At first I thought it was just a plane, this thought only lasted a few seconds as I realized it was heading in a westerly direction towards me and also ascending very slowly.  In this second I stopped and watched it. It was about the size of a street lamp when you are standing under a street lamp but did not shine like a street lamp.  In fact, it just glowed and cast no light.  It made no sound.  Was rectangular in shape with the longer ends being on the top and bottom.  The top may have also been bigger.  It also had a weird halo underneath it.  The color was a very rich orange color.  It did not fluctuate in color or intensity.  It was hard to tell distance at night but I would say maybe 200-300 yards away from me?  Maybe more?  I turned around and began to quickly walk home realizing I could not explain what I was seeing.  I pulled out my phone and texted my partner that I “See a UFO”. The time of that text was 21:58. I was scared mostly because it appeared like it would fly over me if it continued.  I thought about filming it but for some reason didn’t feel like I had time. As a quickly walked home, keeping my head over my shoulder to watch the object, I turned the corner to the street my house is on I saw the object pulse about 2 times and then shrink in size before completely going out.  It then blinked 3 times exactly and was gone.  These blinks were not pulses.  They were your “off and on” type blinks. I would say the total duration that I saw the object was no less than 3 minutes but no more than 5 minutes.

It hovered there as I stared at it… (maybe 3-4 minutes maybe a little longer…  maximum 5 minutes), and I asked my daughter to come out and look at it with me and my toddler followed behind her.

Sun was coming up, it was bright out.  No stars left but one to the NNW.  Bright star, not flashing or twinkling.  I pointed out to my co-worker the star and said it was most likely a planet.   I'm a recent college graduate that took a handful of astronomy and cosmology courses and I'm extremely skeptical of UFO phenomenon.  But I felt something was off when I realized the sun was up and all the planets should have been on the ecliptic further to the left an lower.  Checked location of planets: Jupiter, Venus and Mercury all following sun up, Uranus and Neptune setting, Saturn, Mars and Pluto all below the horizon.  This ""star"" isn't on the ecliptic at all, too far north.  I crossed checked with star charts, nothing matches.  As 08:40 rolls around it's still up.  Hasn't moved (if it is a celestial body it should be moving west, but hasn't).  It's getting bright out and still very visible.  As the sun got higher it looked more like metal! reflecting light than a star. Looks artificial and not natural. I estimate the object was 70 degrees above the horizon (not counting the mountains.  I used clenched fists to estimate sextants about 10 degrees).   The ""star"" still visible with the sun 40 degrees above the horizon.  Aircraft from DIA seemed to be flying east to west normally below it. Another coworker showed up about 09:00 and we both observed it for 30 minutes. In that time frame it moved 30 degrees south.  Pointed object out to two passerby at 09:40 and they could see it and agreed it was strange.  The object was brightly visible until 10:00.  By then it was directly west.  Hate to be that guy but since there is atmospheric research going on here it could be weather ballon?  When I looked at it through binocs it had circle large shape, it was clear with ribs.  Seemed to morph from circle to oval.  I have no idea, so I thought I would post this here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I got out of class sometime after 9:30 and I hit the interstate.   I got on Ashley Phosphate, took 1-26 West to get off on exit 205 A. As I’m going down the road, I see this bright light. It was just a small circular light- I assumed it was a airplane.  It approached, like one. I like planes so I was watching it, waiting for it to pass over me, but instead it stayed in the distance.  I found it odd, about 2 minutes passed and I watched it slowly make its way over to the left side of the interstate and it descended into the trees.  I was so confused, because the only airport I know of is the one alll the way back after exit 212.  So. Right as this “plane” descends, I see another one.  This one has two lights on each end. Different colors.  I automatically assume that it’s a helicopter.  It slowly makes it’s way over the interstate and then it pauses too.. I put on my glasses and watch it slowly descend into the trees.  About a mile away from the! first one.  I was so confused, if these were helicopters, why were they landing in that area? I’m not too familiar with the area but I knew there was no landing spots there.  So just as I see it disappear within the trees.. I see another as I’m passing by the signs saying 205 B is coming up. This one, it wasn’t really moving. I stared at it all the way to my exit.  It was close to ground. I couldn’t make out the object at first but once I came up to the exit, it was directly above me man. It had very dim lights on it.  Now at this point “ufo” was going through my mind, the craft looked so odd.  I was eyeballing this thing hard as I drove around the loop and came up on University Blvd?  I rolled down my window just to listen, to see if it made any sound. It was so quiet.  I watched this thing HOVER from my right side over to my left side.  As I was coming down the hill, a car pulls full of boys are passing me, and I watched the guy i the passenger and he screams “DUUUUUDE” and they take off.  That made me feel better, I knew I wasn’t just seeing things.  It’s pretty high up in the air, but it was so close.. I’m not good at describing distance so I can’t tell you but as I was driving down that hill to get to Ladson, I was in sync with the object. It was getting lower and lower to the ground.  I get to the light, turn left on Ladson, and I’m going as slow as I can, just keeping up with it.  I’m going about 15mph on a 45?  And I follow it to Ladson Elementary School.  It was right there..  It wasn’t in the street, it was hovering over the parking lot of the school?  It had these  strange dim lights that looked so out of place, and the object moved so slow in mid air. I could see it’s shape now, as it slowly shifted from horizontal to vertical. It was a saucer. Just as it did that, it spit something, it was like a tiny pill shaped object that had a white glow to it,  it was big enough for me to see. Right after that I hauled ass.  I got so emotional and so scared. As I’m getting to my friends house, I see military planes in the sky, going towards the direction from which  I came. 	I arrive to her house and I bolt to her door, I think I see  a drone or two flying over her neighborhood, I’m so freaked out. I knock on her door then just barge in, I was too scared to stay outside. I went ballistic and was telling them what happened, they look outside and see the drones. We stayed there for about 20 minutes before leaving again.  As we’re getting in the car, a light in the sky is coming our way, it looked like the first flying object I saw, but it revealed itself to be a plane.  But this plane was scoping.  It was cruising through the sky. And when we left her neighborhood and went back up Ladson, I watched these huge trucks pull into the back of the school, and then the cruiser plane  flew across the street. 	We get to the gym. Work out. Leave. Go back to Ladson. It’s about 12:40 when we get to the light to turn onto Ladson. That plane was still in the sky scoping and those trucks were just leaving the area. I go home. I couldn’t sleep. Needed the lights on to sleep. Haha. There were people on the road, and many people on the interstate that could've saw too.. It really sucks you know. I wish I didn’t see that. I mean. That was cool. Really cool. But. Overwhelming. I just want to know the truth but I guess it’s better to just mind my business.

My husband and I spend most of our evenings on our apartment porch.  We are on the corner of the 3rd story and face an open field next to our apartment complex.  We're the only ones with this amount of an amazingly open field view at this complex.  Though it's an open field, it is outlined with trees, some of which are close to our porch.  From the porch of my 3rd story apt about 20-30 ft out from me, just above a tree top, I looked up and out just in time to randomly see a dull orange/red orb come over and around a tree top right in front of me.  I didn't sense it, it made no sound  at all, and even though it glowed orange and reddish orange it didn't cast enough light to shine on to anything.  So with that being said if I hadn't just looked out at the view in front of me at that exact moment, I would have never seen it, I would have never known it was there at all.  It moved fast and direct.  Staying just inches above the tree tops, moving decidedly around the tree! tops.  Too fast, too silent and too weird of a light to be a drone, too close and too small to be mistaken for a plane or helicopter.  A big storm was brewing in the next town over (Broken Arrow/Tulsa) that we could easily see amazing lightening take place from, but the weather was very calm and pleasant where we were.  Almost no wind or noise, just a calm night.  By the time I registered what I was seeing and started to say, ""Wow look at…,"" to my husband, it was gone without a trace.  The whole thing took place in under 10 seconds, my husband was lighting his cigarette while this was taken place and there for didn't see anything.  The weirdest thing of all, it didn't fly away, shoot off or land.  As soon as I made a sound to form the words Wow, it was that exact moment, mid-flight past our porch it just vanished! Gone. Not up, not down, not hiding... light off in the blink of an eye, no traces left, gone. Poof. Next day I had a strange, realistic dream (occurrence?) during a midday nap.  I felt the need to wake and check on my kids but when I tried to sit up and roll over I felt drugged, no strength, couldn't hardly move or open my eyes.  I managed a weird flop and roll over, tried to say my daughters name but it sounded sluggish to my own ears.  I managed to open my eyes just enough to be blinded by a very direct bright pin point of a light.  I asked my husband later that day if he had come home from work on lunch and for some weird reason shined his phones flashlight in my face or something haha, but he said no definitely not.  All I know is I must have immediately gone into a deep sleep and woke what felt like only 5 to 10 minutes later but I can not be sure.  Everything seemed fine in the house when I did get up, my daughter was asleep on the couch and my son was in his room on the xbox. I went outside to my porch to just take a minute and reflect, thats when I noticed a wicked bad bruise on my left calf muscle with no explanation as to when or how I acquired it.  A day or two later a solid white perfect circle appeared in the bruise, next day another perfect circle appeared right next to the first one;  Both in the middle of the bruise.  That's also when I noticed there were solid pea sized hard lumps.  One under each white circle in the middle of this purple, blue, green, yellow bruise.  A few days later the circles became outlined in perfect red lines that almost resemble spider veins but much softer, smaller and lighter and in an almost honeycomb shape.  The bruises and red lines are gone now, but the hard mass is still very much there.  Also it stopped feeling like two individual pea sized knots and started feeling more like the size and shape of just one Tylenol pill. To sum it up: Softball/basketball sized orb, dull reddish orange glowing orb, flew around a tree top and past me on my 3rd story apartment porch.  When my presence was made known by me attempting to alert my husband of the orb, it blinked out of sight. Next day I had a very strange nap that I felt I couldn't wake up from and when I tried I can barley recall a bright pinpointed light shine in my eyes while I was in bed in my room and I fell back to sleep. Later same day, I found a big bruise on my inner left calf muscle that was shaped like a dogs paw print.  One big bruise with 3 medium to small bruises just above the big bruise.  Bruise was wicked, dark purple, blue, green, yellows and next day a small white perfect circle appeared, than another of the same size right next to it, then I felt the hard object under the bruise.  Bruise is now completely gone but the hard mass is still there.",2016-08-29T00:00:00,35.9115,-95.6152

At first glance, I thought it was a flock of geese, but these definitely weren’t birds.  Only about 10 seconds had passed between the time they appeared and the time they were out of sight, so I didn’t get a long enough look to be able to specifically identify the crafts’ shape.  They were something between spherical and cubic, but what caught my attention and ultimately disqualified my first interpretation of it being a flock of geese was the lack of wings.  There were definitely no wings on any of the crafts, nor did I notice any “flapping” movements. They flew together in perfect unison while maintaining the V formation, almost as if they were connected in the air.  Their movements were swift and completely silent.  Geese make enough noise when they fly that most people can tell when their approaching even before they’re in sight. These crafts flew by without even slightly disrupting the air.",2016-08-29T00:00:00,,

It actually descended vertically with no horizontal movement.  We saw no red or green lights present on the craft.  (Indicating a commercial or even military aircraft.)  It came from the North, until it got around some trees, made a gradual 90 degree turn and began heading to the West.  (In the direction of the airport here.)  We see tons of planes coming in and landing all day, everyday.  This thing was not a commercial airliner. It was flying entirely too slow, too low, and was way too quiet to be a passenger airliner, and had too many lights on it.  (And in the wrong places/not having the correct lights for an airplane.)  It flew pretty slowly past the house, it was probably about 100 - 250 feet away (maybe a bit more) from the house, and it was flying at a pretty low altitude, I'd guess somewhere around maybe 200-400 feet area possibly.  I actually managed to snap a few quick pictures of the thing, which I will attach to this. What was odd to me was the fact that there weren't any other airplanes coming in for about 10 - 15 minutes before this craft came, and nothing came in to the airport for about 15 - 20 minutes after we saw the craft.  There is also an Air Force base pretty close by (Rickenbacker AFB), but that base is roughly 30 minutes to the South of us. This one did have a sound, like a plane - but a very, very quiet plane. (It was more quiet than a single prop airplane.) We didn't hear the noise of it until it was passing the house, and for a brief moment after it had already passed by the house. It had at least 6 - 7 bright white lights present on it. (That's only counting the lights on the left side and back side of the craft.) It was very dark, but it was most likely a black craft, and the way the lights were situated on the craft, it had to be a triangular craft. Note:  Normally we hear crickets outside all night long, but when this craft hovered past us, it was dead quiet outside with the occasional sound of vehicles on the nearby highways and the craft when it hovered by.

However, it took off really quick & the orb was glowing green, while the tail & the sky around it flashed through different colors rapidly.  Not to mention that it was MUCH bigger than a shooting star.  It was almost similar to a flare being shot off, but it was green (not red), flew in a fast & straight line, and it had a bunch of colors streaming from it. There is a video online of a Green Fireball flying over Poland.  That is very similar to what I saw in almost every detail (even how the head detached from the tail) except for the one I saw had the tail that kept changing colors. I wasn't going to report this, but I saw that there were other reports of a (the?) fireball flying around that same day. I want to include that in 1999, me & my girlfriend witnessed a triangle UFO hovering very close to where we were standing in a parking lot.  DAYS after that spotting, I noticed a strange triangle pattern tattooed into my hand that matched right up to other triangle tattoos that I've seen on other UFO witnesses.

I was exiting a restaurant with a friend on Gay Street on 8/19/16 at 8:49 pm in Knoxville TN.  As soon as we stepped out onto the street, I looked North (with my I-Phone 6 in hand) and I was overwhelmed by the sight of a very strange cloud formation.  It had three plumes jetting out of it and there was a ceiling of another cloud above it.  It was so surreal and I said to my friend, “I’ve never seen anything like that before in my life!”   At that moment, I had a strange feeling that gave me a sense of it being “other worldly” and it gave me an odd looming feeling. (It should be noted that I was and still am, completely sober.)  Anyhow, I started taking photos of this strange cloud and realized that I had it set on “square” photo and then I switched it to “regular” photo after a few shots (just to explain the difference in layout).  My friend was ready to go and stroll Gay Street, so I turned around on my heels and hopped in the street (as I often do) to take more photos of Gay Street looking South towards the Tennessee Theatre and the river.  So I snap, snap, snap, etc. and then hop back on the sidewalk and take a couple more shots after that. During my photo blitz, I was more focused on looking through my phone-camera than I was on looking at the sky, so I didn’t pick up the details that I had shot until I got home (about an hour and a half later).  As I flipped through the evening’s shots, I could clearly see something in the sky of one of the shots and when zooming in, I discovered that I had photographed a Fleet of bright green UFO’s!  Of course, I then took a much closer look at the photos before and after this particular shot and discovered that I had tracked this Fleet coming out of the clouds (near a mountain which is lined with radio towers) and seconds later, they were on the opposite side of the sky over the Tennessee River.  In the next to the last shot, you can see two domed lights on top of the mountain (across the river).  NOTE:   There are no lights on top of this mountain and the lights are not seen before or after the incident.  Then in the last shot, you will notice the same two dome lights lifting off into the sky and there is also an orb-type UFO faintly seen in this shot as well. The last shot was taken out of series at 9:14 pm. (I think I just happened to catch them again while they were “taking off”).  None of my photos before or after this series of Gay Street shots, show anything in the sky, nor specs on the lens, etc.  I still have all these photos on my phone and I am happy to show anybody who would like to see the original shots so you can verify the time, date and that I have not retouched these in any way.  I have only emailed them to myself and saved them to my desktop to put a slide show together which I shared on my FaceBook page. I should also mention that I have had Close Encounters (of several kinds) numerous times throughout my life.  However, this is the first time that I have ever managed to take photographs of the visitors.  Not that it means much to those who don’t know me but I’m a very logical person, a respected professional in my industry (fine art painting) and a “normal” 49 year old mother.  I hope these photos help open some minds on the topic. Also to note:  In one of the photos, the glowing green orb heads towards me and is photographed from about 10 feet from me near the sidewalk.  Also, when I zoomed in on these photos, each of the anomalies appear to have a 6 pointed star-like glow and each have a hue of violet/rose colored aura around them.",2016-08-29T00:00:00,35.96156134085213,-83.98011528822055

IT WAS A NICE CLEAR NIGHT WITH A SLIGHT OFF-SHORE BREEZE OUT OF THE EAST.   AT ABOUT 8:45PM, LOOKING NORTH, I NOTICED A LOW FLYING RED LIGHT, TRAVELING FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST.  AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS THE AVERAGE CESSNA AIRCRAFT AT 50 DEG. ABOVE THE HORIZON.   I RAN AND GOT MY PHONE TO CALL SOME PEOPLE BUT DECIDED TO TRY TO GET VIDEO OF IT WITH THE PHONE, KNOWING THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PICK UP ANYTHING USABLE.   AFTER A FEW SECONDS ANOTHER RED LIGHT CAME INTO VEIW FOLLOWING THE FIRST FLYING AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER ALTITUDE AT A DISTANCE OF TWO FINGERS TOGETHER AT AN ARMS LENGTH BEHIND THE OTHER ONE.  BY THIS TIME I HAD GOT TO THE VERY TOP OF AN EIGHT FOOT LADDER THAT WAS ALREADY SET UP IN THE YARD SO I COULD GET UP ON THE ROOF AND WATCH THESE THINGS AS LONG AND FAR AS POSSABLE.  A THIRD OBJECT CAME INTO VEIW SAME ALTITUDE AND DISTANCE AS THE PREVIOUS AND THEN ANOTHER MAKING FOUR! RED LIGHTS FLYING IN A LINE ONE BEHIND THE OTHER.  HERE I WAS ON THE ROOF OF MY HOUSE DRESSED IN NOTHING BUT BOXERS AND ALL ALONE WATCHING THESE GUYS TRAVEL BY AND NOBODY AROUND TO YELL TO SOO THEY CAN SEE ALSO.  WITH THE LIGHTS ALMOST OUT OF VEIW ON THE EASTERN HORIZON I WAS GETTING READY TO GET OFF THE ROOF THEN ANOTHER TWO LIGHTS CAME INTO VEIW FLYING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE PREVIOUS BUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE CLOSER AND A LITTLE BRIGHTER.  THE FITH LIGHT WAS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE REST AND THE SIXTH SLIGHTLY LOWER BUT STILL HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS FOUR.  I AM A 37 YEAR OLD EXPERIENCED ASTRONOMER USING A LARGE TELESCOPE FOR MANY YEARS, I KNOW WHAT SATELLITES LOOK LIKE AND HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF KNOWLEDGE OF AIRCRAFT AND THEIR FLIGHT PATHS AND SUCH.   I AM SURE THAT WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT WERE NOT DRONES,CHINESE LANTERNS, WEATHER BALLOONS, SWAMP GAS OR ANY NORMAL AIRCRAFT DUE TO THE LACK OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND MARKERS REQUIRED ON ALL AIRCRAFT NOR WERE THERE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT AROUND IN THE SKY.   AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO AFTER THE SIXTH LIGHT PAST BY, I DECIDED TO GET OFF THE ROOF AND JUMP IN MY CAR.  I TOOK NOTE OF THE TIME 9:05PM PACIFIC AND AS FAST AS I COULD I GRABBED SOME PANTS,NIGHT VISION,CAMERA AND SOME BINOCULARS WHICH WERE ALL TOGETHER ON THE DINING TABLE.  I HAD ALL OF THESE THINGS READY TO GO BECAUSE I HAVE OBSERVERD THESE RED LIGHTS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE WEEKS PRIOR WHICH WERE REPORTED TO THIS WEB SITE.  WHILE I WAS GETTING DRESSED A LOW FLYING HELICOPTER FLEW OVER MY HOUSE FROM THE SOUTH TOWARDS THE NORTH THAT HAD ONLY A FLASHING RED LIGHT ON THE BOTTOM OF IT BUT THIS WAS LIKELY THE NORMAL MEDIVAC HELICOPTER. I HAVE HAD AN IN MY FACE CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN 2001 OF A LOW FLYING TRIANGLE THAT I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AND WISH NEVER HAPPEND AND SINCE THEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I SAW WITH COUNTLESS HOURS OF READING AND LISTENING TO ANYTHING THAT MAY BE LINKED TO THE SUBJECT IN A QUEST TO GET SOME SORT OF ANSWER TO WHAT I OBSERVED. LAST WEEK I CALLED AM1080 KSCO, A LOCAL AM RADIO STATION AND ASKED THEM TO ! ASK PEOPLE IN THE AREA IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY. I HAVE ASKED POLICE OFFICERS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE SOME KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHAT IS FLYN AROUND ABOVE US. I TAKE THIS KIND OF STUFF SERIOUSLY AND WOULD SAY THAT I AM NOT OVERLY SERIOUS ABOUT IT BUT SOME MAY THINK OTHERWISE. ANYWAYS HERE I AM HAULN BUTT DOWN THE ROAD IN MY CAR WITH MY EQUIPTMENT IN HAND IN AN EFFORT TO CATCH UP WITH THESE LIGHTS AND REALIZE THAT I DONT HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL OF CATCHING UP WITH THESE THINGS AND DECIDE TO STOP AT THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE AROUND THE BLOCK. I PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND BEFORE I EVEN TURN OFF THE CAR FOUR KIDS RANGING IN AGE FROM 4 TO 12 COME RUNNING UP TO ME ASKING IF I SAW THE RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY. I TOLD THE KIDS HOLD ON A MINUTE AND TOOK OFF BACK TO MY HOUSE TO GET MY DIGITAL RECORDER. I AM FAMILIAR WITH INTERVEIWING PEOPLE AND KNOW THAT QUESTIONING PEOPLE ESPECIALLY KIDS ALWAYS GOES BETTER IF THEY DONT KNOW T! HEY ARE BEING RECORDED, IT MAY NOT BE TOTALY LEAGAL BUT I FIGU! RE ITS T HE BEST WAY TO DOCUMENT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO TELL ME. TURNS OUT THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING A FEW RED LIGHTS IN THE WESTERN SKY SINCE ABOUT 8:00PM AND HAD CALLED ME TO TELL ME BUT I DID NOT HAVE MY PHONE ON ME BECAUSE I WAS OUTSIDE IN MY BOXERS WATERING MY LAWN. THE KIDS EVEN DRUG OUT A TELESCOPE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET TO WATCH THE LIGHTS AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WATCHED A RED LIGHT IN THE WEST STAY STATIONARY FOR OVER A HALF OF AN HOUR THEN WATCHED IT GAIN A LITTLE ALTITUDE AND THEN TAKE OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE OBJECTS WOULD DISAPPEAR AND THEN REAPPEAR IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION I RECORDED THESES FOUR KIDS SEPERATLY AND GOT SOME EXELENT STUFF.

I was about to fall asleep around 4am when I saw a light through the blinds of my window.  I have a natural curiosity about UFOs, so I got up and took a closer look.  It was hard to tell what I was looking at.  It looked very similar to a star, but it wasn't flashing how a sta would through our atmosphere. I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out exactly what it was.  I was convinced it was moving, but thought I was just tired and maybe I was just seeing things.  I started to block the object using frames of the window, and realized it slowly but definitely was moving back into my vision.  I did this multiple times.  I opened my window so I had a full view, and went back to my bed to watch this object. For the next hour or so, the object very slowly moved back and forth. It changed direction quite a few times, but it never went very far. I could judge its position by where it was in relation to my window frames.  At one point, it got close enough for me to see there were multiple lights to it.  I cant confirm the shape, but I was leaning towards a triangle or boomerang type object. Towards the end of my sighting, the object started to move upwards and become smaller and more distant.  At this point, the sun was beginning to rise and it was the only object visible in the sky other than the moon.  All of the stars I had seen prior were no longer visible.  This object had to have been very bright, and very big. At this point I had to get back up to watch it, as the object had completely left my view of the window.  I got up to watch it and realized it had become a speck.  I couldn't believe how astonishingly high it got.  This way way too high to be a plane or a drone, and satellites don't maneuver the way this object did.  At times it was completely still, but became more active towards the middle and end of my sighting. Second Object:  At this point its about 5:40 A.M. The first object was extremely high, just a little dot.  I then noticed a second craft MUCH lower in my vision.  I had mistaken it for a cloud at first, but it was an object darting across the sky leaving a small trail.  It was travelling at an awkward angle, and I could not notice any lights on this one.  There was quite a bit of natural light in the sky at this point.  I took a video of this one.  The other object was too distant to show up on my camera. The craft was only in my vision for about 10 seconds, and left no visible trail after it left my field of view.  The object I had originally seen was somehow still visible, extremely high up there.  About 5 minutes later, it was either gone, or there was too much natural light to observe it further.

I continued to walk across the parking and for a short period the object was eclipsed by the building, so I walked around to the side to get a better look. The object was still there.  For half a second, I though maybe it was a bird soaring in the wind as there was a pretty good breeze blowing, but it appeared to be hovering in place, although it was twisting and turning - plus, it had a definite oval shape. A few seconds later, it stopped turning and exited away to the north/northwest until in was no longer visible.

Many radar observations and one visual.,DEW Line (U. S. and Canada),,,,,"Occurred : 6/30/1953   (Entered as : 1953) Reported: 2/18/2017 11:54:28 AM 11:54 Posted: 2/22/2017 Location: DEW Line (U. S. and Canada),  Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/132/S132696.html,"Many radar observations and one visual. This report refers to events of many years ago.  I heard you a short time back on Coasttocoast recounting similar material to which you seemed to attach some importance.  Hence the following:  I was in the Air Force in the early 1950s, stationed in the Northeastern Air Command (NEAC) and assigned to the DEW Line, the string of early warning radar sites tasked to look for Russian bombers headed our way.  My particular radar site was on a mountain top near Goose Bay, Labrador. We regularly picked up UFOs, typically a few hundred miles out to the northwest of Goose Bay, and often scrambled interceptors (F-86s and F-94s) to greet them, or try to.  This wasn’t because of security concerns, to my knowledge we never fired on them.  We just took these opportunities to give our pilots and controllers experience in running intercepts.  On a few occasions, UFOs and interceptors played tag with each other, with the UFOs ‘winning’ due to their superior maneuverability.  They at times would chase our interceptors.  Playful fellows. Later, I was stationed at the control center for NEAC near St. John’s, Newfoundland.  We received reports of all air traffic in NEAC from the various radar sites and tracked them all on a large plotting board.  I once asked one of the sites reporting in why we didn’t get UFO traffic and was told, ‘we don’t bother to report them anymore.'  (At the control centers in the States there was usually a noncom who took these reports and gathered specific information on them.)  I was on duty in 1953 at the Control Center when a British airliner flying great circle from the UK to the US or Canada encountered a UFO a bit south of Greenland.  The case is well known.  The object was a large sphere surrounded by six smaller ones.  The small ones merged with the large one which then abruptly accelerated away at a very high speed (or simply shrank in size and disappeared). It was seen by the flight crew and all the passengers save one who was asleep.  It was under observation for some minutes.  The aircraft landed at Gander, Newfoundland, where the crew and, I think, some of the passengers were debriefed by RCAF and USAF personnel. In returning to the United States in late 1953 or 1954, an AFSC order required that we say nothing about our UFO experiences.  UFOs were apparently a secret.  Then, however, being subjected to official ridicule of the phenomenon, I learned the government lies to us and never thereafter believed much of what the government had to say about anything. I am not a UFO buff and seldom follow the UFO news.  I know they exist and give evidence of intelligent control, and that’s about it.  I was a pilot in the 1960s and ‘70s and did a fair amount of night flying.  Knowing these things are out there, I kept my eye out for one but never sighted one while flying. In 1975, however, I was just about ten miles or so south of Daytona, Florida, driving northbound on I-95, when I finally saw one.  It was after sunset but severe clear.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw a red light to my left (the west) and assumed it was on a radio antenna which was near the New Smyrna airport just to my left.  I often flew in and out of that airport and recalled that the antenna was in fact a few miles farther to the north at the Port Orange airport. Surprised, (a UFO maybe?), I pulled to the side of the highway to observe the orange light more carefully. It was just near or slightly above the palm trees on the opposite side of the highway, so perhaps about 20 degrees above the horizon.  It was moving very slowly (either a relatively small object close in or a large object more distant—no way to tell which), but it appeared spherical and not a point source.  It blinked out several times but returned and began moving somewhat more rapidly to the northwest ! and vanished in the distance. There was no noise or any other phenomena associated with the observation.  That’s the limit of my direct experience with UFOs.  But the sighting near New Smyrna was certainly of an unknown object of some kind.",,,

The sighting occurred at the bus stop, and we talked about it at school that day, so I remember the reaction of my classmates and it being towards the end of the year.   It was around 7 am in the morning and my sister, myself and 4 other children were waiting at the top of the drive above my house (house was down in a dip about 20 feet from the road) on the other side of the road, for our bus which would take us to school that day.   Our bus stop was the coming together of two dirt roads and also a kind of last point on the main road before the road took a bend to the right.  Up the road on the other side it was flat and straight for a good half mile.  A huge double row of 200 foot or more steel power lines crossed the road about half mile or more in the distance.  I could see the tops of the lines from the bus stop.   I think we were all standing there kinda sleepy, like no talking, when I happened to glance up the road and noticed a bright red light on the power lines.  It sat there a few seconds, and then left the lines and started following the road in our direction.  There were no other cars or people out just us.  I don't remember seeing the red light after it left the lines and I could barely make out a cigar shaped object.   Eventually it arrived over our heads, about 30 or so  feet.  It was really close.  It didn't take long to cover the distance down the road, but when it reached the bus stop, it almost stopped and began slowly inching along with the side of the object facing us.   At that point, it began to move off the road towards the tree line behind our house.  I remember it being just at the top of the trees behind our house and disappearing over the tree line.  That would have been correct because our house/treeline was much lower than our bus stop on top of the hill.   The object was grey to bluish grey, cigar shaped or kinda oblong cigar shaped.

The object made no sound...that was the thing that even as a kid you knew was not correct, not natural.  It glided along on a straight perfect line as if on a track.

I actually was waiting for a loud bang or an explosion in the car distance because I didn't know if it maybe was a bomb or a meteor etc etc.  I was a little freaked out, being I've never seen anything like it before and haven't since.   Again,  it was like a really slow shooting star but In our atmosphere and going downward,  blue with a short tail behind it.  Was definitely  experience.   I asked my buddy if he ! had also seen it and he caught the last second before gone cause he was driving and it was night time.  I've always wondered what I saw that night.  Looked online through the last year's just hoping someone else posted the same thing somewhere but still haven't so I guess I'm alone in it.  This is complete truth and I wish we had the phones we got now days because I definitely would have had it on camera.  We were driving down rt1 going back down the beaches coming from Wilmington, DE, so straight south and it was pretty much straight ahead but just up to ths righta and ahead, was really cool looking. Just crazy to me that no-one else seen this blue streak of light I saw that night. Fyi, the date and time is not prefect, it was between early 1999 to beginning of 2000, and even possible that it may have been middle 1998.  I seen one other person on this site that did see a blue green light around the same time in 1998 Just wish I remembered exactly what month and day at least.

I opened my eyes, in the old master bedroom of the house with the addition.  It was the first bedroom up the stairs.  At first I was looking up, but saw something black by the foot of the bed but off the left, actually on the side of the bed of me, and not actually at the foot, but sort of a little closer than the foot.  I looked at it.  It looked almost exactly human, and I assumed my family was playing some type of prank of me with a black suit and mask, probably my brother.  This creature was actually quite tall, taller than a normal human.  But the mouth was flesh and had no lips but sort of a creased structure.  The eyes, I thought were covered, but this creature didn't have eyes.  It was just a head with a mouth and it stood, analyzing me through it's head.  This must have been the way it sensed things.  I looked at the clothes, still thinking this was a costume of my father or brother's to scare me.  The animal had a black suit.  I looked at the detail of the ski! n, and saw that it was essentially faceless, but with a bald head.  A man wearing black, but without eyes and a flatter face.  I exited the home within 15 seconds.  My bed was close to the door, which was open.  And the front door was right down the colonial stairs.  My parents put about 1,000,000 into that house, the museum house I called it.  They were once offered 2,000,000 for the colonial home with a large back addition and a fourth floor.  Maybe whatever decided to stop saw the largely lit building that didn't look like a normal house.  On the 4th floor, there was a typical colonial roof that was extended with the addition and about 6 sky-lights.  They were usually brightly lit from the internal lights, like patterns to the sky.  When we built the addition, we also found this energy piping leading to nowhere in the open land behind us.  The builders said there was something they couldn't comprehend about it exactly, and we decided to bury/ignore it.  I sometimes wonder if we had ! followed it, was it just a bunker from a War that the original! house owners had built?  Why was there power and metal lines running to a field from a house that was over a hundred years old..  I ran outside the home that day, partially naked, screaming the whole way.  There are other details such as seeing a female, and also skin markings but I don't want to go into these because they'll sound like I'm fabricating.  This experience was really just contact. I meditate and try to connect with the peace in the universe.  I'm not really sure if these other sentient beings can feel energy from people, but it seemed like it was observing me from the side of my bed. Hopefully a nice, enlightened creature, not something menacing.  I didn't ever see that man, as I think of him, again.  And I looked up japanese lore, and it said noppera-bo, a vision of someone about to betray you.  Or perhaps a visitor with an alternate transportation device that we don't comprehend.  I think that this being, was sensing and probably used the natural universe on a different level that me, because without eyes, there must have been some other type of sense that kept him almost at a respectable distance from my bed.  If he was any closer, I would not have gone off that same side of the bed.  I'd probably have rolled around the other side and gone out the balcony screaming.. I'm not sure.  But both of us were close to the door, and I am happy I got away. Maybe the screaming let him know I was uncomfortable..  I feel like he let me leave.  I feel like I could have been stopped since the stairs were quite steep.  I went from the top landing, right outside by bed and where I dropped my feet, down the stairs, and outside.  I recall feeling safe, inside my chest and body once I got to the street and looked back at the house, not seeing anyone and seeing cars/ I believe at least one person.  I don't actually remember what happened after the street.  I think I got in contact with my family somehow, I don't recall this was in about 2010, but as early as 2008.  This creature, was not human. Afternote: I wrote about some markings! on my skin, but deleted them because that evidence, I thought, would discredit this account. I have been getting these unexplained white dots on my skin, like a scoop removed and then this white transluscent almost skin grows over.. healing kinda fast and appearing out of nowhere.  The two dots were on my abdomen, then my leg, and there have been others that appear elsewhere, like my forearm.  These are more recent, and I'm sometimes wondering if the contact was peaceful, or if I don't know what's happening when I'm sleeping/being accosted.

When I looked back at the first formation, the ship at the top disappeared.  I think it cloaked because where the ship was there was a difference in the grey color of the sky.  There were irregular sparkling areas around the outside edge of the grey color.  The ships were moving fast, it was only 10-15 seconds that I saw them through the night vision glasses.  My husband was standing next to me and he could not see them without glasses.  By the time he took the glasses the ships were out of sight.  We heard no noise.

This Is going to sound like a hoax. (which is why I've waited so long to report it)  Here is what I saw in the sky on September 9, 2014, in the north east corner of FL.  Regardless, this is how it went down.   I went outside mid morning, after staying up all night playing video games.  I was enjoying the sun on my face and I knew it wouldn't last long as a large storm front was coming from the east.  I than noticed a large cloud that looked like a wiener dog traveling forward, east, just south of the location of the sun.  As it hit the storm front it pushed it back keeping the sun on my face.  The cloud moved in a normal cloud speed.   This is where It gets strange.  I then saw three humanoid images standing on what looked like the deck of my childhood summer house in the head of the cloud.  They were standing between the picture window and the railing of the deck.  The images were moving around and I was very much entertained by what I thought was my imagination.  Then I realized that the lines of the window and the lines of the deck railing wear staying consistent.  All of this was seen in gray and white.  I was now entering into, I guess, a state of shock, so I smiled and waved.   Two of the figures went back into what appeared to be my cloud summerhouse.  The other figure came around the railing and began moving frantically around as if it was yelling at me or dancing or both.  The figure appeared to have large what looked to be dreads on his head. I continued to watch.   Just then, towards the butt section of this wiener dog looking cloud, eight points of light formed a perfect circle and  began to connect with each other with light.  It was at this time I became petrified and ran into the safety of my home.  I few minutes later I came out to see what was happening, clouds moved in from all directions everything I saw previously was now deep behind the clouds, however in what appeared to be a funnel kept the clear sight from me to where I had seen the lights, as if to keep an eye on me to see what I would do next.  I went back inside and went to bed.  I only shared this with a few friends, since I didn't want people to say I was nuts.   Today I googled the date with UFO sightings and discovered that UFO activity in the world was very high.  I am curious to find out if anyone else has had any kind of similar experience.

About 2 weeks ago, I was looking through my bedroom window  around midnight.  The sky was completely covered with clouds.  Around 23:55 I  saw a red light in the sky moving from the north-east to the south.  Thinking  it was just a plane, I didn't really pay much attention to it, until I noticed it was impossible for a plane to be visible because of the cloudy  weather and the red light didn't flinch like those of a plane would.   Because I'm an amateur astronomer, I grabbed by binoculars as fast as I could.  When I  was back at the window with my binoculars, the object was already halfway, so in the east direction.  When I looked at the object I still had no idea what  it was.  It looked like an egg shaped object with a red light in it.  Because  it was very cloudy, I guess the light must have been very bright.  Because no  other objects were seen (stars, planes, ...)  The object suddenly vanished  and was never seen again.   I discussed this sighting with others, but no one  come up with an answer to what it could be.  After searching on the web, I found  similar pictures of red objects in the sky.  One of the which looked the most  to what I've seen was also in Belgium and also around midnight.  Thanks for  the help to resolve this mystery, it deeply concerns me.

This object appears, moves horizontally at about the speed of a small aircraft, then went vertical at a rapid speed.  This object then continued to move horizontally back and forth occasionally moving higher in the sky and seeming to turn a blue color as it changed it's direction instantly.  I tried to drive in the direction I saw it after I lost sight of it, but I couldn't find an answer to what it was.  I talked to a couple different police officers on duty near the airport, I called air traffic control and I am waiting for a call back. Today was my second sighting of this object flying through the early morning sky, same location and about the same time.  The first time I saw this object was 06/19/17 in the North Eastern sky while observing Venus between 3am and 4am PST.  I tried to wake my wife up that night to show her, and of course it was gone by the time she came out.  I went out and bought a Nikon p900 to get some close up shots of the moon, Jupiter and Saturn this week.  Early this morning I went around the same time as I did on the 19th in search of this object, and there it was.  I ran inside grabbed my camera that I don't have a clue how to operate and shot this footage.  I did a terrible job shooting the footage, but hopefully it's enough to show what I was looking at.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,46.41000733944954,-118.9094880733945

It was extremely high for how small it appeared to be.  I tried to point it out to my husband, but he didn’t see it. Just a minute later, in the same general area, there was a huge – what appeared to be Chinook helicopter – way up high.  It was white with a red tail.  My husband ran in and grabbed the binoculars.  It was so high up and the setting sun was hitting it just right - we both agreed it was some kind of hugemungus helicopter.  I thought then that perhaps the first dark object I saw might have been a military escort for this huge transport. The helicopter was just fading from view towards the northeast, we looked up and in the same area, at the same high altitude, was a cigar shaped object that was silver in color traveling along the same course.  My husband looked through the binoculars and could not figure it out.  It had no wings – it was not an airplane and was not a helicopter.  He just kept saying “what IS that?”  By the time he gave me the binoculars it was fading from view and I didn’t get a very good look at it.  With my naked eye, I could tell the color was shiny silver, and it had a strange shape… it was shaped like a cigar.  There was no sound. We sat and discussed what we had just witnessed and the only thing we are sure of is the gigantic Chinook-type helicopter, white with red tail.  The dark object I saw was too small for a “regular” plane to be that high up, and there were no apparent wings, no noise and no lights flashing.  Military?  Possibly.

He asked me if it was a drone.  When I did look I saw a circular object with multiple red, blue and green flashing lights moving NW just above the flight path of jets taking off from Ontario Airport in the San Bernardino County. I told my friend it can’t be a drone because it’s too close to the airport and that’s when the object stopped and went back heading SE for about 5 seconds, and then started making very tight circles at a fast rate of speed. As the object was doing these maneuvers in the sky there were jets taking off from the Ontario airport and knowing that when the jets do take off they hold at 5,000 ft until cleared to make their turn away from the airport.  This object was above the jets at about an altitude of 15,000 ft.  There is also a flightpath going west to LAX and those jets fly at 30,000 ft.  These jets were definitely very high above this object. The object continued moving NW to East and South in tight maneuvers including going up and down about 5,000ft.  Judging by the flashing lights of the object compared to the jets that were taking off and other jets that were very high up the object had flashing lights that did not resemble the lights on the jets plus the lights were very bright.

I was watering my plants on the front porch, when I saw this bright object in the sky.  At first I thought it was a meteor, and I told my father's girlfriend to come look.  She saw it as well, my father merely glanced at it from the backyard and said it was a ""plane or something.""  It was flying near Baker's Corner store in Longview, WA.  I knew it wasn't a plane crashing down or a meteor because it had no smoke billowing from it.  I recorded the part where it shaped into a ball from its fireball shape.  It was a very bright silver metallic that reflected in the sunset.  However, the recording is saved onto my snapchat so I am unable to post here... Yesterday, my friends and I went to Willow Grove Beach in Longview.  We stopped at Baker's Corner like we normally do to get tea and such for the hot day ahead of us (we have had record heat already).  When we got to the grove, however, this man came up to us in a van and told us that the park was closing in ten minutes.  I wanted to tell him, ""Oh, okay, thank you,"" but all that came out was, ""Oh"" and I turned around and walked to the beach.   I don't know what came over me, but I was very afraid of him, as were my friends.  We swam for a while with some friends, and once our friends were with us they stopped patrolling.  During our time in the water we noticed that there was a party taking place further down the beach and the security had not stopped to inform them of the curfew.  We stayed for maybe 30 min until another van came down the trail with its light flashing.  They were headed for us, so we rushed out of the water to my friend's truck.  They followed slowl! y down the trail.  They were both wearing sunglasses and they were pale, I didn't look at them long.  We left and went to eat at a restaurant in the sister town, but after dinner, I realized I had forgotten my purse.  It wasn't in the restaurant, so we had to drive all the way back to willow.  My chest hurt as we got closer to our destination, it was almost hard to breathe.  My friends seemed nervous as well.  It might have been because of the creepy security men before, but it felt much heavier than that.   As we started down the 2 mile stretch of road to the beach, the truck began acting strange.  The lights flickered and turned off then on and the brights turned on etc., and at first I thought it was my friend messing with the lights until she said, ""Did you guys see that?""  I looked up from my phone which was glitching out and focused on the lights on the road.  They turned off for a moment, the radio was disrupted, and it was eerily quiet.   Then the internal lights turned on brighter than I had seen them and the windshield wipers started ging at full speed, the gages twitched and flickered and then everything went dark.  We could see under the moon and decided to turn around in a farmers driveway right before the boat launch.  The lights came back and we took off.   We all felt sick and sufficiently spooked, and as we turned left back towards the highway, a huge white owl swooped down behind the truck and into the tall grass on the other side of the road.  We got back to our friends after midnight, which was strange because the grove isn't very far from where she lived. What do you all think?  Is there a correlation between the strange curfew and the strange security van men?  The owl?  The ufo?",2017-07-07T00:00:00,46.1933,-123.0548

There were approximately 200-300 lights in a clustering.  The closest comparison I could think of would be similar to a school of fish or tadpoles.   The objects were paler than stars (like almost a blue, but not quite), and the light they gave off seemed less concentrated than the stars in the sky around.  The group moved like a school of fish slowly towards the horizon, with a few straggling behind the group.  The group did not move in a straight line like a meteor shower, but rather as if something floating along.

As I've seen several UFOs over my house, some recently and reported herein, I thought maybe I'd see another one.  Sure enough, a bright light, about the size of Venus at its brightest, caught my eye to the southeast.  It was very slowly traveling to the northeast, slower than a regular airplane.  Altitude I would guess to be about 10 to 15 thousand feet.  As I closely observed the light and its movement, it suddenly dimmed, and went out.  I had the distinct feeling that it knew it was being watched and didn't want that.  For several more minutes, I kept my eye on that quadrant of the sky but did not see it reappear. No sound from it, or any flashing lights.  It was just a bright, bluish white round light.  I believe that if someone wants to spend the time looking at night, eventually you will see them.

Object hovered in western sky before vanishing My husband and I were driving from Tekoa, Washington, to Spokane, Washington,  around noon last Saturday.  We were nearing the southern side of Fairfield, Washington.  My husband pointed to the north and about half jokingly said, ""Look.  A UFO.""  I looked and replied, ""Oh, that's a plane.""  As we got closer to Fairfield, we continued to watch the object, and the more we watched, the more we became convinced that what we were looking at was something out of the ordinary.  I would call myself a UFO enthusiast, though this was my first sighting.   My husband is a confirmed skeptic, but even HE couldn't say what the object was.  It was cigar shaped and white or silver.  It moved at a pretty good rate of speed from the North to the West.  We lost sight of it for maybe 30 seconds as we entered Fairfield.  When we saw it again, it was sitting stationary in the western sky.  I found this odd.  I said to my husband, ""If it hadn't been going so fast, I would say it's a blimp.""  It was also way too high up to be a blimp.   When we got further into Fairfield, we lost sight of it again, and as we exited the Fairfield city limits, we could no longer see it.  It was simply gone.  Anyone who has been through Fairfield, knows it is very small and doesn't take long to get through going north on the highway.  It might take a minute so it didn't make sense to me that the object was just gone.   It was a clear day and should have still been visible.  I didn't take pictures or video because my husband's windshield was quite dirty and I was afraid the object would be hard to see.   Thanks for your time.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,47.391,-117.1828

It was a single source of soft, off white nondescript light.  It was a single light source not resembling navigation lighting, and it appeared to be glowing.  Its size, though, was about what you might expect had it been an airplane at 30,000 ft.  Its intensity varied irregularly and greatly as it travelled rather quickly across the sky.   I have seen satellites pass over before, usually as a steady faint light, and twice in a regular sort of flashing, indicating rotation or tumble.  That's what I figured I had here at first.

It almost looked like a bunch of angels fighting or like a “battle between good and evil” was happening in the sky. I turned left onto 43rd, Ave SW and started heading east toward Meridian Street, a busy main road that runs North/South down the center of Puyallup.  I called my friend, who also lives in Puyallup, to tell him about the amazing cloud formations I was seeing.  He looked out the east-facing window of his home, a couple of miles away from my location, and agreed that there were some interesting looking clouds in the sky.  He asked me to take some pictures, so I quickly took a few images with my camera phone, an ASIS Laser 3. Later, when I was looking at the pictures on my camera, I also noticed what appeared to be multiple “faces” in the cloud formations.  Two days later (June 27), I was showing these faces in the clouds to the same friend I had called earlier and he immediately noticed an object in the sky near the clouds.  He said, “What is that?…That’s a UFO!”  I was stunned because I hadn’t noticed the object in the picture before this time. We looked at the other two pictures I had taken and noticed the same object but in different positions in the sky.  The object had obviously been moving because it’s the only thing changing locations in the picture.  Everything else is stable, or in the same location: streetlights, the sign, trees, and reflections from the dashboard of the car onto the glass. I still don’t know what to think of the object.  I’m not a “UFO person.”  My friend, though, is convinced that it cannot be a reflection in the glass, an airplane, a balloon, or any other familiar/manmade object, and so urged me to report it.

This is a follow-up report from a posting I made about my similar frightening encounter back in Kentucky in 1968.   This is somehow important, I truly believe!   I was around ten years old at the time.  My three first cousins and I were playing basketball in the street, at the front of our subdivision homes.  We were all bouncing the basketball around in a circle, when we heard a loud roaring/swishing noise coming toward us.   We immediately looked for the source of the loud sounds, and saw nothing.  We thought it was just and aircraft of some sort.   As we continued playing basketball, we all heard the roaring/swishing noises getting louder and louder approaching us.  Again, we all looked around, and again, we all saw nothing!  Not a single thing was seen anywhere in the clear blue sunny sky.   Then, in an instant, it all of a sudden was hovering directly over our heads, and the roaring - swishing sound was deafening!  The machine seemed to be large and massive, too.  Suddenly, a powerful massive yellow light shined down upon all of us while the roaring/swishing sound continued over our heads.  Everybody was blinded.   We yelled out for each other, but we were lost and separated.  We could hear each other's loud screaming voices, but could not see each other at all.  The noise was amazing.  I even held my ears at times during this encounter, and each time I tried to look up at what was over our heads doing this to us, the bright yellow light was blinding - like looking up at the sun!  I could only see a few feet in front of me, and none of my cousins, either.   After what seemed like twenty minutes, the bright yellow light overhead suddenly just went off and the roaring/swishing object, whatever it was, flew away at a great speed.   We all just stood looking at each other with our mouths gaping wide open in terror and amazement.  ""What was that?""  ""What happened?"" we were all repeatedly repeating?   After a couple of weeks or so after this incident, one strange day our entire elementary school classes was ""ORDERED"" up to the inside front hallway of our school to get a so - called  flu vaccine shot?  Our elementary school was located near where our UFO incident had occurred.  We got a shot alright!  I received a shot-mark, ""V"" Inverted Triangle, stamped on my forehead that day which is is still there and very visible today.   My girl first cousin got a ""O"" Circular Mark stamped on her forehead, still highly visible today too.  Later on, when I went home from school that day and my Dad saw the strange ""V"" mark indented in my forehead he got very angry, he stated that shots ""ARE NOT"" given in the forehead, and he called the elementary school to see why I was given a ""V"" Inverted Pyramid Mark on my forehead.   After a few minutes of yelling and arguing with them, he just suddenly put the telephone phone down and never mentioned the incident again.   ""What happened Daddy?""  I asked him.  ""Just forget it,"" he said.  I knew that he had been threatened.  My Father was an Ex-U.S. Army Soldier and afraid of nothing, but this incident rattled him a lot.   I have never forgotten this amazing incident and we three surviving cousins talk about it still to this day.  I am telling you the honest truth as I well remember it.  This incident really did happen!   Me and my surviving two first cousins remember that bizarre day very well, to this day too!  Back when the incident happened, I didn't even know what an ""V"" ""Inverted Pyramid"" was, but I found out a few years ago.  Today, after some investigating and research, I truly believe that all four of us cousins were ""abducted"" by that invisible UFO that day and we can' remember it.   For some strange reason I have seen several UFO's in my lifetime, and had many other strange paranormal encounters too.  They continue to this day!  My girl first cousin has a paranormal life too!   Whoever sent you that short 2017 message, I just wanted to tell them that they are not alone - it happened to me/us as well.  These things are real!   I have now worked for the U.S. Government ((office deleted)) for many years, and ""WE ARE NOT ALONE!""   Thank You,  ((initials deleted))",,36.7847,-86.2119

UFO Sightings The sky was black—one of those moonless nights with crisp air and unending visibility.  If memory serves me it was early in the winter of 1974. I had just concluded a late-evening insurance appointment on Grantland Avenue west of highway 99 in Fresno, CA. Between 9:30 and 10:00 o’clock, I headed for my home in Rolling Hills on the Madera County side of the San Joaquin River.  The most direct route from Grantland Avenue was to take Herndon Avenue east to Blackstone and then north on Highway 41 to Avenue 10. A mile or so west of the Sierra Sky Park I noticed what looked like an airplane, roughly 500 feet above the ground preparing to land at the tiny airstrip.  Small planes landing here were not uncommon so I paid little attention to it.  But I did notice that its rate of descent was considerably slower than an airplane.  Maybe it’s traveling toward me, I reasoned.  The closer I got to the airport the more attention I paid to the object’s flight pattern. After seeing how slowly it was moving I ruled out the possibility of it being an airplane, and thought it was a glider.  The only other logical possibilities were a hot-air balloon or a helicopter. When I clearly saw its oblong shape I ruled out these possibilities too. Curious, I pulled off the road onto the soft shoulder, came to a stop, and turned my engine off. I got out of the car and listened carefully for any audible sound. Nothing. Not a whir, not a click, not a sound! The windowless gray object wasn’t hovering. Instead it slowly drifted in a northwesterly direction across Herndon Avenue toward the airstrip about a hundred feet above my head, still continuing its descent. I felt sure it would land but instead it drifted west and began following Herndon Avenue back toward highway 99. I got back in my car, turned around, and followed its white light. As I picked up speed it picked up speed. The faster I accelerated the faster it went. Then in the blink of an eye it pulled away from me, its intense white taillight receding into the black starry night. What was that? I thought. The traffic on Herndon that night was non-existent. In 1974, Herndon Avenue was little more than a two-lane country road. I’m calling the airport when I get home. Maybe they’ll have some information. Someone surely saw that. Once home I called the Fresno Air Terminal control tower directly, which you could do in the early 70s. “Has anything odd shown up on your radar screen the past thirty minutes?” I asked. “No sir,” the air traffic controller answered. “Why, what’s up?” “How could you have missed it?” “Missed what?” After explaining my encounter he said, “Well, for one thing it would depend on its altitude and location relative to our radar equipment,” and then continued with some additional mumbo-jumbo about how radar works. As I slowly calmed down from my excitement I explained to him in detail what I had seen. “You know, that’s really odd. Someone else called me from near the Sanger River bottom earlier tonight relating almost exactly what you’ve described.” And the following week I was northbound on highway 41 south of the San Joaquin River Bridge, when I noticed a bright-white light in the sky similar to the one I’d seen earlier. I felt sure it was an airplane and continued observing it as I crossed the bridge. As soon as the object reached Avenue 10 it took a laser-like ninety-degree turn to the left and accelerated out of sight at an unbelievable speed. Many people have experienced sightings of UFOs. Many scientists and the military downplay their existence because nine out of ten sightings can be explained by other phenomena. Some people claim they were abducted, with a small percentage of these asserting that medical experiments and who knows what else were performed on them. Since that time I have listened to stories and accounts of UFOs with interest on one hand, and with reservation on the other. Most of these sightings involve objects shaped like discs or triangularpatterned groups of objects. Nearly all first-hand accounts have not described what I saw—an oblong-shaped craft. With the advent of the Internet I have revisited the subject hoping to find photos or stories that more closely mirrored my experiences. My search uncovered only one sighting that described something similar to what I saw. This incident happened near Mansfield, Ohio, on October 18, 1973, and was widely recognized as one of the most notable UFO sightings that year. I was amazed to find how many similarities my encounters shared with this documented UFO sighting. Here are a few samples: “Cigar-shaped metallic object with dome, body lights, light beam, apparent lifting force…” “hovering relationship” “The object appeared solid…red light at the nose, a white light at the tail…” “No turbulence was felt and…heard no sound…” “…the object accelerated and moved off to the west, showing only the white “tail” light as it receded, and made a distinct 45 degree course change to the right, heading toward Lake Erie.” “On the ground, the driver and passengers of a car saw two lights, one red and one green… At first they thought it was a small plane flying low…heard no sound…its unusual qualities caused the driver to pull over and stop.” There is no doubt that what I saw was real. It was just out of my realm of understanding. I haven’t witnessed another sighting since, but will continue to search the skies for unusual events ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Early 1977 at the GA Acad. for the Blind in Macon.  I heard a trumpet fanfare.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible abduction.

It was a residential school for the blind back then, and there were four students per room. On this particular day, I awoke sometime between five and six in the morning, and as was so often the case, I simply decided to lie there until it was time for our house parent to awaken us at 6:30.   All of a sudden I heard from across the room what I can only describe as a sort of trumpet fanfare.  It came from high on the wall.  I’m guessing there was only a second between the fanfare and the startling thing that happened next.  I heard my dear, sweet friend suddenly emerge from the exact place where the music came from.  It sounded to me as though he simply came through the wall, and he was sobbing as he was turned over in mid-air and then dropped on his bed.  He cried for a few more seconds before he went to sleep.   I can assure you I did not go back to sleep.  I can also say that the boy who slept in the bed next to mine had also been wide awake, and he heard the sound of a brass fanfare too.  I know he did, because I overheard him later that day humming under his breath the exact notes that had come from high on the wall.   I never did ask my dear, sweet friend what happened to him.  After all we were only seven years old at the time.   The following school year I heard that he had moved to another state, so I never got the chance to ask him about this terrifying experience.  Who in the world (or from another world) would have taken my friend out of his bed in the middle of the night, and where did they take him.  Whatever they did to him made him sob, and whoever brought him back just dropped him on his stomach on the bed.   I would gladly answer any further questions you might have about this most unsettling experience from early 1977. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Thanks so much, Peter, for getting back in touch with me as quickly as you did.   I have been carrying around this story inside my head for forty years, all the while wondering who would believe such a thing.  The person who overheard the sound of the brass fanfare and who rehearsed it perfectly later that day is name ((name deleted)).  He presently lives in Atlanta.  In a phone conversation seven years ago, I asked him if he any recollection of the incident.  Alas, he had no memory of the experience.   The primary person in the story is named ((name #2 deleted)), and I wouldn't even begin to know how to contact him.  It seems as though his father was in one of the branches of the U.S. military, and was connected in some way to the State of Alaska.  I did not report the incident to anyone at the Academy For The Blind, and as far as I know, ((name #1 deleted)) didn't report it either.    In all your years of gathering and sorting through U.F.O. stories, have you ever heard anything like what happened to ((name #2 deleted)) in March of 1977?   Most curious of all in some respects was the brass fanfare ((name #1 deleted)) and I heard just before ((name #2 deleted)) materialized in mid-air.  What occurs to me now even as I type this is the possible link between ((name #2 deleted)) having been abducted, and his father's serving in the military.   Blessings to you, Rev.

Of course, let me know if there is anything else I might contribute to the burgeoning literature on abductions.   One question for you, (and it's probably one you get all the time), will I ever know what happened to ((name deleted--abductee)) that morning?  What was it I heard back in 1977?

On the night of Monday 26th June, I was working night shift on an oil rig in the Southern sector of the North Sea.  I won’t give the name of the oil rig but the closest marker to it is buoy 62144. We are not allowed cameras or phones outside on the platform as it is a hazardous area and it is an ignition risk so I will try my best to describe what I seen.  It may be a bit clumsy. At approx. 2330 hours, I was working outside and needed to urinate.  Rather than go up the many flights of stairs and all the way into the accommodation I decided to urinate over the side, into the sea. I proceeded to the South side of the platform and in front me was what at first I thought was a helicopter, we sometimes get emergency flights at night. Once I had taken in what I was looking at it was clear to me I wasn’t looking at anything I had ever seen before. It was very close to me and close to the surface of the sea. I will try my best to describe it--A large oval shape, cannot say what size, as there is nothing close to gauge it against.  I am guessing it was the size of a medium sized plane.  It had coloured lights around its centre, and these were moving from left to right, changing from red, blue and green.  It had a large amount of white light emanating from the bottom of it, this is why I thought it was a helicopter, it looked like a massive searchlight focussed on the sea.  It was extremely well lit up. It didn’t appear to be moving, or was moving very slowly at first but more looked like it had just surfaced from the sea. There was another red light much further and higher to the South of this one. I watched it for approximately 20 seconds, then decided to fetch my two work colleagues. By the time we got back it had flown a considerable distance but was still clearly visible. It was heading in a Westerly direction.  By this time the shape wasn’t discernible but the lights around its centre were still flashing from left to right but this time only appeared to be red. The stand by boat for the rig was close by and was pointed directly at it.  There was also a reasonably sized manned rig over to the West. Regarding sound, I was working in a reasonably high noise level area and had ear defenders on but I didn’t hear anything.  If it had been a chopper for example I would still have heard something as there are about 6 flights a day on here and you can hear them even with ear defenders on. The light that was coming off it wasn’t exactly subtle and it was clear it didn’t care about being seen.  I am struggling to process exactly what it was I did see. I am glad my 2 colleagues also witnessed it, albeit at a much further distance.  It was like nothing I have ever seen and until my dying day I will never see anything like it again. I have looked on line to see if any images come close to help me describe it and the one that looks most like it is the Roswell photo.  The colours best to describe it are in an image of a ufo with Tom Delonge. I’m attaching both to help with my description. I am stopping to tell people now because I am not being taken seriously and am in danger of being seen as nut- which is fair enough, as I know how it sounds.  I hope you believe me, you must get loads of these, but if not I feel better just for sharing. I want to document it officially before my memory of it starts to cloud.  (It never will), but don’t know how. I also don’t know who to contact to see if any other witnesses who also spotted something but this is a start.  If the crew of the stand by boat were looking outside they couldn’t miss it. Looked very much like the black and white photo but the lights around the centre were like in the second photo. The light at the bottom was slightly different, appeared to be more than one. I will never forgive myself for not getting a photo or filming it.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,,

I work as a security officer at a building in Louisville.  I was outside driving the parking lot in the patrol vehicle, when I happened to look up and spot an object, triangular in shape, but rounded at the corners, moving across the sky very slowly.  There was no noise from the object, nor any lights emitting from it.  It was 11:45pm and the sky was partly cloudy.  I could see a few small clouds in the sky near the object, and could determine that the object was not a cloud as it was moving slightly faster than the surrounding clouds.  At night in the city, clouds have an orange color at the bottoms as the street lights of the city reflect off of them.  The object however didn’t have the same coloration at the bottom.  It was of a darker grey color at the bottom, with a lighter gray color on the top.  I was viewing this object at its left side.   My patrol vehicle was facing west, and the object was moving east along with the clouds.  The object did not ! have a shiny surface from what I could see.

I stared at this object for several minutes and it seemed to be at a very high altitude and just stood there motionless.   After staring at the object, I noticed a strange feeling as though they were surveying the entire Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.  I also had a strange feeling as though they knew I was watching them.  It is hard to describe, but it seems there was some kind of telepathic presence.  It made me feel slightly uneasy.   After watching the object for approximately another five minutes, this bright small dot of an object just ""popped"" out of view.  One second it was there, the next, it was gone.

Right over the street about 100 feet in the air is a sight I will never forget.  My wife and I saw three glowing spheres of pure golden white light.  The middle sphere was the same size thereabout as the basketball hall of fame building in Springfield, Massachusetts.  The other two spheres were by its side and were much smaller.   You can’t really say one sphere was on the left and the other on the right because they were spheres.  All sides are continual and perpetual.  But from my perspective one small sphere was on the left and the other was on the right of the large sphere. This craft would oscillate its light and shimmer.  It moved from side to side and when the craft moved, all the spheres would move together as one body.  Their movement was as if the spheres were connected by some kind of rod, but no such thing was visible.   This was not your typical alien space craft.  It wasn’t a take me to your leader kind of craft like a round saucer plate with a bubble on top or a cigar shaped thing.  It wasn’t a weather balloon either.   I never believed that aliens or spaceships like this ever existed.  I never believed stories of space ship photos.  So now what do I do?  I am looking at an amazing space ship.   It made no sound, not even when it flew away.  And when it did fly away it moved in a beautiful graceful curvy pattern and just flew right up into the stars until it blended in with them and ultimately just disappeared from sight.  They were not in the earth’s atmosphere anymore.  They were in space.  They made it look so easy, and Nassau makes it look so hard and sloppy.   This happened on Sam St. Enfield, CT., 06082.  We were looking up at the craft in a north easterly direction.  It was practically 100 yards from us and about 100 feet in the air.  My best guess.  My wife said she saw this same craft when she was younger, a mere child, and I never belived her.  She was angry at the craft when it flew away saying she wanted the driver to get out and introduce himself.  She said his name is ((wife's name deleted)).

So, I am recalling all of this almost a year later, but there were quite a few witnesses there with me that night and I think it would be interesting to compare our experiences.   I was living in south Nanaimo with 3 of my friends as roommates, and we were housing a couple friends who had been traveling.  Our house had a deck on the second floor with a great view of mount benson from south nanaimo.  We were all hanging out on the deck as it got dark we noticed a bright light like you would see on a plane stationary in the sky above Mount Benson.  This light was very bright and it was hovering in the sky at about the level smaller planes fly at.   We took a look at the object through a pair of binoculars and although it was hard to keep steady I could make out yellow red and blue lights along the outer edge of a disc shaped object that looked as though it was spinning.  I could see the different colored lights rotating around the edge of the object.  Beneath it looked li! ke glowing blue tentacles resembling a jellyfish's.  All my friends looked at the object through the binoculars and saw the strange spinning disc.   The object stayed in the sky for the next few hours as we lost interest.  About 3 hours after we first noticed the UFO my friend and I were sitting outside again and I was drawn to look at the object again.  Just then, I saw a huge bolt of lightning shoot up FROM THE MOUNTAIN towards the UFO.  The lightning bolt stopped a few stories below the object, and I alerted my friend, asking if she had seen it, and in the next moment a huge flash of light in the sky above the UFO.  My friend saw the second flash of light and we watched for awhile, after that, but there were no further flashes.  The sky was clear with no clouds.  There was no sound coming from the object.   It continued to hover in the same spot for a couple weeks, with no movement or further flashes of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I needed to get an approximate size.  To get a more accurate size of UFO I held up my fingers on my right hand very quickly because the UFO was travelling extremely fast..  My pinky finger at arms length matched the size of the UFO. The bright moving UFO passed from over our home from a northwest direction in a perfectly straight line to the southeast. It was difficult to determine altitude.  I'd take a guess and say higher than most man made aircraft. The event only lasted about twenty too thirty seconds.   I never forget the experience.

After observing the object for only about 10 seconds, I realized I was looking at something very unusual.

The object was nearly due north of my location (approx. 350 degrees) and fairly low on the horizon (approx 15-20 degrees).  The object appeared to be at a great distance, at least a few miles away, but distance, size and altitude were hard to gauge without any point of reference. The object appeared to emanate a greenish white light or glow.  The sun had set just a while before and could have been illuminating the object.  The object or craft made very erratic high speed maneuvers unlike anything I have witnessed before.  The shape was indistinguishable due to what was perceived to be a great distance to the object.  There were no clouds in the immediate area of the object.

Around 2137, lasting for nearly 7-10 mins in total before they slowly floated up into the sky and disappeared. I looked out into the nights sky and over the foothills south of town, I noticed several objects in the sky that were much brighter than the stars and far too close to be a satellite or aircraft.  These objects simply sat there looking like they were floating in a way.  They could be described as looking like large fireball like items in the sky.  There were 6 of them all aligned evenly across the nights sky.  Then, 1 of them slowly started moving away by going up  Into The Nights Sky Slowly,  To All Of A sudden it would just disappear out of nowhere.  This happened until there were only two left. The strange thing was a Blackhawk police helicopter all a sudden took off from downtown and flew right near the objects where it stayed for a min then turned around and came right back downtown.  Shortly after the helicopter arrived back downtown there was all of a sudden out of nowhere a 3rd light that appeared next to the other two lights still hovering there and it literally appeared out of nowhere in the nights sky. I was able to get these objects on film, and to this day, I still have no clue what those objects were, but I do know one thing after seeing the way they moved and could disappear and reappear out of nowhere they were not of human origin.

My father ( 1926-97) recounted the following sighting to me in the 1960s, 70s and 80s:   He recalled that he was a day laborer on the Conemaugh-Blacklick Railroad working with a sledgehammer on the track.  He had been on the job for several days on a crew of dozens to perhaps a hundred or more workers.  It was a sunny, cloudless day with a deep blue sky.  He guessed that it was mid-morning to mid-afternoon.   All of a sudden, someone said something like:  ""Oh look!""  He looked up and saw a gigantic silver disk travelling at an incredible speed.  People gasped in awe.  After reaching a point in the sky, it came an immediate halt, hovered for many seconds to maybe a minute, then dropped a mile or two, hovered, shot across the sky, hovered, then disappeared.  It made no sound and left no vapor trail.  It had no ornamentation, but was a clean disk.   Dad had never seen a UFO before and did not believe in them, nor was he a particularly religious or superstitious person.  He had been discharged from the Navy in December 1949, where he had driven a landing cra! ft since 1944.  He said he had been trained to judge size and distance and had used antiaircaft guns in some of his engagements in the South Pacific, as well as his ship's 14-16"" guns as a fill-in.  He estimated this UFO was approx. the size of four football fields, and travelled at speeds exceeding any aircraft he had ever see, which included some of the early jets.  Only a missile well into its flight might have equalled it.  But it stopped on a dime!   The next day, he came to work and was told he was no longer needed.  He had not  checked to see if it was reported by the local media and had not gotten acquainted with anyone, but he did recall talking about it with somone who worked next to him.  Later, he did see the movie, ""The day the Earth Stood Still,"" and remarked that it looked alot like that craft, but he said it was much larger.

We were 5 boys  I will not use our names  But B was the youngest at about 9 years old S and G were both were about 12 and R was about 16 and K was the oldest at about 17 years.   B woke me up and was scared pointing in the direction of the UFO and he looked frightened I tried to calm him down in case he fell off the roof so that we would not get into trouble because he was the youngest and our parents would go ballistic and we were all in sleeping blankets on a small roof which made it hard to move around.  He was just pointing behind me and saying what is that, what is that, what is that light and I heard a voice that said in English calm him down and tell him everything will be OK and it was a very Authority like voice in my head and while I was trying to calm him down he was pointing over my shoulder and I turned and there it was the craft I have mentioned.  R one of the older boys was suspended in the air flat as a board still in his sleeping blanket.  I just stared at it and B was still behind me waiting for me to do something about the situation.  I was just memorized by the black bulb where the voice seemed to telepathically emanate from because it was still telling me not to panic and everything was going to be OK, no harm was going to be done to us, they were not going to kill us or take us and I felt calm and was just focused on it and not B who was just huddled behind me.  I started asking it questions with my thoughts and not my mouth on what they were and what they wanted and why did they have R floating near them.  It told me a lot of information very quickly and I cannot remember all of it, but what I could gather is that they lived a million billion zillion miles away and have been around a long time and we were not that important to them supposedly because we were like flakes of skin in that we had a purpose or function, but it was not a great importance, as the brain is, compared to flakes of skin (I hope this makes sense remember I was only 12 and this was 1982)  I started asking lots of questions as in, because why and I do not understand and explain it to me and then I felt B panicking and yelling again because he was frightened for me because to him I was just silently sitting there staring at the craft and as I looked across the shed I wondered why no one else was awake but us two and the voice told me to just go back to sleep and not to worry about B and that is the last thing I remember until the sun woke us up at around 5 to 6 six in the morning. We all got off the shed and headed back to the house B started asking everyone what happened the older boys told him very angrily to shut up about it and when we went into the house and went back to sleep and we slept for at least 18 to 24 hrs. and our parents tried to wake us because they thought we were sick or something because we should! be running around watching television and playing.  We never really talked about it to anyone else as far as I remember and it was just put aside like nothing happened because we were OK so what was there to complain about. It reminded me of the old Bell H 13 Helicopter from the TV show Mash but a little longer tail section mixed with the look of a small submarine like the SEAmagine Aurora.  It had a large black glass bulb in front with a metal structure as the tail with real bright white lights maybe 4 like flood lights.  It just hovered about 15 - 20 feet away from us made no noise. The black glass bulb front was real BLACK as in a real shiny Onyx stone.  The metal looking tail structure where the lights were looked more like the outer structure of a small sub or helicopter because it had the lights attached there and sort of metal beams like the helicopter tail but stuck to the body of a small submarine but hard to make out because of the bright flood lights blocking my eyesight from that body and tail section.  The front had no lights just this big black glass bulb as seen on the helicopter or small submarine and if anyone was sitting in it   I would guess the bulb part could hold 2 people comfortably.  The body or tail section once again hard to tell because of the lights but was not too big so maybe another two people.  The whole craft was about the same dimensions as the Bell H 13 helicopter.  The Glass bulb part was Black and the body was a dull gray metal. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

At 23 years old I had grown up in Virginia my whole life and my soul just knew there was much more to see and do.  Little did I know, just how much more there was.  So I bought a motorhome and headed out west.  I had stocked the motorhome with enough food and camping supplies to last for months and set out for Boulder, Colorado.......free, single, and on top of the world.  As life has it, I was only there for a couple of weeks and ran into a gal from South Carolina who was on a similar journey that changed all that. After a short time of running the streets of Boulder together we left out for the Four Corners area, where Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico meet.  I had met a group of new friends she was hanging out with that were our age and we decided we would all head deep up into the national forest and live off grid for a month or so.  Upon arriving, the dirt road we took up into the forest was a little perilous and saw us more than once with a road span of 9ft, in a camper with a width of 8ft, and a sheer 200-300ft cliff off the passenger side.  We were all glad to arrive safely and the group of us set up camp using tents, tipi's, hammocks and some makeshift shelters.  Her and I were kind of spoiled in the camper with the comfort of heat at night, a cooking stove and a soft bed to lay our heads. After a month or so it had started to get pretty cold in the mountains and we decided to part ways.  A small group of us piled up in my motorhome and made our way back out of the woods, back to the highway and set off for our next journey to Sedona, Arizona.  For those who aren't aware, Sedona is home to of one of a small handful of vortexes on the planet.  A vortex or vortexes are areas of concentrated energy rising from the earth. Many people believe that Sedona has several vortexes or power spots, making Sedona a highly sought-after spiritual and metaphysical destination. As you approach the town of Sedona, even though its in the desert, you have to go down a very long steep and winding road.  The brakes on the camper started to make noise and by the time we got to the bottom, they were completely shot making a fierce grinding noise. The first place I could pull into was the local Post Office and I immediately parked.  Running low on funds we weren't exactly sure how we were going to solve this problem.  By coincidence, if you believe in such things, as we exited the camper, a man was just parking to go in and must have smelled our dilemma.  It just so happened that he was a local johnny on the spot mechanic, and after a brief explanation from us he offered a hot shower and to fix the breaks for free. He directed us to roll the rest of the way thru town and told us of a free camping area about a mile on the other side.  A few hours later he arrived with a friend and tools and within a short time they had replaced all four brakes.  We were very grateful..... We ended up staying at this very primitive camping area for about a week and during that time him and his friend came by a frequently.  We kind of befriended his friend more than him. He was about 7 ft tall with the build of an pro wrestler and we soon found out he had anger issues.  After some time together, his friend, a little more mild tempered, invited me and my companion back to his family's home to take a break from the road and to get a home cooked meal.  After intruding on his family for a few days he and his wife asked if we wanted to go to a good place in the desert they knew of to camp.  It was just outside of Cottonwood, Arizona, which was the next town down the road. As we approached the area I noticed I was in a completely different environment than ever before.  The cacti were everywhere and the sagebrush truly rolled.  The only thing higher than a basketball goal was one mountain range with no trees about a mile away.  It wasn't even a camping area, we just kind of pulled up into the middle of the desert and the only sign of human life were some rocks piled up in a circle for fires.  We all had planned on staying in the camper so it didn't take too long to set up camp. After a light lunch we all decided to go for a desert walk and probably stopped about 3/4 a mile from camp before heading back.  As we were walking and talking I started hearing from a distance behind us a high pitched noise that progressively got louder, the more we walked.  The next thing I knew the couple we were with, not saying anything, started to pick up their pace.  The closer we got back to the camper the louder and louder the noise became till all four of us were at a fast jog.  We threw open the door to the camper and piled on top of eachother getting inside to have a few dozen wild hogs all about a foot and a half tall stampede under and around us.  The camper swayed as they passed by. We stayed in the camper for some time after that but getting hungry and out of cooking propane we decided enough time had passed for us to build a fire outside.  Dinner was good and it had been a long day and the couple we were with wanted to retire so we thought we would give them some space and grabbed a few blankets and headed up on the roof of the camper to bed down for the night, letting them stay inside. Getting caught up in conversation with nothing but the stars and our new found love for each other, hours must have passed and it was probably approaching midnight when I first noticed how beautiful that plain old mountain range looked in the eve of night.  The moon was high behind it, making it really stand out.  It was then that I noticed what looked like a Jeep or some kind of all terrain vehicle on the cusp of the hill which was only about three humps rolling out of the earth and probably only 1000ft high at there peak.  All's that I could make out at that time was what looked like a large headlight traveling along.   Finding it a bit unusual I continued watching as it traveled at a slow pace along the curvature of the mountain till I noticed it had turned towards us and seemed to be leaving the mountain.  That's when I nudged my new friend to take a look.  Within about 3 minutes,which seemed like 20, it had traveled from the top of the hill to almost overhead of us and I could feel her scootch herself close to my side. It was probably the size of a half of a football field with slightly rounded corners on the bottom and almost as tall as it was long, more rounded at the top.  There were multiple pairs of very oddly colored red and green lights not in any kind of symmetrical order on the bottom that seemed to be twisting more like a barbers pole than flashing.  It made no noise...that's 0 noise...and we were in the middle of the desert so you could hear everything. It slowly made its way over our heads only about 3-400 feet above us and had slowed to 5 mph as it was directly above.  As it traveled past us about another football fields length we watched without blinking as it went into warp speed and within about 6-7 seconds it was out of sight doing a slight twisting incline as it went...still never making a sound.  We both looked at each other in the darkness of night both knowing what we had just experienced, hoping it was over....but it wasn't...... As we sat on the top of the camper quietly contemplating what had just happened, these perfectly round bubbles started appearing all around us on the ground.  They looked like thick plastic with a dull light in them and we heard scurrying in the brush.  I wasn't clear if the scurrying was due to what was happening or maybe rodents getting out of the bubbles way.  I had chills running down my spine and goosebumps all over.  This lasted another 5 minutes or so till they just slowly disappeared......and we were ok..... This young lady later became my wife and after 2 decades we love to share this with anyone that will listen.  Most people don't really believe but we know different. Seeing is believing. It changed our lives forever. **So I did a little research and it seems the mountain where I was facing outside of Cottonwood, Arizona, is called Mingus Mountain.....Just thought I'd share that. It was right at the highest peak when it came towards us.... (Feel free to share our story, it is true and I took the time to make it accurate, because it is important)...",2017-06-02T00:00:00,34.7582,-112.01179999999998

I walked out to the middle of the road and shouted ""hey!"" and waved to see if anyone was outside that I could see.  Then I noticed the light started to move slowly.  I backed up to my usual standing spot and watched as it moved diagonally towards the road and me at a 45 degree angle.  It matched my distance from the road and moved parallel to it now towards me.  It moved slowly as it got closer I realized I still didn't know what it was.   I became terrified.  It looked as though it were made of chrome, and it was slightly larger than a car.  It was shaped like a bloated triangle with rounded edges and corners with two white lights on one edge.  The lights weren't all that bright, but I noticed its movement was not related to the lights.  It moved towards me with an edge at the front and a corner to its rear and both the lights were on its right rear edge.  When it was directly above me it stopped.  It sat above me motionless, and silent.  Within about a minute, it vanished.  Something wasn't right about the way it disappeared.  I'm not sure if it moved up until it blended with the clouds, or if it literally disappeared.  It must have seen my bus coming down the road because as soon as I realized that I couldn't see it anymore, I heard the bus engine in the distance.  I didn't tell anyone about it though.  For the next few years I payed close attention to anything unusual above the neighbors house.  I saw the same thing again the next spring when daylight savings time changed.  The second time I just hid behind a tree and waited! for the bus.  When I heard the bus I looked and it was gone.   I saw it again a few months after that and decided to stand in my usual bus spot and ignore it. It disappeared within a few seconds though. The strangest thing about all of this is that the UFO was always above the neighbors' house.  The guy who lived there was a simple farmer, and his son had advanced multiple sclerosis.  He was basically a vegetable.  The teenager had died a few years later from what I heard.   I don't know what it was that I saw, and I don't have a clue what it was doing.  I can't say I believe in aliens, and I know I don't believe other people's UFO stories, but I really don't have a clue what that thing was.

My mother was outside smoking a cigarette around 11 p.m. in June of 2011.  She was looking over at our family farm when she spotted a white oval hovering over the farm.  She came inside and told me what she saw.  I called her crazy until I went outside and saw it for myself. At first I assumed it was a lost airplane.  However it was not moving.  Also, it's worth noting that the nearest airport is MILES away and the nearest big city is hours away.  Our town has more cows than people, and the residents are mostly elderly farmers.  We both agreed we needed to check it out because we had animals to look after, as well as private property to defend. As soon as we got into my mother's car and crossed the road, it started to move.  We followed it towards the back of the farm.  Suddenly it disappeared so we stopped and waited.  There was no noise, not even crickets.  Suddenly it appeared behind us to the south so we reversed and continued to follow it as it randomly descended and ascended.  It led us back north before disappearing once more.  Then it reappeared again with a second oval.  They hovered in the air for a few minutes before suddenly taking off and disappearing. We've never seen either one of the ovals of light again.  Both of us have good mental health, good eyesight, and decent instinct.  The reason I hadn't reported it was due to the fact no one would believe us.  So I soon forgot about it.  But this morning my mother brought it up and we tried to figure out what it was again, and I felt it was time to finally report it.

My languages are German, English, Hebrew and Macedonian.  Regarding the lights, I can definitely say that they were not Chinese lanterns, they were much too high or too far.  I know Chines lanterns, saw them many times in Germany. You must know that we are in the desert, surrounded by Bedouins, and of course military.  At this specific day there was no holiday, festival or whatever might give a reason for speculations of other kind. I understand that the photos are not clear and unambiguous.  The lights were drifting from the right to the left.  The peculiar thing is that the sighting left a deep impression on me, and believe me, I am a very down to earth person.  I read some of the reports you attached, and the similarity is quite remarkable.  Well, I won't dwell on this too much, I do want to thank you for your attention and your response.  You may post the photos.   Kindly,   ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2017-07-14T00:00:00,,

As indicated previously, only small planes fly in the area - contrails etc. are VERY uncommon.  Doubt this is related but thought it an odd coincidence.

I observed two closely spaced (in time and space) sightings on July 4th.  First object crossed sky, a point source, star like, about the brightness of Saturn, following an arc from about Arcturus in Bootes across the face of the moon (or behind?) and disappeared near the planet Saturn.  Assuming the object fell into Earth’s shadow, it was slightly higher than LEO.  From the fact this object was noiseless, covered the distance in about 12 seconds and using the ISS for reference it was travelling about 80 miles/second, or about 5 times orbital escape velocity in LEO. The next series of star like objects occurred about 10:05 (p.m.?), when I noticed a bright object, about 5 moon widths to the west of Zubeneschamali in Libra, after noticing this first object, about the brightness of Saturn.  Within a second or two, two dimmer objects, the first about ½ degree north of Zubeneschamali, the second directly north about 3 moon widths.  The effect was to create an isosceles triangle, with the base composed of two dimmer stars and the brighter star at the apex forming a triangle pointing to the west.  The three objects slowly moved to the north, but disappeared before moving a Moon’s width (1/2 degree) and within 2-3 seconds of the 10:05 sighting of the apex star like object. I have verified there were NO satellites of sufficient magnitude to have been mistaken for the objects.  Neither were the objects asteroids or meteors, there was no ionization trail, and there are no visible Earth-crossing asteroids at this time.

Hard to say.. But here is an account of the incident.  I fell asleep on my couch in Columbus, OH at around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on 7-8-17.  Then I woke up on my back, inside of what I equated to being an enclosed tanning bed-like apparatus.  It felt as if I was traveling at a high rate of speed and the ride was very turbulent.  I began to look around and one of the things I remember seeing is a worn down ""yellow labeling"" on the inside of whatever the hell I was enclosed in.  The next thing I know, at least my head was no longer enclosed as I saw an alien take an object and touched my forehead with it and I was ""out cold"".  I woke back up on couch in the exact same position I fell asleep on with my CPAP on just as it was prior to this ""possible abduction"".  I had no fear, not sure why..  In the ensuing minutes after waking up I tried to make sense of what had happened.  There was no missing time, I was back up within a half hour. Had a sick like feeling in my stomach, open waking up and its been on and off all day. Description of the alien I saw:  Structurally, it was similar to many of the common air craft aliens we see in our American pop culture documentaries (Short around 3 feet, thin body, big dark eyes, funny shaped head) accept this one had rather dark scaly skin, not true gray.  One the the things that stood out was the wide of its arm and forearm, it was the equivalent of a broomstick width the arm was the same width as the forearm.  I was unconscious seconds after he put the object between my eyebrows and forehead. Other information about me which you may or may not find relevant. Since the age of 8 years old I have been an experiencer of sleep paralysis -entity attacks, but even before this the paranormal world seemed to antagonize me at a really young age.  I can remember some things just before the age of two.  I've had thousands of negative nocturnal (non physical) attacks by paranormal entities, like smacking, prodding, choking and senses manipulation (I've also had a few positive ones like when I was tapped on the shoulder after falling asleep while feeding my infant son a bottle which caused the nipple to go adrift from his mouth.   Lately, I'd say within the last year, I've seen very bright lights in my dreams on more than one occasion.  I have been ""spiritually probed"" several times, mostly in the back of my head - cerebellum, but also in the navel and unfortunately my fudge tunnel a time or two. I'm not psychotic or mental, I've never done drugs, and rarely consume alcohol.",2017-07-23T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

Well, I was working nights on a drilling rig in Pinedale, WY.  Elevation is about 7,500 ft, and 100 miles from any big towns, so I get to see a lot of the night sky.   While I was in the back yard of the drilling rig, I looked up and noticed a star-like figure, which hadn't been there the last 14 nights.  I started really looking closely at the object, and noticed it changing colors...red, blue, white.   I instantly thought, well, maybe it's a plane or drone, but seemed to high of altitude, considering the mountains around me were 11,000 ft higher then the horizon.  I called my co-worker on the CB radio, and said hey check this out.  And he responded ""what""  I jokingly said, the UFO in the sky.  He also brushed it off as a plane, or some commercial aircraft, until it didn't move like any plane.   We then began radio chatter which got a few other employees attention as well and they came to the back of the drilling rig to see what all the UFO talk was about.   As we talked, we came to the conclusion maybe it was some kind of satellite.  We also had a debate about maybe being some kind of planet in our solar system, but that would explain the size and color changing orb that it was.  So I went about my work day ever now and then I glanced at it and it stayed in the sky until 5:30 am, when the sun came up.   I got off work around 7:00am, and started my travel back home heading to Casper, WY.  through he south pass of the mountain, and saw some pretty out of the ordinary traffic.  At least 20 white cargo vans all following each other, heading towards the area we had seen the UFO.  4 of the vans had trailers, 2 black enclosed trailers, and the other two had flat bed bumper pull trailers with telescopes.  I then thought to my self, well maybe it was some kinda of planet, or some kind of star searching club was going to check the night sky out.   Finally reaching my house in Casper, Wyoming, slept the day away, because I was working nights for the past 14 days.  I then told my girl friend what crazy things I saw at work and the way home.  She kinda gave me a look like that's crazy, or maybe your crazy.  But we stepped foot outside our house and seen 3 star like orbs again flashing in the night sky.  Did a little research on the internet and I am not only the only one who has seen something like this but there is videos on YouTube of the same orb like figure.

My date is approximate, I know it was a summer night in 2007.  I lived off a small road, Fisher Ridge, that was pretty quiet and calm.  Nearly every night I would walk out the country road and call my girlfriends on my cell phone.  This night I turned onto Highland Farms Rd, and just as I got to the top of this hill, I had this feeling that a car was coming up behind me. I turned around, and approaching me, just above the treetops at approximately 50-100 feet, was this V shaped aircraft.  I remember it moving very slow, like 10 mph slow.  I looked up and saw that it had multiple lights, 1 at the peak of the V, and 2-3 going down each side.  It was so close to me that it lit the dark patch of woods I was walking through with a pale white light.  It was almost silent, but was so close I heard a noticable whooshing sound from the air around this huge craft, and it made the leaves of the trees start to rustle..  it was close enough that I was fairly confident it was an actual V shape, with open space between the two sides, not just V lights on a triangle shape.  It passed over me in maybe 10 seconds, nice and calm, and I could make it out for a small while longer until a hill blocked it from view. I was 16 when this happened, I remember being very confused at first and thinking it must be a low flying marijuana helicopter using thermal scanners, but then it was silent at very low altitude.  I thought maybe it was a jet, but it couldn't have flown so slowly without falling out of the air, or without sound.  I won't ever forget it, its one of the most mysterious moments of my life, and I was all alone in the country side with no one to share it with.

It was late spring 1999.  I want to say it was mid- to late-May, as I clearly remember it was warm enough to have the windows open in the early morning.  I was preparing to attend a local community college that coming summer, so that was 1 reason I was up that early. The other reason I was up that early was because I have been a radio hobbyist since I was 6, when my father turned me on to shortwave radio (I'm 41 now).  I branched out into AM & FM DXing, CB, scanners, & Radio kits.  I would often get up early on days with clear skies to try & catch the early morning ""skip"" of CB operators on the East Coast & the Caribbean. That morning, I was sitting next to the open living room window in the 14' X 56' mobile home I lived in with my best friend's father (I was paid by the state of WA to live with him & be his caregiver), we lived on the northern edge of a small mobile home Park on the corner of US HWY 2 & Rambo road.  The window faced North.  To the north were open wheat & hay fields for miles, until they reached the small mountain ridges to the extreme NW of Spokane, which were directly north of my location. I was tuning around on a Cherokee CBS-1000 base station, when a slight movement out the window caught my eye.  I turned to look and saw a bright white light flashing rapidly blinking way off to the north.  It was just starting to get light out, but the sun had not yet risen.  After about 30 seconds, the light stopped blinking completely.  In its place, I could barely make out a small darker colored object hovering in the sky over the small mountains, some 4-5 miles away. At 1st I thought I was imagining things.  So I got out a pair of 12 X 50 binoculars & looked. In the dim light, I could clearly see a ""typical ufo"" shaped, grey colored object.  As I watched it, it seemed to be getting larger, & that is when I realized it was moving towards me. Now mind you, directly to the south of my location was Fairchild Airforce Base.  To the NE, directly North of Airway Heights, which I was about 1.5 miles west of, was a NORAD radar installation.  Also, directly North of me, about 1.5 miles, was a NOAH Doppler radar station.  About 3.5 miles to the NW was a ""top secret"" underground medical warfare research facility (it was widely known about around Airway Heights, 1 of those secrets everyone knows). Anyways, as I watched the object slowly grow larger & larger, I eventually put down the binoculars, and watched it with my eyes.  It slowed moved across the sky in my general direction, about 30-40 feet above the ground.  After a couple minutes, it passed over the railroad tracks about 1/2 mile N of my location (it's the main East- West BNSF & AMTRAK line), and it suddenly stopped moving.  It sat motionless about 10 seconds, then it slowly sank towards the railroad tracks, until it was about 10 feet off the ground.  It again sat motionless for about 10 seconds. It then rose back to it's original height, about 30-35 feet.  It sat there about 20 seconds, then a rapidly pulsing red light appeared underneath the object.  It appeared to be aimed at the ground below it, but I am not sure what it did, if anything.  The light disappeared after about 10 seconds. Then, the object rose slowly to about 100 feet in the air.  Suddenly, my neighbor to the west of me, about 60 feet away, her dog started barking like mad.  So I leaned out the window, & her dog was on his chain, on his hind legs, staring at the object, & barking a lot.  I noticed my neighbor, a woman in her late 40's, was standing on her porch, also watching the object. So, I got up & went out on my porch.  I yelled over to her, do you see that thing up there?  She turned suddenly & said oh my Lord, you can see it too?  We then both turned back to look N at the object.  By this point it had been hovering at about 100 feet for a full minute.  As we both watched, it slowly started to move off to the N.  When it was about a mile away, it suddenly shot N at an incredibly high rate of speed, and began to ascend.  Within about 3-4 seconds, it was completely out of view.  Just after it disappeared into space, I saw a brief flash of light, like when a plane is high overhead & the just set sun shines off of it. Suddenly, the air raid sirens at Fairchild went off.  Within a couple minutes, 3 UH-1 Hueys flew over the mobile home park, headed N in formation at about 300 feet in elevation.   Right after that, I heard jet engines going into afterburner, and 2 F-16C Fighting Falcons took off from Fairchild heading west, then immediately banked & went N at a very high rate of speed, at about 800 feet in altitude.  I soon lost sight of the fighters, but the Hueys slowly moved back and forth over a large area from the NW to NE.  They briefly hovered over 1st the underground germ warfare lab to the NW, then the NORAD station to the NE, then over the NOAA Doppler station to the N. I wwnt back inside, but continued to watch from the window. The Hueys then started heading back to Fairchild. When they got close to the railroad tracks, 1 Huey broke off & lowered until it was about 20 feet above the railroad tracks, while the other 2 headed back to the base. The Huey above the tracks, its starboard side door opened, & I watched through my binoculars as an airman in a flight suit & helmet with mic, lean out the open door with what appeared to be some sort of sensor.  It was white, and had two 1-foot long tubes that came out the bottom.  The soldier pointed the object at the ground, in the same approximate area the object hovered & set off that pulsing red light, & he pulled a cord out of the Huey, plugged it into the side of the white hox, then he would look down at the ground, then look back into the Huey, while talking.  The Huey slightly moved around a few times, then the airman got back in the Huey, the door closed, the Huey rose to about 60 feet, & went back to Fairchild.",2017-03-10T00:00:00,47.6446,-117.5933

I was winding up a day of working around the property, brushing.It was in that part of the day where the days summer heat was starting to wane down.  I was sitting in a chair that faced NNW looking down the valley towards the town of Hayfork.  We lived about 7 miles from town in a very mountainous rural area, with sparce populations of people.   I was on the phone talking to a friend of mine on the coast, when I spied , what looked like a slow moving craft of some sort coming down the valley moving in a SSE direction, basically heading right straight at me.  I was talking to my friend and was telling him, I think a marijuana spotter helicopter was cruising my way.  It had what appeared forward facing lights of a strong intensity that were very, very bright even in the waning sunshine.  It just kept coming toward me, ever so slowly and without any sound.  I thought this very strange as it was close e! nough to hear the noise of a helicopter, if it was a helicopter.  It was to low and flying way to slow to be a fixed wing plane.  So, this peaked my attention, big-time, and just sat in the chair and kept talking on the phone to my friend telling him what I am seeing.It just kept coming towards me and the lights began to move in a haphazardly way without any type of directional pattern, one would see on a normal aircraft.  As it approached , even closer the light slowly evolved in to one big mass of very, very, very blinding silverfish white light, like a giant arc-welder light in the sky.  All this time it was very low to the ground maybe 150-200 ft., but because its light was so strong I couldn't make a real good measure of height.  It finally arrived over me and it cast great light through our trees, because we lived in the forest under a canopy of Douglas Fir trees.   Absolutely no noise came from this craft and at that time, I told my friend on my wireless phone I was watching a! U.F.O. hovering over me and the house.  It was so damned bright! I absolutely could not make out any type of shape.  It appeared to be a big mass of flames , hovering in the sky.  I got out of my chair, still on the phone walking under it as it moved to the SSE up the mountain behind our house.  It gradually rose higher in the air to negotiate the mountain and so I started up the hill trying to I.D. this thing.  It went behind a dense bunch of canopy and I expected to emerge out on the clear side of the branches, but it was gone.  It just disappeared, almost just like turning off a household light at night it, it was just gone.  The whole time I was on the phone with my buddy describing it to him and he just listened the whole time.  The phone never made any type of noise, since it was a cordless house phone; it remained clear and no static.  I have never seen anytype of flying craft like that before, so I am totally convinced I witnessed a real close encounter with an unkown type of U.F.O craft, what ever they are.  This all TOO true and kinda wish I didn't see it, let alone it being so close to me over-head!!  Thanks!! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

About 9:30pm, I opened my eyes, looking straight up into the sky and saw a very, very faint V-shaped  object silently passing over me.  It wasn't very high at all, maybe 1000-2000' up. I muttered something to myself in surprise as it continued in a generally northern direction. Size?  It was at least as big as a passenger jet. Why there'd  be a UFO so low over the island of Negros Oriental is hard to guess, but there was definitely something up there!  It was so faint that if I hadn't been looking right at it when I opened my eyes I wouldn't have seen it. I doubt if anyone else saw it because it was so faint.  No noise and no lights on it.

Our two-story house sits on the north side of a street that goes east/west.  We are directly at the end of a T intersection.  Another street starts at this intersection and goes south. On June 15, 2017, at 19:30 (7:30pm), I was doing some planting in front of the house.  The sky was clear and the sun was nowhere in my line of vision.  Standing, I had turned and was facing a large flat window on the house, about 3.5’ from me.  The window faces south.  Because of the thermal properties of the window, during daylight it is difficult to see anything inside, and everything outdoors is clearly reflected back.   I happened to be looking at the distinction of everything reflected and saw a bright white sphere, approximately 20” in diameter, travel east to west about 35’ directly above our street.  It was traveling about 41 mph, if my calculations are correct.  It did not waver up, down, or side-to-side.  It appeared to be following the street.  There was a slight visual softness about it that I consider to be an aura.  It produced no audible sound.   I turned around to face the street and search the sky to see if it might return.  I’m still standing there one minute later (with the house to my back) when directly above me I see the sphere re-appear about 10’ above my house, going north to south at the same speed as before and again, absolutely no audible sound.  This time, when it gets to where the edge of the street starts in front of the house, without hesitating it dips down about 5’ and continues to fly straight south.  I noticed, instead of flying directly over the road like it did when it went from east to west, it flew about 15’ to the west side of the north/south road and flew just above the tree tops.  There did not appear to be any comet’s-type tail or other lights, only a complete bright white sphere.  I immediately recognized it as being the same type as I had encountered twice previously. This sphere is the same, if not identical, as what I saw and had hit my car while driving on the interstate on August 26, 2016, (3 miles away but also at the same time of day - please see that report) and also on October 22, 2016, (same location as now on the street that intersects with ours but during the night and that one flew south to north and further to the west off the intersecting street – was also witnessed by another person – please see that report). For more than 20 years, we often stargaze at night, watching stars and satellites.  These white spheres are unlike anything we’ve ever seen.

We walked out on the nearby porch and observed a burnt orange light to the north at about 40 degrees above the horizon.  It was a distinct orange light, with no discernible dimension to the naked eye, with a brightness comparable to the headlight of a commercial jet. We watched this light for several minutes from the kitchen porch, and observed during that time two successive white lights drop vertically downward from the orange light.  These white lights quickly faded out after their emission from the orange object, approximately 1 or 2 degrees below the object.  My impression was that the white lights moved faster than one would expect for freefall, while my brother thought the motion was consistent with freefall. Somewhat excited, we raced to the roof deck for a better view.  By the time we got there, a minute later, the object was no longer visible.  We looked in the location of the sky where it had last been seen, which was the constellation Cassiopeia, for a minute, or so.   Suddenly, a bright orange flash erupted near the middle star of the Cassiopeia constellation, that persisted for a split second.  As that occurred I thought I saw a faint streak of light angling upwards at 60 degrees to the left of the flash.  We observed nothing after that. When on the lower porch, earlier, we examined the object with 10 power binoculars, but it still was very small, seemingly pointlike.  My brother thought it had a round shape.  We considered that it might have been a Chinese lantern, with the white objects being flaming pieces of wax falling out of the lantern.  But its brightness, combined with its small angular size, as seen in 10 power binoculars, seemed to exclude that possibility.",2017-07-14T00:00:00,43.2335,-72.2962

I look up, seeing seven very bright lights, traveling in a nearly straight line, traveling in a north to south direction, at about a 50% angle from the horizon, above us. The lights were much brighter than the brightest star in the sky--perhaps 10 times or more brighter. My first reaction was one of being very startled and concerned.  This did not look like anything I had EVER seen in the sky before...and I was at first concerned it was something dangerous.  After it continued past us, I was less concerned, and just very curious at what it was. The lights did not make any sound that we could hear...and the night was overall quite quiet.  The lights continued on their path, coming in and out of the clouds in a southern direction, for about 6 minutes or so...as they faded out of view and into the clouds in the distance. Hard to get a good read on their altitude, but they were significantly higher than the relatively low clouds that night, and perhaps a fair bit higher.  If I had to guess, I would say 5,000 - 15,000 feet.  But again, I'm no expert at altitude distances. Unfortunately, both of our phones were charging in the other room, and by the time we thought to get pictures, the lights were out of sight. To describe the lights in more detail:  Seven (maybe 8) very bright, white lights, maybe 10 times brighter (or more) than the brightest star in the sky, traveling in a nearly straight-line formation across the sky.  They were traveling in a nearly single-file line, with a couple of the lights slightly out of line. The lights were very close together -- all 7 seven of the lights were approximately contained in the outline of my fist when my arm was completely outstretched.  They seemed to be traveling at the approximate speed of an airplane.  They were traveling at a constant speed.  They seemed to be either twinkling or blinking... not all at once, but at a constant rate...maybe every second or so.",2017-07-23T00:00:00,38.798958214042266,-77.09513265167007

I was taking my normal spring break fishing trip at our lake house south of Pell City, near the Coosa River.  The best way to explain this is to explain the lay of the land a bit.  The property has a steep drive downward to the house.  Being fairly remote in the woods, trees are everywhere and right against the driveway.  We had wooden steps going up to the 'front door' of the house and the wooden porch continued and wound around to the actual front of the second floor of the house.  Above those steps on the top (Second) floor is the window of the room I was sleeping in.   I woke up in the middle of the night just after midnight.  Light was flooding the room.  There was a noise very loud.  Is was a roaring near deafening roar like that of a jet engine.  What in very unusual about this, is the lighting.  It seemed to come from everywhere.  I never moved.  I barely breathed.  I was simply struck with fear as if someone was searching for something or someone.  At first, I thought it was a truck from the street, but that did not match up.  If a car was on the drive way it would have to be a good ways behind the house to even attempt to angle the headlights into the window of my room which was parallel with the driveway.   There was another mystery, the noise.  I remember thinking, maybe it's the police looking for someone.  But that did not make sense either, because they would be using a helicopter over the forest.  What ever it was, was not making the normal whup-whup of a helicopter.  This was a loud roar.  Though I could not see it, I seriously felt as if it was below the tree line in order to highlight the window.  The trees were too high by the house for any helicopter to safely be right above with all the trees around it.  It seemed to stay a long time, which ended up being around 10 minutes simply shining a very bright light on the whole house and through the window right above my head.  This will sound very odd, but it seemed! as if the house was 'being scanned' though no effects or any other lighting was seen.  I remember being simply too scared to move, and too scared to breathe.  I remember thinking thought, ""There is no one here.""   I cannot say for sure, but it felt as if I was hearing other thoughts within my own.  I really expected to see something walk right down the hallway.  Though I never heard walking on the porch, it was as if the idea was placed there like 'we should'.  Though I never left the bed, I felt as if my perception was changing in some way.  It was very strange.  It was as if this mystery craft was right next to the house hovering above the street and below the tree line.  I distinctly remember thinking to myself, ""If I don't breathe maybe they will go away.""  I was saying the Lord's Prayer, and other silent prayers, and trying so hard to not breathe.  Here is the rub, that made me go, ""What the?""  The roar became even louder, and then the craft or whatever it was, was simply gone.  It left almost instantaneously! .  The Doppler Effect was almost missing here, thought I heard it 'leave'.  There was no hearing anything lift off.  No tires crunching the gravel or concrete.  It went from being there, to simply not being there.  I had the hardest time going back to bed that night afterwards.  The next morning I checked the porch and the tree branches hanging over the driveway.  Everything seemed normal.  What woke me up that night, I am still completely clueless.  I never stayed up there alone to go fishing after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2017-03-10T00:00:00,33.59098360655738,-86.32157540983607

I closed the bar at 11pm, as per my boss's instructions. There just wasn't allot of business in this little high mountain town in the Sierra Nevadas, so we closed early.  However, the bar up the road, White Pines, about 1/2 a mile, did stay open usually until 2 am, and I often went there after closing my bar. So, this one particular night, I closed my bar as usual, and everyone else was gone by now--I was by myself, and as I was descending the broad steps to the empty parking lot where my 4 wheel drive Toyota pickup was parked, I looked up into the beautiful black night sky that was star filled, as was so often the case in this mountain town, I saw in the sky, just above the tops of the tall pines, this strange, long string of colorful lights!  They were almost like a string of Christmas lights, doubled or tripled over, with a wasp-waist dip in the middle of the string. I was just astounded!  I watched from one of the steps, as the lights moved from the North to the South, slowly, but steadily.  There was absolutely no sound. I was thinking about what it could be.  I went through all the possibilities in my mind, and there was nothing that could be man-made that this thing would fit.  I was positive I was seeing a UFO. It continued across the hwy, that's Hwy 4, a two lane small hwy, that was also empty of traffic, (typical at this time of night) where I got a really good look because there were no trees there to block my view, and watched as it continued across the sky over the pine tree covered hill to the South, and silently disappeared. I started being afraid, and ran to my truck, and got in as fast as I could.  Then I thought it was pretty silly to think my truck could protect me from anything as advanced as that, if they really wanted me!  I started my truck, and headed to the White Pines bar, as planned.  I was going to meet a friend of mine there.  She was coming up from the town of Murphys, about 20 miles down the mountain to the West. I thought to myself, ""I'm not gonna say anything when I get to White Pines, they'll make fun of me!""  I want you to realize that the people in this small community knew each other, and that these small town bars were where friends meet.  I knew at this time of night there'd be a handful of people, who all knew me. So I parked and went into the bar, and as my friends greeted me, I spoke out:  ""I just saw a UFO!""  I just couldn't help myself!  They did give me a bit of a bad time, but after only a short time my friend from Murphys came through the door, and she heard us talking about what I saw, and she said she'd just seen the same thing!  She'd been driving up the mountain, coming to meet me, when through her windshield she saw a string of lights, moving from North to South, at a slowish speed.  It also had the multiple strings, with a wasp-waist in the middle.  She was driving so wasn't positive there was no sound, but she didn't hear any sound. There was one difference in her sighting:  the lights were not multicolored as I saw, but blue and white. I was really glad to have my story corroborated! I think she was too.  I was glad, after all, that I'd said something. It's been years, this is the first time I've ever put it in writing, but it sure hasn't faded in my memory.

The light was bright and steady, not pulsating, and the object made no sound.  I watched it travel across the dark sky, trying to determine what it could be.   Then another identical object appeared from the same area as the first one, and followed the same path.  One object was trailing the other.   When both objects were clearly visible at the same time, I ran to the house to ask my husband to come outside quickly.  For two to three minutes, we both watched these two orange-red spherical objects travel from west to east, although they seemed to be not perfectly round, and looked to be somewhat flattened on the top.   There was a distance between them but they followed the same trajectory.  The trailing light passed into a small thin cloud and disappeared first.  Then the leading light passed into a larger, more dense cloud and dis! appeared second.  Then they were gone. After that, the sky seemed clear except for a passing airplane.  I resumed walking the dog and then to our surprise, about two minutes later, another orange-red light just like the first two appeared, again from the same area on the western horizon and traveling eastward.  My husband was still outside and witnessed it, too.   About 30 seconds later, there came another light from the same place.  This set of lights traveled approximately the same path as the first set, were also a distance apart, and both lights also passed into thin clouds and disappeared, but this set disappeared almost simultaneously.  They didn’t travel as far as the first set did before blinking out. The objects did not have lights on them; the spheres themselves appeared to glow brightly.  None of the four objects appeared to be at an extremely high altitude.  The lights of the passing airplane appeared to be much smaller and not nearly as bright as the unknown objects.

It was brighter than all other stars or planets, and 50% bigger than Venus.  Did not look like the space station, which is smaller, moves much, much faster and which appears closer to earth.  Went inside to grab camera and binoculars, light was still there, but began to slowly fade away.   Red light plus slight shadow of a solid object were the last parts to be seen.  We have quite a bit of air traffic in the area, and this looked nothing like an aircraft.",2017-07-07T00:00:00,38.2433,-122.4602

It was a very clear sunny day and there was a University of Oregon game going on nearby at Autzen Stadium.   An airplane was flying overhead with a banner trailing it, like they often do on game days.  I stopped to bring up the video recorder on my phone because I was having a hard time reading the sign and wanted to blow up the image.  My husband asked me what I was doing and you'll hear him in the video saying, ""Coors Light,"" because he could read it (without being a dork like me and video recording it).  You can also hear someone else yell ""woah"" in the background, and I am not sure what that is about.   It wasn't until much later that I was watching videos on my phone that I noticed something come into the frame of the video in the upper corner by the plane and flash by.  It's moving at a very fast speed and seems to be fairly low in the sky.  What is crazy to me is it looks disc shaped, or partially disc and cylinder shaped, when you zoom in on it.

On my way driving home from a evening dinner with my wife, we stopped at an intersection at a red light with no cars in front of us (front of the line) with very possibly no cars behind us and little or no cars going through the intersection.  The sky was clear (no clouds) and dark (black sky).  Then, as if a light switch had flipped on and in the corner of my eye, I noticed a bright white light very high in the sky and off in the distance.  Then in an instant that light seemed to beam directly down towards the ground and did so very quickly and appeared to leave a trail of light as it moved to the ground.  As quickly as the light appeared it had moved towards the earth and disappeared out of sight. There was no sound that I had noticed with the light.  It definitely was not a meteor or something as the way it moved was as if it was 'warp' speed (light really high up in the atmosphere then beamed straight downwards in a straight line towards the ground). I had asked my wife if she had just seen that and she agreed that she did.  It was something that was completely unexpected and left us both in wonder at what we had just witnessed.

Flashes of light and missing time. On Friday, November 18, 2016, we had another family encounter. Unfortunately it was during a snow storm so little detail about the craft was perceived. The winds were easily over 80 km/hr.  Visibility was zero due to snow and sleet, during wind gusts  We live out in the country side, about 10 minutes outside of Thunder Bay.  Earlier in the day at around 3 pm we went to town to pick up our kids from school.  The weather was horrible already, but we had to go to grab the kids. Carefully we drove and navigated the ice covered streets, picked up the kids, stopped for an early dinner and decided to hit up a walmart to grab a few things before heading back home. It's about 7pm at this time.  The weather seemed much worse.  The roads in the city were slippery, but still navigable. As soon as we got onto the country road, it was apparent that this storm was hitting us full force. It was pitch black out asides from my cars headlights. It was stupid to be outside in this storm, so I drove very slow with my hazards on.  At times we had to stop dead in road due to total white outs. About 1 km up the road we noticed that no houses had any lights on. That's a tell tale sign there isn't going to be power at our house. We went around a corner and in the middle of the road is tree bits everywhere and to the immediate right is a tree on the power lines. After about 30 minutes, we made the usual 10 minute drive home.  Sure enough no lights on. I pointed the car towards the house and instructed the family to each grab a bag and bring it to the house. We have been using the back door due to reno's in the front. So the wife and kids made their way to the back of the house with the aid of my high-beams in the drive way. Once they were in, my wife flashed the cell phone through the bay window in the front, signaling they are in. I turned off the car and made my way to the house.  Tree branches were breaking due to the high winds. As mentioned it was pitch black outside - I pressed the remote car lock on and off so the car lights would flash, providing some illumination, while I made my way through the snow drifts and into the house. Once inside, it was apparent the hydro had been out for awhile. It was about 15 degrees Celsius in the house. Thankfully we have a wood stove also. We had the kids sit on the couch with a flash light.  The wife lit a few candles in the living room and grabbed the dog to bring him outside for a pee, and I grabbed the wood bucket to go to the shed to get a fire started in the woodstove. I used the cell phone flash light app to find my way to the wood shed, the wife stood in the middle of the back yard with the dog while he did his thing. As im in the shed grabbing wood and filling the bucket I faintly hear my wife scream over the howling wind "" WTF ""  At first I thought she was yelling because she fell over or something, then she screamed my name. I came out of the shed and she started screaming ""Did you see that, did you effin see that""  I had no idea what she was talking about, I started making my way over to her.  The snow blew so hard that I lost visibility of her for a brief moment and I dropped the cell phone in the snow. I took the 10 steps to get to her and she was screaming, ""The sky just lit up blue above the house, the ground, everything turned blue then white.""  I looked to the back window of the house and the kids were screaming.  Smacking on the sliding glass door.  We ran into the house. The kids were crying and screaming ""what was that, what happened""  They were freaking out. My oldest -12 years old,  said something was outside our front bay window, and everything in the house turned blue then white. I was dumbfounded, I didnt know what to think because I didnt see anything. My wife and kids were Both crying. I felt so confused as to what happened. My head was pounding, and everyone else was extremely emotional. Then while we were all standing by the back sliding glass door, the only way i can explain it, it was like a light came through the window and instantly flashed from red to a bluish green than disappeared. I was more confused than anything and said WTF just happened I said out loud. It felt dream like. My 12 and 8 year old were crying and screaming ""I want to go""  my wife was flipping out, panicking and I just stood there. Because I felt like it was all just a dream. I started asking my wife what did the blue light look like outside, and asked her to describe it. I said Could it have been someone with a flare, or a roman candle, ect. My wife yelled at me, "" I dont know what it was, but the first thing I thought was a UFO and that it was the end of the world.""  The end of the world I repeated?  She said yes, as soon as I seen the light I felt complete dread. She looked completely terrified. I tried calming everyone down and said it must have been lightening, or something caused by the storm.  (I personally have never seen lightening in a snow storm, but I know it can happen.) Then I said it must have been a electrical transformer blowing up. I asked my 12 year old, what exactly did you see. She was crying and holding on to me saying a bright blue light was at the window, it came into the house, turned blue then white.  Then the candle flames got really big and the cats freaked out. Just as she said it, the room went bright from another window on the opposite side of the house.  We all turned towards the window, but it was gone. Again every one started crying and yelling. I tried to calm them all and said to sit on the couch, ill get a fire going quick. My wife stood in front of the big bay window, watching to see if it happened again. I think about 10 minutes went by. The fire was going, then my wife said,  There it is look! It's  out over the trees. I looked out the window and there it was.  A bluish white ball of light. Hovering Above the trees, across the road.  Probably 450-500 meters away from the house. It just stayed stationary there while all of us looked at it.  It looked about the size of a quarter in my fingers, if I were to hold it up at arms length and on the closer side to 500 meters away. I dont know how long we stood there watching, but it was almost a hypnotic feeling.  We all stood there staring. suddenly i snapped out of it and looked around. My living room was filled with smoke and the wife and kids were still looking out the window. I panicked and yelled for everyone to get to the back of the house.  I was very confused now, I looked at my watch and it was now 9:30 pm.  It was 35 minutes since I started the fire and started watching out the window. The wife and kids for the first time this night, calmly turned around and went to the back door. I opened the wood stove door and messed around with the fire and told the wife to crack the back door to let the smoke out. During this, I looked out the window and the light was not there. I had everything under control after about 5 minutes with the door open, the smoke was cleared. We all sat back on the couch, trying to get warm. The laptop had juice in it so I put on a movie to watch while we waited for the hydro to come back on. After calling the hydro company they told us that it wouldn't be restored till 6pm tomorrow due to the storm.  We all huddled together in the living room on the couch in front of the wood stove for the rest of the night. The kids didn't mention the event once until they fell asleep. The remainder of the night was uneventful. The next day while the hydro crews working on the power down the road, I pulled over to talk to them.  I asked one of the techs if any transformers blew in the area around my house. They said no.  A tree downed the main power line 10 minutes from my house. The same tree that we noticed was on the road as we drove home the night before, after the power had already gone out. Things of note: no drone nor helicopter could have operated in these conditions…  I know because I have my private pilots license. Winds were above 80km p/h, trees were coming down all over the place.  Total white out conditions at times. This is just one experience that I have had. I have had many of the same nature. My grandmother and My mother have had these experiences. I have had them all my life, and now my youngest daughter - 8 years old -is mentioning things to me about things she is experiencing.",2017-03-10T00:00:00,48.39341445783132,-89.3034545180723

It was early afternoon and I was driving in Minneapolis.  The object was in a northerly direction.  I saw a very large rectangular prism just hanging there in the sky.  It was just beyond the tree line, the tree line about 4 city blocks away.  It looked like it was hanging over the city's lakes area.   It was off-white in color with brown outlining the edges and outlining other rectangular shapes within the object outline.  Interesting detail, the off-white was dirty and dingy, like it was old and well used.  It didn't move, it just hung in the air.  It was close to the ground too.  Usually, when I think of UFO's, I imagine them like the movies; high in the sky, flashing some lights, flying around, then speeding by, and disappearing. It did disappear, but not by speeding away.  It just vanished, it was there one second and gone the next. I discounted what I saw, I don't know why.  I don't want to be a conspiracy person maybe, sorry no offense intended.  Now, I don't know what I believe.",2017-03-10T00:00:00,44.98078334423014,-93.29330787839163

So, 15 minutes or so later, as I am driving east towards Hwy 97, I couldn't help but notice, THE MOON IN FRONT OF ME AGAIN.  In front of me while driving west and now, a few minutes later, it is in front of me again, but this time driving east...........I have to say, this really freaked me out.   Thanks for reading!
