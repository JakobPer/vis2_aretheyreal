I looked up and could see the plane by its lights and some reflection of the resort lights as it headed off in a ESE direction out over the ocean.  It was flying at about cloud level.  It was not traveling at a great rate of speed. Something caught my eye that at first I thought was a meteorite.  It came from over my head/shoulder traveling in a northern direction (along the coast).  It made no sound.  It moved at a very fast speed, then slowed down almost instantly.  It made a sharp move in about a 45 degree angle toward the NW then made a circular move behind one of the clouds and ended up coming almost directly back at me.  It had a single, white light in front.  The whole thing was sort of manta ray shaped and had a silvery white glow (very subtle- which was just a bit more than what would have reflected up from the resort).  It came a short distance toward me then very quickly turned completely around (a 180 degree turn in almost no turning radius) and sped away through the cloud again.  It moved very differently than anything I've ever seen.  It was smallish, like the size of the single engine plane.  It was very organically shaped, smooth.

I was on the east side of the complex, and instantly notice two bright white/red lights due east of my position.  The lights were low in the sky, maybe 5-10 degrees above the “horizon”.  Positioned horizontally level with each other, the lights were separated by about the distance between my hands when my arms were extended straight out from my body.  They lights themselves appeared much larger than any other stars or lights in the sky.  My guess, due to the size of the lights, would be within 1/2 mile of my position.  Neither light appeared to be in motion of any direction, there was absolutely no sound being emitted from either light source.  After observing the lights for about 3 minutes, a third light exactly similar to the other two appeared due south of the original pair, maybe a mile or two away.  From my perspective, it too was stationary.  The thing that caught my attention most was the brightness and the clarity of the lights.  The light was not being “beamed” down or away from the source, nor was it “blinding” in any fashion.  It is best described as “clear and pure” white light, very warm without any pulsation visible.  All three sources emitted the same intensity of white light, which created a “4-point” star effect with two points up/down, and two points each left/right of the source.  What appeared to be emitting from behind each white light source was an equally bright and intense red light, whose points appeared to be along the axis of NW/NE/SW/SE when compared to the white points of light.  I describe the red lights as behind the white lights only from the stand point that the red light spheres appeared to be slightly larger than the white light, and the points of red only shown in between the points of white.  All three lights were much larger than any visible stars.  Also they were larger to any “aircraft” lights as they would normally be viewed.  All three lights remained constantly stationary.  Suddenly the light that appeared after the first two, emitted only a visible red light for about 2 seconds then was “gone” or out of sight.  No noticeable movement or sound was detected.  Then the southern lights of the two original lights appeared to dissipate in the same way: Only the red light visible for a brief moment, then instantly gone.  I viewed the remaining light for another 30 seconds or so, then had to return inside.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

It was approximately ten p.m. and a quarter the way up from the top was a round formation of bluish white lights.   Some of these lights were very dim and some got brighter and dimmer and dissapeared.  It looked as though they were all connected somehow, and I freaked out and told my friend to pull over somewhere.  We got into a parking lot and parked under a tree, and then both got out of the car.  We walked up to a fence and stood there looking very carefully at these lights and we noticed the lights had moved to the top of the mountain.

I threw down my yogurt and we ran into his car, and drove back to our friends house.   I noticed my cell phone died, even though it was fully charged.

It was a fairly warm night with a few scattered clouds in the sky.  The moon seemed to be very bright and since we live way out in the country no traffic was on the road.  We were discussing one of the movies when my wife said, ""Look at that, what in the world is that?"" I should add at this time that I am a licensed Pilot with both fixed and rotor wing tickets along with an A & P Mechanics License.  I have worked in the aviation field since my 2nd tour of Vietnam in 1969 where I was a Door Gunner and later promoted to Crew Chief on UH-1H Huey Helicopters.  My wife has worked at the airport for over 25 years in the main terminal.  We both have 4 year degrees and very good vision.  We are not quick to jump to conclusions about things we see or hear but this did catch our attention pretty fast. In answer to her question I had no idea at all of what the aircraft could be.  It was dull black with lights in several places around the aircraft that seemed to be windows.  There was a purple beacon in the center of the bottom but no position lights or anti collision lights anywhere at all that we could see.  I thought for a moment that it might be a B-2 Bomber but then I realized that the aircraft was making no noise at all and after ""zooming"" up to us it stopped right over our vehicle.  Our windows were rolled down and the moon roof was open as the night felt so good.  About this time we turned into our private drive and made it up to our house which is about ¼ mile from the main road.  This was around 23:20 or so as I remember, my wife agrees with the times that I am putting into this report.  The next thing that either of us remembers was being in the car, it was running but my wife was in the driver’s seat and I was in the passengers!  Since I am 6’5” and she is 5’7” this posed a problem for me in that my knees were killing me from being forced into the dash.  We closed the windows, the moon roof and turned off all the lights and the radio.  After shutting down the car and going into the house we noticed the time, according to our atomic clock, (which is supposedly in tune with the big clock in Colorado), that it was now 02:24 hours????  Where did the time go??  Neither my wife nor I remember anything what so ever after parking the car at our house.  We drove straight home from our friends who live about a mile away from us.  As I stated before we were not drinking nor were we under any influence that would make us see things that weren’t there and we certainly were not in bad enough shape to spend that long in her car with my knees pushed through the dash board!  From what my wife and I remember the aircraft was totally silent, no noise or sound what so ever.  It was triangular in shape, very dull black in color from what we could see, with a purple colored beacon type light at the bottom center with lights in various places around it as if they were cabin windows.  We never saw anyone, we never heard any sounds, we do not remember what happened to the time that we lost, why we were in different positions in the car and why we were sitting outside our house with all of the windows to include the moon roof open?  I did wake up with a headache and my wife felt bad enough to stay in bed for most of the next day.  We hope that this report helps you in some way.  We would like to find out what happened to us, why it happened and what we can do about it.  Please don’t ask us to go to the Government, any branch of the Government, as we trust the drunks that hang out in the alleys of Gaffney more than anyone from the government!   Thank you for your time and please do not hesitate to get in touch if you need more information.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,,

It is a beautiful sunny day with no clouds in the sky. I was on my lunch break from a class talking to my wife on the phone in my car when I spotted out of the corner of my eye what at first I thought was a skydiver as it looked to have a falling motion. I worked at an airport where they have skydiving and have witnessed jumps from the ground view several times. This was a little different as it looked way to high and was moving to slow. At first I was thinking maybe it was a military drop of some kind. I was on the phone so I did not give it to much thought but then it stopped moving all together. I asked my wife to go outside and see if she could see the object as well but she was several miles away and I could not point it out to her in the sky. As I was trying to tell her which way is North it started to move again. This time instead of the falling movement it began to climb and move to the East. At this point I asked my wife to go inside and do a google search for someone to call about something like this which she did and is how I was able to call you immediately after the sighting. As she was giving me your number the object once again stopped. After about a minute in which I was trying to tell my wife once again where it was with no avail it began to move again. This time it moved to the North West and at a very fast speed. It quickly disappeared out of sight. I got off the phone with my wife to call you but noticed two of my class mates looking up in the same direction. They where returning from lunch and saw me looking up in the sky. They spotted the object as well and witnessed it from the first time it stopped to when it disappeared. They both have agreed to give their names if needed. My phonecall with my wife lasted 20m 43s so the entire sighting lasted for a good 12 to 15 minutes.

It dissappeared within seconds of us getting back in my friends turbo-charged car(so it only took about 10 seconds to get back on the road and head after the thing in the sky). The object made no sound and had no propeller on top so this was not a helicopter. This was not a plane and its landing gear. I cannot explain what this was, only that I have spent the better part of my young life studying this phenomena and I have never witnessed something like that in real life. I was terrified and I felt very strange afterward. A feeling I cannot describe. This is the Hudson Valley though and I have been told this sort of stuff has been going on for years.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,41.93857247706422,-73.99030091743118

PD)) The fuzzy, comet-like object seen on December 10, 2007 across the East Coast was apparently a rocket stage from a classified satellite. I live in Smyrna, Georgia, about 12 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta and approximately one mile from the southern end of Dobbins Air Reserve Base. At approximately 6:45 p.m. last night (December 10, 2007), I took my dog for his evening walk and looked up at the sky. I noticed slightly to the south of the zenith a fuzzy patch of light in the sky. It was maybe a quarter of the size of my pinky fingernail at arm's length. I watched it for a few moments, thinking it was a bright star blurred by a cloud, but the night was perfectly clear. I discerned a comet-like shape--a brighter triangular point with a fanned out, fuzzy ""tail.""  As an amateur skygazer, I was amazed that I'd not read about anything like this being visible and certainly had not seen anything like it on previous nights. I called my father at his house east of Atlanta at  6:48 p.m., but there was no answer. I went into the house to get my binoculars and came back outside to get a better view. Through the binoculars, the object definitely looked like a comet, and I could see that it was clearly moving against the background stars. I then called my sister's house in Loganville, Georgia (approximately 30 miles east of Atlanta), at 6:52 p.m. and my father answered the phone. I told him to go outside and look up and when he did, he said, ""Well I'll be damned! What's that?"" ""I think it's a comet,"" I told him. ""But it's moving too fast for a comet and it's not supposed to be there!""  I chatted with my father and continued to observe the comet moving slowly northward close to the zenith. It seemed to get very slightly brighter. At about 7 p.m., through the binoculars I noticed a pinpoint flash of white light just to the right (north side) of the object (the flash was in the same spot as the one noted on the illustration on your website concerning this siting). I told my father, ""Wait, there's a flashing light...that's not a comet. I'll call you back.""  I observed the flash several more times but was unable to determine if it was happening at regular intervals or not. It seemed to flash about once every 30 to 45 seconds at first. The patch of light continued to head north toward Cassiopeia, and its brightness was fading quickly. The last time I saw the flash of light next to the fuzzy light, I counted up to 120 seconds and did not see the flash again. It dimmed and I lost sight of it at roughly 7:05 to 7:10 p.m. before it reached the ""W"" of Cassiopeia.  I went inside and called the Smyrna Police Department and described what I saw and asked if anyone else had reported it. No one had. I then called the local Fox affiliate, Fox 5, and asked their news desk if they had received reports of the light in the sky. The man on the phone said that they had calls reporting it from Clayton County (south of Atlanta) all the way up to Cleveland, Georgia (roughly 40 or 50 miles northeast of Atlanta). He had no explanation as to what it might be. I called Fox 5 back at 11 p.m. to see if they had learned anything, and there was no new information.  This morning at work, I've googled ""mysterious light georgia"" and numerous other applicable terms, but nothing came up on google or Fox 5 or the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (the city newspaper). I just spoke with a public affairs sergeant at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, and she had heard nothing of the unusual light in the sky. When I typed in ""ufo december 10 2007"" and the first link that came up was this website.  At various times, I have seen satellites, the space shuttle, and the international space station moving across the sky in the evenings. They are always distinct, fast-moving points of light that generally dim and ""blink out"" once they enter the earth's shadow. The object last moved much slower than any aircraft (save a helicopter) or satellite. When I saw the flashing light and realized it was not a comet, I thought maybe it was a high-altitude balloon of some sort that had vented gas or propellant, but since this appears to be the same object seen by many people over several states, I have doubts that a weather or test balloon could have been high enough in or above the atmosphere to be viewed from such a wide area. I have no idea what it was.  The times listed above are very close approximations from the call records in my cell phone.  Now that I have typed all this, I just heard back from an astronomer at the Fernbank Science Center's observatory here in Atlanta. Apparently, the object was an Atlas rocket performing a ""fuel dump"" after depositing a classified satellite in orbit. The story can be found at www.spaceweather.com.

At approximately 1845, I spotted a green hue in the SW skies near the Messier object M15, approximately 45 degrees above the SW horizon.  It appeared to be a comet; I quickly slewed my telescope to the object, and viewed it at a magnification of 100X. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed, but much slower than a normal satellite when viewed through a telescope eyepiece field of view. The object contained what appeared to be a head and a tail (very much like Haley’s comet looked years ago through a pair of binoculars), and its magnitude was so bright that it was dominant in the sky.  There was also a point of light that moved with the object at the same speed, approximately one tenth of a degree from the “head” of the object. I tracked the object for approximately 45 minutes, the “tail” faded (almost appeared to dissipate over time), but the point of light near the haze remained in the eyepiece, it’s magnitude and position not changing over the period of time that it was tracked. The object passed very close to the star Schedar in the constellation Cassiopeia.  I stopped tracking the object as it passed through the constellation Cassiopeia at approximately 1935 hrs. The object continued to move in a NE direction at approximately 60 degrees above the northern horizon. The Telescope I was using to track the “object” was a Telescope Engineering Company (TEC) 200mm (8 inch) f/9 refractor, mounted on a Astro-Physics 1200gto computerized equatorial mount. The object was tracked by moving the Declination and Right ascension axis in a manual mode. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD))",2008-03-04T00:00:00,35.7519,-79.2248

There is a comet forgotten the name to lazy to look it up but a comet or fuzz ball like or bigger than the 7 sisters that I saw in the eastern sky. This fuzz ball was moving over so slowly but in odd directions to the rotation of the earth not making any sense.  A friend of mine alerted me to it and said hey go outside and check out the comet. I did and went out several times only to find that it had moved to odd positions and in weird trajectories that a comet would not normally follow.  My only conclusion is that it was man made perhaps a urinal dump that caught the sunlight similar to when you can the ISS or other satellites at night but then why would it move into the different positions over the course of the next hour and half.  It is the erratic nature of the movement. The sighting  took place this evening in mostly clear skies with good clarity on a cold winter night with temperatures in the 20s.

A ball of Amber/White light est (5 miles away)looked like a helicopter's search light or a large aircrafts main light's, very very similar in apparance but much larger, and much brighter, without any aviation light's on it, as I watched it through  binocculars; also the light was constant it did'nt break, brighten or dim as it traveled horizontally or away from me. It appeared at 19:30pm just after it had got dark outside and traveled an (est 5 miles) perpendicular to me along the ridge of the hillside at the hight of a small aircraft, to the right along the horizon and orbited behind the back of the hillside, it returned at 20:00-20:30 and orbited again. It appeared the next day at a simillar time, repeating the same pattern of travel as the previous day. One day later it appeared again, but on it's second orbit it began to pulsate it's light on and off constantly every 2-3 seconds, dissapearing and reapearing while still moving across the sky at a constant speed. There is a transmitter mast a few miles away to the left on the horzion and (5 miles) from my location, lit up with 8 Red evenly spaced lights from bottom to top, and as the ball of light lit and unlit, 4 pale Red lights in a perfect diamond pattern appeared to the near top and to the immediate right of the mast, from my line of sight. There was quite a lot of background (low cloud/mist) but the Red mast lights were clearly visable, the diamond then seamed to blink each of it's 4 light's. moving a bit to the left as the far left light disapeared, probably obscured behind the mast, but it's dimensions neither grew larger, nor smaller at any time. I know the hight of the mast to be about 300mtrs tall and this thing (4 red light's in a diamond shape) was at least 1/5th the size and just seamed to hover stationary for (20-30 seconds) before it vanished.

At first I thought it was the nightly police helicopter doing patrol, but this was different.  It didn't make any sound, but still it had some sort of essence coming from it that gave my professor and I a feeling of ecstacy.   We couldn't divert our attention from it.   It was almost as if something was purposefully making us continue to stare at it.  When I tried to look away, I felt sick to my stomach, and extremely dizzy, and my professor had the same feelings as I.  This went on for what seemed like hours, until something happened to this day that makes me sit back and analyze life.  With a sudden sharp shriek almost identical to that of a wounded animal, the craft burst into light did two counter lockwise barrel rolls then dove straight down into the ground, in the fild about 100 yards away.   After we both gathered ourselves, my professor and I went to the field exactly where it had dived.  When we got there we were both amazed at what we saw, for it was not earthly possible.  There was absolutly no sign of disruption to the ground at all, and the only thing that really seemed out of place was a dense smoke above our heads that honestly smelled quite pleasent.

They were about the size of big headlights.  I stopped my vehicle right away and got out, as they were coming directly at me.  There was one out in front, two others above and below, and then another behind the two middle ones with 3-4 smaller redish, orange lights directly behind.

What made it really creepy was there was no sound, no sound at all, it was dead silent outside.  The area is very rural and you usually at least hear crickets, but it was dead silent outside, no crickets, no dogs barking, no breeze or wind, absolutely nothing at all.  It was dead still.

One evening my wife witnessed something of what appeared to be at the time white flashes in our bedroom that was coming through our window. These bright white flashes were continual and only appeared in the early hours of morning.  After the third day of this going on we had contacted our neighbor and asked him if he had seen any unusual white flashes in the early morning hours and he looked at us like we were insane.  My wife including our three children ended up sleeping together until we found out what these white flashes were, only problem is other things started happening. Around two and three in the early morning hours we started hearing a low hum similar to a vibration, so I took my ladder out and climbed up on our roof and seen no cable interruption. In my line of work I work for an electrical company but I will not mention which one out of the fear of possible retaliation.  My wife as well as my eldest child felt our home was haunted but something kept telling me differently, for example one evening we heard such a loud noise like a jet blast but throughout the entire sky and to this day I have never heard such a loud noise and hopefully we never will again.  These white flashes seemed to subside to only then be replaced by what appeared to be a red laser type of beam. This beam for a better word would spell out threats on our bedroom wall as well as through our house, again emphasizing that my wife said our home was haunted.  Then it happened, one evening the threats started getting worse and we started to see a few circular objects in the Southern sky and after contacting more than just a few local officials, for the most part each one felt we had lost our minds.  They and by they I am referring to whoever or whatever was using these red beams started writing on our walls information that no one had any access to and it started to cause a very prominent divide in our family.  Some of the words that to this day still standout were such words as die, filthy, leave,  you cannot make us leave, Norma [my wife felt maybe a correlation to Marilyn Monroe?], they whoever they are mentioned they still are visiting others who they have talked to before and they wanted me to go public which I refused and that seemed to anger them worse.  This red beam went as far as naming each member of our family and each evening it grown worse. The writing started lasting later into the morning and longer, personally I started losing more sleep as each day passed until finally we had enough and we now are staying with friends until we move back to Missouri where my wife has family.  When this red beam was writing, it would also make direct contact to my wife on her body including myself and we could feel heat from it. After it started leaving marks on my wife in the form of small burns around her head, neck, ears, and along her legs. That is when we moved to a friends home that I met after moving to Sarpy county.  I want to tell anyone who may be reading this that I am an electrician by trade and in no way shape or form have I in my entire life ever have dealt with anything like this and to those others who these things refer to, my family who are dealing with this, our heart goes out to you.  To all the officials we contacted I would like to end this by saying thank you for nothing.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,41.254851796008865,-96.06482784922395

I was sitting on the beach looking at the Eastern sky.  There was a diverse variety of cloud formations on the horizon and clouds were passing overhead.  The Southeastern sky was clear and blue except for some very shear cirrus clouds to the Northeast.  The conditions were very good: light Southerly winds, low humidity, excellent visibility.  I was starting to look Southeast when suddenly a bright light caught my eye.   I thought at first that it was a high flying plane reflecting the noon day sun.  There were several flashes of light that moved in a Northeastern direction in a nearly flat trajectory.  I saw a bright white spherical object traveling at a speed that can only be described as impossibly fast.  It appeared seemingly out of thin air and I was somewhat startled by it.  It went from a high speed to slowing down and as it moved across the sky, it looked like it either flew into, or behind the cirrus clouds.  It also had an aura that became more pronounced when it interacted with the high level clouds.  It stopped for moment and then disappeared.  It happened very quickly, but I got a good look at it.  A strange feeling came over me as I realized that I had never seen anything like that before.  To further describe: I was sitting at sea level and I was looking skyward 45 to 50 degrees from the Southeast horizon.  It appeared as a bright light that also flashed a few times.  It looked like it was at a very high altitude, which would mean that what I saw had to be of substantial size.  It moved a good distance in what could have been no more than a second or two.  The spherical shape became more apparent when it slowed down, however it was still moving quickly.  When it stopped, it remained stationary momentarily, then it vanished.  My wife was with me when this happened.  I tried to point it out to her, but she only got a glimpse of it.  It all happened so quickly, but the image is very clear in my mind.

First let me start by saying I am very experienced with auroras (been tracking them for years) I am also an amateur astronomer, I have experience with aircraft and flight and have a sound knowledge of weather. What I saw along with my friend that night I cannot explain. I ruled out lights from a plane, fireworks, auroras, lightning and static discharge.  It was around 11:30 pm, we just finished looking at the moon through my telescope and I was looking out at the night sky when I saw this cloud southeast from my home, it looked close and had just been over the house so I know it was a low cloud by the speed it was travelling. I thought it was pretty against the light of the almost full moon. All of a sudden, the cloud turned red with a little orange tint then pulsed to blue and then changed to green. It lit up the whole cloud telling me that whatever was creating this light was big. The light lasted about 4 seconds and turned off. I then yelled to my friend to come see what I just saw and miraculously the light re-appeared just in time for her to see it. The second view also lasted about 4 seconds and pulsed from red with orange tint to blue to green almost mechanically. Having seen it twice and having the same light pattern rules out a natural phenomenon.  I have been pondering coming forward for a while now but decided it was the right thing to do.

I then immediately pointed out that  there was one "" ODD "" smoke coloured trail that ended abruptly which looked like something got shot out of the sky.  As we approached Highway 10 or so we saw a blue white strobe lighted line going from south to north...however, nothing was visual except the lights.  I immediately suggested that this is a remote drone of some sort.   it hovered in the northwest over the Halton hills for about 5 minutes.   As we approached Erin Mills parkway we encountered a very bright flash in the vicinity of the delta Hotel, many other motorists saw this flash....which was only about 500 feet up.  cars breaked to get the visual, which lasted about 4 seconds. It was way too low for a meteoroid, meteorite.  As we passed highway 25 things got very interesting....I noticed a very unusual light signature in the sky which wasn't a plane....it was a looong streak of bright spot light.  I told my wife immediately that this wasn't "" A PLANE ""....well it WASN'T.....we pulled over on highway 401 near cambellville...and watched the spectacle while others obliviously drove on by !   IT WAS A LARGE AIRLINER BEING FOLLOWED BY A SMALLER aircraft flying at subsonic speed.  never have I seen this formation before, both planes were separated by approx. 1,000 feet or so.  In a clearly lit path.    My assumption was a Command plane and a fighter escort, but no supersonic jet boom.   I am assuming my observations were correct...a military , spy or drone exercise was carried out over southern ontario at dusk on march 11, 2007.  the telltale signs were the odd vapour trails which were clearly visilble when we were over toronto.   The drone observation and bright flash took place over  Mississauga, with the last of the! vapour flash right over Erin mills parkway and the 401.  whoever else saw this please post...this wasn't a normal occurance as i am well educated with the night skies.  I was initially pointing out Venus to my wife when this all unravelled.    Our friends saw this bright flash from all the way down in detroit.  something was going on.

Excited, I went to get a pair of binoculars from my truck. I stood up on my wall and focused in on the object. I saw a round shape with a curved bottom. But on top there was a bright green light just shooting off. On the sides, there were red and blue lights flashing. For about 10 minutes, it slowly dipped toward the mountain. 	Then, to my amazement, it split! There were now 2 small white lights about a finger width apart (from the distance away). They sank lower still. Suddenly, they shook violently for a second, then shot back together, again to form the previous object. I was shaking, almost unable to hold on to the binoculars. I gathered myself and watched it. 	It was close to going over the mountain now. But, before it went behind the mountain, it suddenly just shut off. As if a light switch had disconnected the circuit leading to it. I focused more, and faintly saw the outline against the stars in the back. It descended into the dark mountain. I though it was over. 	Now the most shocking part. As I continued watching, I saw a black circle shoot down from the sky at a very high speed, with a thin white tail-Right where the UFO had gone down. I almost dropped the binoculars again, but managed to get them to my eyes to see ONE MORE black circle shoot towards the area. The area behind the mountain lit up dramatically and then quickly died down. We checked out the are from a hill. There were flashing red and blue lights, surrounded by little lights all around.

Approximately 3 minutes later, a new small light appeared from our point of view 2 inches up and 3/4th's of an inch over to the right.

It hovered in the distance, above near-by tree line, and for the first moment I thought it was a blimp circling on a route around the university stadium.  It was about that size, and from the side it appeared to have an oval shape.  There was a flashing light to the right side, which went out of view as the object rotated.  The light was visible again as the object pitched so the apparent top was visible.  At this angle it looked like a Vinn-diagram, with three areas of the structure coming together at the middle.  These three areas were equally spaced, equal in size, and if the spaces between them were filled the perimeter would have been roughly circular.  The color was dark and slightly metallic, but overall blackish and in the southern sky versus the setting sun.  As the object continued to hover, it spun and also flipped over completely very slowly more than once, moving eastward and we though downward slightly.  At this point we discussed the possibilities of a stunt plane (a completely unfamiliar variety moving entirely too slowly), an RC disc (which typically would have had a limited range and would have been either enormous or easily distinguished), and a helium balloon in free fall (which would explain the manuevers but not the shape and apparent size at that distance).  The loss of altitude we determined to be an illusion as the object was becoming smaller and we observed it traveling away from us.  The object then rapidly decreased in size, moving very quickly away southward.  The altitude also changed as the object got further away  and apparently gained height.  We observed it until it was a barely visible dot in the distance.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,29.646086792452827,-82.38107610062893

I was in the Coast Guard on the C. G. cutter Valiant, which was (is?) stationed in Galveston Texas.  We were going to Norfolk, Virginia, for some battle training at the naval shipyard there. I was usually put on lookout, since I had very good eyes back then. I think we were off the coast of Miami (anyway, I remember it as being in the Bermuda triangle) and I saw a light come down from the clouds.  I was looking north, and this light came from the west and landed on the water.  A few seconds later, I saw the light continue flying east and up and into the clouds.  I dismissed this as a water plane landing on the ocean at the time, but wondered why it only took a few seconds to fly off again.  Then again, it could have been a helicopter that just idled near the water.  It was too far away to know for sure. The strange thing about this trip, is that on another watch in the Bermuda triangle, I was told to report all boats and ships in the area because there where multiple contacts on the radar.  I thought the guys were pulling my leg, because it was a clear night and the moon was shining bright, but there was nothing but smooth water on the ocean.  When I switched shifts to steer the ship, sure enough there was multiple contacts on the radar.  I thought maybe a school of whales, but we never saw any break the surface.

It was the early Eighty’s, possibly November or December of 1982 or 1983.   I observed what I at first took to be a blimp crossing the interstate from west to east.  I noticed it because from my scientific, weather, history, Navy, research and other experience I knew that it was very dangerous for a blimp to be that close to the earth so near a ridgeline so commonly windy, and I wondered if it was in trouble.  As I got closer I realized that it did not have a gondola, then that it was closer to a cigar-shape than the usual teardrop-shape, then that it had what appeared to be windows along the side midline, continuous and extending around the nose and tail as far as I could see (which I verified as I passed).  I saw movement behind the windows (which seemed translucent rather than clear, like looking through sand-blasted glass) that was purposeful, not random, rhythmical or cyclic.  I pulled over and stopped.  There was no sound coming from the vehicle, particularly not the propeller and/or engine sound I associate with blimps.  It continued east at about twenty mph. following the land contours until it rose and disappeared over the hills. The color of the light from the windows was a sandy yellow and was the only light coming from the object.  There were no navigational lights of any kind.  The color of the surface gave the immediate impression of a silvery gray but upon closer examination it was actually metallic silver with some sort of mottled or textured surface.  Given that at that time my eyes were 20/5 and able to see in dim light even better that in bright light, the elements of that texturing had to be less than ½ inch.  I pulled out my compass and did a little trigonometry.

I as well as two other immediate family members have very clear memories of an event that occurred one night.  I don't remember the exact date but I know, as well as I know my own name, that it was the night the very last episode of M.A.S.H. aired I think it was 1983-84 something like that. We moved to Tilden from San Antonio because my mother was the personal assistant for a Texas oil man.  He had some 2000 acres just outside Tilden and wanted to get out of the city.  He built three houses all on virgin land on his ranch.  The houses were about 40 -50 yards apart one was for his parents, one for the pilot, and the other for our family.  My dad was in the air force and stationed in Korea at the time so being the typical air force brat I had a fascination with all aircraft.  The pilot, always kept the jet ranger close by the three houses incase one of us kids were to get struck by a snake.  My mothers boss had 3 kids, the pilot had 2, and my mother had 2 and being virgin South Texas land it was not uncommon to wakeup with Rattle Snakes on the door steps keeping warm on the concrete.  The night I am referring to my mother's boss and the pilot had been using the Bell to help herd some cattle that day and had not come home when Mash started.  Just as Mash was ending my German Sheppard, Joy, started howling and crying like I've never heard a dog do before or since.  She ran wildly around the living room and would run to the back door then back to the couch.  Joy would normally get upset when the bramas would come close to the house or when an illegal would come up to the house looking for work.  However this was different she literally went crazy.  She stopped running around and went to the sliding glass door and bared her teeth starring out the door snarling like she was possessed.  Did I mention that she was a puppy maybe 8 months old.  She had never done this before and was disturbing us so I went to the door to get her and calm her down when I saw what she was going on about  The scrub brush had been cleared probably 200 yards in any direction around the houses when they were built and directly behind ours was a ball of fire.  That is the only way I can describe it.  It was difficult to register the dimensions of the thing but I am sure it had to be at least 60 yards in diameter it looked huge.  It was perfectly round and appeared to be on fire.  NO windows or little green men coming out, it was simply hovering a few feet off the ground.  What was strange, as if that was not strange in its self, it was very bright and had red, yellow, and orange colors to it and pulsated but it cast NO light.  What I mean is it did not cast shadows or light up the area around it.  You could only barely make out the ground just below it.  I stood there for 2 or 3 minutes trying to get my mother and sister to come look at this thing and when my mother saw it she started to panic and rushed us in to the back bedroom and forced Joy to come as well.  We probably stayed in the bedroom for 20 minutes when we heard the pilot coming in with the Jet Ranger.  The next day I told the pilot what we had seen and asked if he saw anything, of course I was met with a disbelieving attitude and he said he did not see a thing.  No one saw it but us, not the pilot’s family nor my mothers bosses.  I am a college educated professional businessman, in fact I minored in philosophy and consider myself a very rational person.  I know what I saw and gave up a very long time ago on trying to get people to believe this story no matter how very true it is.  I am not a UFO buff but I know there is something unexplained out there and it does fly.  I have however never heard of any sighting that can be described as a huge ball of fire and was wondering if you have.  I have heard of the Marfa lights and always thought maybe this was one.

Due to recent acceptance I will now reveal my encounter, which is only the 1st of two different sightings in my life. In 1983 I lived in the town of Cookstown, N.J. This is a town just outside the main gates & reserve of Maguire Air Force Base in addition to Ft Dix. After dinner I had took my (2) dogs for a walk through the adjoining field of Balasko Oil Co next to my house, it was dark, there was no wind and it was very humid. The field was isolated which was ideal for my needs as my dogs were vicious. Something then happened which I can only verbalize as a sence of something terribly wrong. As this thought was registering in my thoughts, both of my dogs began to growl which escalated my feelings and I could feel the hair raised on the back of my neck. Please know that I have never felt this sence of fear while in the presence of my dogs! As a dog handler, I knew their perception was keener than my own and I looked to where both dogs were focasing their aggressive behaviour. To my complete shock & fear, both dogs were looking up in the same direction at a 45 degree angle. I looked but did not immediatly realize what I was vaguely beginning to see was the silouete of a triangular shape no more than 100 ft above me and no more than 200 yards in front of me. The most upsetting feeling was consuming me as this shape was standing still in the air without the slightest sound! In retrospect to the angle, nose straight up with bottom triangular sections down. A terrible sence consumed me which I can only ascertain was what was making my dogs snarl and show their teeth. I did not stay any longer and pulled my dogs and took them back to the house. Many years later when the Stealth was first revealed I was amazed at how similar it was to what I witnessed in 1983. Possibly could have been the testing of the stealth but I still question why it would have been over Cookstown in lieu of the endless barren miles of the military range. The key I would assume that would solve this or separate this incedent from question would be if the stealth is capable of hovering 100 ft off the ground, nose straight up without making a sound or vibration.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,40.0491,-74.557

There were no wings, no con trail,  the cigar shaped object flew from the north due south. I observed this object for about 20 seconds as it clearly was visible in and out of the cloud openings.

The living room faced the balcony that overlooked the tennis courts. All of the sudden the balcony and part of the living room floor turned bright orange. I thought that was strange, as I opened the balcony door I heard people yelling (I could not remember what they were saying). Everyone was looking at the sky. As I looked up all I can see was that the sky was being covered by something light orange.  As I looked at it I really did not understand what it was. I looked at the people on the tennis courts and some of them were running inside the building while a few stayed there point up.  I remember looking up and down several times. It covered the whole horizon. I could not see where it ended. It must have been a few 100 ft above me. About 20 seconds into the experience, it started to move straight up at a great speed with no noise.  I would say another 10 seconds later I noticed the outline of what seemed to be a circle with an outer ring and a glowing orange/red center. It moved straight up at a great speed. My eyes started to water because I could not stay focus on the object. Soon afterwards I noticed two more similiar objects one on each side for a total of three.  As it was moving up it started to move toward the direction of the east, toward the ocean. It finally disapeard, and when I realized what I just saw I looked around me and my friend the owner of the apartment was standing next to me rubbing her eyes with tears. Why eyes were also watered, with a little discomfort.  The people below on the tennis courts yelled at us asking if we saw it. We told them we did. We asked them were did it come from, and they said it just rolled over the building and everything turned orange.  I have told this experience to all my friends throuht out the years. No one believes me, but I know what I saw was real. I don't see my friend any more, but many years later we met by accident, and the first thing she asked me if I remember that day when we saw the orange glow. I told her yes, it is something that I have never forgoten. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

We were out in the middle of nowhere, not knowing where we were apart from the fact that it was en route to irvine.

When I actually looked over, i saw this triangular shaped aircraft. It had two lights, and was tilted at a 45 degree angle. It was flying at the same level as us, as if it were a car. And then, for some incomprehensible reason, this unidentified aircraft flew right in front of us, cutting us off. I was driving at 80 miles per hour, and was forced to brake.

It was more of an irregular ""flicker"", much like a fluorescent bulb when it is getting ready to burn out.  It was not regular in shape, but seemed to be extending out from a slightly brighter center point in a somewhat irregular form or pattern. Each illuminating flicker had a bit of a difference to the shape. And the color was odd, not a single shade but a blend of shades.  The size was larger than a medium-sized star, but that included the emitted light form.  It never went completely dark until the last quivery flicker.  About 2 or 3 seconds later it was in the SSE sky, at just slightly above the original degree point...seemed to be same size and description.

This is a park for Kennedy Space Port works and family.  It is about as close as you can get with out getting on KSC, 10-15 miles away. I was taking movie pictures with my camera and the shuttle had lifted off.  About one to one and a half minutes after the launch I pulled away from the camera and look up and saw some thing going from West to East at a high rate of speed.  It was bright and looked like a flying saucer shape but you just saw a yellow light.  I asked my friends and some other people around us if they saw it and they said that they did see some thing. I first thought that it was a chase plane to take pictures of the shuttle but quickly decided that it was not a chase plane.  They have land base camera’s that can give you better pictures than a chase plane.  Also if a plane is in the launch area they will not launch the shuttle.  I have seen many shuttle launches since I live close to Cape Canaveral.  I have never seen any thing like this before.

My initial thought was it was on a tower, but I realized there are no tall radio towers in the area where this light was.  Besides which, I make this trip several evenings a week and had never seen the light.   My next realization was that it was moving, very slowly, appearing to move from west to east (towards me) and coming closer to the ground.  The light appeared to be about 2-3 miles distant, but this is just a guess.  It was not landing lights on an aircraft-I have lived by airports before and am familiar with these.  Plus the light was much larger than landing lights would be, and the airport is in a different direction.   As I drew closer, I started thinking that perhaps it was a series of large bright lights, as opposed to 1 large oval light.  I thought it might be a helicopter, but the light(s) was too wide to be on a helicopter.   By this point I had been watching the light(s) as I drove for approximately 5 minutes.  The light(s) was getting lower and lower.  There was nowhere on its line of decent for a helicopter to land, so if it was a helicopter of some sort, I don't know what it was doing.  Of course, I don't know what a UFO would be doing landing in a residential section of Baton Rouge, either.   At this point I had to make a turn in order to reach my destination, and as I was already late to pick up my daughter, I chose to make the turn and lose sight of the light(s).  When we returned to that road about 5 minutes later, the light was gone.   As I said before, I have lived near airports before--both military and civilian--and did not recognize the shape of the light(s).  I was more than a little bit spooked.   The road I was on was not crowded at this time of the evening, but it was by no means empty.

IT had no wings to speak of,and only made a hum .When it passed overhead I heard a wisp ,like when birds fly by close enough you can hear them.It was only after it passed directly over me that i could hear the hum,like the sound a golfcart makes when it's moving slow.Dimentionaly it was about 25 feet long and 25-30 feet wide.Very dark flat color, no reflection .The part normally thought of as the cockpit was the only rounded part of it,but the nose was very blunt or flat and wide.There was no tail.... no rear lights at all.

Which would put it at 20x magnification.  I did not have setting circles so I do not know the elevation. But, these objects did pass by M13 which is in hercules. they were within a degree of it from my location.  The amount of sky covered within this viewing was from anywhere north. And I lost track around scorpio as my scope is in a cradle mount and was hitting the back of the chair that I had it on.  the entire time I view I guessing is 5 minutes.  i did see a plane or jet pass in front of my scope as viewing ese objects also. It was in front of them. So they deffinitly were further out. These lights never blinked they stayed steadily lit.

I was standing in the driveway of the house that I was visiting. It was a clear, cloudless night. The stars shown brilliantly against the dark sky. I stood looking up at the stars in the heavens, when suddenly I noticed a moving ""light"" very high up in the sky. I knew, from the altitude that this moving ""light"" appeared  to be, that whatever it was that I was looking at, must either be the space-station, or a satillite. The light maintained its altitude, but when it was directly above me, I was dumbstruck by the sudden brilliance of a brightness that suddenly seemed to appear from the bottom of this object when the object got directly overhead. There seemed to be four (4)lights that were part whatever it was that I was looking at. I felt that what I was seeing was triangular in shape, with white, non-blinking lights on three cornors, with the bottom, suddenly brilliant ""beam"" in the middle of the other three. AT NO TIME DID ANY OF THE LIGHTS THAT I SAW 'BLINK,' AS THEY WOULD HAVE IF THIS WERE AN AIRPLANE! The light then proceeded to change course. It made a turn; not abrupt, but a gradual, gentle course change. It then accelerated, gaining speed quite rapidly, and I watched it until it trailed off from sight. The bright ""beam"" that I refer to, in the middle of this object, seemed to gain in luminosity when it was directly over my head. In other words, one second, it wasn't bright. Then, quite suddenly, when it was directly overhead, it was! I ruled out an airplane, as they have red, and green blinking lights on their wings. I thought that the brilliant light ""beam"" could have been an airplanes landing lights. But there was no change in the luminosity that should have accompanied the deployment of landing lights in front of or around this object. Besides, with no blinking of any kind noted, it seemed unlikely that this was an aircraft. I stood there, wondering what it was I had seen, for several minutes after I finally lost sight of this object. I have spent many moments in the past looking up at the heavens.

If the object was at a high altitude then it was gigantic in size, but I would guess it was only about 100 feet over the house and if this guess is correct then it was about half a football field in size.

We where playing hide and seek with my cousin and my friends (they are also my neighbors) at my friends house near a road, and at the other side of the road is a bench with 3 men drinking beer (which where also my neighbors,) the environment at that time was dark ‘cause you know here in Philippines not all of people are rich. As I am running and finding my way to hide near the road, the man with beer at the bench shouted UFO. UFO was popular at that time (1993 – 1994) here in Philippines ‘cause it was the time that they really appear or what we call the invasion.  As I look up at the sky I saw the perfect circle with blue ring light under it and in that blue light is a much powerful blue light rotating clockwise, and why did I recognize the shape so easily? Because the blue ring light was like an aura. The UFO was about a little higher than a TV network Tower and it’s moving very slowly diagonally to south east. It was like a size of a small coin from what we’ve seen from the ground when you hold a small coin (1 cent coin). As I had seen it followed with goosebumps. I ran as fast as I could to our house. It was so dark at that time, instead I sit under a small tree and shout call my mom many times as I look again at the night sky it’s still there the movement was change to North East. And as my Mom called me and as I will show and tell It to her, ‘cause you will still be able to see it from our house. It was totally gone. It happened around P.M.8:! 00 to P. M.9:00. Because P.M. 9:00 was our sleeping time at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

One of my friends gets hit in the nuts, so we sit down and cool off in a life gaurd tower.  While we are talking, I see a blur come from the left side facing the ocean.  I was thinking of making a wish, but it was not a typical shooting star, my friend points out that an object has appeared out near the horizon above the water, pulsating.  We watch, wondering if its a helicopter since bellows has some military activity and exercises are performed there.  As we watch, we see this light start buzzing around doing very angled turns at high speeds.  It was mind boggling.  So we keep on watching, the light stops again after a while and then it starts growing bigger.  Eventually it flew above us the the right, not too high up so I got a decent glimpse of some red and greenish lights, maybe blue, I have a hard time remembering what exact colors I saw, but it was ovalish and it was silent.  I live near alot of air traffic and I know something moving that close to the ground at that speed should make a lot of sound but I didn't hear anything.  So we look at each other and don't say a thing.  I am an honest person and tell my findings to friends and I tried to limit the talk about only what I had physically seen.  My other friend, one being hawaiian and one being caucasion, both took it way differently.  We didn't really talk about it much, because it freaked my white friend out alot and for a long time.  I guess it didn't apply to my life so why mentally masturbate over it for a long time.

My wife and two young children and their grandmother all lived in a two story home in a very dark and thickly wooded private community in Northern California in August of 1998.  There are no street lights in this area and the nights are incredibly dark. The house lots are huge and far apart and across the street from us was a huge undeveloped tract of Pine forest.  At approximately 2:AM on this absolutely calm and relatively warm summer evening I was awakened by the brightest blue-white light I have ever seen. I was sleeping in my own upstairs bedroom and my wife was in another next door one and my two children in their own rooms as well. Grandma was downstairs in her own bed.  My door to the upstairs hallway, which had windows facing out to the woods across the street, was open.  My room was so immersed in this blue-white light coming in from this wooded area direction that it was blinding. I had to actually shade my eyes.  I was very groggy when I first awoke so I was just befuddled as to what this light could be.  It took me several seconds to wake up. When I became fully awake I studied the light with incredible amazement and curiosity. It was illuminating the entire inside of our house!  I didn't know a light could be this bright.  It was like one of those six foot wide ""Hollywood Premier"" night-beam-in-the-sky lights were being shined right onto and into our house!  This light was steady and unwavering. It had a cool, unearthly, blue-white glow to it. Almost like a welders torch glow but no wavering and flashing at all like a real welders torch would have.  I was unnerved and my mind came up with a ""safe"" scenario that there must be emergency vehicles outside our house and every one of their lights were being shined on our house and lighting it up on the inside.  But then I listened and I couldn't hear one sound outside.  No voices or engines running.  Then I got a little scared.  I just couldn't get up and look outside to see what was directly making this light.  It was a strange ""sense"" of apprehension and fear. I actually felt cowardly for not doing so.  Just then, two minutes after this light first lit up our house I heard my wife in the bedroom next to mine shout out "" what the heck is that light?""  Her door to the windowed hallway was closed, and still the light was so bright it woke her up as well.  Unlike me she ""bravely"" got up and as soon as her hand touched the hallway door knob to open it the incredible light blinked out.  And as soon as it did...every electrical appliance including the humming refigerator, clocks and clock-radios in the house went out too.  We tried the lights, nothing worked.  My wife staggered into my room and sat on my bed. Like me, she was shaken and said she had never seen anything so bright in her life.   We called the gated community 24 hour security guard house about 1/4 to 1/2 miles away as the phone did work and they reported no outages or calls about anything unusual like people's electricity being out.  We sat there pondering another couple of minutes and all of a sudden the lights and power in our house just blinked back on !  It was all so strange we just sat there silent and dumbfounded.  Eventually we got up and walked down to our children's bedrooms and took a quick non-entering look inside and they seemed asleep and fine so we just went back to bed.  The next morning my wife and I got up and she started making an eggs and bacon breakfast for us all.  Not long afterwards our 13 year old son came slowly walking down the stairs.  I didn't look up but said ""good morning"" as you could hear him coming down the stairs.  He kind of moaned in response and said "" ohhh, I must have had the worst nose bleed of my life last night.""  We looked up and the front of his T-shirt was partially stained in blood and he had dried blood underneath his nose and down his cheek and chin.  My wife and I immediately walked over to comfort him and then we went upstairs to his room.  His pillow was fairly well splattered with dried blood also.  To this day we don't have a clue as to what happened that summer evening. But the events I am describing happened exactly the way I say they did.  Our son seemed okay after this and I don't recall him ever getting another nose bleed.  But that light.  I still don't know how anything could light up the ""inside"" of a house like that with absolutely no sound.  Was this a UFO event?  I can't say it was becuase I didn't see anything but the light. But, it certainly was a U.L.E.  ""Unidentified Light Event.""  And it reminded me of the movie ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.""

I was driving across Kansas on my way to California. It was late at night and i had just left a truck stop where i had a cup of coffee. About 100 yards off the road to my left, there was what appeared to be an accident, where someone had rolled over out in the field.  There was what appeared to be emergency vehicles there with what looked like a floodlight on the vehicle.  I didn't stop because there was no need to with what seemed to be emergency vehicles attending. Actually the whole scene seemed surreal. As i continued down the two lane highway, I remember listening to Art Bell on coast to coast radio and there was a show on that was sort of a take off on that 1948 radio show with Orson Welles and ""War of the Worlds.""  I remember that on the show, there were alien spacecraft landing around the United States.  I remember being momentarily sort of alarmed as i was listening to the broadcast. A couple of minutes later, I noticed a light ahead of me shining down on the road and coming towards me.  I assumed that the light was from a medivac helicopter going to the rollover accident to evacuate injured people. As the light shining down on the road approached and flew over my vehicle I noticed that there was no noise coming from the object which was at a very low altitude (i'd guess no more than 100 ft or so).  I remember how strange it was that a helicopter could be flying that low and make no noticeable noise.  I remember looking in my rear view mirror and saying to myself, what the ""F"" was that thing. Basically,  I forgot about the whole incident until a couple of years ago when I was talking to my son about UFO's while we were having dinner at an Applebee's Restaurant.  Suddenly I just remembered the incident.... as if it was a dream though, and not something that actually took place. He talked to a friend of his who said that I probably had been abducted by a ufo and that they planted the false memories of the accident and the coast to coast show to mask the incident to me.

Behind this light, my father and I witnessed two contrails that were lit up by the moonlight, which seemed to chase this bright red light, which did not pulsate or change color.  The light suddenly stopped for a second and lowered its elevation, made a quick maneuver to the right and continued south along the coast. The contrails could not keep pace with the light, which then again stopped, this time the orb seemed to expand and become brighter. It then bursted into many fine particles like an industrial firework, then this same process went into reverse and it seemed to implode and collapse on itself and then disappeared over the water. No sound was heard or did we see debris of any kind fall from the orb. My jaw just dropped and we could not believe what we had just witnessed. The contrails finally fizzed.  In a matter of a minute we then witnessed two military jets fly into this area over the water. They were military because they had one red pulsing light on the fuselage and I grew up on an air force base and I am familiar with how fast they move.  These jets were probably scrambled from Homestead AFB. We then thought, could the military be conducting missile tests over open waters right off the coast?

I went out side and noticed what looked to be a slow blinking light and assumed it was a radio tower. Then I realized  there was no radio towers in the direction I was looking,  I also realized the object was way to high for a radio tower.  It had the brightness of a white strobe, with the exception that it blinked on and off at a much slower rate, more of a fast fadeing glow on and off, at it's full size it was the size of a large house.The time was late afternoon, but still clear enough to see that there was nothing visible at all when the white light blinked or glowed off. It was staying in the same spot so I decided to run as close as I cloud to see it better, after about a mile I cloud see that there was a large grey cloud it was sitting in and as the object pulsed off and on I noticed a strange purple static energy that seemed to be directly around the object.  Now things get interesting.....  As I'm standing there I hear a loud roar and I look up and I'm astonished to see a US Coast Guard Falcon jet flying as fast as It can right over my head and I mean right over me VERY low and hauling tail toward the object. I jumped and yelled ""yeah! go get'em!""  as astonished and excited as anyone cloud imagine. As the Falcon reached the object, the glowing object rapidly went out and was gone, the Falcon jet made a number of slower circles around where the object had been and then left the area in the opposite direction that it came from originally.

It was coming down lower and lower and closer to the car lower than the 3 story Pac Bell building on March Lane.  It seemed as wide as the goodyear  blimp.  I was cutting behind the building to get to the aparment complex next door.  I rolled down the window to hear a motor and it was completely silent.  That was when i got scared.  The car almost stalled.  At that point I panicked and prayed to God that we not get taken up as I have heard that happens to people.  I checked my clock to make sure no time would had been lost.  I took my adult friend and her 2 children home (in the complex) and then raced back home.  When I got home I went to my backyard and could see it in a distance moving toward UOP.  I was also shocked at the boldness of it moving so slowly and so low.  My back yard was on Brookside Road at the levy.  I watched my clock and arrived home without losing any time.  I was stunned to the point of not seeming able to speak about it and my friend was as well.    A couple of years later I brought it up and asked her and her children exactly what they saw and it was the same.  Just recently I have felt able to tell others.   I still cannot even believe we saw it and I really do believe  that had I not prayed we would have been taken up.  I am now a 55 year old woman and at the time was managing properties in Stockton for a developer out of Roseville.  I had been with them for close to 3 years.  I am a professional woman and at that time my children were enrolled in private school.  My friend was in her late 20's at the time and  the  children were 10 and 8 years old.  Neither of us used drugs or alchohol.  Needless to say it was very frightening and I still look over my shoulder in  fear.

On April 9th, at 9:20 pm. I saw a bright red light come on then go out. Then four bright orange lights lit up from left to right, then went out one by one from left to right. Then 5 orange lights lit up from left to right and went out one by one from left to right. These lights were really bright. The red one was round, but the orange ones were shaped like rectangles. They were right over the tops of the trees in my neighbors back yard directly behind us in the northeast, within 5-600 ft. from me. The orange ones had sort of a screen look to them. Like they were windows from a craft. They were lighting up as though they were going around something circular. The very next week they were back and my husband and I both saw them plus, we heard that two other people about 4-5 miles from us saw the same thing. On the 16th of April, the same thing happened. The red light showed up first. It was followed by bright orange lights (as bright as tail-lights on a new car). This sighting lasted about an hour. The orange lights looked different than the ones I saw by myself the week before, though. These looked more like flares, or fireballs, but they didn't go anywhere. Not up, not down, just around something like a disk shaped object that we couldn't see. They again came on left to right and went out left to right. It was like a sequence of a different amount of lights coming on each time. One set was three, one set was 9-12, one set was 2, etc.  Then, as though another craft was answering the first one, (this set of lights was straight east instead of northeast) Four bright yellow lights lit up. These lights were bigger than the orange ones, and that is the only time they lit up. Then the orange ones in the north east went RIGHT to LEFT, as though they were satisfied with the answer of the other craft. That was the end of the sequences. We got video of the bright yellow lights, and two of the last four orange lights as they were going out. The next week (April 23)I got a video of a craft going over with no sound, and a smaller light came out of the craft. These had no sound, even though it was directly over my head. There was no flashing lights to indicate that it was an airplane of some sort. The smaller light that came out of the bottom of the craft, came down and then went west as the larger object was flying north to south. Then there was another smaller light flying east to west over the larger object.

Firstly I have had 3 daylight sightings in my lifetime. Firstly, I would like to relate to you the most shocking sighting.  I was working as an IT technician and was on location at Cardiff High School. I was waiting for a windows operating system installation to finish and was looking out of the library window feeling quite bored. It was quite cloudy, very overcast and the cloud cover was quite low. It was December 05 and we had had some rain earlier in the morning and through the clouds I could see a diamond type shape making its way through the could cover. I continued watching it thinking that it was a hot air baloon as it seemed to bob through the clouds like a cork would on water.  As it got closer it broke through the cloud cover it was a cylider, gun metal grey in colour that was slowly rotating. When it broke through the clouds it was at a left angle. It straightened out! and leaned to the right still rotating and then went back into the clouds. It really felt like I was seeing something that I shouldn't be seeing and it was so large and onimous that it kind of freaked  me out, so much so  that I quit my job to be closer to home. I now work in Swansea at 5 grand less a year to be closer to my family incase anything should happen. It seems a bit of an extreme action but either I was badly halucinating or I actually saw something that was totally out of this world. I cannot tell you what it was but I can tell you it was no plane, baloon, venus or swap gas.  My earlier UFO sighting happened to me when I was 11 years old, in the middle of the day at my local Junior school. I was always the last to be picked for football being a short fat kid and was hanging off the raillings of the school yard waiting to be picked as goalie as usual. It was a clear sunny day and visibility was really good. I heard some of the kids in the yard start saying things like they were looking at a flying saucer.I glanced up but couldn't see anything. I looked around to my left and saw to my astonishment what can only be discribed as two dinner plates joined together top to top and viewed from the side. It made no noise at all and shot across the sky from one mountain at the top of the valley behind another valley into the next. It went from the Llynfi valley (town called maesteg) into the Afan valley. It left a shadow on the ground and was below the height of the mountain which it passed behind. Literally a few seconds later there was an almightly roar as two RAF jets, Jaguars I think  chased it behind the mountain it disappeared behind. It really freaked me out. The ufo literally left the planes standing. I approached a teacher along with three other pupils and tried to explain what I had seen. I asked him why the ufo never made a sound and he told me the wind must have been blowing the other way???? Neadless to say that the incident changed my views on things for the rest of my life. If it was a government aircraft why was it being tested so low over a populated area?  Don't they have test ranges for that sort of thing?  Why did I hear the jets and not the ufo?  Why would a government risk testing prototype untested aircraft over populated areas, when there is a danger of these ""aircraft"" failing?  The object in my third sighting however was picked up by my digital camera using night shot in daylight.  Nothing was seen at the time of the shot but when checking my pictures later a disc was clearly seen.   This has been analysed by a private ufo group and the results are quite startling.  ufo websight http://www.alien-disclosure-group.moonfruit.com/ under recent posts.

It was roughly parallel to the ground and just to the left of the interstate, with multiple green lights contained in an oval shape with trailing sparks. It was visible for maybe 2-3 seconds before it simply disappeared/vanished.  It was a virtual duplicate of a sighting I had several years ago further down I-81 near the Rockbridge-Botetourt County line: same time, direction and description, albeit 80-100 miles further north – an experience I called in to the Rockbridge County Sheriff’s Department at the time. The difference? I had a witness riding next to me, my wife was dozing in the front passenger seat when I told her to look up.  The thing was visible long enough for her to awaken, look up, and see it to.  Other traffic on the highway at the time had to have viewed it as well, but I found nothing in news reports the following day.  I couldn’t judge altitude, size or speed, but if the spark tail was from atmospherical re-entry it was quite large and flying at a speed well above the posted (65 MPH) limit.

When our aircraft was less than four hours from destination, perhaps in the vicinity of Iceland, sometime after 5 a.m. GMT, the sky was still dark.  While my sister went to the lavatory, I moved over into her window seat to see if there was light on the horizon.  Situated several rows behind the port wing, I noticed a spherical red light toward the rear of the aircraft. At first, I wondered if it was attached to the tail, since it appeared close and much larger than the stars, the same apparent size as the wing light, though less bright.  That I immediately ruled out, as it was too far away from the plane.  It was impossible to tell if this sphere was a glowing object at some distance or a light on some larger, dark object at closer range.  When my sister returned we both observed this light – not the regular wing lights and strobe of conventional skycraft, but a single, deep red light or glowing orb that flew at our altitude, keeping pace exactly with our airliner.  We watched it a good thirty seconds before it veered off to the side and receded quickly into the distance.  We must have been flying in some cloud cover because the red object appeared to be increasingly enveloped in fog, the farther away it traveled.  This probably indicates it was closer than another plane should have been or it would have been obscured in the cloud.  Upon landing, I decided to quiz the captain, who stood outside the cockpit as we deplaned.  ""Did you see that red bogey that was pacing us on the port side at around 5 o'clock?"" I asked rather loudly.  He replied that he hadn't, chuckled and said jokingly, “It might have been a UFO.”  It was there long enough that I don't know how he could have missed it.  We told all the people we visited in England about our sighting, and one woman said she was relieved to hear someone else describe such a thing, because she had seen something very similar on a night flight.  I will gladly speak with any investigator interested in this sighting but doubt there is anything further I could add to this report.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,

I still doubt what actually I saw but I am sure that whatever it was, it was not human. Not even earthly. It was God, devil or an alien. It had tremendous energy and I felt the force in the proximity of the thing. In fact I fainted due to it. 	Well I was coming home at around 2:00 AM as I work in an MNC and do night shifts. Suddenly the road disappeared in front of me. There was a huge bus like thing with no wheels, hovering over the road, blocking it. I flashed the high beam to get a better look. The thing then split into two. There was a bright flash of light- brighter than anything I have seen. For a moment it seemed almost like daytime. A creature descended from the machine and looked at me. I was so scared that I turned the car’s lights off. I kept the engine running so that I can escape in event of an attack. But the creature did not seem to bother about me. It looked like a human but around 7-8 feet tall and quite huge, bulky and hairy like a bear. And the head was slightly bigger than that of an average human. It was carrying an instrument that looked like a crystal cube with a handle. The creature just raised the instrument and waved it. Then it took out a box like thing and put the instrument in it. Then it approached my car. As it neared my vehicle, I felt heat and force of high magnitude. When it was around a yard away from me I fainted due to the intense pressure- like G force. I regained consciousness after about 10 minutes and the thing was gone. It left a hole of about 1 feet depth and 10-12 feet in diameter on the road where it was hovering. I just rushed to home. I was not able to sleep for whole day. Next day while going to office I stopped at the spot and the strange thing was that the road had been repaired. The question I have is that when the creature approached my car, why did it leave me and my car unharmed?   Regards, Elvin.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,

An orange light in the sky appeared against the red-orange-green of the fading daylight. The light was relatively stationary over the West part of the city (about 20 miles away from me) at about 3,000 ft in the air. And so I assumed that it was an airliner on it's landing approach to Tucson International. A few things about the light, however, caught my interest. It appeared to be too orange to be an aircraft landing light and it seemed to be positioned too far to the North of TIA's runways 11L/11R to be on the final approach leg to one of those runways (the lines of descending lights on Tucson's Western horizon at night are airliners landing on these runways). After about 2 minutes a smaller orange light broke away from the original light and after a few seconds the two lights casually faded out . The manner in which this happened made me think of a small plane on fire and a part breaking away from it before falling out of the sky, yet I heard no explosions or saw no burning embers fall to earth. Still, the novelty of this event inspired me to wait around a while to see if I could hear any police sirens or breaking news reports about a small plane crash over Tucson. As I was doing this I kept my eyes on the Western sky to see if anything else appeared. After about 15-20 minutes I became bored and went into the house to get something. About 5 minutes later I returned to the porch and resumed my scanning of the Western sky. The sky was now a bluish-green horizon turning to the blackness of night as I spied another similar orange light to the South of the original one, this one farther away and appearing to be at a much higher altitude . This light only appeared for half a second before falling fast like a tear drop and disappearing. I stayed outside for about 30 minutes after that and did not see any other similar events. When I finally went inside, it was night. I wonder if anyone else in the city saw this?  A few things to think about: Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is situated in between my house and the airport. I am a former pilot and have never seen this type of thing before. It could have been a flare drop at the Barry-Goldwater range in the desert to the West of the city, yet it seemed too close for this; it appeared to be in front of the Tucson mountains from my frame of reference. It could have been space phenomena, i.e. meteorite activity, yet all of the meteroite entries into the atmosphere I have seen have been very fast an angular.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

It couldn't be a comet because it would have had a trail of debree. Definetly no meteor just by observation. It was about the size of a quarter if you held it in your hand.

Weather: Temperature (est) upper 80s/low 90s), humidity (dew point 60s), wind light, clear sky with patch of high level cirrus to north east.  Air craft contrails moderate to short with definite gaps in trail. Narrative: I was sitting on a lounge chair located in the patio shade attempting to read a novel as I played with my granddaughter and a neighbor’s child.  They were interested in how the chair could change positions as I relaxed so they were tilting me to and fro.  My grandson was off exploring around the corner of the house. I observed a contrail passing from North to South as an aircraft flew along the usual flight path to the west of Washington.  This contrail was short to moderate in length as it evaporated into the dry upper-level air.  The next aircraft observed along that path did not pass until after 1700 hours.  Length of contrails depends upon humidity level of the surrounding air and there were definite long gaps in these contrails. As I looked at the contrail and the aircraft started to disappear behind a nearby tree, my attention was drawn to a bright light very slightly above the contrail.  I assumed this light to be caused by the sun reflecting from another aircraft.  As I looked at the light source, its position in the sky relative to the contrail did not change.  Thus it could not have been caused by reflection from another aircraft. Nor could it have been caused by reflection from a satellite.  Both sources would have moved relative to the contrail. Shortly the apparent position relative to the still existing contrail changed from above to below the contrail.  Time for this change from the initial was estimated in the neighborhood of 30 to 60 seconds.  I noted that the light was now an object that appeared to be similar to a high flying balloon such as those used for upper air studies.  So my next guess at the cause of the bright light that I first noticed was a reflection from the instrument package.  Thus I arose from my lounge chair to call my grandchildren so that I could show them the balloon. The object now appeared against the blue sky background as a white/blue-gray annulus with a darker blue-gray center. It was much larger than the original light source.  Relative size can be compared to that of a pea (3-5 mm) held at arms’ length.  From my viewing angle I assumed that it was a round object with a flat bottom since it appeared elliptical.  Color and shading was consistent with light shining through, not reflecting from, a high flying polyethylene balloon.  Brightness was similar to that of the moon which was in the eastern sky on that day.  The moon in the southern sky was hidden from my view by the roof of the home. I continued to view the object as it moved quite quickly for a short (relative) distance and stopped.  Upon this movement, I started to think that perhaps the object was much closer to me and that it could be some type of air borne seed (such as cottonwood) or debris moved about by low level winds swirling around the house.  Second thoughts occurred as I changed my position relative to nearby houses and trees.  This object had moved too fast for wind born insects, seeds or debris. As I continued to observe the object, it very suddenly accelerated and sped off eastward passing across my field of view from west to east behind the nearby rooftop in well under one second.  Total subtended angle of movement before moving out of my sight was in the 20 degree range.  No contrail or other evidence of its passing remained except the image in my minds eye. Altitude of this object cannot be estimated from this single observation since the size of this object is unknown.  Estimated angle above the horizon at first sighting is around 40 degrees.  The apparent standing still with respect to the contrail can be explained by the initial movement of the object directly toward me.  The object would have moved closer to me and toward the north as it descended below my reference contrail and become a recognizable shape.  From my viewing angle, the object was probably circular giving it somewhat of an elliptical ""cigar"" shape popularized by other UFO reports.  It moved too fast across my field of view to describe it better.  Total viewing time was 1.5 to 3 minutes.   This is estimated from my first sighting to my subsequent moving about to locate my grandchildren.  I certainly did not look at my watch during this event.

I saw  a blinking light in the sky first which looked like what I'd seen the  previous night.  That light was way in the sky but it was across the  lake SE from me and then, and I couldn't see it very well, but I  definitely saw a low, closer hovering light fairly dim in the trees more to the  left next to the property and then what I thought might be people out  on the property with flashlights - there were lights as if from a  flashlight or helicopter surveying the ground and I couldn't tell what I saw  it wasn't very clear but it was a streak of some low to the ground  animal back and forth.

I  read for a bit to calm my mind and when I turned the light off to go to  sleep - through the blinds in a room completely on the other side of the  house facing West there was a very, very bright light that was  hovering in the wooded area outside our house.  I woke my husband up again and  he agreed he could see it and although he'll never admit it could be  anything other than something explainable I could tell he got a little  spooked.  He kept whispering loud - ""ok, so what do you want me to do? I  see it, I see it"".  The light would change from VERY bright white to  dimmer so you could barely see it and then brighten up again and as it  would brighten a bunch of tiny little colored lights would blink so fast - red blue green.   I saw this light at around 12:45 and it lasted a little over an hour.  It moved very slowly all around and lowered into  the trees and I heard noises like low whistles best way I can describe  it was a soft high pitched noise between flute and a whistle.  I had  trouble sleeping but nothing else happened after the thing left.  I didn't  move to another window - when it was out of my eyeshot, I just let it  go.

Within seconds I realized the flashing was either rotating or coming from both ends and that the flashing was not consistent like the strobe on an aircraft.  There was no  lights or a strobe that would associate it with being an airplane and the way it was moving, very erradic, slow then fast, up , down, this was just not the way any aircraft that I am aware of can or would fly.  The brightness of these flashing lights would be comparable to what would be seen from arc welding at a distance.   We watched this for about 2 minutes and then it disappeared.  We were facing northwest which would have put whatever it was above the Hanford Nuclear Reservation or very close to it.  The sky was clear and there was considerable amount of moonlight.   If you can imagine what it would look like to see the bright flashing light that has NO consistency from several LARGE scaled arc welders flying through the night sky, that is what we were seeing.  This was NOT the strobe light from any aircraft, the way it was moving was unlike anything either one of us has ever seen and to recall this event has me goosebumped from head to toe.  I would really like to hear from others that must have seen this as there is no way you could have missed it.  Please inform me if there is any other reports of this.

Partially through the movie, at about 22:30, I saw a flash in the corner of my eye, out of the open window. I dismissed it, until it happened several times. I figured it was a manipulation of a flashing, from a window, in the flats across the street. I grew intrigued and stared at the sky. There was absolutely no sound made by the flashes, no definitive lightning form or such - and the weather was definetly not the sort for such. I saw a flash in the clouds, silhouetting a black, stretched sphere. At arm's length, my fist would be the same size as the area of the flash. at 23:15, I began to type down what time I saw the flashes. I recognised a pattern forming, the flashes every 5 minutes - 23:13, 23:18.

On the drive back from Georgia to Alabama on Saturday night, May 10, we went the Tennessee route, because it was shorter. I hate that way, especially coming back from Georgia, because the last leg is a highway that is very dark. Somewhere around Scottsboro along highway 72 (West) we noticed this very bright, very annoying flashing light just ahead of us. It was just behind the treeline across the highway on out left. We first thought it was far ahead of us and we would soon pass it, but after miles, and miles, it was still just ahead of us. We started wondering what it was, because it was so bright and distracting. The more we paid attention, the more we thought it was moving, just in front of us. I kept looking behind us thinking maybe it was a series of lights, but no, there was nothing behind us. I thought it might be some elaborate storm warning system, because we were headed into bad weather, though it was on the other side of the state at the time. A couple of times the treeline vanished, and I saw at least one row of horizontal lights, maybe two. At one point I thought maybe it was part of a prison tower, because it seemed to be attached to something that looked like the top of a prison tower. But if it was, it was a moving prison. I also briefly thought maybe it was reflector lights on a wire running across the road, but I'd never seen them before and why were they visable from behind a tree line if that is what they were?  Finally we paid very close attention to it, and as I looked and the treeline cleared for a moment what I saw was a row of very bright lights on the bottom of what looked like an observation deck. On top of that was a very, very large, very flat platform, which seemed to be oval shaped. I said to my boyfriend ""I may be crazy, but that looks like a giant UFO."" He kept glancing but he was driving, so he couldn't see as much as I did. By the time I realized it might be something worth taking a picture of, it had finally started to slow down and inch behind us (mind you, we were driving about 60-70 miles and hour this whole time). I took a couple of pictures, which were mostly black, and I took a bit of video, but by then it was way behind us and seemed to be fading. After that we drove into a storm with real lightning and we didn't see any more strange lights. I don't know what it was, but if what I saw was what it was, then it was a gigantic UFO. We were on Sand Mountain, which they say is where most UFO sightings in north Alabama are concentrated. It was really cool, and I wouldn't swear it was a UFO as in an ""alien"" ship, but it was something unusual.

A fast traveling object that covered great (irregular) distances while blinking multiple colors extremely fast.,Tucson,AZ,2008-05-11T20:00:00,light,1 Hour & Counting...,"Occurred : 5/11/2008 20:00  (Entered as : 05/11/08 20:00) Reported: 5/11/2008 9:59:33 PM 21:59 Posted: 6/12/2008 Location: Tucson, AZ Shape: Light Duration:1 Hour & Counting...",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63098.html,"A fast traveling object that covered great (irregular) distances while blinking multiple colors extremely fast. My girlfriend and I were driving home from a SubWay restaurant when I saw what appeared to be a malfunctioning airplane. It’s hard to stress in words how distinctly different from an airplane this was, and when I saw it my mouth dropped and I immediately pulled over to the side of the road. I live at the base of a mountain (the outskirts of the city) and was heading north-east when I saw it. After I pulled over to the side of the road and I pointed out what I saw to my girlfriend and she became as awed as I was. Now that I had stopped moving I was able to properly asses what I was looking at. It was a ball of light about four times as big as a star but smaller than an airplane light that was blinking/flashing multiple colors (I’m talking almost every color imaginable) about 10 times per every 1 time that an airplanes light blinks. Basically, if an airplane blinks 2 times a second, this object was blinking about 20-30 times a second in alternating colors like red, blue, green, purple…etc in a hard to catch order (if any). However, that wasn’t the half of it… Its one thing to see colorful flashing (strobe-light like) light, but it’s another to see this object’s crazy movement in the sky. It came from the north-east heading north-west in an irregular, non-linear path that consisted of circles and zigzags with behaviors similar to that of a firefly. It was moving nothing like an airplane/satellite/whatever, and occasionally consisted of dives that dropped the object hundreds of feet in order to regain its altitude only seconds later. At this point I was freaked out enough and decided to call the police for help… I called 911, who forwarded me to the Local Police department where they took my information and told me to keep my eye on the object. I continued to watch the object in its irregular path towards the west when it suddenly seemed to stop in one location for about 10 minutes! It seemed to stay in the same vicinity but make loops, dives and etc, all covering great distances in very short periods of time. Wanting to contact a UFO hotline, I got into my car and drove the remainder of the distance home. When I got home I did a quick search to get to www.nuforc.org and call the hotline support. I talked to someone for a good 5-10 mins about the object I could now barely see in the distance. He told me to call up friends closer to the object (that was now far west) to see if they could spot the object as well. As he was telling me this I noticed a helicopter flying over my neighborhood (with a spotlight) at the intersection I had told the police that I had witnessed the object (I don’t know if that was a coincidence or what). I later drove back to the original place I had seem the object, where I called my friends on the other side of town. They all couldn’t see the object because they lived more into the city and had a harder time seeing stars (because of the many lights) let alone a weird blinking thing. I eventually drove home and filled out this report as the man on the hotline had told me to do.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

It was more of a star shape with about six points, dark against the bright blue December sky.  My next guesses of a very large leaf or (hah!) a flying squirrel were ruled out by the altitude of the object. I guessed it was flying at over 1000 feet.  It cruised silently from almost directly west to east, at roughly 120 to 150 knots at my estimated altitude. As it approached the trees on the eastern horizon, I could no longer make out the points of the star. It now appeared more like a ball.  Perhaps unrelated to this, a helicopter (which I took to be military from the sound) followed the same course (and apparent altitude) exactly ten minutes later.  Earlier today I was taking pictures of hawks and so had my telephoto camera within 20 feet of me but had no time to take a picture of the object.  The object may have been a very large balloon, though I haven't seen many star-shaped balloons of this sort. It flew in the direction of the wind.

Then I realised it was moving, and the light was pulsing. It moved very slowly at first and not in a straight line, so I didn't think it could be a comet or meteor (as all of those I have ever seen have been very fast and moved in one straight direction only). There was no noise at all from it, which made me think it couldnt have been an aircraft and besides no aircraft lights look like that. It moved to a point directly above where I was, and stayed there pulsing but not moving for about 30 seconds. Then it seemed to go straight up as the light got smaller before disappearing altogether.  A couple of planes passed by at the edge of the sky a few minutes later and they made the normal noise and looked completely different so I am utterly convinced it could not have been a plane or helicopter.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

Object description:  To the naked eye, appeared as a gray hazy patch, mostly circular but flattened on one side. Approximate magnitude 1 to 2 at initial sighting, approximate size ¾ degree across.  Through binoculars (10x50) & telescope (6” F5 reflector) was shaped very much like a water fountain spraying straight up (or a mushroom cloud, pointed at the base). Through the telescope I noticed a point-source of light traveling with the cloud, near the tip, or base.  This point-source varied up and down in magnitude slowly, averaging around 5th magnitude, but every so often (between 10 and 60 seconds or so) it would flare to perhaps –2 magnitude, instantaneously, as if sunlight were reflecting from a flat surface, as is observed with tumbling satellites.  Movement was in a straight line. At initial sighting this was approximately 3/4 degree per minute. Object speed slowed as it progressed across the sky, indicating to me that it was traveling in a straight line, as opposed to orbiting Earth. The brightness of the cloud diminished as well, though more rapidly than the point-source.  At the end of the observation the cloud was no longer visible, only the point-source, which by this time had faded to average magnitude of 10 to 11, still flaring to magnitude 4 or so. Movement had slowed to about 120 arc seconds per 10 seconds.  To summarize, object was first sighted in Cassiopeia, approx Alt. 65 degrees, Az. 5 degrees (R.A. 0h10m x Dec. 55 deg.). After approximately one hour, final sighting was in Lynx at approx Alt. 40 degrees, Az. 60 (R.A. 6h40m x Dec. 55 deg.) Object traversed approx 55 degrees.  I have sketched the view through the telescope, indicating the location of the point-source of light, the direction of travel, and the direction of North. I will e-mail the sketch.  Also I took several photos with a 35mm SLR, ranging from 30 to 60 seconds each on ISO 200 film. When I get it developed I will send those pictures. The film had been in the camera for a long time, hopefully the pictures will come out okay. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD))",2008-03-04T00:00:00,34.3527,-83.2983

This is a second hand report based on conversations from 3 co-workers that I found credible due to the nature of the converstaion. After work 2 brothers arrived near home at about 10:30 pst at Pyramid Lake Nevada. They saw 2 red lights descending towards the mountains. This seemed strange to them and as thay observed more closely they described realizing that it was a single very large (aporox 1/4mile perhaps longer in length) elogated object due to the fact that as it moved it blacked out the stars between the two red lights. These lights ocasionally faded or brightened with changes in motion of the entire craft. They pulled over and got out of the car .. the object continued to move across the mountains occasionally descending behind and back up.  A loud noise was associated with the movement of the craft. One brother described the sound like a shotgun blast that lasted the whole time. The other brother described it as like the sound of an earthquake rumble/shock sound but louder. No vibrations or shockwaves were felt by either brothers. At one point the object stopped over the mountain top about 2 miles from their position and lit the mountainside with a very intese yellow light this lasted at least 15 seconds the light allowed them to see the mountainside in exceptional detail, sagebrush, trees, rocks. At this time another freind of theirs returning home to the same area pulled over beside them and observed the following.  The craft moved away acompanied by louder noise and up into the sky disapearing. The craft never seemed to turn in relation to their position so that only the one aspect of the object was ever presented to their veiwing position. No protrusions were observed. The shape of any other sides were not evident. They have lived in the area for years and are used to military aircraft in the area, helicpoters, jets and munition explosions. This was FAR different from anything they had ever seen. The next morning they observed two military jets lingering and flying around the area of the sighting. I had overheard my three co-workers talking amongst themselves and began to ask about their sighting. At no time during our conversation did I feel the story to be made up or exagerated. They appeared genuinly astonished and awed by what they witnessed with no attempt to impress or gain noteriety. They are in their early twenties in age had not been drinking as they were just returning home from the end of their shift. I have related this to your website as I have never heard a more detailed or unusual eyewitness account that I felt to be credible and honestly given.

On Monday 10th December 2007 we went for a short walk at about 10.30pm, and noticed the lovely clear skies, and how bright the stars were and decided to use the binoculars we’d borrowed to sit and watch them for a while.  (We live in a city, so can’t see the stars very well at home)   We’d just started passing them between us, when my husband exclaimed that one star was very bright and twinkling.  At the time I thought nothing of it, as it was a clear, cold, winter night, and stars can appear to shimmer in the atmosphere.  We were looking over the loch as the ‘Little Bear’ constellation was becoming visible and rising over the hills.  There was no moon.  Weather was cold, clear and bright, no clouds in the sky. On looking through the binoculars, he could see a white glowing body of the object, with flashing red, green and blue/purple lights around the edge.  Of course, we both thought at first that it was a helicopter, civilian or military plane (especially as we were in a remote location, we thought it could be the RAF testing a new/unknown craft) or even a satellite, caught up in the atmosphere, as it seemed a long way away (the colours were only visible as twinkles with the naked eye, but clearly with the binoculars)  We sat passing the binoculars between us for some time, watching in puzzlement as the object moved quickly around the sky, but always in the same patch of sky (south west of the ‘little bear’  constellation)  Several times (at least 3) the bright object seemed to disappear into the distance, as it became so faint, it was only possible to see it if not looking directly at it (as with a faint star) the first time this happened we thought it was travelling away from us, and that was that.  But it came back into focus, clearer this time, and appeared larger (though still a white glow) there were absolutely no clouds in the sky at the time; all other objects in the sky were clear at all times. This first phase happened over about an hour.  Then, as the stars gradually moved around the sky, the object appeared to stop moving of its own accord, and drift in the same direction, at this point we were wondering if it had been a satellite we were watching.  But then, the object starting moving rapidly against the direction of the stars, and could be seen to be streaming white almost like a vapour trail and seemed arrow shaped (possibly due to travelling through earth's atmosphere), previous to this it had appeared oval/disc shaped it continued doing this for some time--it was reminiscent of when a kite is being flown and the flyer yanks the string to pull it in or out of the wind flow--it looked as though it was jetting out of Earth’s atmosphere to the other side. Eventually it stopped jetting in the opposite direction of the stars, as if it had got through the atmosphere and through the other side into outer space.  It appeared to be moving further into the distance, and now only glowed with a pulsing light, that changed from faint violet to greenish yellow in a clockwise motion, almost as though a beam of light was emanating from the object and changing colour as it did so.  The object then did not continue following the direction of the stars but remained in one position.  We continued watching for some time, and it remained, glowing in the sky. We first spotted the object at about 11.00 pm and finished watching at about 2am, as were very cold by that point.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

The lights formed a triangular shape in the sky with the base approximately one 6th of the height.

I am not sure how long this had been going on before I arrived but people were standing in the parking lot looking up in amazement. One guy was filming it. It was around nine at night when I saw it and, just before 10 minutes had gone by, it all of the sudden tilted and took a sharp abrupt dive behind the store which would be a field. A few of us, myself included, looked behind the store and it was just dark. There was never at anytime a sound.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,34.71265882352942,-86.75229705882353
"BLT RESEARCH REPORT:  Unusual wide ring of flattened field-corn found NW of Harrisburg, PA.",Harrisburg area,PA,2006-10-14T00:00:00,,,"Occurred : 10/14/2006   (Entered as : 10/14/06) Reported: 10/30/2006 5:58:29 PM 17:58 Posted: 12/7/2006 Location: Harrisburg area, PA Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53173.html,"Unusual wide ring of flattened field-corn found NW of Harrisburg, PA On October 28, 2006 a local turkey hunter who was working the edges of a remote farm field stumbled upon a large (90 ft. +/- overall diameter) flattened ring in field corn, which abutted one edge of the field.  The flattened ring was subsequently rough-measured to be approximately 30 ft. wide, with a standing center section of about 30 ft.  The 8-9 ft. tall corn plants were all laid in a counter-clockwise swirl around the center section of standing plants.  The hunter further reports a ""path"" off one side of the ring which appeared to him to be part of the formation.  From the photos provided it appears that some of the plants were not completely flattened to the ground, and some appear to be broken at the 2nd or 3rd stem node from the ground--in spite of the hunter's assertion that he observed no cut or broken stems.  The ""path"" was not photographed clearly enough to determine it's width or length.  The hunter, who hunts this posted land with permission from the owner, estimated that the ring had occurred some 1-2 weeks previously, although this is really a guess.  He reports no high-power electric lines near the field but notes that there is a creek running along one side.  We are told that the land-owner does not allow access to his remote farm generally, but a MUFON researcher reported no evidence of radiation on his visit to the site.  No compass work was carried out and there is no information regarding the plant stem nodes.  No samples were taken.  From the photos we observe what looks like a fairly typical cropcircle flow to the lay of the plants; we note that a ring in corn is rare (most events in corn are flattened circles) and also point out the relatively large (30 ft.) width of this ring.  These facts, along with the very remote location, suggest that this event is not man-made although, without on-site observation and sampling, it is impossible to be certain.

The event actually took place about 20 min North-west of Moab. We were driving in momentary silence along I-70 when my friend pointed at the sky and exclaimed he saw a meteor entering the atmosphere. The light was brighter than the moon and dimmed as it entered the atmosphere. We then saw what looked like 3 objects breaking away from the bright light as it dimmed. As the green, red and blue lights began coming closer to the ground we realized that they were not separate but attached to something spinning; possibly triangular in shape.  The strange thing was thier was no noise, no trail of dust or fire and as the object came closer to the ground, it began slowing over the mountain just ahead of us as if it were landing.  Seeing as we made fun of stories like this, we continued to rationalize that it wasn't as it seemed. We pulled off of a truck stop about a mile down the highway where several truckers had pulled off as well. We looked over the ridge to see if we could still see the object, but it was further away than we had originally thought. After realizing we had just encountered a UFO, two truckers pulled up next to us and asked if we had seen the 'lights'. We talked with them about what we had seen and their story was exactly as we saw it as well.

At lunch time (20:30 hours) most of us shipfitters and welders would go to our main shop (Building 128) for lunch, card playing, naps or whatever we could do in only half an hour. This was the week after Echo I had been launched and was scheduled to be visible over the Los Angeles area.  I think it was Tuesday the 16th when lunch ended and one of the welders called for us out to the front (South side) of the shop to watch Echo I pass overhead.  It was a very clear night and was easily seen as a silver dot (about the size of a pencil lead held at arm's length).  It's orbit from West to East was easily tracked and we all felt thankful to have had an opportunity to see it on one of the few nights it would be seen in our area. The next night there were scattered clouds and as I left the shop building after lunch and walked toward Dry Dock 2 I looked up at the clouds and thought to myself, ""Much too cloudy to see Echo tonight"". Then from above the clouds on a Southerly course I saw four crescent shaped objects ""flying"" in a reverse ""V"" formation.  Being crescent shaped and not too long after sunset I first surmised it was the sun (now over our horizon) that was reflecting off of some type of aircraft like the Vought V-173 ""Flying Pancake"".  I could only see them for about 4 or 5 seconds before they disappeared above another cloud.  I tried to listen for a sound of aircraft engines but heard nothing except for the leaking air from low pressure air manifolds down in the Dry Dock.  If they were the Vought aircraft, I would certainly have heard their twin propeller engines. I checked my glasses for dust, backed up and stepped forward again to see if they were a reflection of something on the ground off my glasses.  I did this for one or two minutes without being able to duplicate the apparent sighting.  In size, and if circular or ""saucer"" shaped with the reflecting sun on their West edges, they would be the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length (as opposed to a pencil lead in my description of Echo I). When I mentioned this to a couple of my fellow workers they just laughed and said I've been reading too many Science Fiction books (actually I was reading Harold Lamb's historical novels at that time). I have modified an historical map of the shipyard (that no longer exists) that I reconstructed from old maps and aerial photos for a book I am writing on the history of the Shipyard, Naval Base and attached Naval Air Station.  In accordance with your instructions of electronically uploading images, I am emailing this map both as an insert and as an attachment for your study. Because I transferred over to the Design Division 4 years later and eventually was the structural configuration manager of the 1980's reactivation of the Iowa Class Battleships I kept the story to myself - except with friends who like stories like that.  I retired in 1994 but did not decide to file an official report until now when I realized the accuracy of my shipyard map may be of value.",,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

UFO  June-August 1964 or 1965  At 9:30pm I went to a ""parking"" place with my girlfriend, about five miles southeast of Wautoma, WI.  Soon after arriving we noticed a light moving across the sky.  We watched and commented how it must be an airplane, but we thought it should somehow have different lighting.  It was a steady white light not unlike a star, except it did not ""twinkle"" like a star.  As we followed the light across the sky we fully expected it to disappear below the horizon.  It did not.  The light circled around behind us and then disappeared below the horizon.  The area behind us was flat for several hundred feet and then rose ten to twenty feet or so.  While still watching where the light had disappeared, the light reappeared, still behind us relatively in the same area it disappeared.  It might have been several yards to the right in the clockwise circle it had started to make.  The light circled around us in a clockwise fashion very slowly for many minutes, sometimes disappearing below the horizon/rise behind us, always coming back up circling.  At some point after reappearing from the horizon/rise behind us, the light dipped into a grove of trees to the left of the driver’s side of the car.  Note:  Up until then I was under the impression the light was either up with the stars or at least up there somewhere with jets.  The trees were about a hundred yards away.  We could see the light going through the trees!  It came out, circled, disappeared behind us, and went into the trees a dozen times or so.  The last experience occurred when the light had again disappeared below the horizon/rise behind us.  We were looking for it to reappear when it flashed at our back window.  The object/light seemed to take up only half or less of the back window.  (1960 Corvair, 4 Dr)  It was there for only a second.  The light did not hurt my eyes.  There was never any sound associated with the event.  The object/light’s departure was instantaneous, not to be seen again.  The event lasted about twenty minutes.

I had gotten out of the car first, and was heading toward the house, when I turned back to see if my mother was behind me. I looked up a bit and saw a large craft, floating silently in the sky. It was round in shape but had a raised section in the center. The section had angled sides and a flat top. I yelled out to my mother, who came over and stood next to me while we watched and discussed it. I had the impression that it was quite big. It was floating what I think was about 6000-8000 feet above a very tall tree that was there, which helped me get perspective on it. There was nothing unclear about it. Over the next 10-15 minutes the sun began to set, we were entering into twilight, and some light clouds started moving in. At that time, the fire alarm for the town, which was a few blocks away, started sounding, but instead of just doing so several times, it just kept sounding, over and over again, without stopping. I spotlight appeared in the sky, which was scanning all around the area where the craft was. We speculated that other people must have seen it, and that they were probably trying to find it with the spotlight. It was frustrating, because they came close to it a few times, but missed it. At that time, I left my mother there and ran inside to get my father. He was a pilot in the navy, and had experience with observing aircraft. By the time I got him up and outside, the craft was gone. My mother said that it took off so fast that she wasn’t sure which direction it went in. She told me a few years later, before she died, that it had actually vanished, and that she was so stunned by having seen it that she said it took off instead. She was afraid that if the said that it had simply disappeared, everyone would think she was crazy, or that she made it up, because in her and everyone else’s mind, huge objects, especially ones found floating in the sky, do not just disappear. I told many people about this at the time, but found out very quickly that very few people would believe me, and that the one’s who didn’t would ridicule me. It was frustrating, but after a while I just stopped talking about it. The only thing that made anyone realize that I was telling the truth is that I was with my mother when it happened, and she was a very honest, rock-solid person. Any time the subject of UFO’s came up in our presence, we would just look at each other and sort of roll our eyes. We knew what we saw. The second sighting I had was with five other people. We were outside during the summer, on a hot night. Our family friend, Mr. M, pointed out what he thought was a satellite, moving across the sky. We (me, my sister, mother, father, Mr. M and another young friend) were standing in our driveway watching it, and talking about satellites. But when it came to a certain point, it suddenly stopped, right next to a second light of approximately the same size and brightness. We were all quite surprised, since as far as I know, satellites don’t stop like that. It stayed in that position for a few minutes, and then came the big shocker – the second light simply disappeared, as if someone turned off a switch. A few seconds later, the first light continued across the night sky, and over the horizon. I had one more sighting, in the summer of 1973. I was alone, in my bedroom, at the rear of the house. I was lying in bed, when I saw lights coming from above the house. There was no sound at all. When I pulled the curtain back, I could see a triangular shaped craft, but it was hard to see, because it was 10-11 at night, and very dark. There were lights on bottom that were strongly colored. I believe they were primary colors: red, a bluish color and a yellowish one. These lights were in groups of three and seemed to be rotating, on the bottom of the craft. It seemed to be hovering VERY low – maybe 200-300 feet. I was frightened, because it was so close, and my parents were out, so I was alone. It was all over in a minute. It moved on, heading north, over the house. I few minutes later, I went outside to see if I could still see it, but it was gone. At that time, a helicopter with no lights hovered over the house at a low altitude for 1-2 minutes, and then flew off in the same direction that the craft had. It was quite loud. These sightings were in Islip, NY, between approximately 1969/1970 and 1973. I know you don’t want names, but I would like you to know that I would gladly take a polygraph, or testify about this in any forum. I think a lot of people have sightings but are afraid to tell anyone, for fear of ridicule. I didn’t tell anyone about these experiences for years, for that reason.

Then, the main object gave off bright light burst and moved vertical slightly before it disappeared completely. GONE!  As background: The night sky was relatively clear with no noticeable wind and just a few high clouds. I used the tree line to measure the object’s unconventional movement. At the same time, I observed several airplanes making their approach/departures near SeaTac airport. I clearly observed aircraft and stars before and after the “EVENT”.  The above described round orb and little light are like nothing else I’ve witnessed in night sky, not even remotely. I've been thinking about this all day, and it's still with me very strongly. I was just standing on my deck looking at the view and it really spooked me to see something so strange and have it stay with me so vividly. I decided to search online to see if anyone else saw anything unusual in the area to no avail, but I feel obligated to report this. I am an educated individual and for sure skeptical of UFOs.

Two of my friends and I were laying on my trampoline in my backyard around 1:20 AM in Las Vegas, NV. We were talking and just looking at the stars when I noticed this odd formation of lights moving across the sky. There were three clusters moving together- the main cluster was a V shape and the two other clusters were slanted lines coming from the sides of the V’s. They seemed to kind of float like a sting-ray would underwater. I pointed the lights out to my two friends. I pointed out that it was coming from where “Area 51” is supposed to be and one friend also pointed out that it was moving towards Nellis Air Force Base.  Soon after, an airplane left McCarran airport and we compared the two. The UFO was completely silent and seemed to float and flutter while the airplane made a lot of noise and the body was completely visible. Both objects seemed to fly at the same pace and altitude. About a minute after the airplane went by, I noticed another UFO flying a very similar route as the first, except this UFO had no lights and was seemingly transparent. At times it was a dark brown/green color, but mostly the same shade as the night sky. When it flew over stars, it was more visible and the stars seemed to change a little bit. This UFO was going a bit faster than the first and was also completely silent. Unfortunately, only one friend noticed it when I pointed it out.  Friend A, who saw both crafts, believed the first UFO was one object. I, however, believe the two smaller clusters (both made up of about 3 to 4 lights) were just flying extremely close to the main cluster- as if protecting. The cluster to the right seemed to be a little behind when I first noticed, then sped up a little- as if to catch up with the other two crafts. He hadn't seen it before that moment, but has researched UFOs for some time.  Note: At my location, the routes of the crafts and of the airplane that left McCarran airport would intersect, making an X. Hence, they flew from and towards different directions.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

March 13, 2007 My daughter and I were driving home at approximately 7:40 PM (PST) on Tuesday, March 13, 2007 in Simi Valley California when I caught something blue out of the corner of my eye. It was airborne and flying at a very high rate of speed. I looked to my left just as my daughter, who was sitting in the passenger’s seat, did.  I saw two blue lights flying side by side. It looked as if there were two vehicles flying side by side at extremely high speeds, one slightly above the other. As the vehicle approached, and was in front of us, there appeared to be only one, not two. The vehicle flew very low, low enough for us to make out certain details, but not low enough to skim roof tops or anything of that nature.  The only way I can find to describe this vehicle sounds rather silly. It looked like a snowboard. It was rectangular with slightly rounded corners. There was a blue light on each end and the bottom was illuminated white, although no white lights were actually visible. It was bigger than a plane that seats two but smaller than a large passenger jet.  The vehicle itself was platinum colored, very shiny. There were no windows visible. It looked very thin in reference to ""cockpit"" height. I don’t know where someone would have been sitting? Maybe reclined a bit?  My 10 year old daughter was frightened and asked me ""Mommy, what is that?""  I simply responded, ""I have no idea honey,"" as I could think of nothing to relate this vehicle to. It had no wings and made no sound. It flew like nothing I’d seen before. I am not aware of any vehicle that our military possesses that could possibly fly as fast as this was flying.  My daughter and I were evidently not the only people in awe of this sight as there were people driving in the same direction down the same side street that I was, 3 other vehicles, and we all stopped! I never even looked in my rear view mirror. There were people out walking; the weather was beautiful and very warm that evening, as well as watering lawns and they were all stopped and pointing up.  I was approximately 3 blocks from my home, short neighborhood blocks, not city blocks. I looked away for a second when I realized that I was literally stopped in the middle of the street. Every other car was stopped as well, including a black vehicle that was stopped dead center in a crossing of two streets. It was surreal, like something you’d picture in a movie and as I sat there, I kept trying to make sense of what I was seeing.  As soon as I got my bearings, I realized that I had been holding my cell because a few seconds before I saw the lights, I heard it ring the voicemail tone. I hit the speed dial for my husband. I kept saying, “go outside, go outside and look up!” He was totally confused and was asking in which direction? I told him to “look east toward Santa Susana Pass because there is something flying in that direction that is unbelievable!” He wasn’t fast enough; he only saw the two lights far, far in the distance.  My daughter and I had been driving North on the side street and had to make a right turn on our street, going east toward my home. As I reached the intersection of my home street and the street I’d been traveling on, I could still see the vehicle in the distance. Again, it looked as though it were two and not one, with one light slightly above the other, side by side. I looked away to the left before making the right hand turn and when I looked back up, it was gone.  When the vehicle was in front of us you could clearly see that it was traveling end to end, but when it was coming toward us and passing us, it appeared as though it was flying side to side. My daughter still insists that it was two, they came together (she uses her hands to describe this), and when they passed, they split apart. I tend to think that it has something to do with the angle it was flying at that makes it appear as though it was two, an optical illusion I guess.  I had assumed that there would be many reports of this as I was on a tiny side street and there had to be at least 12 probably more like 15 people on that street alone! It was flying the length of the Valley; I can’t imagine how many other people saw it, but it had to be a large number.  It wasn’t 100% dark, it was clear and there was no way you could miss this thing as low as it was flying, unless you happened to be looking down. Unfortunately my older daughter and her friend were out on the drive way of our next door neighbor’s house, drawing on the ground with chalk, and missed the whole thing! My older daughter kept saying “But we didn’t hear anything!”  I don’t know what it was, but it was ridiculously fast, silent and wingless. It flew in a straight line and the lights on the bottom were constant, no blinking etc. It doesn’t appear that anyone reported it, or if they did, I haven’t read anything about it. They probably feel much the same as I do. You don’t want people to think you’re crazy and you don’t want to be audited every year for the rest of your life for asking the government what it was! lol  I’m posting this to try and get a reasonable explanation to help my little one sleep better at night. Like I said, she was frightened, I on the other hand thought it was amazing but was not in fear at all; more in awe.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,34.26942403433477,-118.76270987124464

There were no problems with the nuclear-powered Los Angeles class sub, based in Groton, Conn., and the Navy was investigating the incident, the Naval Submarine Force said in a statement. Units of the USS Enterprise Carrier Strike Group saw a red flare in the area where the sub was operating off the coast of Jacksonville, Fla., Tuesday night, said spokesman Phil McGuinn. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was awakened in the early morning hours and told of the events, said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. ""The secretary of defense was notified at the time when the Navy felt that they had a sub in distress,"" he said. The Navy immediately started searching and also contacted the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office in Norfolk to assist with the efforts. Family members of those on board also were notified. ""Fortunately, the submarine established communications in the early morning hours...and indicated that there were no problems; hence, units were able to stand down from the search and rescue that was already well under way,"" the Navy said in a release. There were about 140 sailors on board, said Lt. Mark Jones, a Navy spokesman in Groton. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

"Bright shiny light-object, changes color and disappears when hit by auto-focus beam from camera...see picture",Winthrop,NY,2007-03-13T22:33:00,sphere,2-3 minutes,"Occurred : 3/13/2007 22:33  (Entered as : 03/13/07 22:33) Reported: 3/14/2007 10:45:25 AM 10:45 Posted: 4/27/2007 Location: Winthrop, NY Shape: Sphere Duration:2-3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55714.html,"Bright shiny light-object, changes color and disappears when hit by auto-focus beam from camera...see picture Bright shining light/object, approximately the size, maybe slightly smaller, of my thumb nail at arms length.  Object/light hovered in one spot for about 2-3 minutes, then disappeared when camera auto-focus beam went off.  This just happened last night.  I was at the computer...my wife was doing the dishes...we both kept hearing an unusually loud, low pitched, rumbling sound, going overhead...We could not tell, from inside if the sounds were jet engines, or the wind.  I had gotten up and looked outside on three earlier occasions to see what it was, or if I could see something flying overhead.  There was, in fact, a constant howling wind all evening.  But, there also was a steady stream of jets, aircraft, or something overhead.  I couldn't see them because of the cloud cover, but I could hear them, that is, apart from the wind.  And, I could hear the Doppler pitch change in the engine sound as they passed by.  Except for the chemtrail planes (I have 100’s of photos) there are no regular flight paths over my place. There also are no major airports nearby.  We have two community airports, Potsdam & Massena, each about 12 miles from my location; one due west, one due north.  Fort Drum is approx 80 miles southwest of my location.  There were no stars or moon visible, there was a low cloud cover, and it was quite windy...I could not tell from inside if the sound I was hearing was the wind or a jet engine...which is why I kept going outside and checking.  Just before I went outside for a fourth time (and this is where it gets a little weird), I said to my wife: ""I keep getting a sensation like I am being watched, or stared at;"" like when someone is standing behind you and is staring at you, and you can almost ""feel"" it.  The thing is, she was off to my left, in my field of vision, doing the dishes; and we live alone?  I went outside and this time there was a single very bright white light, shining like a star over my neighbor's barn, who happens to be a Detective, BCI, with the NYS Troopers, and who was outside with his family observing and commenting in an excited way about the light/object...we live approximately 150 yds apart.  The light wasn't reflecting like the moon...it was shining, sparkling, or emitting light, and so bright, I could only see light, I could not see an object, just a light.  I was looking slightly North of West, up at an angle of approx 35° from the earth...the object was slightly smaller than my thumbnail extended at arms length...there were no other lights in the sky...I live in the country, there are no streets lights or other forms of light pollution.  The object must have been quite low in the sky, because there was a low, visible cloud covering/ceiling last night.  I asked my wife to get my camera, a Canon Power Shot S2-IS (it gets a little weirder here).  As I pulled the camera up to my eye, I was thinking I was going to have trouble finding the object in the viewfinder, shooting in total darkness and all.  I was surprised to see the object, right there in the view finder, no problem at all finding it...I zoomed in some on the object and was I thinking; “I'll take this picture, and then I'll take another with the flash up/on and see if the object responds to it.”  I had the auto-focus on, and when I squeezed the shutter to focus, of course it shot out that green laser beam.  Then, just as, perhaps slightly before, the shutter went off (I have the camera set to make a sound like an old 35mm) and there was a slight delay in the shot because the camera had set the exposure to 1/8 of a second…. just after I zoomed in, and just before the camera locked on and froze the image, I saw in the view-finder the object change from a bright shining white light, to a blue, violet, and green sphere with white light shining through the colors with a blotchy sort look...it kind of looked like a picture of the surface of sun, except this was blue/violet/green...that's when the shutter went off...and that is what the picture shows. I can’t say if the object actually changed in appearance, or if it was the “zooming” that caused me to see it differently throught the viewfinder?  My wife didn’t see what I saw, the change in the objects appearance/color from bright a bright white light, to a blue/violet/green sphere…she had just turned to shut the front door, it was chilly out, and when she turned back, she asked; “where did it go?”  I could not see the object in the viewfinder anymore...it seemed to just disappear….I didn’t even think I got anything on the exposure.  I pulled the camera away from my eye to see if I could re-find the object without the camera.  There was a glowing in the cloud cover where the object had been.  I could hear my neighbor and his family saying to each other; “Did you see that?”…Everyone sounded quite excited, so was my wife and I.  It looked as if the object was now above the clouds and illuminating them from above.  Although, I could not see anything of the object anymore, or make out any shape...just the clouds slightly illuminated from above where the object/light had been.  The illumination was growing fainter quite fast...so, I pulled the camera back up and tried to get a second picture...it doesn't show much...just looks like there’s some slightly illuminated fog.  I haven’t talked to my neighbor yet.  I've known him since he was born, and I don't know if he'll even admit to me, let alone anyone else, that he was outside looking up too?  I can't imagine he's going to go on record, considering his position...he's a detective with the NYS Police, BCI, 25 years.  I hope to see him tonight, or perhaps this weekend, I'll see what happens.  Also, after I took the pictures…I remembered that I hadn’t yet changed my clock on the camera, which is why the time stamp is an hour off from my reported times.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

It was late at night when he was on his balcony (facing south) and off to the west, in the distance, approached what looked like a helicopter with a searchlight.  As it drew closer, he realized this was nothing man-made.  It drifted in a straight line ever so casually over the trees across the parking lot in front of him heading toward Oshawa. It was somewhat larger than a bus.  He described it as triangular with a small white light on each point.  In the middle was a massive white light but with no beam coming off it.

So we really started to watch the sky and about five minutes later a group of seven lights came over head doing the same weaving and flying,   Another ten minutes went by and we saw another group of three that did circles and stopped before taking off again.

In all last night we saw 57 of the smaller lights including a group of twenty or more ( we couldn't count them all because there were so many in that group).

I was on the phone with my friend and decided to go outside for a bit.  I was looking up in to the clear night sky when all of the sudden, my eyes caught unfamiliar movement.  I focused in on the movement.  My eyes revealed to me two triangular shaped crafts.  They were dark in color and had white spots all over the bottom.  I assumed the white spots on the bottom were for lights.  They looked like lights that weren't turned on.  The crafts were flying due North.  They seemed to be at the height of a low-flying plane.  A few odd things I noticed:  -They flew like birds gliding through the sky.  No noise whatsoever. -As the went off in to the horizon, they were flying towards eachother, but didn't seem to be impacting one another. -While they were shaped like triangles, they were not equilateral.  Not only that, but they were not flying aerodynamically.  What would visually appear as the head of the triangle, was NOT the front of the northern moving ships.  It was like they were flying sideways.  This sighting lasted about 15 seconds.  It all happened so quick that I was not able to even think about getting my camera inside.  Way too dark, way to short of a sighting.  However, I am a skeptic at heart.  I have NEVER seen anything like this, and know what I saw was valid.  The mystery to me is: were these man-made craft that are just being kept secret, or are these extraterrestrial craft?

It was intensely bright,like sunlight reflecting off a mirror. Although reflected light tends to spray outwards - this appeared to be a perfect circle or orb approx 3/4 inch in diameter from my position in the driver's seat. I thought it might be the sun reflecting off a plane, but it was too large, much too bright and a little too low to be an aircraft. To my relief, the brightness gave way or folded to a flat and dull grey slender shape. I had thought it was plane after all. I looked away for a 1/2 a second and when I returned to look at the object and it was completely gone from view - vanished. I searched the sky - nothing. In the farthest distance high up in the sky I could see the trails of an airplane and  other commercial aircraft far to my left. It was really weird. I work for an airline and live in in Fairfield County CT where there are always commercial aircraft in route. I searched UFO related sites to see if anyone else saw it because there were so many cars on the highway. It freaked me out butI'm still holding out for a logical explaination.

It was on a late night drive home from a job our band had played in Vermont during the summer of 1985, and as we were driving on dark road just back into NY, we both caught a glimpse of the stars beginning to disappear in the totally clear sky. We pulled to an overlook parking lot and got out of our truck and watched it. There were no lights, no sounds other then crickets chirping, as we watched, the stars disappeared slowly behind a solid black shadow. We estimated that the object had to be at least 300 ft from the front to the back edge and around 400 feet from side to side. It moved slowly and in a straight line and took around 5 minutes to go from horizon to horizon. We were in a valley at the time, so the mountains were fairly close, and the horizons were only a few miles apart. We are positive it was not a cloud as the sky was perfectly clear. Since there was no sound it could not have been a blimp or other man made flying object. We stood there for around 20 minutes to see if it came back or anything else would happen, but it remained quiet and uneventful. We also checked all the local new media sources for the next few days but no one else reported seeing anything that night.

This night I noticed a very bright streetlight in the distance. I thought to my self that the light was going to burn out in moment because it was too bright. But instead it started to rise straight up in the air. At a distance of several hundred feet in the air, the oval object turned from bright white to bluish / green color and then despaired in front of my eyes. Just before it despaired I noticed some detailed lines around the object.  Feeling that I saw something exstordinary, I went home and called Kenny Airport and asked them if they had anything unusual on the radar screens. They told me that they could not give that information out. So I told them I wanted to report a UFO.  They did give me a phone number in Washington, DC to call. The next day I called that number and a Commando answered the phone and told me there usually is no activity in the North East reported, and that most of the activity is in the South West. He made me feel like no one really cares, and my report will not make a difference. He took my number and told me he would check in to it. Well the Commando did call me back and told me that there where no reports made.  Years later, finding out about peoples abductions, I came to mind that the object that I witnessed the night was extremely low to the roof tops, which could of meant that I witnessed an abduction.

I am a 38 year old female.  When I was 16-17 years old I saw something unlike anything I have ever seen. It was very late at night and my parents where sleeping. I was in the living room watching television.  I decided to look out the window at the stars. The view from our window was unblocked and the sky was full of stars that night. I had only been looking for a few seconds when I suddenly saw what I believe was a UFO.  Three lights in a triangular pattern appeared in the sky. At the top of the triangle shape was a red light. At the bottom in each corner was a white/yellowish color light. The two lights in the bottom corner left there position at a rapid rate of speed. The light in the left corner moved to the left and the right light moved to the right in the same formation at the same time. Both lights went out away from the red light. The two lights suddenly returned to their exact positions as before and the whole thing disappeared as if someone just turned it off.  All I saw was lights in the form of a triangle. If it was a ship of some kind it had no other lights on it except the three that I described. I have never seen anything like this before or after that night. Considering my age reporting what I saw at the time was of no importance to me. Now that I am older I feel it is important that someone knows of what I saw. If it was a UFO or not maybe the information I have to offer could be of some kind of help or assistance to our world or country.  I reported my sighting as one or possibly  three sightings because the two lights separated from there position as if they where separate from it but had a connection to the red light at the top somehow. From what I saw I believe it to be one main ship with others that detach . Thank you for time reading this and I hope I wrote it where you can understand what I saw. I’m more then glad to offer more detail if needed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD)),2008-02-14T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

It was likened to what one would feel if they rubbed an inflated balloon and ran it just above the hairs of his arm. I saw for about two minutes a large dark purple to black Triangular shaped craft. It was not an exact triangle because the “bottom” side the triangle was just a little longer than its two other sides.  From what I could compare with objects it was near I would guess that two sides were about 75’ feet and one side was about 100’.  It was about 50’ above the ground and about several hundred feet away from me at a “11:30” position if I were standing in the middle of a clock.  It was traveling no more than 10 mph along a path that was heading about 19 to 20 degrees angle.  It made absolutely no sound.  It did not have any windows or ports. It had no markings. It had no fins. It look just like a smooth very dark purple to black triangle. I could see the bottom of the craft but only from an angle as if one is standing at a short distance off the side looking up. About 2 minutes later, (counting time when I first saw the object it accelerated vertically as almost instantly in a 180 degree line straight up and disappeared into the blue sky. About 2 minutes later I did hear the sound of jet craft and about 2 to three minutes later 3 military jets were in my plain sight but at an altitude higher than the craft I previously seen. (400’ higher maybe?.) These jets did appear to have Air Force Insignia on their tail fins but I am not sure because they were just going too fast for me to be positive about this.  I did call an Air Force base in MO.  (I don’t remember which one but I think it was Whiteman? Not sure about the spelling.) I did remember getting frustrated because no person seemed to know where exactly I should make my report to or who to talk to and no one said they had information about whether or not Air Force Jets were flying in southern Iowa at that time. So I just gave up and forgot about trying to pursue the matter.) The 3 jets did fly in the exact area the craft went vertical into the air but they kept traveling in this direction until I could no longer see them.

The UFO continued on a straight and level path, and although my air speed was 110 m.p,h. the UFOs speed was such that there was no way I could catch up to it. If I had to approximate it's speed, I would guess at 400-600 m.p.h. The saucer never deviated from it's straight course.  As for the size of the UFO, I can't really say, since there was nothing that I could compare it to. But if I had to guess, I would say about 30 to 50 feet in diameter. It happened so quickly, but I did get a very good look at it. There were no windows or any markings on the UFO saucer. The colour was a dull silver, almost a grey colour.  I usually carry a camera in the side carrying pouch by the pilot's door. But this time, the camera was in a sports bag behind the rear passenger seat. There was no way of getting access to the camera. If I had a passenger with me that could have handed me the camera, I would have been able to get a very good picture with my 35mm camera! Now when I go flying, I always make sure that I have at least two cameras with me at all times. This was a once in a life time experience.  It is now 20 years since I had my UFO encounter. To this day, I have had no other experiences with UFO sightings from the ground or in the air.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

Because the family was from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada, we were staying in Tampa Bay Florida for half the duration of our trip (2 weeks)to Florida.  The other week was to be spent at bush gardens at a different hotel.  The hotel we were staying at was called the The Sonyesta.  On or around the night of 19 Dec 1987 we decided to visit a restaurant called King Henry's Feast in Miami.  We left the hotel in Tampa at around 16:00 on the 19th and drove to Miami.  The King Henry's Feast was a Medieval style dinner and show and the whole affair lasted many hours so by the time we left Miami to go back to our hotel in Tampa bay it was quite late, around 0:00. At around 1:00 am we were on a deserted stretch of highway near - as far as I can remember- swampy country with scattered palm trees.  Because it was somewhat dark I can only remember seeing flat ground with telltale plantlife that indicated swamp such as sparsh high grass, rushes and bumpy, in some places, reflective ground indicating stagnant water in addition to the dark outlines of palm trees.  I remember that the moon was full when we left Miami but at 1:00 on the highway it became foggy. My memory becomes hazy at this point, but I recall other cars stopped by the road and people looking at something in the sky.  I recall the other passengers in the car gasp and say ""oh look!"".  I recall seeing three other people besides the passengers in our car.  The other peoples cars seemed to have headlights on. The passengers of our car consisted of 4 people.  Firstly myself age 7.  I was at that age an avid camper with my parents and that is how I knew what swamp looked like.  I am now 28 and a Captain in the PPCLI, a Canadian Infantry unit and I have seen action in Afghanistan.  My father is a doctor who practiced at the St James Clinic and Misecordia hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada.  My Mother was or was studying at the time, to take her bar exam.  She has been called to the bar in Winnipeg and British Columbia Canada.  She no longer practices law but is a stay at home Mom for my younger siblings who were not yet born at the time.  The final passenger was my Dad's mother and my grandma who is now deceased but at the time worked at a clothing store for senior citizens in Winnipeg. My Father and Mother were in the front 2 seats of the car and my Grandmother and me in the back.  As we approached what I remember to be one or two cars pulled over at the side of the road with people beside them I perceived 6 light blue glowing lights rotating in the sky.  Each was the size of a quarter in my memory, but only because they were some distance away.  I seem to recall we got out of the car at this point to look at the lights but I have another memory of staying in the car the whole time.  The lights did nothing but rotate, in my memory at an angle and down towards our car.  The whole scene-like a picture- was us, bottom right ground, road bottom middle, other people and cars bottom left.  Mid right was shadow of palm trees, mid center was fog but flat bumpy ground, mid right was fog, top right fog, top center fog with some traces of moonlight seeping through and top right were the six blue lights rotating at an angle facing us. I do not recall how long we lingered watching the lights but at some point during this time I recall glancing out of curiosity at the other people near our car and to our left to see if they were as amazed as us.  I recall a man with shaved head and glasses in a white shirt looking calmly back at me with an amused expression.  I have conlicting memories of this man; one memory that he was in another car and I saw him through a window and another memory that he was outside the cars to my left at about 9 feet away. At this point I draw a blank and do not recall if the lights disappeared or we just got bored and decided to leave.  We got back to Tampa Bay and had no other encounters since.  After returning to Canada at the end of the vacation we did not discuss at all afterwards memories of the vacation.  Anytime I brought up the issue of the lights my mother scolded me, dismissed the event or made fun of me so I soon let the matter drop. Upon remembering this event last year in September 2007, I questioned my father and mother at a restaurant and it took them by surprise.  I said simpley ""do you remember the 6 blue rotating lights in Florida?""  My father remarked off hand (and without any prompting from me) that there were lots of people watchig the event.  My mother then remarked that she had no memory of other people there.  We were all 3 of us discussing the event further in the car and my mother became very agitated and angry while my father seemed very curious and trying to remember more, or so it seemed to me.  My Mother did give me a detail I had not remembered-my Grandmother had decided to purchase communion which was a book about alien abduction.  My Mother told me all this nonsense about UFOs was due to my Grandmother scaring me.  I do not recall ever discussing the event with my Grandmother at all. Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The sky was clear and I had enjoyed beautiful meteor showers all evening while listening to a Utah-Hawaii football game earlier. I was pulling a slight grade and moving rather slow.  Suddenly, what appeared as a meteor appeared straight in front of me but this one was coming straight at me instead of moving across the sky!  The object was moving at a high rate of speed, leaving a bright green trail in the sky behind it.  My first thought came out loud, very loud “Holy s**t this thing is gonna hit me!!”  My first instinct was to get into the breakdown lane and stop.  The object however, stopped directly in front of me.  I would guess the distance at approximately 1 mile, more on this later.  Being night, it was very hard to “guess” the distance, but the object was quite large and shaped exactly like tops that I had as a kid, the kind you wrapped string around and tossed out to spin.  I immediately looked at my watch and clock, set at PST and checked where the moon was – behind me.  I turned my headlights off and sat and watched the object through my windshield for a full 11 minutes.  It did not wobble or move about but sat stock still and emit an orange colored light similar to some street lights you see.  There was no definite outline, just a top shaped dark color inside the light.  At the widest part, just below the tapered top was a darker line. Windows perhaps?  After watching the object for a few minutes, I flashed my marker lights a few times.  After another couple of minutes I flashed my headlights three times.  Not getting any response I just sat and stared, I know any one there should have seen my lights, as I was the only vehicle on the road.  I remember getting the impression that the object seemed to glower, maybe from a slight pulsation of the light.  My windows were down, and I shut my motor off.  There was just dead silence, not even night sounds of animals or anything else – very eerie.  Suddenly a very bright white light shot out of the bottom tip of “top” and shone straight down steadily and the object just slowly sank out of sight.  I was alone again.  After sitting for a few more minutes trying to digest what I had just seen, I fired my rig back up, turned my lights on.  Right in front of me was a view area sign.  I pulled up to the view area and went in, turned my rig around so I could see where the object had been.  I shut ‘er down again and took a look around.  There were a couple of other rigs and a few motor homes there but everyone was asleep.  I sat and had a pipe and a cup of coffee, waiting to see if it would come back up.  After an hour of walking around and stretching, I decided to go to bed.  Next morning I took a walk around the area.  There were deep, ragged canyons all over the place.  I took off for Green River again.  Approximately 1 mile up the road was a bridge over a very, very deep canyon/river.  This canyon ran directly toward the area where I saw the object sink down, so I am assuming this is where my “top” went down.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,38.9851,-110.659

It was a light green color. It seems like I can remember this experience like it was yesterday, although it occurred decades ago.  I vividly remember the feeling it gave me when I saw it, yet somehow I can never really explain it. I still remember weeks later when Independence Day came around I saw all the fireworks and used that as a way in my mind to rationalize away what I saw, though, I always knew that it was nothing like a firework.  I never did tell anyone, not one of my seven siblings, parents, or friends.  I knew I would be made fun of, I was smarter than that.  It wasn’t long ago that I told my wife about it, she is very supportive and takes things at face value with me.  In spite not speaking a word of this to anyone else in the 19 or so years since the occurrence, it seems reasonable to report the incident in case it has some value to someone out there studying the subject. 	I was fairly young, 11 years old to be exact.  We lived in a comfortably large home in the spread out private community of Martin Downs.  We had 3 or 4 acres on nice little lake in the back yard.  All the homes were spread out, our area of the neighborhood was fairly open, and we had a great view of all the homes on the lake.  Most of the homes on the other side of the lake were nestled in trees, very private.  Mostly long needle pines with Palm trees speckled in with Palmetto underbrush, standard Florida Foliage.  I remember it being a late summer evening, it was a Friday night and all my older siblings were at a church dance down in Palm Beach. My younger siblings were in their rooms, I remember turning the corner from the long hallway that lead from our rooms to the living room and shockingly seeing this very bright light hovering just above the treetops on the other side of the lake.  Under normal conditions the view from our living room is breathtaking at night; the wall toward the outside is mostly glass going into our ‘Florida room’ which outside wall was entirely glass sliding doors down the breath of it.  The house is built up a little bit so you have a great view when normally things are very flat in the area.  So looking through the two rooms you can see the light from the houses on the other side.  It must be between 200 and 300 yards to the other side of the lake, and this light was bright, frighteningly so.  It was a light green color; I really couldn’t tell what shape it must have been so I would guess an orb would be a great description from what I could discern.  It frightened me to the bone, but at the same time it was so mesmerizing, I could not take my eyes off it.  So I stood there, half hiding behind the corner of the wall, as it hovered, moving ever so slightly to the west for about 5 min.  The westward movement was so slight, during that time it probably only traveled about 40 yards or so.  Then, as I watched it, it just disappeared.  As I thought about what I saw I was astounded! , shocke d, my world of what I knew had changed.  That image still sits in my mind today, hovering just over the treetops, as I go back and look at pictures of my back yard, I can see that it moved directly over a house.  I wonder if anyone else saw it, I really do wonder.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,27.1188,-80.3666

The disk was filled with clear vertical rainbow stripes like a prism. It was dazzling in the intensity. The rainbow rays extended outward from the shape but they were softer, hazier... Then ""bam!"" it was gone. It's hard to say how close it was. The ""humming"" sounded fairly close, but the flash of colors seemed much higher. The oval shape could have been covered up with quarter, and the total flash with a tennis ball(to give you an idea of perspective.)

The weather was beautiful all week and we were aware that there was a good chance to see meteor showers.  As we chatted, we were gazing at the stars much of the time looking skyward over the ocean. One evening mid-week, we saw a rectangular shape of three vertical rows with 3 or 4 lights in each row of bright red (slightly orange) lights.  The lights were huge and looked like they were located just under and slightly to the left of Mars in the sky.  They appeared out of nowhere, were stationary and blinked out after about 3 to 4 seconds. About an hour later, lower in the sky in the same direction were more red lights (3 or 4 lights more or less in a horizontal zig zag row) they also appeared and disappeared  within a few seconds.  These second set of lights reminded me of flares, but they did not move or stay lit like a flare would have.  I know Camp LeJeune is close by, but I do not know what those lights were.

The night was partly cloudy and low clouds were moving northward with patches of open sky and stars visible at times between the clouds.  The wind was blowing from the south at approximately 5-10 mph.  Temperature was approximately 78°F.  Visibility as reported by the Weather Channel was approximately 10 miles.  At approximately 11:38pm CST, as were walking on the northernmost point of the track, my friend was startled and pointed to an object observable above the northern tree line moving East to West at a high rate of speed.  My first thought was that it was a falling star due to it's silent flight.  Then, as I noticed NO downward movement of the object and what appeared to be either 1) multiple lights OR 2) several different objects flying in formation, I quickly realized that the object was moving in a trajectory PERPENDICULAR to the horizon and not FALLING as I had first assumed.  The object continued it's high-speed horizontal movement and as it was going to pass behind the town water tower, I ran to the next visible observation point to get a better view.  I was able to observe the object continue it's East to West path and when it once again was going to disappear behind the treeline, I ran to another spot where I could possibly see it again.  When I got to where I could see the area where the object was headed, it was gone.  I can't say for certain what direction it went in after I saw it the second time but it was definitely gone by the third time I was able to see it's path.  It was traveling completely silent, with no engine noises whatsoever.  It was not a helicopter (too fast and too silent), it was not a propeller-driven plane (too fast and too silent), and it was not a jet because their was no sound whatsoever even after it passed.  Its appearance was blocked a bit by the low clouds but the lights showing from behind the clouds.  It was either one LARGE silently moving obje! ct OR se veral objects flying in a VERY TIGHT arc formation for a considerable distance with no real deviation from a perfect arc.  The object traveled at an elevation that was in a straight line with the local water tower and approximately at a 25° angle from where I was standing.  The object's distance from me was unknown.  I have had experience with the observation of flying objects in the past.  I know what a jet, plane, helicopter, and falling star appear like in the Texas sky.  This object had NO visible running lights.  The only lights visible were the bright white series of lights that made up the arc that made up the object or objects.  The object appeared to be moving faster than any jet or aircraft that I have observed in the sky in the past and with NO sound whatsoever.  My friend is a Certified Nurses Assistant.

They moved overhead without any sound, heading toward the west and then arching to the south-west/south, like they were heading toward White Sands.  The formation did *not* block out any of the stars as it moved, and at the apex of the semi-circular 'turn', the objects seemed to 'twist' in on themselves, before regaining the formation.  They moved quickly and fluidly through the sky, it took less than ten seconds for them to disappear over the horizon to the south.  There was still no sound, even after it was gone, and I could hear one car go by on the street we live on.  There was nothing 'chasing' the object, either.

These were perhaps at 2000 feet and moving very slowly.  I turned onto 14 heading north and again observed the cluster of strobing red lights, and as I did so I saw a smaller, bright white light separate from the group of red lights and travel at high speed in the opposite direction of it’s course, back toward Ann Arbor. It was quickly lost to my sight, so I looked back at the cluster of red lights while trying to stay on the road.  I should have just pulled over and got out to watch, but this was an unusual thing to see, and I was so absorbed in it that I didn’t think of that at the time. As I watched the group of red strobing lights moved slowly in seeming increments along I-94 in a westerly direction and about a mile north of the freeway.  As I continued on 14 I lost sight of it. I considered the smaller bright white light that had come out of it and the speed at which it had left, it’s lack of any navigation lights, and thought that perhaps the two observed objects were not ours.  Of the cluster of rapidly strobing red lights I observed that it in no way complied with our standard aircraft lighting conventions, there were only red lights, and the rapid strobing also is not something one of ours would do, and the acceleration of the small bright white lighted object was quite beyond anything we can do with a manned aircraft, so all of this was pretty non-conventional.

All a saw was the bottom side of the disk which appeared to have small blue lights flashing randomly. I am not sure if they were lights or just reflections. I watched this for about 40 seconds and then it just vanished in thin air, there were hardly any clouds at all. Almost as soon as I had stepped inside, I saw the disk again through the window. This time it was much lower down, probably only 500ft above the roofs of the houses, but a lot further away from me than before. It was also traveling much slower than before, probably only jogging pace. It seemed to maintain altitude and I was able to estimate the size of the disk. I would say it was about 80ft in circumference and around 15ft from the bottom to the top. This time I was partly able to see the top of the disk, and it looked exactly the same as the bottom. The gray haze was still around the disk, but I could not see any of th e blue flashes I had seen before. This time, I was able to see the object for just over a minute.

Having some experience with a few sightings before (because my eyes never leave the sky) I ran out and immediately began to compare its movement with a nearby by airliner, houses and trees.  According to my co-worker, the object/light started out as being as large as his fingernail.  It moved slowly upward, silently.   By the time he arrived at work and I had gotten outside to see it and it was half the luminosity of Venus which was shining in the predawn light also in the southern sky.  The light from the object began to pulsate and the object began to move in a tight circular pattern.   A commercial airliner began to approach the area from a westerly direction at what I can assume to be a 30,000 foot ceiling.  As the airliner came closer, the object moved sporadically in a straight line heading south, quickly the light flickered and dissipated and finally shot away.  30 minutes later while we were talking about it in the office, a third witness told us that she saw the same object from a different angle. She said that she saw two smaller objects ""eject"" or ""shoot"" out from the bottom of the main craft.  She pulled her daughter outside to watch. 20 minutes after the craft shot away, the sky was a full military aircraft scrambled in multiple directions and all in the basic area where the object was hovering.  A person in our group familiar with Air Force maneuvers mentioned that those aircraft were moving in a scout formation.   We are all familiar with the regular air traffic patterns from L.A., Vegas and Phoenix. None of these six or so aircraft followed those usual patterns.

First I thought it was the back of a low jet fighter plane back burner, but the size and color of the reddish hue was more similar to a flare than a plane especially the bright pink/reddish color, it had a bright center like a star but pink in color and a reddish exterior with no smoke, sound or the normal burning flicker of a flare, it also kept motionless in the well lit sky (it was around 18:03), floating at the same vertical height for around 1 minute after spotting it. As I was driving at around 60 miles per hour it was impossible to tell the exact distance between me and the light and wither it was completely motionless, but I would estimate it was standing there at a distance of around half to one mile from where I was. After around one minute of watching it, I tried to stop the car to have a better look, as I also had a good camera on my phone, but there were no place to stop.   I decided to do a U turn to watch the light from the closer other side of the road, and when I realized it had already disappeared with no trace.  It is impossible to tell if it diminished or flew away as there were trees in between when I realized it completely disappeared.

The light broke into several red orange orbs that then formed a pyramid shape in the sky. They stayed in that formation about 15 seconds and then went straight up and vanished. It was about a month before this I saw a long black craft in the south sky in the same area as I came upon it the craft moved and then just vanished it did not just take off it just vanished! In the year of 1975-76 a large orb was sighted in a small town in South Dakota The Chief of police called the air force and just as you heard the jets arrive the object vanished also. I can not explain why but I also know of several other people that have seen the same things in the skies of south central South Dakota and many will never admit to it because of the fear that people will say they are crazy.

My coworker, who has since quit, will not contribute to this report so I will not use his experiences although I would prefer as they are more ""colorful"" than my own.  A little background here; I am (or at least was) happily married and prefer to stay that way, and my wife will not listen to me and DOES NOT support my reporting this but after researching online I feel I must do this.  I am a 28 year old who graduated from a very small town in Nebraska, so I do not expect anyone to take me serious that this took place. People who have an education or money would be, but I am just a regular guy I guess, but here it goes anyway.  I have had a bit of a personality crisis (as well as a whiskey crisis) for the last few days and I’m just trying to get by.  Frankly, I am annoyed that this happened, and 4 nights later I am still annoyed and not enjoying my  life if you don’t mind me speaking my mind. I was driving a commercial truck used to move frozen food that is sold retail, and there were two of us, one in each truck returning to our “office”. I was ahead of my coworker, when we turned a bend in the highway, ahead there was a black square in the sky. I don’t know how else to describe it, there were no lights or sounds, just a square floating.  I nearly had a heart attack when I saw it, keep in mind-and this important-that it wasn’t there when I came around the bend, it just appeared.  It was low and almost on the road and I locked up my brakes.  My truck is heavy and admittedly we speed, so I was all over the road. I came to a stop and got out.  All I saw was this black square. I am not trying to sound dramatic.  But it was simply a black square, moving very slowly-hardly moving-to the south.  This is when thing get weird, cause my coworker gets out of his truck and his face is white as a sheet, and he says ((deleted))all this for selling ice cream door-to-door.""   I am staring at this black floaty thing, and then suddenly my coworker is gone. I mean thin air gone.  Suddenly from the cornfield about 50 yards ahead from the south comes my buddy screaming bloody hell.  His eyes are so big it’s like all I can see are his eyes to this minute, and all I can see to his right is this dark square, and as he is running to me, his arms out wide as if to hug me, and there comes this horn, ya know like compressed air you have on your boat, and I duck.  My coworker jumps into my truck and shuts and locks the doors, and here I am prying on the door handle screaming like a school girl and I look behind me and see a guy, like a little skinny guy  along the ditch, and this is where I become a drinker, cause the guy is looking at me all menacing like he is coming to kill me and he is skin and bones with a big ass head.  Jim lets me in and I put in drive and push this International to 120.  My wife is mad, don’t make trouble for me please, but you all don’t know (or belief) but I do.

I was driving home after driving over to the north side of town to pick something up.  I was less than half a mile from my house, coming up towards my turn off when I saw something in the sky that looked like a low airplane coming in on final approach at an airport, that's how low it was. It had to be no more than a few hundred feet in the air.  I turned off at my usual turn, and I could see this thing was low so I pulled over at a clearing where there weren't any trees around, parked, and got out. This thing, from what I could tell from the lights, was shaped like a triangle. There were two lights on the bottom of it at the front, one at the back at the point of the triangle, and then a blinking red light about 3/4 of the way back on it.  I was looking up thinking it was an airplane or a helicopter (when I was pulling over and getting out), but there was something wrong. This thing slowly passed literally right over me, but there was not a single sound coming from it. It was almost like it was just slowly seamlessly gliding through the air. From as low as this thing was, there should have been the sounds of an engine or something if it was a helicopter or a plane. And it sure wasn't coming in for a landing because the nearest airport was about 5 miles SW of where I was and this thing was traveling N-NE.  I watched it until I had just gotten past me and then I jumped back into my car and turned around because I wanted another look at this thing. I got back onto the road I had just turned off of, but this thing was nowhere to be found. I looked all over in the sky in the direction it was going in as well as all around in every direction and there was nothing. No white lights, no red blinking light, nothing. Just the moon and stars.  I drove for a little bit longer trying to find it again but couldn't find a single sign of it.

Then I looked and saw Jupiter was still over where it was supposed to be,  looked back at the object.  It was bright white,  and it started to move slowly,  picked up speed.  It moved across the horizon from south to northwest. Went and got my binoculars.  Typically we get a lot of air traffic being near the Riverside Descent Area to Detroit Metro Airport.  But I was able to see other planes at extremely high altitudes.  Planes typically have flashing lights, and red/green lights on the wingtips.  I looked at the object with my binoculars.  No flashing lights at all.  Just a bright pure white light.   My wife saw another object moving in the opposite direction and had been looking at that.  Then after the 2nd object had moved across the sky in the exact same trafjectory but opposite direction, we picked up another 3rd object moving the exact same direction as the first.  The object was not a plane with its landing lights (another typical phenomenon I've seen in this area for 30 years) because it was almost at the zenith and it was moving.  It was not a satellite, as it was moving much too slow.  Plus it had started off stationary, like just a star in the sky,  then it started to move off.  Eventually the object did lose its brightness and fade away.  I have seen satellites get bright and then fade away but the speed never changed.  this was stationary for a bit before it moved off.

Observing the night sky around 9 PM, notice a solid white light traveling across the sky from southeast (Hinton, WV) to northwest (Beckley, WV) direction.  Similar to airplane movement but no blinking lights, just one solid emission.  Object slows and eventually fades out.  Keep looking for a few more minutes, nothing happens.  Then, what we think is a regular star suddenly emits three incredible pulses (flashes) of light and disappears.  Keep watching sky, not noticing anything for about 5-10 minutes.  Suddenly notice a bright twinkling light further on over the tree line in the distance (toward Beckley).  At first looks like a bright planet but notice slight movement.  Staying mostly still, it hovers a great number of feet in perfectly vertical direction up and down or shoots with incredible speed from side to side.  Obviously not man-made aircraft, at least one the public does not know about.  Observing object through binoculars, notice there seems to be no definite shape and a multitude of colorful lights is constantly revolving or moving around the object.  After another 10 minutes or so, notice a group of smaller  lighted objects moving below the main object just above the tree line, hovering above, in and through the tree tops.  At all times there are at least 3 to 4 airplanes in the sky.  As soon as one passes over the tree line another appears, obviously coming from the nearby airport (Raleigh County Airport).  After a while notice second object to the East with similar colorful emissions after a few minutes also emitting smaller lighted objects in the tree tops.  By this time the airplanes begin flying under and around unknown aircraft repeatedly, passing very close.  It is odd to see so many airplanes in the night sky over West Virginia.  Usually you may see one or two, I counted anywhere from 10-20 or airlpanes over the course of just an hour.  After 45 minutes to an hour, notice yet another object to the southeast (toward Hinton) same appearance and mannerisms as first two objects.  Take girlfriend home and leave for Parkersburg, she calls about 20 minutes later to tell me the latter object is hovering over the graveyard beside her house.  All observers are normal hard-working people.  We are all pretty open-minded.  Two are married with a child and second on the way.  I'm 25 years old and nothing like this has ever happened to me.

I recently watched a Larry King Live episode on UFOs and decided to write here. I never realized that something like this site existed, and had forgotten about the incident up until now.  	I was outside sitting on our swing out in my backyard with my friend from school when we saw a huge triangular shape approaching very low. I don't remember exactly when we noticed it, but it was very large and very low. It was about the size of 2 or 3 large houses put together and probably about 5 or 6 stories above the ground. It made little or no noise, and was moving very slowly. It had a triangular pattern of small white lights spaced fairly far apart. Each light was about the size of a regular bulb from that distance away. There were about three on each side. In between the lights it was blacked out so I think it was only one entity.  	I remember my friend staying outside while I ran inside to get my dad. When we came back out it was passing over our house. It was probably moving about 10-15 mph depending on how low it was, but it was moving very slowly. It reminded me of the shape of a Stealth Bomber, but it made no noise at all. We also do not have any nearby military airport bases near our house.  	I went back inside to get the video camera and when I came back outside it was almost gone. If I did get it on tape, we either didn't see anything afterwards and threw it away, or I simply didn't tape it at all. As I said, it was a while ago so I don't remember too much. I still don't know if anyone else saw it that night besides myself, my friend, and my dad.  	It did not leave a trail. There were no other aircraft following it. It was moving almost directly east to west and very slightly north to south. I hope this report helps, even though I couldn't give much exact detail.

When I turned my leg around to see what it was I had a perfect 2"" X 2"" square of hair missing on my leg and it was a little red???

My wife is the only other person I have told about this, because I figured people would think I'm crazy.  About a year later I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.

About 30 seconds later it took off again so fast I almost lost track of it.  I got my wife up and showed it to her.

These lights reminded me exactly of the Phoenix lights, and that is when I started to get creeped out a little bit. I was talking to my friend who was with me about the Phoenix lights and he started to get creeped out. I have lived next to that airport for 19years and not once have I seen these lights in the sky. I also know the difference between a star, satellite and an airplane. These lights were very large and very bright. They were glowing an amber/green color. We drove to my friends house who lives right next to the airport, we could see the lights from his back deck. He said he saw them appear in the same place the night before. They turned on one by one he said and stayed in the sky for 2 hours or so. As he was telling us the story the lights began to turn off. They just disappeared one by one in order. It was the most amazing site I have ever seen. Just like that they were gone.

This was the first of many events like this in this town.  I have known many people who have seen UFOs around this area.  Even a famous world-renowned photo was taken of a UFO in McMinnville-   First, I just put out my cigarette...and then I noticed a star in the middle of the sky.  Clouds were hanging around but there were clear patches where I could see stars.  But this one looked really cigar shaped.  I watched it twinkle and throb for a minute...when suddenly it just took off across the sky...but it did some very theatrical moves!   I was shocked.  A pretty star turned into a light show.  For about 25-30 seconds this thing hung in the shy...But when it finally left....its movements were so intense!  It was a very light blue in color with a very noticable glow.  And was long and cigar shaped.  I could see it plain as anything.  It was so noticable.  I have wondered if anyone else saw it that night as well- It was the only thing I have ever seen move that fast!   It did a zig-zag through the sky and left.  That was it- But it was unbelievable-  And I never thought I could get to see something like this again..but I have...and I will post more of those reports.

That said, this event varies quite a bit from the former.  (2) I'm a comprehensive mental health case manager for Volunteers of America, and am currently pursuing a masters in counseling psychology.  Anything that sounds like a definitive conclusion that I may mention I stress is purely speculative on my part.  I'd like to think my background is fairly based in scientific observation.  This occurred at 6:25 pm on Friday, January 11, 2008.  I was in my car in Lake Charles, LA.  I had turned off 5th Avenue onto Prien Lake rd., headed east-bound towards the onramp onto interstate 2-10 west (where I was going to merge).  There is a fairly short distance between that corner and the onramp, perhaps a half mile.  I noticed up to my left something that I hadn't seen before.  I assumed it was a tower; Lake Charles is a fairly large town so it didn't surprise me that I had missed seeing it before.  The reason I thought it was a tower was because it appeared almost stationary, and was about the height of a tower top.  There was three white lights in a triangular formation, and along the back base was a blinking red light.  I thought for sure it was a tower top, yet when I kept trying to locate the actual tower itself, I couldn't see it.  It was dark, so I assumed that it was just obscured.  Then I realized it was moving.  At that point my onramp was coming up, so instead of pulling over and risk not being able to get a good shot of this thing, I merged onto 2-10 west-bound and grabbed my 5 megapixel digital camera out of my tech bag (I keep my PSP, DS, and cam in there when I spend a couple days away from my apartment).  The thing was moving slow still, from north to southwest.  I took an initial picture with the flash on, which looked like crap because of the glare of my dirty windshield.  I turned the flash off and took several more photos.  The thing disappeared over the southwest horizon just before I hit the 2-10 bridge of the Calcasieu ship channel.  I wouldn't have given this a second thought if the thing hadn't just *sat* in place while I passed it, and like I said, it seemed somewhat low over the Oak Park area of Lake Charles.  My camera picked up little more than taillights and darkness, except for one picture.  I had to adjust the brightness on it to see anything, but I believe I may have gotten it on the right side of the frame.  I've been monitoring local media to see if anyone else saw it, but I've heard nothing yet.  Traffic was fairly busy, too, at that time.  I will say this, too:  I've been to Long Island, NY, so I know what real air traffic looks like.  We don't get that here, but as soon as this thing was out of sight, lots of planes with blinkblink-pause, blinkblink-pause white running lights started popping up all over.  I'm not saying they were chasing anything, just that they were there in stronger numbers than I remember seeing before.

I have found only (1) thing that is evidence that the ufo was there. Over time what I found was that one ufo was only one of a number of them. because the metal is detect in complete shape I have to say that the metal was a alloy that was like ours  becouse any other metal would be found in pieces not complete like what was found.  I do not know why I found it but I did. becouse it is complete it is like a blueprint and you can tell how it would work . It being the large one is so large you would think that it would hold a lot of there poeple, but when you look at the print , you see that only the core of it would hold life. the outer part it like ballast tank, this allows it to go to the bottom of water. It has in the core (7) riser that lets it rise without vacum damage it. This design shows that they use all of nature to do things. What I see of there design, If they have it they use it. In march 0f 06 I saw one that was flying . It was only a cicle of light very bright< but looking at it this llght must be very cold to be this bright. becuase they donot have anything that donot use , why have the light. We donot think that they need light to see so WHY HAVE IT.

Unlike all the other nights I sit at this place at my computer, I had a strange feeling something wasn't right. I had to keep glancing over my shoulder checking the large window behind me. Between the window and the computer is about an eight foot distance to where I observed a UFO, whilst I sat in the chair. Each time I looked all I saw outside my window was the trees blowing in the wind and the other usual things.  Until I had the most overwhelming feeling something was watching me. I ignored it for a few seconds, but the longer I did the more nervous I got. I turned around fully and looked through the window, whilst sitting in the chair. I saw a circular object in the corner of where my backyard is outside. I watched it, realizing it was moving. I observed the difference between this strange light and the light of another residence through my backyard (I live in a suburban area). There was a definite difference and it was unlike anything I ever even heard of, as it was not a typical UFO, which is large.  The light came closer, until it seemed to be only 15 or twenty feet away from the window outside. For the first few seconds, it looked had white light emanating from it, with a red light on top. The lights were flashing within the object. Then the red lights on the UFO seemed to be moving from the top of the UFO to the bottom. And as it continued to move closer to the window, I ran away from the room as I felt the object was watching me and could see me in my house. I believe my feelings are right, and not silly. Again, the object appeared to be about five to seven feet long, and about the same amount wide, yet it might have been saucer shaped. The shape was difficult to discern, yet it seemed closest to a circle.  This light from the UFO had a shape though and was extremely clear to my eyes and I am sure I can't explain it as a normal occurence. I was 20 years old the night I saw it. I did not really believe it was a UFO until I heard in a documentary about ""alien probes"" appearing over suburban areas. The conditions from the room I was observing in, included a lamp light, which was on and a few feet away from the window next to it. Yet, this light did nothing to distort the image. The light of this thing appeared to my eyes to be moving in the middle of my backyard probably 15 feet off the ground. Another detail is that this object was one hundred percent light, but had a definite form, as the red light shifted from top to bottom. At least it appeared to be all light from my vantage point.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,40.9317,-73.1142

I asked my wife if she could see what I was seeing and she confirmed and added that it apeared to have a vague, almost translucent disc shape around the craft itself.

It blocked out the stars as it passed overhead and there were no clouds to be observed...it was a ""severe clear"" night. The sighting lasted approx. 30 to 45 seconds until it disappeared into the light pollution to the south of us. Again, we observed no sound from the craft and we live in a very quiet part of town so there was nothing to interfere with our hearing anything unusual.

I want to start out by saying I still hold out there's a possibility that maybe what we saw was some sort of mylar shaped baloon, like the sort you get from the super market. But I want to make my report in case others in the area saw something, the same thing or more and can confirm it wasn't a fancy mylar baloon. Would also like to add my husband and I were the witnesses and we both wrote our descriptions of what we saw and little diagrams within 5 minutes after the incident so the details would be fresh. We were driving down Vista way, past the theater area and saw a black object in the sky. It was about 6:30 pm so the sky was still well lit with the sun just only starting to set. I did see a small plane in the area, like one of those itty bitty 2 seater ones. The object was black, didn'ty seem shiny in any way, seemed rather small and high up. It looked like it was in my opinion either changing shape or rotatinging and the effect was it looked like it was changing shape. (If this was a mylar baloon maybe it was spinning producung the same effect??) Both of our first impressions was that it seemed like roundish and then more ovalish, flatter, like it was wobbling or changing shape. If it was changing shape or spinning it wasn't doing it at a high speed but was slow. We pulled over into a parking lot and got out of the car and looked up at the object. It was then we noticed an orangish spot, or light on one side of the object. I couldnt tell if it was a light or not. My husband's opinion of the orange light was that maybe it was a reflection off the top of the object from the sun that was low in the sky, but he wonders why the bottom of the object wasn't orange too if this was the case , and maybe the darkness of the bottom of the object was the actual colour of the object. We were both frustrated about not being able to see more details clearly when I remembered we keep a small pair of binnoculars in the glove box, they're a cheapo pair and don't magnify very much but would be better then nothing, we were leaning against the car while watching the object so it only took a few seconds to grab the binnoculars, my husband looked away from the sky for even less time then I did and when looked back the object was gone. Just gone, weird timing on the binocular thing but maybe it was a coincidence. If it was a balloon we saw then maybe it popped? We spent another few minutes looking around  to see if maybe we just lost sight of it but never saw it again. The object was sharply defined against the pale sky so it wouldnt have been hard to see if we had just lost track of where it was. Also the object to our eyes seemed to be in a fixed position the whole time we saw it (which made us doubt the balloon theory a bit) It didn't seem to be climbing in altitude either.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,33.201433333333334,-117.2317373015873

It came closer to the house and I was a little scared because I thought it was coming closer and closer to my window. I almost thought maybe it was a comet at first, but then it turned and went towards the cornfield next to us. I did not see any tail on the object and the way it was moving clearly was not a comet. We watched as it just floated quietly but also had like a wavy bounce to it so it didn't look like it was traveling perfectly straight. It looked like something that was observing its surroundings.

Occasionally I am looking down at the gravel road as I am riding and as I began to look up I saw the figures. This startled me, causing me to veer into thick gravel and look away from the figures as I tried to regain control. I quickly came to a stop and looked to my right just as the figures which appeared to be looking at me turned away and began walking away as they suddenly became translucent and faded away. Immediately afterwards the large object that was about 50 feet in length which I had not focused on also became translucent and faded away.  All of this occurred in 5 seconds or less.  I do wear prescription glasses, I am near sighted, I did not have them on and I am not required to wear them while driving.  I tried to focus to see if I could still see them again but I did not. I then began to look around me as I sensed a presence near me. This spooked me and I quickly got back on my bike and began to peddle away towards the bay. I stopped about half way and began looking around again, but saw and sensed nothing. I then went to the end of the trail and waited there probably 15 minutes and was spooked again by what sounded like foots steps on the gravel. I then got back on my bike and I took the longer more difficult route along the dikes towards the Dumbarton Bridge instead of going back in the same direction that I had originally came.  I believe I had seen 3 UFOs in my life, 1 of which occurred on the Menlo Park side of the Dumbarton Bridge around the time and before the lights sighted by many in Phoenix Arizona in 1997.

I went inside to get my Kodak P712 digital camera, which has a 10x optical zoom lens, hoping to get a better look. Upon, returning I did not see the object, and thought it might have passed behind a cloud.  I sat back down to enjoy the sunset, and after a few minutes a bright pinpoint of light caught my eye off to my left as it continued moving slowly south through a clear patch of sky at about the 11 o'clock position. I could see the bright spot very clearly, and was able to point it out to my 5 year old son. My wife, who was also present, did not see it; she had been facing the opposite direction.  I momentarily lost sight of it while readying my camera, but decided to snap some photos of the area anyway. I was very pleased when one of them captured the object. My only regret was that the camera was set to 3.1-mega pixels instead of its maximum of 7.2-mega pixels. The object was definitely three dimensional, and traveling at a slight upwards angle as it moved from north to south.

On the evening of Friday June 13th, 2008 my wife, sister and I witnessed a UFO while driving east on Highway 375 (otherwise known as the Extraterrestrial Highway). Approximately 9:30 PM, after passing Groom Lake Road, my sister saw an object in the sky, south of us.  I pulled over the side of the highway and quickly exited the car. 20-25 miles south of us, over some mountains, we saw an unknown craft fluttering around with the dexterity of a moth. This craft was at least the size of a two-story house (maybe larger, it is hard to judge size in the desert), and had two strobing lights, one green, one red. It was not a jet, airplane, or helicopter, as it fluttered around the sky like a butterfly. It would alternate directions immediately, dropping and rising 50 feet instantaneously. We observed the UFO for about 2 minutes before it sank below the mountains. Three possibilities immediately entered my mind regarding the UFO: 1. It was an alien spacecraft piloted by aliens. 2. It was an alien spacecraft piloted by military personnel. 3. It was an experimental aircraft reverse engineered utilizing alien technology piloted by military personnel.  Five minutes later, the UFO appeared again. It hovered in the air, as if the pilots were skittish--somewhat afraid to be where they were. This sighting was even more exciting as we all were able to fully observe the UFO, its rapid movements making it impossible that this was a man-made craft. After another two minutes, the UFO sank below the mountains. Adrenaline pumping, we surveyed our surroundings, spotting stationary headlights behind us on the highway, about a mile or two away. This light did not move. After five minutes, we became nervous and decided to investigate. We drove back and saw a white SUV with government plates speed off. Relieved to not find Leatherface or any other deranged cannibal hillbillies in rusty pickup trucks, we decided to drive back to our observation point (approximately 26 miles southeast of the Lil Ale Inn).  5-10 minutes passed without any sign of the UFO. It was starting to get late, as I live 2 ½ hours away in Las Vegas, so I was ready to leave when the UFO hovered in the air once again. This time we all noticed an incredible sight: the mountain range to our left was being illuminated on the other side by a powerful light source intermittently, as if the Area 51 base was trying to communicate with the UFO with a sophisticated visual version of Morse code. The mountains were silhouetted in light. We were all silent, awestruck at the possibilities. This new sighting made me realize what was happening:  The Area 51 base was attempting to communicate with an alien spacecraft utilizing light signals.  Why else would they utilize an enormous light source in such a manner? Every time the craft came into view, the light source would illuminate the mountains in an intermittent fashion. When the craft lowered, the light source would stop. It almost seemed as if the lights somehow reassured the UFO to not fly away. We could not tell if the UFO ever landed or not, as the mountain range blocked our view of the ground and Area 51.  We stayed another 15 minutes, observing the UFO twice more. The lights from the base strobed even more powerful as the UFO fluttered around. It was obvious that we were observing something important, beyond our understanding. Was this the first time that this communication has taken place, or has this been going on years or decades and they are trying to refine their methods of communication? So many questions swirled around my mind, though the overwhelming feeling was one of awe and excitement. There is not a doubt in my mind that I witnessed an alien spacecraft. I plan on going back and camping out on a mountain overlooking the restricted zone boundary, and packing a video camera, telescope, and binoculars!  Overall, we observed the UFO for over a half hour, 5 sightings in all, about 2 minutes at a time. I was not drunk or high, nor was my wife or sister. I have completed 190 credits hours in college courses, my wife has a Master’s degree, and my sister attends George Washington University.  We are all in agreement that we have witnessed a UFO.

It traveled towards a smaller, less brilliant star located just west of, and below the brighter star and continued on this course for a distance that put it in line with another dim star whereupon it began to accelerate very rapidly. It continued to accelerate, and passed between the inner star of the handle of the big dipper, and the bottom star that forms’ the corner star of the bottom of the cup of the big dipper.

It then would wiz I.e. move fast and makes abrupt stops. I thought it was going to land somewhere near by and I continued to pursue it. I was very scared. I did see a few cars on the road. But I have no idea if they spotted the same thing. I also must mention that I saw an airplane above it and it was quite far away in the sky as opposed to this object I saw.

On about the night of May 13, 2008 (about 12:15 on May 14) I was sleeping when my wife woke me to observe a strange phenomenon she observed shortly after midnight.  She said she had seen a strange, seemingly near stationary strobing light outside our west window of our second story bedroom window-probably about 15 degrees off the horizon. From the bed, I looked out the window but did not see the lights.  My wife got up and opened the blinds covering a south-facing window.  I then saw a very bright light – bronze in color.  It was flashing regularly and was very crisp and clear at the source. Our home is located in the flight pattern of an international airport and also a local community airport, so aircraft are regularly flying over our home.  I have lived in this area for over 10 years and have seen many planes both during the day and at night.  Nothing about the light I observed resembled an airplane.  I don’t know exactly how to describe the light but it was just so different than any light I had seen in the sky before.  The size made it look distant but without knowing the size, determining the distance was impossible.  What was unique about that light was that it was so crisp, and on a hazy night, one would expect an aircraft landing light to be fuzzy at a distance. I watched as the light traveled a little above the treeline defining the horizon heading approximately south.  The light alone was strange, but after watching it for a few seconds, it made a smooth but tight turn upwards and changed direction to the north or northwest.  After the turn, the light increased in speed suddenly, and then flew out of my view.  My wife ran to the other end of the house in time to catch another glimpse of the light before it disappeared completely from sight. It is hard to judge size, distance, and speed without known references, but the object was either very small, close, and slower  or large, distant, and extremely fast.  There was no sound, so a small/close object is not likely.but the light was so crisp that it didn’t appear to have been a known object at a distance.  if the object were distant, then the speed as it climbed up was incredible.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,43.014164735516374,-83.70674685138538

The only blinking light that I could see was a red one, no green or white as an airplane would have.  Neither one of us could come up with any idea as to what this was since aircraft have the additional wing lights, meteors don't have blinking lights, and satellites generally are in stationary orbit or are in equatorial orbits.

On December 12, 2007 at approximately 9:30 A.M.,  I was inside an office located in Isla Vista,   Santa Barbara County, California, 93117, when I heard a couple of people outside talking about seeing something metallic  in the sky.  I went outside with my friend, and I immediately and asked what they were looking at, and they replied, a UFO.  We asked where, and they said,” It is above the second palm tree” and I looked and saw it. It was perfectly still.  It was a clear day, and I could see that the sun was glinting off of the object, which was the cover of silver, and it was not twinkling, or anything, other than the light of the sun reflecting off of it.  The surface seemed to be more muted, like the difference between glossy prints and matted prints of photographs. It was reflecting the sun, but not in a glare like airplanes do for example. The other 2 guys, who called our attention to it, said it had been bigger, huge, they called it, about the size of the moon, and it had just moved away, distally, and went from being that size to the size of a star, where it paused. They pointed out the object to me which was located above a palm tree, over the ocean, at approx. 45 degree angle in the sky. We were about a block from the ocean, in the down town area of Isla Vista. I immediately spotted it in the sky, and it looked smooth and oval or circular and was perfectly still. I asked one of the other spotters, who had his camera out if he had managed to photograph it and he said no, and as I reached for my cell phone camera, it zoomed away very fast.  It was getting smaller and smaller until it was gone. It took it probably less than 2 seconds to disappear. There were at least 4 of us who saw it, perhaps more.  At the time, there was about 15 people there, however most were distracted by breakfast, and conversations.  I think that only about 4 or 5 of us actually saw it. From our advantage point, it looked to me to be over the sea, probably only about 3 miles out. I do not think I would have seen it if not for the fact that it was about a hand’s with above the palm tree, and the other spotters gave good directions on where to look for it.  When I saw it, I noted my feelings about it, and I felt calm, which was unusual as normally just the thought of them scares me a lot. As an aside, some have said they show up when there are military things going on, and the night before, approx. 15 hours earlier, on December 11, 2007 at 6:31 P. M.

I was shook up by this and could not figure out what it was.  I again quickly looked to see if there were lights in my car that could be causing the visual images – but again couldn’t find an answer.  Finally, as I arrived at my son’s day care as I was about to get out of the car I saw another arc of lights form above the horizon in plain sight.  The arc was shaped different – different angle, but behaved the same in terms of the lights “coming on” one at a time with the one just lit the brightest until the next came on.

We could see no shape of any balloon and there was no obvious basket below the object for holding the people who would be operating the balloon.  He mentioned that he thought the light was flickering as a flame would. Just as he said this the flame flickered out and disappeared. We waited, thinking that if it were a balloon, the operator would have to re-ignite the flame to keep the balloon from falling. There were no sounds of attempts to re-ignite the flame and there was no more light. We could not see anything falling to the ground, even at a slow rate given for the hot air of a balloon to cool, bringing the balloon down. The sighting lasted about seven minutes. It was approximately 5:45pm, Wednesday, December 12, 2007, in the very Northwest corner of Washington State, about 30 minutes south of the Canadian border. There was a wispy cloud cover of about 1000 feet, but we couldn’t even see the diluted light of a flame going through the clouds. We continued on our way with my son watching for a return of the light, while I drove. I arrived back home about 30 minutes later, not having see the light again.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,48.74688634868421,-122.44462006578947

This is my third sighting in five years and almost to the exact date of my first.  My first sighting is dated to 11/01/01 (reported here on this sight) and involved six spheres traveling over our heads in an off-set V formation, heading East (slightly South) direction.  Now these were a visual I cannot get out of my head.  They flew over my house approx. at 10:15pm with 2 witnesses. You could see the moon and clouds reflecting in each one of the spheres as they passed under and toward the (full-ish) moon, which gave off a pinkish/white color.  They had scattered lines all around each of them (like a ball of yarn) and no sounds.  I watched these fly away from us and then vanish as soon as they flew out from under the low cloud formation.  Size and distance I judged with...if you took a quarter and held it up above your head.  Very thought provoking sighting. My second sighting was on Tuesday 10/23/06 where on my same back deck around 8:30 pm, I viewed a light in the sky the was stationary, blinked bright white for three seconds, then went dark for 5 seconds, and then repeated this three times.  On the third time it went dark, it seemed to fade out.  Now I know what I saw wasn't a plane, or helocopter, star blinking, meteor, flare....etc.  It was interesting enough to watch for it again, but never saw it repeat. Now my third, which happened on Friday night/Saturday morning at 12:40am made my heart jump into my throat, and beat five time faster.  I viewed a single craft of the triangle nature slicing through the low clouds, right over my head. This craft was in what I would call 'stealth-mode' because you could not see the craft, but I could see the clouds rolling past the sides, and stearing the clouds behind it.  It traveled from the North, heading South very slowly, then banked toward the West after it passed over. I could not see it after that.  Personally, I was frozen with fear for about 20 seconds before I went inside.  It took me 2 hours to fall asleep that night, and I can still see it in my head.  I really believe I live in a 'pathway' or 'hot-spot' for these things and will keep on watching for them.

It was a very scary moment for me, and really wanted others to read it.  At aprrox. 12:40 AM on Saturday 10/28/06, I stepped out for a smoke on my back deck of my townhome. It was very dark, with none of the neighbor's back porch lights on, so I really could see the stars in the night sky. There was some very large broken patches of clouds high in the sky,(I'm not too clear on elevations to judge them.) Sitting and leaning against my sliding glass window, facing South-South East, I noticed movement right above my head as I was looking toward the East (about 60 degrees up) at the stars. What I saw scared me numb and froze me still for about 30 seconds. I saw a very large 'triangle' shaped craft slicing through the bottom clouds, heading to the South just over my head, then bank toward the West as it was just going out of view from me due to the building's roof line next door to me. Now the wierdest part about 'this' sighting (this is my third at this location) was the fact that I really didn't see the craft, but viewed the clouds rolling past the front two sides of the 'invisible triangle-shape', and stir or roll the clouds behind it. There was no sound, no lights, and what I would describe as a 'stealth mode' or being invisible. I could actually see right through the shape, and a few stars on the other side. This was very frightening to see, and I wish there had been other witnesses.

The object appeared to be at flight level somewhere between 30,000 AND 50,000 feet, located above a point midway between Kayenta and Flagstaff Arizona. At first we noticed a tight triangle of lights  with one of the lights brighter than the other. At first glance I thought it was an aircraft but then because the lights were not strobing and because it maintained a fixed position I realised it was not a conventional fixed wing aircraft. Then a ""V"" type of extension of lights began to light up extending upward and back from the central lights. These were amber colored changing to orange and then later almost a bluish color , then the lights receded back to the nucleus. I considered the possibility that this was a blimp and we were seeing it an angle when the craft abruptly gained altitude in a straight verticle motion. No blimp could have executed such a maneuver . It was an almost instantaneouss gain in altitude of what I would estimate to be 500 to 1000 feet. It remained in that fixed position, occassionally gaining and losing altitude in a similar fashion for almost 30 minutes. I got a pair of binoculars and observed that there were indeed three lights in a tight triangle but that around those lights was a kind of glow of an almost milky quality. Then the craft disappeared. I was looking at it through the binnoculars and told my girl friend ""I've lost it"" . Putting the binnoculars down I saw points of light that appeared one after another in a large triangle  pattern progressing to the northwest across the sky in what could only be desctribed as "" great leaps"". At first I thought that perhaps these were  four or five air craft with strobes on flying at different altitudes , creating a triangular pattern. However if that had been the case they would have continued across the sky. Instead they vanished. I believe it was the craft we observed making its way ac! ross the sky  and then vanishing from sight. The night sky was completely clear. There was a crescent moon and none of our view of the object, either when it was in a fixed position or when it ""leaped"" across the sky was obscured by mountains. Sedona is a low light community so the visibility was excellent that night. I am a former private pilot and flew a twin engine Senecca over this part of the country  for several years. The object did not conform to any type of civilian or military aircraft with which I am familiar. If the  lights streaking across the sky in a triangular pattern was indeed this craft then there is nothing currently being flown which can remotely approach the speed at which this craft traversed the sky.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,34.904693548387094,-111.89417096774194

I want to report something which happened to me many years ago.  The problem with this is that I am not honestly sure that I did not dream these events.  When I was going into 6th grade, which would have been the summer of 1959 I had an event happen that happened at night and I was supposed to be in bed sleeping.  At this time we lived on a farm with our house surrounded by thick woods.  Our closest neighbors lived about a quarter mile down the road on the other side of the road. I recall being in a compartment or room and there was an adult male there with me.  I believe that he was about 25 to 30 years of age.  He just sat there on the bench which was attached to the wall with his head down, his legs spread slightly and leaning over with his elbows resting on his knees not moving nor talking at all.  I recall looking around wondering what I was doing there since I was supposed to be in bed sleeping.  My bed was in the basement of our home and I shared the room with my two younger brothers with my younger sister sleeping in the next room.  I stood up and walked around the compartment and thought it was strange since I was supposed to be home sleeping but I found myself in this compartment.  Three walls appeared to be made of a metal and the other wall had a very large window in the upper half which covered about half the length of the compartment in which we were.   The door into the compartment was between the window and the bench also under the window the bench continued on the other side of the door, I think anyway.  The bench which I had been sitting on and which the man still was sitting on was attached to the wall with the window in it. The window looked out into a passage way and was slanted outward.  I was just a little afraid at that time and was looking at the window wondering why I was there and most of all wondering where ""here"" was since I had no memory of going to this place or even leaving my bed.  I was watching the window when this being walked by.  It was taller than I was at the time.  It was NOT the grey or whatever people normally think of as being involved with UFO’s.  This thing more resembled a ""woki"" as pictured in the star-wars movie.  This thing was not wearing any clothes or have any type of equipment on it that I recall seeing. I seemed to remember that the color of the hair or fur was a dark brown.  I remember then I became very afraid and was scared that that thing would come into the compartment in which I was located along with the man.  I yelled and screamed and ran and jumped onto the window, using of course the bench under the window.  I kept yelling and clawing at the window while laying against it deathly afraid that thing would come into the compartment.  I was totally amazed that all throughout this incident the man in the compartment did not even raise his head or show any interest in anything happening. I recall nothing more and later in the night I woke in my bed, raised up and looked around then lay back down and tried to go back to sleep which I did.  To this day I am not sure this really happened.  I have told my wife about this ""incident"" several times but I never had the nerve to tell anyone else. I should tell you now that I WILL NOT submit to anyone trying to hypnotizing me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was a Sgt. on sheriff patrol in Knox NY at the time.  It was around 8 or 9pm and it was dark out.  I pulled over to the side of Route 146 to relieve myself.  I was standing right next to my cop car and I heard a slight humming sound which I thought was my car radio.  I started to turn to enter my cop car when all of a sudden a very bight intense beam of light shown down on me.  It scared the heck out of me.  I tried to look up but the light was so bright I could hardly make out the shape of the object.  It was saucer shaped and from what I could estimate it was about 200-400 feet above me.  Then the intense beam of light turned off in a blink just like a flash light would and I could see the object shoot off at a very high rate of speed up out of sight.  It made little or no noise and left faster than anything I have ever seen or could possibly imagine at the time or now for that matter.  I then got a call on my cop radio from one of my Deputy officers I was in charge of and he told me to come to a woman's house who said she had seen a UFO a few minutes ago in Berne New York which was close to Knox.  I told my Deputy that I thought I might have just seen what she saw and decided to go check it out.  When I got to the woman's house her dogs were acting very strange.  They were crawling on their bellies with their tails between their legs and were trembling.  I have never seen dogs act like that.  She told me she had see a UFO hovering over her barns in the back yard and had seen them several times before that night.  After that I decided to contact the control tower at the Albany airport.  I asked them if they had tracked anything out of the ordinary and they replied ""no, but we've received several other phone calls from people saying they saw UFOs as well.""  The events were published in the Albany newspaper (I believe it was the Albany Times Union) shortly there after.  I have not told many people about this except for my close family.  I don't want any media attention and anyone to bother me.  I saw what I saw and I know it was something strange and out of the ordinary.

I am 39-years-old, and I am guessing that what happened to my grandmother occurred in the summer of 1973 or 1974, in Titusville, PA.  I would have been about 5-years-old, and I have my own memory of what I saw.  However, my father revealed to me years later that there was more to the story.  My memory of the event is as follows.  My family showed up at my grandmother’s house for a summer visit.  (We lived about 6 hours away.)  We pulled up to greet our relatives, who stood around talking about something that seemed unusual and important.  My mother or father explained to me at that time that the circle on the ground in front of me (in the middle of my grandmother’s yard) had recently and suddenly appeared.  I asked many questions for clarification, and the information I received was that one night something heavy seems to have been set there.  No one knew what but the speculation and joking was that a UFO had landed there.  Part of the conversation was that there were no tire marks or any other evidence around to suggest that someone created the perfect circle.  It seems like a big drum could have created the impression, but how anyone could put a huge, heavy drum there and why they would do so and then remove it made no sense.   My brothers, cousins, and I all decided to play with the impression, creating games from the circle and having fun while the adults chatted in a serious manner.  I would estimate that the circle’s diameter measured 10-15 feet across.  And, as I recall, the indentation has smashed and broken the grass (not burned or scorched).  Brown dirt was visible in the groove that had been cut into the ground.  I remember the groove of the circle as being more v-shaped than flat.  The depth of the groove may have been about 2-3 inches.  I really can’t be certain of the exact appearance and depth of the groove, but it was deep and pronounced enough to be seen from her house, from the neighbor’s yard, and from the driveway.  Years later, while in college, I asked my father about my memory, about which he expounded.  Apparently, my grandmother had been experiencing strange things a few days to a couple of weeks prior to our arrival.  That was, in fact, why we came to visit her.  The events had spooked her so much that she wanted company with her.  My active, pragmatic, not prone to exaggeration Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother had awakened one or two nights to find herself standing and staring out the window at a light.  She felt as if someone was calling her name.  She’d ""snap out of it"" and go back to bed.  Then one night she awakened to find herself downstairs in front of her sliding glass doors looking out into the yard (at the exact spot that the circle appeared).  This really alarmed her because she had no memory of coming down the steps.  My grandmother was born with a problem with her hip socket that gave her a limp her whole life.  Making her way down the steps was a bit of a challenge to her, requiring careful balance and use of the railings.  Again, when she found herself standing at her door, she had felt that she had been staring at a bright light and that someone outside was calling her name, beckoning her to go outside.  During these events is when the circle appeared.  My father believes that my grandmother had contacted someone about the circle and that a man from a local university came and collected a sample of the soil from the circular impression for testing.  My grandmother passed away in 1990, and my father never knew what came of the soil testing.  I don’t believe that anyone thought to take a photo of the impression, which had disappeared by the next summer when we visited again.  (We kids tried to find it but couldn’t.)  My family has been curious about ""the circle"" and what happened to my grandmother a few nights that summer for many years.  I don’t know how posting my story can provide any answers or additional information, but I feel compelled to share it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was heading south east at a slow steady rate.  There was no indication of a propulsion system.  It was the same in front as in back.

I know that many years have passed, so this event may not be of interest. I just haven't heard of a story quite like this one.   At the time we lived in a small town, so we all agreed not to tell anyone about it, feeling we would be ridiculed.  Now, after all these years, we've only just began to contact each other and recall exactly what happened that night. We were all about 20 years old or so.  I'm not sure what year it was, but me and 2 friends were riding around in my car in Clinton, MO.  It was a boring night riding in circles around the Clinton Square, which is where all the kids hung out.  We decided to go see a friend in Windsor, MO, which was about 25 miles away.  As we were on the way, heading east on highway 52, I happened to see a flashing, blinking object on the horizon to my left, and mentioned it to my friends. It seemd to be blinking different colored lights that were unusual. They took notice, but resumed talking about whatever. I kept watching it as they talked and noticed it was coming closer to us from my left. (I was driving so I could see it better than them.)    As the object now came within a half mile or so, I interrupted my friends and said that they should take a look at this thing since it seemed like it was going to fly over us.  I shut off the stereo and as it approached it was obviously very large.  It had various stationary and blinking lights in a configuration that I can't quite describe, but as it flew over us, we only knew it was very large.  It slowly flew over us - I mean only 10 or 20 miles an hour at maybe 150 or 200 feet.  Right over us, but we couldn't figure out a shape.  Just BIG... and NO SOUND.  We hung our heads out the windows and looked up as it slowly flew over us.  It didn't make sense. We coasted along the highway and began talking about what it could have been as it headed toward our right-hand horizon.  As we talked and watched the object fade off in the distance, we eventually speeded back up and continued down the highway.  We soon realized the object was coming back toward us. (but from several miles away)  It seemed to be on an intercept course with our progress down the highway.  As it approached within about a quarter mile or so, I noticed that there was a circular light below the object.  As if there was a beam of light shining toward the ground, but you couldn't see the beam, but only a patch of light on the ground below the object.  There were strip pits in the surrounding area, so it was very strange seeing the patch of light floating up and down the hills below the object as it approached us.  I yelled at my friends when I saw it and we all became very uneasy about it.  Now it was upon us and just to the side, about the height of 3 or 4 telephone poles up.  It turned to parallel us and matched our speed, which was now only 10 or 20 miles an hour.  Weird blinking lights, maybe strobing or rotating, but very hard to describe, even just after the incident.  NO SOUND.  Not a whisper.  We still couldn't make out a specific shape, even though it was right over us. Only the lights that seemed to defy any aircraft-type shape.  Kind of like a big box, but nothing we could actually describe within reason.  We all had our heads hanging out the windows, looking up at it: RIGHT OVER US and it banked and flew toward the horizon to our forward, left. We looked at each other in disbelief again until one of my friends yelled: ""Chase it!"" I speeded up, but didn't realize that we were now within the city limits (and speed zone) of Windsor.  Now there were familiar flashing lights in my rear view mirror and we were pulled over.  I told my friends NOT to say we were chasing a friggin UFO and they agreed.  The Windsor cop walked up to my door and put his hands on the ledge of my door... I kid you not, he had ""L.O.V.E"" tatooed on his left hand fingers and ""H.A.T.E"" tattooed on his right. This night was getting wierder as it went on.  After he asked for my driver's license, I realized that I had left it on my dresser at home.  He asked my name and I told him it was ((name deleted)).  He went back to his car for a while as we chattered about what had happened with the object. The cop was the furthest thing from our mind.  He soon returned and told me he didn't have any record of a ""((name deleted))"" from Clinton, MO.  I corrected him on the name and he went to his car again.  We were now laughing about Barney Fife, but still trying to figure out what that thing could have been.  The cop returned again, now with a dumbfounded look since he had messed my name up again.  He said we should follow him ""downtown"" to the police station.  I gladly agreed and followed him there.  We went inside and he introduced me to the ""Chief"" who quickly pulled me up on his computer, showing me as Barry Wilder.  No Problem and thank you for your time.  We were quickly released. As we walked toward the door, one of us said: ""Wouldn't it be weird if that thing was still out there?"" We stepped out the door and looked to our right... There it was, about a mile or two down the road and seemingly hovering. We jumped into the car and gave chase again.  As we headed toward it, it began about a mile-wide cirlcle. We saw an dirt path that lead up to a small hilltop.  There were no trees or anything around it, only this ""bald hill"" as we called it later.  We stopped the car and got out as we watched the object circling toward us.  It was as if we knew it would fly to us.  It did.  It came directly over us at a speed of maybe 20 miles an hour.  We stood there in disbelievment as it flew directly over us.  Again, NO SOUND.  Nothing.  The sound of the mild wind blowing past our ears was louder.  It slowly flew over us and headed away for the last time.  We looked at each other in disbelief, but when we turned to look at it again, it seemed as if it was much farther away that it should have been at the speed it flew over us.  Soon it was over the horizon and gone. If I seem vague about dates and times it is only because after the event my friends and I decided it would be best not to tell anyone about it since it sounded so rediculous.  We lived in a small town and people would not understand what had happened.  Because of this, it kind of faded into my past.  I moved away soon after the incident so we didn't have much of a chance to talk about it until years later.  I just spoke with one of my friends and asked him about his recollection of the events.  As we spoke, he said that we actually turned around to follow it after the first pass.  I don't remember doing that, but we probably did.  I think if we all got together, we could work out the exact sequence of events.  It wasn't like a ""sighting""... It was more like an ongoing encounter that we couldn't quite grasp, so I think we all just tried to forget it. The date and time could be verified by the Windsor Police Department, unless Barney Fife is in charge of records. They could also verify that we weren't drunk, on drugs or just crazy.  We were straight as a board and completely sane.  In the years since, two of us have become upstanding citizens and business owners.  The other one has been gone and not much in contact. I know this sounds a little unbelievable, but I'd like to get together with my other two friends and refresh each other's memories as to the exact, cronological sequence of events. I would then like to take lie detector tests to prove that this really happened.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,38.3859,-93.7431

There were only a few lights on at the time in the area so that my vision of the night sky was not obscured.  I too saw a very large (probably the size of a football field) triangular / boomerang shaped object cross the sky above me – going from west to east (I know because I was near the mountains and the object came from over the mountains).  It was very large, traveling surprisingly slow, and at an altitude I would guess to be less than 1,000 feet.  There was no sound associated with the craft, there were no lights visible at all, and it was very dark in color.  The only way I knew the craft was there was because I noticed it block out the stars above it as it passed in front of them directly above me.  I focused in on it and observed the very distinct outline of the craft and watched it maintain a straight course for 10 seconds until I lost sight of it as it passed directly over the City of Boulder.  It startled me so that I immediately went to a pay phone and called the Boulder Police Department.  Dispatch for the Boulder Police Department informed me that they had recently received over 20 calls already on the same observation.  This wasn’t 2005 as was the case of the report that has caused me to file this report – My experience was in 1983.  Unfortunately I don’t recall the exact day.  I can only guess that it was late in the year, very possibly September.  I do know that I saw a craft, however.   I had recently spent 4 years in the Navy and was familiar with every type of ‘publicly known’ military aircraft, and this fit the profile of none of them.  I have since gone on to develop a career in the Navy and have spent a great deal of time in a flying status.

Then I realized the ‘star’ was getting larger and coming toward my car very fast and was not going down but coming towards me.  Then it was above my car outside my driver’s side, up quite a ways. This all happened extremely fast.  It followed my car for a few minutes and I was able to tell that it looked as big as a football field in the sky, with some lights around the edge of its kind of oval shape.  I had my window down and it made no sound at all. My little dog was in the back of the car and my camera was there, but I was too afraid to stop the car and get it to take pictures.  I watched it and in just a few minutes, it flew away so fast, I could not believe how fast it took off, going south, and then it was gone from sight.  I went home and told my mom and she said she believed me and had heard similar stories from other people in the area.  I did not report it because in 1984, most people did not believe you, so I just kept quiet except for telling my sisters.

It doesn't end there. Ok from what I can remember, I was attending elementary school in about the mid 80,s, I was about 8-10 yrs old and after lunch we went to the play ground, and on the way, there was talk and children excited about an object in the sky.  So I ran to see, when I arrived the teachers and children where pointing in the sky, so I looked an there it was a UFO!!!  What ever that ment  I didn’t know rather to be excited or scared so I looked at the teachers, they seemed to be fine so it was ok. Thinking back it was very high up possibly miles up and north about one or two o’clock high, at first, at least to me it appeared to be saucer or oval shaped but definitly chrome in color, and It just seemed to set their for awhile it didn’t move at all, what was so exciting about that. At least 30 min went by as the children started playing again, then suddenly the teachers started yelling look!!! When I did It had started changing it’s shape to a tear drop facing down and flickering from a dark chrome color to bright chrome glow, at this time my watch a Dukes of hazard watch started beeping Its horn sound , fuzzy sound but It was beeping and it wouldn’t stop so I covered it with my hands and continued looking, then it fell in like a controlled fall about a third of the way down and stopped again for a few minutes, I started playing with my watch when all at once some of the children said it was falling to the ground, I looked but couldn’t find it for a second until it flickered here an there on the way down until I last seen it just above the tree’s. I don’t know if it had fell to the ground are not but it was definitly falling down. After that we couldn’t see it anymore then we went back to class after observing it for at least 45 minutes. No big deal to me I didn’t even know what UFO was. If I am correct on the date the next day when we returned to school, again after lunch we where playing in the play ground when unexpectedly I’m  pretty sure of it are we wouldn’t have been playing out there, the teacher! s starte d yelling at us to leave the play ground, at the same time I Noticed one or two military helicopters just over my head, and that was it for me checkmate I was gone!!! Anyways  when we the children had seen that it was the military and they had landed in the play ground we were excited. I remember thinking they were there for us the children and were going to paint our face’s  with camouflage like they would at the city fair when they would come. But in full uniform the officers just walked on bye straight to the principles office screw them!!! We later went back to class then soon after my teacher including other teachers where called to the office, and we were subbed by another teacher while she was gone. And that was about it until the next day when we arrived back to school and was told on the intercom that what we had seen was none other than a weather balloon and we were even told on kplc news that it was. So that was that. Go figure!!! Hell I believed It. Until about 20 years later after I had forgotten It all those years, it wasn’t a UFO that’s why I forgot about it until I’d seen a similar event on the history channel, then WOW what had happened all came back. Any way I’m glad I seen this site on the web I haven’t really had it in me to tell this story to any one else around here because I haven’t heard anything about it since don’t want to bring it up again. I’m sure I’m not the only one that remembers it around here. Awe one more thing for what its worth just a couple of miles north of my small town of about 3,500 is a large prison compound it could have had a strange appearance from above. And I also seen on the history channel about UFO’s a map showing a UFO crash recovery just about 40-80 miles north of my town. about 40-50 miles north of here is a military base called Fort Polk, I don’t know when the so called recovery took place but it was a long time ago, I guess it would be possible for the craft that I seen to have crashed way up their since it was so high it could have appeared to be c! loser. W ell I guess that’s about It I hope some one else can explain it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date.

I looked back at the road and looked up again thinking that I had never seen a bird able to keep afloat for that amount of time without utilizing its wings. As I stared longer I realized it was not a bird at all. In fact it was something that I could not explain. I seem to want to compare it to a submarine that was flying. Or maybe a missile, due to its shape. It was black and long and thin, similar to a cigar. It seemed to have small fins sticking out of its sides. Again I was on my motorcycle and so I could not here any sounds, nor did I see any lights. Its movement was not that of a rocket, because it did not move in a linear manner. I would liken its movement to someone holding it on a string and pulling it up and down, and if it weren’t for the height of the object in the sky, roughly 500 feet, and location, over a heavily wooded area, I would swear someone was holding it up on a fishing line.

I started looking up into the northern sky when I noticed an object that was stationary and gleaming in the very bright sun and was at the altitude of normal airliners. After I completed my honeydew chores and rolling up the hose, which took about 15 minutes in total I again looked for the object and I found it was still in the very same spot including that it was still stationary and apparently had not moved.  I called for my wife thru our patio door and asked her to come and look at some object and tell me what she thought. I pointed to it and she said, “I don’t know what that is, but it is not moving at all and maybe it is a big balloon”. My wife then went and got me our binoculars so we could take a better look.  WoW, came out of my mouth while looking at it, as it was visibly quite large, circular with a weird combination of red-green-silver haze around it. I then gave the binoculars to my wife and said, “You got to take a look at this”. Well, to say we were both astonished is an understatement.  The object remained stationary for another 25-30 minutes and then started moving directly north at a very slow pace and in fact so slow that I initially thought it had stopped moving again. As the object moved northerly the red-silver glow was more apparent and the greenish hue totally disappeared.  I watched the object for a good 40 minutes and I still do not understand what I was looking at, but I can definitely tell you it was NOT a balloon or any type of man made aircraft including a helicopter at that height.  I am still stunned thinking about it and wanted to report it accordingly. My wife and I have never seen anything like this and we both thought it should be reported, discreetly.

It would be easier to draw.  But there was a big shiny, what looked to be a star.  Biggest and brightest I have seen.  Then there was a little dot or light to the right of it.

I went back inside to get my girlfriend to see that if you look, there are little light going around and connecting at those points giving it the shape of an oval or disk or something.

I went inside, got some money to walk across the street and get some coffee.    When I came back outside, I didn't see it anymore.  I looked over to the EAST to see if I saw a particular star that was present before and it was moved, but still there.  Most stars were still there as the 10 minutes past.  But didn't see the object.  Then realized there was cloud cover in that area.  So I chalked it down to it did not move, but was just being covered by some clouds.  It may move some but should be close to the orginal positon bc not much time did pass.  Maybe 10-15 minutes.  After getting some coffee and a dougnut, I headed back, but decided to have another cigarette and see if the cloud cover passes bc I want to find that image again.  I wasn't that patient and just said, it is the cloud cover.  But then as I am looking in the sky, saying I wish I didnt go to get coffee and doughnuts, I noticed behind the clouds there was some light or haze creating what looked to be a disk or orb.  I counted that every 9 or 10 seconds, the lightt would go around.  Looked like there was searchlights, but it didnt go into the sky.  It was behind the cloud, and looked liked a cir! cle.  I went inside and yelled and my gf to get up and look, but she did not bc I went right back out there.  I rubbed my eyes.  I looked again and confirmed tro myself what I am seeing.

From my limited research it appears I could have witnessed the International Space Station (haven't verified it could bee seen from my location at that time)pass over head which I may have but that doesn’t explain the other 8+ objects I saw and they all kind of looked the same with the exception of one shooting star like object.  The first sighting I saw one traveling from my north towards the east horizon followed closely by a similar object trailing a few seconds slightly off the path of the first object. The rest seemed to be traveling roughly in the opposite direction, each traveling from horizon to horizon in a matter of minutes and some appeared to be moving in a less than perfect straight line. During all this I witnessed numerous shooting stars as one would expect however one was unlike any I have ever seen before, much brighter and much slower with a long white tail similar to those I’ve seen on pictures of comets.

It was an unseasonably warm eveing. Temperature was around 70 degrees F. There was little to no wind. The sky was clear. Humidity was low. I live in a small town in northern North Carolina. There are lights from a shopping mall about a mile away and street lamps here and there in our neighborhood BUT on a clear night one can still see many familiar constellations, etc. I just happened to look up at the sky when I observed the sighting.  All of the ligts were yellowish in color and NOT blinking. They were moving in a general S to N line at an EXTREMELY high rate of speed. When I first saw them they were about 12 o’clock position and only took about 2-3 sec. to go out of sight to the N. One has to remember that tthis happened VERY fast. As best as I can remember there were 5 or 6 lights in the shape of a rectangle. Its hard to say whether this was a single object with several lights or several distinct objects. The lights all moved in tandem and at the same rate of speed. What struck me as much as anything was the RATE of speed and the absolute silence before, during, and after the sighting. I am 58 years old and this was my first sighting.  I am a veteran and my son is a pilot. I have been around aircraft all my life and I have NEVER seen any aircraft move at that rate of speed. To cover half of the night sky in 2-3 seconds is MOVING. Now a big problem here is to try and judge the SIZE of the object or objects. I am not able to do that  as it happened so fast. Of course the larger the object(s) was....how far away it was....is all very important in determing its speed. I was not able to do that !

The sightings were on the opposite side of the sky.  I immediately thought that ""some of these pilots in these commercial aircraft MUST have seen what I saw.

Wow! Today started out normal, I had just returned home from carpooling with babies in tow and sat in the car a little longer than usual listening to this cool song on the radio.  The sky was clear, the weather nice, with no breeze. After about a minute I decided to get out and open the house door to enter my house. Just I approched the lock with key in hand, I hear an extremely loud roaring/churning/oscillating sound, I think "" What the..."" as the sound is directly on the side of my house and getting so loud that I can feel it shake the ground.  I run to the side of the house and for about 5 seconds (that's about how long it took for me to turn tail and head back to the car so that me and my babies could hotfoot it away!) the sky just on the side of my house and above my neighbor's yard was a weird cold greenish blue tint. Like looking thru a funky pair of sunglasses. Anyway, at the car door curiosity takes hold so I am standing on the stepbar of my car and I watch, mouth agape as this orb approx. the size of my car tire, leisurely travels down the powerlines. It is the same color as the sky was glowing seconds earlier but now the color is contained just around the orb itself.  And I recall thinking it is going to set the trees on fire as it rolled and periodically sparked. Just as I decided to grab my camara phone (cause no one was going to belive this!!!) It reached the end of the wires, turned a funny bright white yellow color, sparked a few more times then just winked out.  By this time two of my other neighbors were outside and we were all looking up at the lines. So I called my mom who is only about 2 blocks away and asked if she had experienced anything odd, and she confirmed that she heard the the loud roaring and her lights flickered off and on several times but she never came to the door.  After that phone call, I decided to drive the block to see the damage that this fireball had caused. ( still asumming that logically it must have been a blown transformer or something) yet after inspection, it was noted that 1)no damage whatsoever was done to the powerlines in question, you could still see the mold growing on them, 2) there was no buring ozoney smell in the air, that you would normally get from these types of fires ( I have seen powerlines burn before and they smell bad) 3) and the weirdest thing of all is that I do not remember hearing a loud boom like a powerline blowing, the sound just appeared and then got louder!

We saw a floating light flashing periodically on our property.  The light is about the size of a baseball and appears to float across our property a fairly high speed.  I flashes then dims and then flashes a few yards away showing us it path of movement.  The light seems to know we are watching it because it approached our back porch where we were standing and watching it and came with 12 feet of where we were standing and landed in on the ground and continued to blink and flash slowly perhaps one blink every 6 seconds for about 4 minutes then we noticed the flashing was about 20 feet above the ground and it exited our view by floating into the forest behind our house.  When I shone a very high powered flashlight on it there was no visible structure to be seen. This thing has been here at least three times that we have seen it. It seems to have intellignece and seems to be very aware of our presence. We will attempt to video tape it tonight as proof but would prefer a professional to come and visit our property to make a more scientific evaluation of this unexplained object.,2006-05-15T00:00:00,27.59220375,-82.50594

We were going about 35mph at the time. I pointed them out to my husband and he saw them also. We passed a clump of trees and we looked for the lights but they had disappeared. We got to our apartment complex about 10 minutes later, which was about a mile away from the sighting; we parked our vehicle and stood outside talking. My husband and I both glanced up at the same time towards the southwest end of our complex and saw three brightly colored orange lights very close together about 20 feet apart from each other. They blinked on one at a time and stayed lit for about 10 seconds and then completely blinked off. Then we saw further to the right of where those lights where three more lights come on one at a time stay lit for 10 seconds and then turn off. They were separated about ½ mile from each other and were about 100 feet from the ground. There was absolutely no sound. We decided we were going to see where they were heading to so we got into the van and chased these lights. We headed south down the back country roads chasing them. One lit up to the left of our vehicle, only three lights this time and in the same sequence as before. It stayed three quarters of a mile ahead at this point. We continued to follow and saw it light up again this time on the right side of the vehicle and it seemed to be going about  45mph. It stayed just barely in front of us as we followed it. Once again only one and the same sequence of action. The last time we saw it light up there were the set of three lights, but there were additional lights this time, about two more and they were a bit  ahead of the three we were use to seeing. To us it seemed as if there was more then one. If asked I can not exactly say, they were in to many different positions they all stayed about 100 feet off the ground. We came to a dead end and could not follow them anymore so we turned around and went back home. The whole chase lasted about an hour and we ended up about 10 miles from our apartment complex. Tonight we decided we would check to see if we could see these lights again. I had seen on websites that others had also seen these lights in/around the same area. So we went near the area we first saw the lights and parked by a field. This was around again 9:15pm, we waited for about 25 minutes and saw nothing but just when we were getting ready to leave, My Husband, Step-Son, and I, saw these lights come on just south of our location. There were 12 to 13 lights on and the same orange color as before. Behind these lights we saw what looked like sparks shooting from behind it. We watched as it looked to be coming in from an angle and it started to turn more lights on. I’m not sure how far it was from the ground but it seemed pretty close. I tried getting a photo of it but it disappeared completely from there and never reappeared.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,40.55987014925373,-85.62199402985075

They were static and I judged them to be at an altitude of where I normally see the shooting stars.

At this time, I was home alone with 3 small children which had been put to bed.  We had 5 outside dogs that began barking up a storm.  There was a large fenced pasture behind and adjacent to our property, with a tree-lined driveway leading toward and then turning to parallel this pasture. I went out of my front door and rounded the corner of the house facing the pasture and didn't see anything.  I saw the dogs sitting side by side and barking in the direction of the pasture.  I walked closer and past the dogs (who did not move forward with me).  I thought it odd that the dogs did not come with me to investigate.  When I had moved a few steps closer to the pasture, I saw a large orange light that seemed to be slowly rotating the circumference of an object.  The object itself, I could not see againt the night sky.  The light seemed to move from right to left, disappear momentarily as if on the back side of the object, and re-emerge on the right again.  I also noticed that the object itself seemed to be silently moving in a forward, downward and zig-zagging motion (closer to my property).  I ran back into the house and locked the doors.  I called my husband who was bowling with friends, and he scoffed as I explained what I had seen.  I was terrified, and realizing he wasn't going to come home immediately as I had hoped, I instead called a friend long distance, and stayed on the phone with her for well over an hour until he did arrive home.  I did not report the sighting to any authorities for fear of ridicule. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

It was Mid-October 1990, I was thirteen years old and was on the phone with a friend when my father came in my room and told me that I needed to feed our dog, which stayed outside. It was around 9:00 p.m. I got the dog food and went to do the chore quickly so I could get back on the phone. It was a clear and cool night. While walking to feed the dog I noticed how beautiful the sky and stars were. I bent down to pour the food out into the dog dish as I stood up, I noticed this oval shaped flying object that had green and red lights circling in the middle. There were windows in the craft where I actually seen a green figure with a huge head and big bulging black eyes. This figure is just like what is reported in most alien sightings. This is how I know that I am not crazy. I seen this way before people went Area 51 crazy like they did in the late 90’s. The craft was flying extremely low across a field. After staring at it for about 2-3 minutes, the curiosity left and fear took over because it noticed me and started coming my way. I ran straight toward the house. As I approached the steps I looked back as the craft quickly went backwards out of sight. I was upset and got my parents to walk out to see maybe they could see it. They did not get to, it was gone. I knew what I seen. If you tell people this story they think you are making it up. After almost 18 years, I think about the sighting often and have a lot of questions. This sighting happened in Reidsville, GA. I could understand how people would feel this story is far fetched because if I would not have seen it, believing it  would be difficult, especially since I am almost a 31 year old man.

Near Corsair.  Craft nearly filled the sky between the pines.  Very large, very close. I was driving on Monument Rd. towards East Tawas, around the Corsair cross country skiing area around 1:30am.  While driving, above the tall pines I could see a spotlight shining above the trees, crossing the roadway ahead.  My first thought was the typical helicopters, which my dad always said it was the DNR, that we would see with spotlights at night in the Tawas City area.  As I drove closer, the light was larger and brighter than a normal spotlight I've seen before from a helicopter.  I began to slow down and stare through my windshield as I was coming upon it and was almost underneath.  I could tell it was coming from the right to the left as the beam of light was getting brighter.  When the front end of craft appeared in the opening of the roadway (above the trees by approximately 100-200yds), I realized this wasn't a helicopter.  I pushed my clutch in and pulled over to the side of the road.  The entire front end of the craft was the spotlight.  The best analogy I can give is it looked similar to the battlestar galactica in the first star wars movie.  It was very large and I was almost directly underneath it.  I pulled over, rolled down my window and looked almost directly up at it.  It was moving gracefully and slowly across the opening of the roadway.  The sound was a sound of a light to medium hum.  Almost like the sound of it going through the air.  There wasn't a rumble of an engine sound.  It sounded like when your furnace kicks on and you can hear the air blowing through the vent, except louder.    I remember thinking that this thing was huge.  The thoughts going through my mind where - this isn't a helicopter.  What kind of plane is this?  When I realized the entire front end, which was flattened, was the spotlight, I then looked for wings and there weren't any.  It was moving slowly as well.  I've been in plenty of planes and currently live near an airport, and I know a plane moving that slow isn't possible.  At any rate, when I realized it wasn't a plane, around 1/3-1/2 ! of it wa s above me with the rear still hidden by the tree tops on the right hand side.  I then said to myself, scan this out and I started scanning all over it with my eyes.  The middle had a slowly pulsating red light.  There were many smaller white lights around the perimeter that were spaced, I'd guess, at around 20-30yds each.  There were roughly 4-5 lights around the longer sides of the oval, with the spotlight out front.  After looking at the lights, I started to look at what was on the body of the craft.  There was stuff?  Again, like the battlestar galactica.  Whereas there were tons of protruding parts all over the place.  At this time, I realized I was out in the middle of no where, by myself.  I remember looking to my left out the window into the woods.  When I thought that I was alone out in the middle of the woods, and when I noticed the darkness of the woods, I got extremely scared, like a monster was about to come out of the woods and get me.  The scared/terrified feeling is like you get as a kid and almost become unable to move.  I remember locking my door and reaching to roll up the window and begin shifting into 1st gear.  As I was rolling up the window, I continued to watch it.  The front end was almost now out of sight and the rear end just broke out from above the trees on the right side.  I started to release the clutch and roll the car when the craft changed its speed.  It originally had to be going no faster than around 25-35mph (taking into consideration the distance).  When it sped up, it doubled/tripled its speed.  I looked forward and shifted into 2nd gear just as I saw car lights coming around the bend (just as I was pulling off of the shoulder of the road).  I figured they had to see this.  I began to slow down and they flew by going normal speeds.  I hit my brake lights to see if they would hit their's and no go.  I drove home, told my dad about it, he laughed and said it was probably a DNR helicopter.  I know what I saw.  I had time to evaluate it, it moved very slowly, it was dir! ectly ab ove me, and extremely close.  It did not have wings, it was not a helicopter unless there is one that is of this size, and it did not have an engine sound.  When I stretch my arms out, I can measure that the width of this was approximately the distance of my hands being apart of around 1.5 feet.  Extend that angle out to the length of those pines, then add around 100yds+ above that, and that's the width.  The length was the length of the entire view of the sky that can be seen across the roadway, then minus about 20yds or so.  When the front was about 20yds from being hidden from the trees on the left hand side, only then did I recognize the rear come out from the tree tops on the right hand side of the road.  It continued at its slow pace until it was around almost 1/2 out of view (I could still see the red light in the middle) then it sped up.  Total time from viewing the front of the craft until it was gone, approximately 1min.  I just closed my eyes and replayed the event and it was probably close to 30secs.  Very scary feelings.

When I looked up I dropped my paper cause I saw suddenly 3 balls of light hanging still in the air in a wide triangle-form. My first thought was it was maybe a reflection of my window, but it definitely kept hanging there on the same spot and when a rising cloudformation covered 2 of the 3 objects after 3 minutes of watching it out of my train window, it ruled out the possibility of being a window reflection.  It appeared like they were reflecting sunlight though because they were hanging in the late-evening western part of the sky, and looked orange/yellowish. They appeared to have a round form but rather oval, it’s hard to say, but they definitely didn’t appear to be pointy like a star. Furthermore, the light didn’t appear to be coming from a concentrated spot like you have with the flare of a plane or a planet/star, they looked like bright ‘ink’spots in the air, so they should have been really big.  I believe they were hanging 25 to 30 degrees above the western horizon and I could look at them for at least 3-4 minutes! Then a cloud covered the bottom 2, which formed the basis of the triangle you could say, and only the upper one was visible. The train then made a curve and I lost them out of sight. Later in the car I pulled over a few times to have a look when I was outside the city, but that cloud had risen so they were just gone or behind the cloud but I haven’t seen them after.  I estimate they had the magnitude of Venus at its brightest, magnitude -4, but it was like there were 3 wide (no-pointlike/starlike form but broader in shape) Venuses hanging in the sky exactly in a wide triangle form, on a great distance I guess cause a cloud at the horizon covered 2 of them.  I ‘ve seen all kinds of phenomena and have been a member of an observatory/amateurastronomer for 8 years (not anymore now) so I know basis meteorological and astronomical phenomena. I have watched the skies for so many hours and nights and seen a lot, from magnificent fireballs and meteors to satellites and iridium flashes, but nothing that was unexplainable. Never ever I saw something as yet uncomprehensible like this. If it was there, there should have been lots of people who saw it cause it was bright and clear., I don’t understand it hasn’t been on the news yet.

At approximately 8:30 PM Thursday night, Myself and a co-worker witnessed four very bright lights hoovering about 20-30 feet above the tree line.  We were sitting on our music stage at work. We were facing the restaurant. I looked over my left shoulder at my buddy.  I noticed these lights. I tapped him on the shoulder and asked him what that was.  He saw it and replied, “I don’t know.” I then slapped him on the shoulder and asked him again, “What the f*** is that?!  The lights were grouped together in a kite shape.  There was one in front, one light offset to the right(just behind and to the side of the front light,) one light offset to the left(just behind and to the side of the front light,) and one light in the back( there was more space between the front and back light, than there was between the side lights.  The lights were pointing down to the ground, and you could see beams of light below these lights.  It appeared to over the trees, but was close enough to know that whatever it was, it was big.  We then stood up.  Almost as if they heard us, as soon as we stood up the lights started to dim.  I thought they were going behind the tree line.  But when I stood up, the tree line was 20-30 feet below where these lights were.  The lights dimmed to nothing, and it disappeared.. We kept our eyes on the sky.   After the lights dimmed out I could notice approx. 12 twinkling lights flying erratically in a northerly direction.  They kept moving until out of sight.  Shortly after, a small prop plane flew by, quite low.      This was the first noise we heard in the sky. The small plane flew over the area where we had spotted these lights.  He flew by and continued towards town.  We could see and hear him circle back and then he started flying towards us.  His headlights were coming right at us, then he darted back over the highway where the lights were.  This time when he got in that area he did a complete turnaround. When he turned back, my co-worker and myself saw 6 twinkling lights coming back at us from the north.  They were heading in a southerly direction.  Then all the lights disappeared, except one.  It was a clear night last night. And not a whole lot of traffic in the sky, except after what we saw. For a while there, it looked like the sky was dancing. We have been trying to come up with some explanation for what we saw.  The first thing we thought was maybe it was a light tower.  But there are no light towers in the vicinity of where witnessed the lights. The lights were as bright as the ones at a football field.  They were unlike our parking lot lights, they are more reddish.  These were very bright. And then they just dimmed out, like on a dimmer switch.  No noise in the sky when the lights disappeared. Nothing like this had ever happened to us before.  We are both mind blown by what we witnessed. You can guarantee we will be out there for the next few nights.  This time I’m bringing my camera in hopes of getting it on film.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,33.4465,-79.6251

At 8:40 pm I went outside to take a walk and noticed, in the northeast, two bright orange lights, moving slowly, in tandem toward the left.  The brighter of the two was about the same brightness as Jupiter, which has been prominent in the southwest sky for weeks now.  The second was a bit dimmer.  At first it reminded me of the tandem flyover of the space shuttle and ISS a couple months ago, except they were going the wrong direction and were completely the wrong color. However, the speed was similar, and the brighter light appeared to be following the other.  The lights were low in the sky, and soon moved behind some trees. When they came back into view, I realized there were 3 orange lights, forming a broad-based triangle, with the two dimmer lights at the bottom and the brighter at the top, between them. As they headed behind some trees again, then behind the house across the street, I called for my daughter to come out of the house, and I ran around in my yard trying to find a clear view. Once my daughter was outside with me, I saw the lights once more in a gap between trees. By this time the lights were in a different configuration – as if the brighter light were “catching up” with one of the dimmer ones.  They were all slightly dimmer by that time, so I had the impression that they were moving away, toward the north. They soon dropped below the treetops and I didn't see them again.  As I think about it now, the 3 lights may have represented the corners of a very large triangular object (way bigger than an airplane), which turned toward the north while it was behind the trees, thereby changing the angle at which I was seeing the lights.  Size - if I held my arms out straight, and pretended to put one finger on each light in the sky, my fingers would be about 5-7 inches apart between the brightest light and the two dimmer ones, and about 12-13 inches apart between the two dim lights  Out of the 4 or 5 minutes that elapsed, I had perhaps 60 seconds, total, that I could actually see the lights.  I didn’t hear anything. But then again I saw a conventional small aircraft in roughly the same area, and couldn’t hear that either.  The conventional aircraft seemed to have circled around in the same general direction as the UFO, then back again toward me. Or it could have been two different aircraft, going in two different directions. I’m wondering if there’s any way to find out if the pilot(s) saw anything?",2007-10-08T00:00:00,43.1998,-71.6954

The lights were in a straight line.  We could see no planes, noise, or any other motion in the sky. Then less then 5 minutes later we saw another light.

I never thought I would ever file a report like this, but I would like to get to the bottom of what I saw.  I just got back from my vacation at Myrtle Beach.  We were there since 8/31 and just got back today, Friday 9/7/07.  We stayed in North Myrtle Beach.  Last night (Thursday 9/6/07) around 11:30 pm, my friend and I were walking along the beach toward the Apache Pier. We were in deep conversation as I looked up to my left at the clear night sky over the ocean.  There were a few cumulous clouds that were visible.  As I looked, I saw a bright orange slow moving object moving to the north.  At first I thought it was plane, but it didn’t look like a typical plane light you would see at night.  Before I could say anything to my friend, it faded away.  Consequently, I just let it go and didn’t mention anything.  Shortly after that moment, we turned around and started walking back to our resort.  About 15 minutes later, my friend nudged me as he pointed up to the sky and asked, “What is that?”  There in the sky, was the same slow orange light.  As we both watched in silence, the light separated into 5 or 6 other orange lights that lined up in a perfectly straight diagonal line.  Then, in perfect unison, they slowly started moving to the left.  Then they simultaneously faded away.  Neither one of us could come up with a reasonable explanation.  My friend’s first proposed explanation was that it could have been a flare.  But can a flare separate into 5 or 6 other orange lights, evenly spaced apart in a perfect diagonal line, and all move in unison in the same direction?  We stood there staring for about 15 more minutes, hoping that the strange lights would reappear.  Unfortunately, that was the last we saw of them.  As we walked back to the resort we kept our eyes on the sky.  We even stayed on our balcony for a good while.  We were hoping that there would be something about it in the news this morning.  But no such luck.  I would just like to add that I’m not a believer in little green men visiting the earth from other planets.  I’m just perplexed as to what this could be..  I’m sure that there is a rational explanation to this.  I would just like to know what it is. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from this area of South Carolina.

While waiting for the Reno Balloon Races to commence, I spent my time watching for satellites. After spotting a couple of normal ones, I saw a very unusual one. This one’s flight characteristic seemed to be like a butterfly in a strong breeze except very, very high up (high up enough to reflect sunlight at about 4:15am).  It appeared to be climbing in altitude quickly also. It was headed in a southerly direction and headed into Orion. As it climbed, it seemed to slow and then just lazily move towards the westerly foot (star name = Rigel) of Orion. I pointed this out to a passing stranger who showed no particular interest. As it reached Rigel, it slowed to a stop and reversed course. It was as faint as a smaller satellite at this point, and proceeded slowly in a northern direction past Meissa (Orion’s head), past Mars and to Triangulum. At approximately the star Perseus, the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the east and started to slowly accelerate at first. A couple of women with their 2 children came to sit next to me and I pointed this out to them, they focused in quickly, and the object accelerated  to the point that it went from almost straight above us to the horizon in about 2 seconds while the apparent size grew from a small, dim star to a large size star. I have watched the stars since I was a child, and have studied astronomy for decades. The flight characteristics of this object matched no known aircraft that I have ever heard of as far as fluttering, ability to make an instantaneous 90 degree turn at high velocity, or speed. To go from straight above to beyond the horizon at that altitude constitutes speeds that NASA could not duplicate in their wildest dreams.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

The sky was at dusk, still with a lot of blue, and a mostly full moon was staring me in the face.

My room mate and I were walking from Capital Hill to the Starz Theatre, next to the Denver Pepsi Center to see an advance screening of ""Lions for Lambs"".  We are about 5 minutes from the theater when I first noticed  a strange looking object flying overhead.  It was around 9:36pm and the sky was getting dark enough to see the FAA lights on the aircraft, but still bright enough to make out the shape of nearby helicopters and airplanes coming from the nearby Denver International Airport. The object appeared gray in color, no lights, no visible vapor trails, and no sound emitting from the object. It caught my attention because after looking at the flying object for a few seconds, I realized I couldn't pinpoint what type of flying craft it was.  It seemed to look as if though it was flying in a straight motion, but had the appearance it was rotating and changing its position within the flight path. At one moment I thought I could see wings, but it would quickly change into an unrecognizable shape. I also thought that it could have been a bunch of balloons banded together, but i've seen those before. And helium balloons travel upward, this object was traveling in a ""straight"" pattern, never escalating its height. Another odd factor was that caught my attention was that it was not making any sound. I'd say it was maybe 700-750ft off of the ground, close enough to be able to hear an aircraft sound. I would know that, because other aircraft pass overhead at much higher alltitudes in Denver, and the sounds are easily distinguishable during the time the object was witnessed. And I say 700ft, because the largest building in Denver is the Republic Plaza, which is at 714""ft. And this object was definitely within that range.. The Object traveled silently , and eventually just disappeared out of site. That too seemed also a little strange, because the visibility was still clear enough to see aircraft coming too and from the nearby Rocky Mountains. However this craft seem to loose visibility. As it would move farther, the shape would also still keep changing. This will have been my second time seeing UFO in two different States.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

I am an ex ((deleted--military speciality)) Specialist and I am currently attending college to obtain a ((deleted)) degree in ((deleted--technical field))!   I am somewhat reluctant to even divulge this much and will appreciate absolute anonymity at this time (as I fear what personal and professional ridicule I may face in the scientific community).  Last night 10/25/07 at or around 20:30 hours myself, my fiancé, and my two children witnessed a triangular shaped UFO.   At the peak of this triangle was a shimmering blue light which rays of light seemed to come out in fractioned adamantine way.   The other lights at each peak changed color.  We witnessed this craft move from one side of the sky and then straight down to where it was only maybe 200-300 ft away in the sky.  It emitted no noise and seemed to give of an electromagnetic field.  In addition, our clocks in our van and the lights dimmed. We witnessed what appeared to be a red orb coming from the triangular shaped UFO and then seen several (perhaps ten) aircraft and helicopters heading toward the UFO.  The moon was full a night illumination was extremely high, so we cold literally make out the contours of each craft.   I believe that witnesses in a red truck down the street from us saw this event as well, however, I have not approached them thus far.  I would like to explain these occurrences in more detail in private with an investigator, and perhaps send a drawing of the event and the crafts that we saw.   There is much more, and I would like to discuss via investigator correspondence.  I would prefer email contact at this time.  I have much to explain, and believe me, I’m quite serious about what I saw last night and what I have seen in the past.   Please keep this information to yourself at this time.

Multiple luminous objects sighted in night sky,UK/England,,2006-05-25T00:55:00,light,2 hours,"Occurred : 5/25/2006 00:55  (Entered as : 05/25/06 00:55) Reported: 5/26/2006 5:45:32 AM 05:45 Posted: 7/16/2006 Location: UK/England,  Shape: Light Duration:2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50726.html,"Multiple luminous objects sighted in night sky (Note to receiver: I am sending this again because I saw in the confirmation page that my apostrophes didn't display correctly as I copied and pasted the report from Microsoft Word. Please accept my apologies.)   I would like to report a series of object sightings that took place in the early hours of this past Thursday morning. I would have reported it on Thursday, but unfortunately did not have the time to do so. I observed multiple luminous objects again this (Friday) morning, and will fill out a separate report for this.  As I mentioned in the one previous report I sent to your website (2/19/05), as I was an astronomy student for many years, and still enjoy it as a hobby, I am familiar with the sky and the phenomena it can present, and also know about optical illusions like the one that occurs when you stare at a star for a few seconds and it appears to jump around in place. I also have very good eyesight (20/10). I say these things merely to let you know the type of observer I am.  The sightings began at 0055 on Thursday morning, when I was settling into bed. I sleep with my curtains open, and as my bed is right next to my window, I sometimes look at the sky before I go to sleep. I live out in the Scottish countryside, where there is little light pollution, so we get some fantastic nights when the clouds stay off. This night was a totally clear night and remained so until sunrise, which is very early here in the summer (about 0430 right now, so my viewing window is short). A bright object moving in a southeast-northwesterly direction caught my eye. It was simply a white light the size of a star with no other light on or around it, and it moved slightly faster than an airplane would have at that estimated altitude. It then gave off a bright flash the size of a pinkie fingernail held at arm's length that was about twice the magnitude of Sirius. This lasted 1 second, then it continued on its course until it flew over my house and out of sight. I could hear no noise coming from the sky at this time.  I immediately jumped up and grabbed a pen and paper from the table in my room in case any other objects appeared and I could write down anything noteworthy.  Approximately 1 minute later, I saw two other objects heading in the same direction as this previous object. They were also both the size of a star and consisted of nothing but a point of white light, however, these 2 were lower in magnitude than the first. They flew very close to one another, a distance of 2 dimes held at arm's length. I continued to watch them until they disappeared out of sight.  I did not have my digital camera or my binoculars in my room at this point, but I was so riveted by this that I could not bear to turn my eyes away. I started to need to use the toilet halfway through the night, but did not dare leave then, either. In any case, I knew that my camera's memory was full and its battery was not charged (though its video feature does not produce good video of the night sky anyway).  From this point on, these objects continued to appear, one after the other, again and again that night. Their altitudes and magnitudes varied, but they were all simply points of white light with no position lights that an aircraft would have (I confirmed this the following night with my binoculars). I jotted down details as I went along, but I was working in almost no light, except the light that was coming from outside, so my notes are not as thorough as the next night, when I had an Indiglo light that I turned on whenever I needed to write something, and was able to record the exact time and heading of each object.  After one object had disappeared from view, I would stare at the center of the sky, let everything fall out of focus, and wait for any moving points of light to appear. When one appeared, I would then follow that one until it disappeared, and so on.  The headings of the objects were mainly southeast-northwest and west-east. In total, I counted 14 of these objects and up to 3 unusual (what appeared to be) conventional aircraft.  After the 2nd and 3rd objects I mentioned that appeared together, a new object would appear approximately every 5 minutes for the first half of the group or so (the intervals grew as time went on), and travel in one of the headings mentioned above until it was out of sight. Their movements were straight and precise, though faster than a passenger airplane. Their speeds and magnitudes would vary. One object, the 11th object, was particularly noteworthy. It seemed to appear very low in the sky, at about 10 degrees elevation, then began moving vertically upwards. It did not move straight up, but in a sort of side to side aberrant motion, even one time moving down a little before moving up. After it had reached about 30 degrees in the sky, it travelled straight down again at tremendous speed accompanied by a streak of bright white light, brighter than Sirius. It disappeared after this. It travelled a distance of about from the tip of my thumb to my wrist held at arm's length in less than 1 second.  There was another white object after this, same in appearance as the previous, then I noticed what appeared to be an aircraft flying towards my direction (southeast-northwest) from where the bright object was. As it approached I could hear it, and it had green and red position lights on its right and left wings, respectively. It also had a very large (the size of the head of a tack held at arm's length), pulsating white light on the underside of its fuselage. I have not seen this type of light on an aircraft before, but I am not an expert on aircraft lighting. It flew over my house at an altitude of at least 10,000 feet, I would estimate. I could hear it in the sky after it flew past my house, until its noise faded out of range.  I should note that passenger aircraft are not that common in our area as others, perhaps due to our location relative to the airports in the country as well as the path of other flight routes passing over the country. Our sky never seems to have any contrails in it. An aircraft of any type is uncommon, save for the fighter jets from the nearby air force base, especially at night (I hear the occasional passenger aircraft during the day when they do pass, but almost never night for some reason, even when I am up very late), and therefore one of this appearance was even more bizarre. I was to see what was either the same aircraft making more passes, or 1 or 2 other aircraft of the same type making passes, twice later on that night. It is impossible to say if it was the same craft as the first time I saw it, it passed over my house and I did not have visual contact with it the entire time. I happened to note the time of this craft, and that was at 0204. The second and third planes, the last objects I saw that night, appeared at 0253 and 0258 respectively, both heading west-east. The last white object I saw was at 0235, and I went to bed shortly after 0300.  The number and behaviour of these objects is what astounded me. I have watched meteor showers before and knew they weren't meteors. The fact that the two white objects that in particular displayed remarkable characteristics were identical to the myriad of other white objects makes it hard for me to accept at the present moment that these other objects were conventional aircraft. I should note that there is an air force base, RAF Leuchars, approximately 10 km to the northeast of here. Their fighter jets can be seen and heard flying in the skies here every day, but never at night, and make a considerable noise even when at high altitudes.  The average altitude of the objects was hard to determine. They could have been small objects quite close, or large objects considerably far away. My best estimate would be between 20,000 and 30,000 feet.  I am not here to report conclusively what the objects were, as I cannot say this, but only to pass on this information. I will continue to monitor the sky here and report any other activity.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

Discription of sighting: While aboard a cruise ship, the ship was stopped due to a man overboard alert at approximately 1:00am.  The engines were all stopped and my daughter and I were on the 5th floor, out on the balcony of our room.    We were looking out to sea for any sighs of coastguard help that may be on the way for rescue.  This was approximately 2 and ½ hours after the engines had stopped.  The waters were calm with little wind.  Looking out on the horizon there was a very small amber colored light that seemed stationary.  I pointed this light out to my daughter, and commented that this may be a boat or some vehicle to assist with the search and rescue.   As we were watching this light it changed from an amber dot of light to a white tower shaped light.  At the same time it started to move rapidly towards the ship.  Within a minute it traveled from the horizon to 100-300 feet from the side of the ship and stopped.  The was no noise emanating from the light source. The water however was churning and upset.  The engines of the ship were still at all stop.  The light remained aside the ship, still and hovering for about 40 seconds, then was gone from our view. We remained in this area for 14 hours.  There was an coastguard airplane that flew by several times circling the boat, from far off.  This airplane was nothing like what I saw earlier. 	When morning came I went up on deck and spoke with some other passengers, and they were talking about the man who had jumped overboard, and I found no-one who mentioned this strange occurrence.  I would like to know if there were others that saw what my daughter and I saw. ((COPIED CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) -----Original Message----- From: Peter B.

Cordially,  Peter Davenport, Director National UFO Reporting Center Seattle, WA  ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Hi, The date of the sighting was May 25, 2006.  I did not ask any crew if this had been logged since the event centered around the tragedy of a man jumping overboard.  We were off the ship soon afterward.  A special note: Since we were legally bound to stay in the vicinity of where the man jumped, we were going to be 14 or so hours late arriving in New York.  We were able to make brief phone call to home, but this was monitored, and no details of why we were going to be late were to be given over the phone at that time. Funny?

PD)) Although I myself have not seen a UFO, members of my family and friends have had various types of sightings.  To the best of my knowledge, only one has ever been reported (July 2006 in Virginia).  I feel that perhaps some of these stories may be helpful in collaborating other sightings.  All of these individuals are down to earth, honest, and intelligent, and have no reason to fabricate.  The July 2006 sighting that my son’s half sister and her boyfriend reported:  They saw an extremely large triangular shaped object over her boyfriend’s rural home in Virginia.  It moved slowly, also with no noise.  It was in the evening and had lights. They watched it for several minutes and when it seemed to notice them, it shone a light over them.  They were also completely frightened by it.  The following is a list of other sightings; exact dates are unknown.  Early 60’s – my sister and brother drove over a hill on a farm road outside Dell City, Texas, and stopped when they found gigantic tumbleweed blocking the road.  As they were trying to decide if they could go around it, it suddenly lifted noiselessly off the ground and slowly rose straight up, then shot across the sky.  It happened in broad daylight, they were very frightened by it, and their story has never changed over the years.  1995 – a niece and nephew spotted an extremely large triangular object moving slowly over Las Cruces, NM, and followed it for some time.  It appeared to follow the Rio Grande River, moving from south to north.  It was nighttime, was lighted around the perimeter, and had a low hum.  They also noted several military helicopters in the area that also appeared to be following it.  My nephew is now an English professor at the DABCC of New Mexico State University.  Early 80’s – a good friend who was living on a ranch outside Tatum, NM told me of seeing an extremely large object over their ranch home.  It occurred around dusk, and her teenage daughter and two of her teenage girlfriends also saw it.  As it was told to me, the daughter and a friend were sitting outside waiting for another girlfriend to arrive when the object suddenly came over a nearby hill and hovered over their home.  The girls ran in and told the mother (my friend) who was on the phone with her husband.  My friend told her husband to hold on, and put the phone down while they all went outside to look at it.  As the other girlfriend’s approaching car became visible in the distance, the object suddenly sped over to the car and followed it to the house.  The girls were completely hysterical and as they watched, the object suddenly went straight up and across the sky.  It had some lights and moved noiselessly.  When my friend told my husband and I this story, her husband confirmed it, as he had heard them all screaming while he was holding on the phone.  1998 – another one of my four sisters also encountered something mysterious, possibly a UFO.  She was driving on Interstate 25, from her home just north of Las Cruces, NM to the university for a class she was taking when she noticed a small blue ball flying alongside her car.  At first she thought it was a reflection, but then it started to move around her car.  It continued to follow her car for some distance and it freaked her out completely.  When she got off the Interstate ramp at the University she drove straight to another sister’s home a few blocks away.  This other sister confirms her story and says it took a long time to calm her down.  She and her husband had to drive her home.  August – 2007   My son, who is 36 and a schoolteacher, and his mother-in-law both saw what they describe as a “large invisible object” cross the early evening sky.  They noticed this invisible object because it blocked out the emerging stars as it crossed the sky.  As it moved slowly and noiselessly across the sky, they could note the triangular shape.  They also noted some military helicopters in the area right after the sighting.

That it is near Pearson Int. Airport is surprising to me. The sighting lasted a good 5-6 minutes. When I first saw the object, it was hard to grasp what I was seeing. My second thought was maybe it was some kind of perfectly round and silver coloured balloon, but it could not have been; both by its configuration and its motion. There were 2 lines running horizontally in the mid section as if of windows but of the same silver metallic material. Its look and behaviour suggested intelligence and purpose. It moved silently. When it first caught my eye it was travelling horizontally slowly at approximately 500 to 1000 feet. It was hard to judge height accurately as it was a bright clear sky and there were only thin wispy patches of clouds at around 10,000 feet. As the object passed out of sight over the roof line I moved to continue viewing this phenomenon. As I moved, the object started a rapid right turn; as if to block my view with other roofs, so I moved further. Each time I moved it seemed to attempt avoiding my gaze. Finally I had a full view of the sky at that height. It then suddenly went straight up and within 4-5 seconds had hit the cloud layer and disappeared from view.  As for size I can only guess that it was about the size of a dump truck. Weeks later I noted that a near earth encounter of an asteroid occurred on Sept. 16, and I wonder if this had anything to do with this vehicle being there at that time; perhaps to view the close fly-by. I don’t know. It has remained a profound event to me and I am sure it was either not from our time or not from our planet.

This bridge provides an excellent panoramic view of the sky, perfect for capturing images of clouds.  I considered stopping at home first, to grab my Nikon D50, but I could tell I was testing my wife’s patience as it was. To my everlasting regret, we proceeded with my cheap digital camera that I kept in my car.  We got to the bridge and I walked out to the center of the bridge and took about 20 some pictures. The sky was partly cloudy (25% cloud cover?) but mostly blue sky.  When I finished, I walked back to the other end of the bridge where my wife stood waiting. As I talked to her I noticed two grey spheres flying toward us from the East in tight formation, the one nearest us just above the other.  They flew at a constant speed and trajectory from East to West. I was so excited I forgot that I had a camera in my hand. I kept asking if my wife could see them, but she could not. By the time I finally got my composure, the objects had begun to pass behind an apartment complex in front of us. Unfortunately the next mistake I made was to switch my camera to the movie setting, not realizing that the resolution is so poor it would not pick up the objects. I took a short video which is completely useless.  I have seen many different aircraft in my 43 years on this planet, these objects defy conventional classification. They were not weather balloons, I have seen weather balloons. They were perfect spheres, metallic gray, but not too reflective.  I figured that the reason my wife did not see then was the glare. Despite the partial cloud cover that day, it was actually a very bright day, and I had polarized prescription shades on. As the objects passed through the sky the seemed light gray, as they passed in front of clouds they seemed darker. They disappeared on the Eastern horizon.

I had just gotten the kids to bed and stepped out onto my deck to smoke a cigarette.  It was a very clear night and I was looking up at the clear starry sky when a triangular formation of white, orb like lights flew over my house from behind me.  There were three orbs extending down the left side of the formation, and two down the right, with one at the point.  They made NO noise and flew in perfect formation while turning to my right as they appeared to be doing a large U-turn.  At what seemed to be the apex of their turn, the last orb in the uneven left side separated from the formation and maneuvered itself precisely into the same position on the right side of the formation.  I realized then that these orbs of light were totally independent objects flying in one perfect formation.  I was now trying to focus even more intensely on whatever these orbs were and began to notice that their was slight variations in the intensity of light being generated by the orbs.  The formation continued on its flight path and disappeared from sight when the house blocked my view, completing almost a perfect U-turn. I never heard any noise coming from these objects, and had no real way of judging the distance between them and myself.  A major highway is within sight of the house from the deck.  The path these objects appeared to take almost makes me wonder if they saw the highway and decided to turn around in the other direction.  I stood there for sometime waiting for them to come back, hoping they were flying in a circle so I could see them again and be more prepared for what I saw the first time.  But nothing came within sight for the next 30 minutes I stood there waiting. In the days to come, I contacted a customer of mine who is an Air Traffic Controller at the Lancaster Airport.  I asked him if they had any reports of strange lights in the sky Christmas Eve and was told they did not.  He did ask why, and I briefly explained.  His analytical disbelief in what I saw prevented me from sharing this experience with anyone but my wife and kids.  A few close friends were told whenever the topic of ghosts and UFO’s came up, which is how I received the link to this website.

I was descending from the flatlands, a farming area where lots of wheat is grown, into an ancient Columbia River bed where the Columbia had flown some several millions of years ago, when some event caused it to redirect it's flow to where it currently runs. Along the top of a ridge which runs north and south of my easterly direction. I saw an object fly over the highway in front of me approximately 200 yards in front of me. It was flying no more that I would guess 20 feet above the ridge which was approximately another 20 feet above where the highway was cut into it to descend into the river bed. The object was traveling approximately 40 to 50 MPH when it passed in front of me traveling Left to right (North to South). The object appeared to be made up of two identical balls, maybe 5 to 6 feet in diameter made out of either metal or glass. Very shiney and definetely solid in appearence. One ball followed the other. The two balls were connected to each other with a metal assembly which ran straight frome the center rear of the front ball, connected to the center front of the rear ball, kind of like this: O--O. The proportions of my example are a little off. The middle connecting assembly appeared to be about 8 feet, giving an overall length of approximately 18 to 20 feet, and definetely solid construction. The whole sighting lasted about two seconds.  It is possible it may be a misidentification of a helicopter, but I have never seen one in this configuration and I could detect no sign of the rotors with my sunglasses on and off.

We are both 18, in honors classes, and have never seen something like this before. We don’t believe in UFO’s but like to keep an open mind. She was laying on the backseat when she told me to look at the sky. I didn't quite understand what she was talking about, but she repeated herself and when I looked up through the window, the sky flashed and the whole sky was illuminated, but there was no sound. It lasted for almost a second and it appeared that the eastern part of the sky was where the illumination’s origin was from. The light wasn't as bright as daytime illumination, but was a little dimmer, most closely resembling the lighting conditions found not quite at dusk, but around 5pm when the sky begins to dim. It looked exactly like sheet lightening but there was no sound of thunder and it illuminated the entire night sky. After this last flash, emergency vehicles sirens seemed to appear all around us, gradually moving east. This period of constant sirens lasted for between 5-10 minutes. When I further asked her about the flash, she said that the first time she told me to look, there had been three flashes in quick succession, with the first two flashes having a shorter interval than the interval between the second and third. Three flashes again occurred after this, with a gap of around 15-30 seconds between the two sets. The flashes were again irregularly spaced according to her, but occurred very quickly. She said that I had seen the very last flash in the last sequence. The flashes illuminated the entire night sky and for this reason other people on the road must have seen them.

According to Heavens Above, a very bright (-8 magnitude) flare from Iridium 49 was visible from my location. It was to be seen in the ENE at 39 degrees elecation, starting at 22:06:06. The distance of the flare center from my location was 2.7 km.  The flare (a reflection of the sun) came right on time, but because my eyes were fixed on a spot a little higher up and a little further north, I missed the beginning of the flare. I did catch it in the corner of my eye and looked directly at it when it was at its brightest. The flare was quite spectacular but it faded quickly. The duration of the flare was no more than 2 to 3 seconds.  Less than 2 seconds after the flare had faded from view, a bright and very fast moving light came from the north, heading south. It flew horizontally less than 5 degrees below where the flare had been. I saw the moving light first in that location and followed it until it was obscured by a tree. The entire event lasted no more than 2 seconds.  The object (light) had the general appearance of a meteor but it looked like no meteor I had ever seen and I have seen my share of them. Besides, meteors do not fly parallel to the ground. The head was about the diameter of three Jupiters (or about 2 arc minutes in angular size. The front was convex and the back was concave. Two very  thin ""streamers"" came off the end points on the concave end. The color of the light was white with a yellowish tint. It remained steady in intensity over the brief duration.  I estimated the angular distance between the location of the Iridium flare (and the appearance of the object) and where the tree blocked the object as about 45 degrees. The object traversed that distance in 1.5 seconds. These facts give the object an angular speed of 30 degrees per second. That it ten times faster than the Space Shuttle flying over CA for a landing in FL, and 60 times faster than the angular speed of the ISS (International Space Station) when it passes overhead.  The brief duration of my observation leaves me with the impression that the object was not at a very high altitude, although I have no facts to support that impression. If the object was as low as 10 000 feet, my calculations show that it flew at a speed of 1.26 miles/second, or more than 4500 miles/hour. If it was at any higher altitude, its speed would have been proportionately faster.  Then there is the element of coincidence that I find difficult to accept. How can two visually spectacular but otherwise totally unrelated events occur in the same patch of sky at essentially the same time. What are the odd??  What did I see. Can someone enlighten me?",2007-06-12T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

The sky was bright blue and the only clouds to be seen were two thin, wispy clouds at a very high elevation.  It was a very bright and sunny day. As I looked at the sky, I noticed a flying craft appear directly in front of where I was viewing.  I had not noticed the craft at all in my peripheral vision. The craft seemed to be flying at about the elevation I see helicopters flying at frequently.  Maybe a little higher.  The craft had the look like it was surrounded by a haze, and it appeared to be a solid dark grey color.  It also looked like it was flat on the bottom and hill shaped on top.  I did not see any wings or propellers on the craft.  It was flying in an easterly direction, and it appeared to be going pretty slow. Slower than I've ever seen an airplane fly.   It appeared to be gliding along.  I didn't really think much about the craft, figuring it was probably a helicopter or something, until it disappeared right in front of me.  I observed the craft for probably a couple of seconds, and then it appeared to fade and disappear completely.  It did not reappear.

Traveling back home by car from Key West (towards Miami) my husband and I saw a strange object in the sky ahead of us. We calculated its size to be anything from 15 feet in length, in a horizontal position.  It looked cylindrical in shape, with 'fins' at one end. It was a bright white color - perhaps reflecting the sun, against a clear blue sky. We didn't see any lights on it. As we drove further along our route, towards the object, we could see that it seemed to be in a static position approximately 500-1000 ft up, directly above what looked like a radio tower. There was no sound or motion observed at all, and eventually we left it behind - above the 'radio tower'. We could not see any tether, but we are left wondering whether this could have been a simple weather balloon or similar man-made device? If so, others may have reported seeing this same object there in the past. Unfortunately, , being at the end of our holiday trip, we had no film left in the camera to photograph it.

From where we are, they appeared to be over Elko, Nevada,  to the East and South of the Airport.    We have often watched incoming airplanes at night and they appear to stay in nearly the same place for long periods although they are coming closer.    Their white lights just seem to gradually get larger.    The red lights never seemed to get larger or smaller as we watched.       When I hold my hand sideways, they were about 3 fingers high “over” the town.     Size  close to my smallest fingernail with arm outstretched.      I hollered at my husband to come see,  and we watched for awhile. We each went back inside several times to get the binoculars and to locate the scope,  and to get the camcorder and such.     ( One of us watching the lights while the other was inside).      The camcorder’s battery was completely dead.     I tried to get a photo with the cell phone , but that didn’t work either.      The lights stayed stationary for probably 16 minutes or so.     We also turned on the C.B. radio to see if any  truckers traveling on Interstate 80 were talking about them.  (nothing).     The last time that I went inside, the lights left while my husband watched.      He said that they appeared to go slowly higher and then towards the South East and out of sight.     I was only inside about a minute,  so they were not moving real slow.   I have watched airplanes leaving that stayed in sight for an hour or more.     I looked at the clock  and wrote  down the time at that point.  It was 11:16 P.M. Pacific time.            We had seen flares on the night of February 21, 2008, about 90 miles North of Elko.   The flares were orange, and there were 8 or 9 sonic booms as some fighter jets shot something out of the sky.       Something lit up brigh! tly behi nd a cloud, and it was “daylight” momentarily.    (We were driving on the highway and had pulled over to watch).      There is an airbase close by that area of Idaho, so it could have been some sort of training drill.      Our faces, particularly our eyes, were puffy, red and sore the next day. (My eyes stayed swollen for over a month).   We looked as though we had a sunburn, but without the usual outline of our sunglasses.     That same day,  Feb. 21,  early in the morning,  Wells, Nevada (50 miles East of Elko) had a 6.0 Earthquake.     The flares on the  night of Feb. 21, drifted downwards and Westerly and they sort of glowingly flickered like flares do.     The red lights on June 14 were different than those. We can’t rule out some sort of celebration for flag day (however, NOT fireworks).    Maybe two VERY large, lighted, anchored balloons?      There is also a  NOAA station here.      Do the weather balloons have large red lights and get released at night?      Would they stay stationary for so long?       We don’t know.     We have watched weather balloons being released before,  but in the daytime,  and they moved off rather quickly.         I read where you mentioned the space shuttle and International Space Station.     Maybe that’s what it was.    Well, anyway, that’s it for now.      We wanted to report it so as to validate if someone else reports the same thing.

I immediately noticed a large planet-sized object directly behind the flight line, appearing to the West.  I live on an air force base, right in front of the runway on the 8th floor.  My apartment has large windows in each room that face the runway and the mountains beyond it.   I viewed the object for about 20 minutes.  By 1:25 a.m., it had faded out of sight.  I used a Runton Trail Buster compass to determine its Western location.  The object resembled the moon, but it was about two and one-half times larger than the moon.  It had the luminescence of the moon and did not move about quickly or erratically.  It hovered  behind the flight line, changing from a dull beige glow to a reddish glow, almost like the glow you would see during an eclipse, when the moon passes in front of another planet.  There were large markings on the face of this large planet-size object.  Although I could make these markings out through binoculars, the definition of the picture was unclear when I zoomed in with my Panasonic DMZ LZ3 camera.  However, I took several pictures of it – several still photos and one moving picture, using the flight line lights and a red tower light as a frame of reference. I steadied my arm on the window sill to keep the object from moving; however, it was difficult to keep my arm completely still.  I had to break away from my line of vision with the object to write out a diagram of the large markings I saw on the face of this planet.  I could only see these markings through the binoculars.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACE OF THE PLANET:  The markings looked like the outline of a scroll-like antennae on either side of a head with an arched body.  Two lines projected out from both sides of the body, ending in two circles (like hands).  At the bottom of this body, a small projecting line ended in another very large circle (like feet).  When I kept going back to view the object with my binoculars, I noticed the picture on its face had now tilted, and the patina of the object took on a reddish glow.  The tilt:   The scroll-like head changed from a 12:00 position to a 9:00 position while the large circled (feet) changed from 6:00 position to 4:00 position.  When I went back to my paper to continue filling out the drawing, and then returned to the window, the object was no longer there.  I did not actually see it vanish or blink out.  I only noticed that the last time I went back to view it with the binoculars, the patina had appeared to change color, its face had shifted position to a tilt, and it wasn’t glowing as brightly.  Regarding the actual shape of the object, it was almost like looking at three-fourths of the moon.  It wasn’t a complete circle.  It was as if the northwest portion of the circle had been blotted out by the darkness.  The edges delineating the object were fuzzy looking, where it melded into the surrounding darkness.  I have seen this object twice before.  The first time I saw it, it was at 11:00 p.m., in a more northwesterly direction.  It was more prominent then.  It also glowed a little brighter and appeared to be a little larger than it was tonight.  Then it appeared to be three times the size of the moon instead of two and a half times the size of the moon and much lower in the sky.  I viewed it for about 15 minutes.  At that time, it had actually sunk down behind the mountain range, northwest of the base.  However, I thought it might be some kind of lunar eclipse until I noticed the moon’s position the following night and how different it looked from what I had seen.  The second time I saw the planet-size object, it was at 4:30 a.m.  It was located in the same location, northwest, directly over the mountain range.   It slowly sank behind the same mountain range it had sunk behind before, during the previous 11:00 to 11:30 p.m. sighting.  This time I woke my husband up (who completely denies the existence of UFO’s).  He thought it was the moon, but the moon appears higher up in the sky in a more southerly direction and glows differently than this object glowed.  Due to the consistency of the location of these sightings, I believe there may be some sort of alien base within the mountain range to the northwest of the flight line.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

There's a lot of cloud cover tonight, so they must have been flying below the clouds. I didn't hear any noise or anything. I could easily have missed them/ it if I hadn't caught it out of the corner of my eye. I'm pretty creeped out by this. I'm sorry, I don't know if I feel comfortable giving my whole name in that contact section. Maybe that erodes at the credibility of all this, but this is really weird.

I noticed how the stars were out and I was looking at the Little Dipper, I was facing south looking up.  Below the Little Dipper were two stars shining, to the left of those stars was a very bright object. The bright object was placed like:  X (Little dipper here)      . Star        . Star  		     *  object   ((NUFORC Note:  Design did not survive the transfer from the report form to our database.  PD)) As I stood there admiring the sky, the bright star like object started moving down and to the right a bit in a very precise motion ( in the shape of the letter L).   To make sure it wasn’t my eyes playing tricks on me I called my husband to the door of the studio.   I said look, at that bright object.  Is it moving to you?  He stated, wow, yes.    Soon after he sat down in the studio.  I continued to watch this object for the next two and a half hours. (9:00 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. central time).  It was a clear cool night, no winds.   During this time the object made small circles in the vicinity it was placed, it also moved up and down, left and right.  There is a very tall tree in the neighbors yard that I stood behind to watch the object.  I placed myself against my studio and watched the object move left and right up and down and at one point did a small circular move through the tree limbs.  I also stood in the back yard away from all trees and watched this object do the same movements.  My husband came out a couple times to view this object and he did say it was something moving up there.   Once we both saw what looked like a red flashing light from one side of the object. (Unlike any human aircraft).  I also observed several commercial airplanes doing their normal flights.  Non of them seemed to be aware or concerned that this object was there.  I could hear the commercial planes go by, I could hear the low faint rummble of the jet engines.  The planes were quite high.  I heard nothing from this object that seemed to hover the small city of Auburn.  I also kept an eye on the surrounding stars to see if there was a change in brightness or positions.  No change noticeable to the human eye. (Of course I did not have a telescope, I will be getting one now.)  I went into the studio for a bit to warm up, always looking out the window or door  to see if there was any change in what this object.  Within one hour the object had moved up to a  parallel position to the star on its  right.  Closer to 11:00 p.m. it looked like the object was fading, moving straight back, not up or down. The object began to dim, very slowly.  By 11:30 p.m. it looked as if it were a small spot in the sky, unlike it’s first bright lit form.  The movements I am describing from the object were not large movements.  Small and precise. While observing this object I will state again that no other stars had any of the features or characteristics  this object had and the stars never repositioned themselves.  I wanted to report it but because I did not have knowledge of what to do I did a little research on-line to find this website.

We would like to have the witness re-submit his report, using one report form per sighting.  PD)) Lights in the sky and a shiny object that went behind a cloud, cloud disappeards after a while I work in CampHill, get back from work at various times of the day since I have flexible work hours. I drive from my office on Erford Road to N. Front St across the Harvey Taylor bridge. I've had 3 experiences that I found strange worth reporting, particularly after reading some of the reports from Harrisburg, PA.  1) About 2 weeks back from (12/29/2006), driving back from work around 7'ish in the evening, I had just entered Harvey Taylor bridge and I was looking at the sky in front towards the state capitol and I see a set of lights in the sky, bright white lights in the distance off to the right side of capitol. My first thought was that it must be lights up in the mountain and then realized the mountains are to my left and I was still wondering what the light was, continuing to drive looking at the road and the sky, by the time I was getting towards the Front St. intersection I could see the lights were turning right to left and just disappeared. By the time I got to the intersection and had a red I was thinking it must have been a plane since there's an airport close by, but I've never seen that many lights and they were very bright and gave the appearance it was in far off and it disappeared, since I have to use 2nd st to get to my apartment on Front St and there are buildings on 2nd I couldn't see anything more. When I parked my car at the apartment I scanned the sky in the direction in which I had seen the lights hoping to see something but there was nothing, and I thought nothing of it.  2) Today (12/30/2006)I was coming back from my weekly gorcery at Giants (Camp Hill), I was driving back on Harvey Taylor bridge, I had just entered the bridge and again a set of lights this time towards the left side of capitol and a lot closer than what I saw last time. I could count about 6 distinct bright white lights, I couldn't make out any shape as I continued driving I'm looking at the sky and the road ahead, it's impossible to stop on Harvey Taylor without getting yourselves killed because a lot of people speed, I had covered about 3/4th of the bridge and the ligths as far as I could make out were stationary and then the lights just disappeared. I kept scanning the sky for anything a plane, anything that could explain the lights as I was driving on 2nd and again when I got to my apartment and parked.  I usually see planes in the evening sky from probably the airport close by but they are identifiable becuase you see them, there are the lights which are not unusually bright and you can see them move steadily and then you hear them and if you keep looking you can see them go away from you.  I have lived in this area for close to 4 years now, I think I have a fairly good idea of the Harrisburg skyline, I usually bike or walk and many I've taken my bike across the brige to look at the skyline from the other side of the river. I think I can say those lights were not from any building, even though the lights I saw was low in the sky.  I'm not an expert and I have nothing to gain from this, just found it a little strange and I thought I should report. Coming to the third experience, I have not too much to report. I live in a high rise apartment on the front st, overlooking the river with my apartment windows giving a beautiful view of the mountains in the distance. Some time in the past 2 weeks (it was a weekend because I was home) probably around 2-3 PM, I was going in to the kitchen to make some coffee. There's a small window in the kitchen facing the mountain, I just instinctively looked outside, and saw a small patch of wispy clouds in the sky over the mountains, probably what made me stop and continue looking at the clouds was a shining disc like object just at the edge of the clouds. I kept staring, thinking that I should go to my living room window because it gives a better view but I couldn't move and kept staring and I saw the object disappear behind the clouds. I went in to my bed room pulled out my binoculars (I've got a 15*70 Porro Prism Celestron) from the shelf and to look the clouds hoping the object would reappear. The clouds was not too much and the sky was really clear and blue, just a little and wispy, but I could see nothing but the clouds. So I put my binocular down, pulled my chair to the window and just sat there staring at the clouds, the strange thing was the clouds disappeared totally, usually you see the clouds moving with an air current but this just disappeared and the sky was totally clear. I sat there in my chair looking out the window and after a while I just went back to my routine life.  I am an amateur astronomer and I look at the sky with my naked eye and at times with my binoculars (harrisburg city is not the best place to look at night sky). I have no idea about what I saw, just that it was not normal that I'm used to.  I am an engineer and I work in a field where my main skills are problem solving, I would rate myself as a person with a scientific outlook.  I did not bother to look at the exact time and I did not even bother to note down the date, becuase I still hope that there is a simple explanation and maybe what I was just something very ordinary and easily explained, probably it was just that I found it strange. What brought me to this site was to try and see if there was anyone reporting anything like this in Harrisburg and google search brought me here, I thought for a long time before I decided to post what I saw.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,40.307082581453635,-76.8305888471178

We were on the Southside of Birmingham and were driving up Arlington Avenue South to cut through to Montclair Road via Carlisle Road.  We live in the Crestwood/Irondale area of Birmingham.   The weather was in the low 60's and overcast and a bit gusty and there was rain in the forecast.  Not really unusual for the south but for some reason it just felt odd almost the way it feels before a thunderstorm or even a tornado.  When we turned onto Montclair from Carlisle, we drove just a short distance approximately a quarter of a mile to where the Pilgrim Church is and we noticed through the trees and up to the left a flash of a very bright blueish light that lasted maybe a second.  We both expected to hear thunder or a boom from a transformer but we heard nothing.  As we continued on maybe another quarter of a mile, we were approaching a red light and intersection.  It should be noted that there is a ridge to the left that runs parallel to Montclair and at the intersection there is a post office to the left and just up from there is another building that houses the Orthopedic Specialists.   This ridge is mostly residential.  As we were about to pass under the red light (speed limit is 25)  to our surprise the brilliant blue light reappeared on the ridge just behind the Orthopedic Specialists building. We were maybe 500 feet from it so you could see it very clearly.  What we saw was truly amazing and we have never ever seen anything like it.   The light was a brilliant plasma blue. It seemed to pulse, it was bright but not blinding.  The cylinder was very large, approximately about 50 - 60 feet across and about 100-120 feet tall.  There seemed to be a cylinder within a cylinder.  The outermost cylinder had a very 3D appearance and the best way to describe it...a Hexagon.  It was slowly rotating counterclockwise.  The innermost cylinder was smooth but it didn't really seem to rotate. You could pretty much see through the cylinder but because of the light it definately had a hazy glow to it.   The cylinder extended up towards what appeared to be a circular stack of levels starting with the lowest level closest to the cylinder, which was made up of rectangle shaped lights arranged around the perimeter of possibly the bottom of a craft.  It too was rotating in a counterclockwise direction.  The next  3 levels stepped up and out and disappeared into a very dense low hanging cloud.  You absolutely could not see what was up in the clouds and I have to say that the cloud was unusually low and very dense and despite how windy it was seemed to just hang there.  The craft just hovered there and it lasted approximately 5 seconds.    Then just like a light switch it turned off.  There was no way to tell if the craft disappeared or if the light just turned off.  We continued traveling down Montclair and trying to put our minds around what we saw.  We had probably travelled less than a quarter of a mile and that took less than a minute when just like before it appeared again.  It seemed to be travelling very slowly along the top of the ridge.  When the light appeared it just seemed to hover over the houses along the top part of the ridge. Again, concealed in the cloud. This time we pulled over and rolled down the window.  There was no noise, no whir, no sound at all.  All of a sudden all of the lights to the left of Montclair Road where the craft was hovering all went out.  The entire neighborhood was cast into darkness.  Of course, curiosity getting the best of us, we decided to turn up into the neighborhood towards the area that the craft might be to see if by some chance we might catch a closer glimpse.  All of the houses were dark, no street lights....very eery but it was obviously gone.   As we made a U turn to go back down towards Montclair there was a very clear view of another ridge that is a few miles away and we could see transformers blowing one after another, maybe 5 in all . The saddest part is I actually had my camera in the backseat, why o why didn't I pull myself together enough to get out my camera and record the event.  At any rate, this was absolutely the most amazing thing that either of us have seen or experienced.    I have to say I have always been a skeptic but I just have no idea what this could have been but it definately seemed to have some purpose or intention in what it was doing.  What would that be?  I have no idea.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,33.48091579651941,-86.77946934404284

Hi, this happened about 2 months ago, a UFO-type phenomena seems like a logical explanation.  This occurred in Cheney, WA on December 13th, give or take a day. I am a junior at EWU. Myself, my roommate and 2 friends were sitting in the living room, we were all watching one friend play a video game, but the volume was really low, almost mute, and we had my computer playing music at a moderate level.    I am sitting closest to my room, and all of the sudden I start to hear this weird sound.  It starts from nothing, and it sounds like a giant loud machine, like reactor is the best way to describe it, and it came in sound waves and each wave got louder and louder, like  pulsating vibrating waves, and the whole time I could not tell if this was in my mind until I looked at my friends. All of my friends jaws were dropped,  they could hear it to.  At the point of almost deafening, it then made just like a quick split second space type sound. Then a voice asked in perfect English “WHERE AM I?” and clicked out with the same split second space sound and it was done, all of my friends agree that the voice was not in any way, shape, or form a human voice, I definitely agree.  The best way to describe it is like a creepy, confused little creature, but in a way sounded harmless.   We all agree that it happened in my room, which scares the hell out of me. I emailed a guy who I thought was an expert and he tried to tell me it was a ghost sighting or something, but I cannot stress enough of how much like a creature it was.  I just really want a logical explanation, it was a very scary event, probably only lasting 10 seconds tops, and I am sure you have heard some sightings and events in your day, and all of this happened, even though it sounds really crazy. Do you hear of this often? Or do you know what the hell happened to us?  Thank you very much. Another question I have is why my room, my apartment, we live on the 3rd floor of a college apartment complex.  Prior to the event, probably a month or two I had been looking up UFO stuff pretty tuff, so when it happened, and when I started thinking about why it happened in our apartment, that scared me.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,47.4313,-117.6292

My attention was drawn to what initially appeared to be a shooting star.  The first thing I saw was a flare of light moving at an extremely high rate of speed.  I was essentially facing directly north when I first sighted it.  The object was traveling downward and to my right (east).  As I watched the object it appeared to change course slightly - flaring to a more horizontal trajectory that was now headed generally southeast.  As the object changed course, I could clearly see a dimly lighted boomerang shaped object.  The delta shape was covered with soft, orange colored lights.  The fact that I was on a lighted residential street, along with the speed of the object and relatively soft lights eminating from it, made it hard to distinguish more detail.  While it was not possible to see in great detail, there was no question of its perimeter form.  From the time the object changed course until it vanished from sight was no more than 2 to 3 seconds.  It was traveling at approximately the same speed one might associate with a shooting star - extremely fast.  It was a fairly clear night with gusty winds.  As the object receded out of sight, I listened intently for any indication of noise.  There was none.  Given the incredible speed it was traveling, I would have expected a sonic boom.  There was only silence.  I was by myself, walking the dog at the time of the sighting.  While the initial flare of light may have caused others to look up, the remainder of the sight time happened so fast and with such minimal illumination, that it would have taken someone in nearly the same circumstances I was in, to see the same thing.  It happened so fast and was obscure enough that it was one of those instances where you had to be at the right place and right time.  This sighting took place approximately 45 miles northwest of Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City, SD.  I am accustomed to seeing both commercial and military air trafiic in the area at all hours of the day and night.  So, it seemed logical that there was a military connection given a flying object and proximity of an air base.  However, to travel across 1/4 of the night sky in 4 to 5 seconds is simply impossible by conventional standards.  The speed at which it left my sight was so great, it's difficult to effectively describe.  The distance away and size of the object are difficult to quantify.  Given that it started out appearing as a shooting star the perception was that it was near the edge of the earth's atmosphere.  However, as it corrected its course and leveled out, it appeared to be within 3 to 5 miles and roughly the same size, or slightly larger than that of a commercial aircraft.  I tried to call the control tower at the air base but was not able to find anyone willing to look into this.  I'm not surprised.  I would guess that UFO sightings are almost always met with a high level of suspicion and doubt.  I have tried to logically explain what I saw and am left with nothing that makes any sense at all.  I am a college graduate and active, local businessman.  My practical nature begs for an explanation that meets with some earthly criteria.  While I am intrigued at the prospect of extra terrestial life, I would best be described as an interested skeptic.  Although much of what happened defies explanation, I do know this - I clearly saw an object appear and disappear within 4 to 5 seconds.  During that time, I clearly saw a boomerang or delta shape that was covered with soft glowing orange lights.  What I saw was moving at a speed that so far exceeds what we are familiar with that it simply was not an aircraft as we know it.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,44.47293571428572,-103.86063571428572

It was so evenly lit I thought it had about 6 portholes evenly light that were reflecting off the water. Before I actually got stoped I got a signal to proceed. I started picking up speed and proceeding. The lake and the boat then disapeared behind a refinery that is on the lake. I didn't think much more of it until I got on the other side of the refinery. I looked over towards the lake I saw the same thing I had seen before but It was obviously not on the because there is brush and trees so you actually cant see the lake. It was a little closer and moving as fast as I was about 25 mph. I realized that what I thought was a reflection was actually some sort of underlighting. Not very bright but noticable.

When driving to my house in West Seattle, my sister (who was traveling south on Interstate 5) sent me a text message telling me about 2 objects in the sky that seemed to be flying towards one another. She made a joke about the fact that it looked like a jet intercepting some kind of UFO. I brushed her comments off at first, assuming she just saw jets or something typical of the Seattle area.  About 10-15 minutes later, after she had arrived, I was looking outside in my backyard and saw the exact same type of objects she saw.  There were several of these high altitude objects in the sky over the next 20 minutes or so. Some looked like jets, but a few did not. I'm no expert here, so for all I know these could be extremely high jets or it could just be a NORAD exercise or something, but someone said I should post it here so I did.

Once I arrived there were several people standing by the road looking up at the UFO. It was round about the size of two football fields. The color was much like the center of an egg. The UFO remained stationary. Every few seconds a small UFO would drop from the center of the mother ship. It would hover for a moment then dart of at a high rate of speed. This was taking place within a mile of one of the highest security military bases in the country and within 12 miles of another secure base. I call dispatch and ask if they would call both bases and let me know it they knew what this UFO was and if they could see it. I knew the one base could not help but see it. Being only one mile from the base they would have been able to see same from there flight tower. After all sources had been checked no one admitted to seeing or knowig anything about the UFO. I did not think much of it at the time for one simple reason. There was no way the two bases could not have know about this UFO. When I call this a UFO I mean it in the truest form. I did not know what it was, but given its location I knew good and well the military knew what it was. Because of this I took it to be something from earth. Now after all these years I still believe it was not from outer space. It was an amazing sight. To see this huge round stationary UFO located at about 1,000 ft with these small round UFOs dropping from under the belly of the mother UFO and darting off at great speed in every direction was a sight to behold. What was it, I have no idea, but I do know this much. The nearest base could not help but see this object. The point is they knew what is was snd were not about to tell lawenforcement anything.

I remember this because my brother had been sent to Iraq for Operation Provide Comfort.  It was dark, and it was nearing the fall of the year.  My sister (11), myself (12), and my mother (37) were all traveling north on Highway 65 in Greenbrier, AR on the way to a friend’s home. < sighting location 35.2xxxxxx,-92.3xxxxx > We were approaching the center of town which had been marked with a new stop light.   As we approached, I saw a giant ball of amber colored light to the Northwest.  It was about 45 degrees from the horizon and about 300 feet out and must have been 30’ in diameter or more.  I exclaimed to my mother “oh God, what is that?”  I remember having the fear of missile attacks from the war that had been taking place.  My mother and my sister both looked on in awe and my mother stated franticly that she didn’t know what it was.  After about 10 seconds, the orb started to produce “offspring” which went from dim blips to equivalent phenomenon of the original.  They all just popped out and hovered there over the city.  We were all panicked.  After about 8 more seconds, the orbs appeared to shoot straight out to the North at undeterminable speeds.  In a fraction of a second they were at a great distance but then hovered for another moment in formation and then split apart and disappeared into the night again.  We continued to see the orbs in single and sometimes double formations several times as we continued to our friend’s home.  We didn’t have a cellular phone at the time, but as soon as we arrived at the friend’s home, we called a mutual friend who was a hobbyist astronomer.  He too was able to witness the objects and called in an inquiry on all of our behalf to the Air Force.  We along with the other friends (totaling 7 on this event) witnessed them for the next couple of hours sporadically in the sky. 	The next time that I witnessed these objects was about a year later with my friend.  We were playing football in his yard around August of 92.  This was the most peculiar time that I have ever been subject to these types of happenings.  He lives in the same proximity of the first sightings. < Sighting Location 35.2xxxxx,-92.3xxxxx >  As we were tossing the ball back an forth at dusk, there were some scattered patchy clouds in the lower atmosphere, but there was still good visibility.  The next sequence of events is almost unbelievable to myself, and I was very near leaving them out because I want to be taken seriously; however in the name of truth and science I will include them.  I felt an eerie numb come over me and I fell to my knees with a dumb gaze at the Northern sky.  My friend was baffled and ran over to me and was asking “what’s wrong with you dude?”  He was curious as to why I had stopped playing and fell down and was gazing up.  I was paralyzed, and my stare was fixed directly above his neighbor’s home in a small patch of clouds.  He shook me by the shoulder telling me to get up with some concern on his face.  I managed to speak.  I was able to raise my right arm and point to the focal position that I was fixed on and simply said “watch”.  He looked where I told him to look.  Nothing appeared at first and he started asking expectantly “what…what do you want me to see?”  It was no sooner than he had spoken the words that the first one appeared.  A giant orb of amber light appeared over the home, just popping out of the low level cloud formation.  My friend looked on in terror and in wonder and begged me to tell him what it was.  I was still numb and stuck from a fear or reaction that I cannot to this day explain.  Moments later, two more lights formed out of the originator and they hovered in formation by it’s side.  They were in the clouds and caused illumination to the particles around them which created an orange glowing haze.  The objects came very close to us, and this is the closest that! I have ever been to them in all of my experiences.  My friend had his 4 wheeler in the front yard, and he yanked me up off of the ground as he panicked and tried to get us away.  The 4 wheeler had worked all day, but when we tried to start it, no ignition took place.  After about 5 failed attempts to start the ATV, he dragged me inside the house.  He got a gun, and called our friends mother to help us.  We huddled down in the house until she arrived.  My friend’s mother came to get us later and was amused by the story, until a short time later when she saw what we had told her about.  I have continued to see these things, and can document every sighting location.  There are at least 4 other significant events that I would be glad to go over if the interest is there.  Please let me know if you can put this to use.  I am very interested and willing to put forth some effort to document these happenings as I am sure that they can be reproduced.  The areas that I am familiar with have been sites where many of my friends and family have witnessed this phenomenon spanning over almost 20 years.  My friend’s mother has a friend that has recorded these things on VHS, and I believe that they can be observed possibly with time lapsed equipment or intelligent motion sensing equipment.  I personally do not have the means alone to make such productions yet, however I do believe that this is achievable.  Thank you for your time in advance, and I can assure you very credible witnesses and contacts are easily produced.  One interesting fact about the region where I grew up (and I don’t know if this has/had something to do with the frequency but there used to be subterranean nuclear missile silos within just a couple of miles in both directions of the indicated areas.  Although these had been removed for several years before “my” sightings, I feel that it is significant that I mention these because they are the only other source of any sort of combined or specific energy known to be out of the ordinary.

It was about 8:30 or 9:00 and I saw something moving downward at approximately a 45 degree angle at a pretty good speed. It was in the distance in front of me and I thought that it was a plane that was going to crash. As I drove on, it slowed its downward movement and leveled off. I could not figure out what it was. As I kept going I came over a hill and there it was, hovering in the sky off to my right, over a field. It was not very high up, I could see it very well. It was shaped like a saucer, the traditional flying saucer, with blue, red, and green lights that flashed back and forth on the bottom. It made no noise at all. It just hovered there approximately 100' up in the air. It was a warm clear night and I just stopped my car and watched it. It eased across the road and hovered there on the driver side out over another field very close. I rolled down my windows to try to see if it was making any noise and it wasn't. It baffled me. What could it be? I looked from every angle I could think of, watched it and could come up with no answers. It finally began to move and it eased off to the east and went down behind an old barn. I decided I had seen enough and went on home. I am a college graduate, hold a graduate degree, and pastor a church, but I still can't believe what I saw that night. I wish someone could explain it to me. I have told only a few people and my wife and kids always tease me about it, but hey, I still never go by that field today that I don't relive that night. It wasn't scary. It was just a mystery that I guess I will have to wait and let God explain to me. The bible says that "" I have sheep in other pastures that you no not of"" maybe that scripture applies to this.

I was in the army and I was in charge of  a guard force of  5 men.  I was the sergeant in charge, we were on guard duty guarding an ammo point(Bunkers).I was sitting in the hummer with my driver parked at the entrance of the ammo point facing towards the main road that lead to the ammo point entrance. As we were sitting there we both saw green and red lights ,that looking  back it now it was like there were spinning. At first my driver thought that it was some kind of firing range and we were seeing tracer rounds, the army uses red tracers when they are conducting night fire exercises, but the only problem was the spot we saw the lights was a camping area for the non-commissioned officer school, I knew this because that was the area I went to school before I became a sergeant, and another thing is that why would someone be firing live rounds near an ammo point. So, I radioed in to the command center and notified the officer of the guard and advised them I was going to go investigate the lights. So I had my soldiers load there weapons and be on high alert and my driver and myself started up the hummer and rolled to the area we saw the lights, we used a spot light and we could not see anything and we identified ourselves and no one replied to or calls. There was a quit eerie feeling so after a few minutes we returned back to the entrance to the ammo point and it was not long before the officer of the guard showed up and we told him what we saw and he told us to make a report and that was the last thing I remember about that incident.

One night myself and a couple friends were off-roading in the foothills behind Millpond in Bishop, Ca. We stopped at one point to look down into the valley to look at the lights coming from the music festival that happens every year there.  We noticed a light coming from farther back into the hills and all noticed how the light neither changed position, nor intensity as it came towards us. It was distant enough that we could not make out any detail as to what it was or its size, but just upon casual observation, it was obvious it was not a car or anyone carrying a light.  I jokingly flashed an SOS at it a few times. Our friend who was driving us around in his truck said he had to go, so he could take his mom to work. So we jumped into his pickup, a Nissan extra-cab, and drove back into town. I had thought nothing of the incident until my Mom had asked me a number of days later if I had seen the UFO article in the Register newspaper. It described a ball of light some 100-200 feet in diameter, and how it had passed over the Millpond area and the sighting of it by hundreds of people, there was also a contact number in the article (at the end IIRC) for anyone that had anything to say about it, I don't believe the number was a local one. I believe it is still on microfilm at the local paper. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We had arrived there around 5:30 p.m. or 6 p.m., and the only reason the security guard at the gate let us in was because my friend knew somebody. There were private homes surrounding the lake, but there were no homes in the area where we were fishing, which we did for hours during the visit without catching anything. At around 10 p.m., I turned around to get a cigarette out of my tackle box when I noticed three large bright lights hovering behind some trees. Behind the pond was an open field of high grass a few hundred yards in diameter, and along the perimeter of the field was dense forest. The object I saw was off to the left. I said to my buddy, ""What the hell is that?""   Astonished, he said, ""I don’t know.""  The object moved out from behind the trees and started to slowly make its way toward our position. It was only two or three stories above the ground, and I had a great fear it was about to land in the open field. My friend pointed his flashlight at the object when it was just about over our heads. I wanted to get in his truck and flee the scene. The object, which emitted no noise whatsoever, then started to move in another direction away from us toward the forest until it finally disappeared over some trees. The object’s lights faced us during the entire sighting, making it impossible to determine the craft’s shape. My friend and I threw our fishing gear into the back of his truck and sped away to the entrance of the private lake, which happened to be in the direction the object flew. We were traveling along a dirt road when we had to stop and wait for a slew of deer to cross. The animals were running from the area where the object had flown. Regarding the object, we were unable to make out its shape because the three lights facing us were extremely bright. Each light was three times as large as an automobile headlight, and they were brighter than high beams. The object must have been fairly large, however, because there was some decent space between each light. The object could not have been a plane, jet or helicopter because of the way it moved and because it made no sound. Furthermore, I’ve never seen any flying craft that could move so close to trees like this one did. Other aircraft were visible from our position, but they were merely planes taking off and landing at a nearby airport, which was pretty far away from the lake. The object we saw basically was right in our faces and, again, couldn't have been a conventional aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

But I know helicopters can't fly that high. Then it moved in a straight line, but it wasn't no usual line. As it was moving it would shuttered. It would dip down and then back up, while keeping it's forward momentum. Then it stopped.

They stopped and then one took off going away from me and as it was leaving it would pulse a white light. It would light up and then slowly die out. It repeated this until I lost sight of it. Then I looked at the other one. It did the same thing maybe a minute later. Then I looked back at the first ""star"". It was in the same area but once again it moved in location.

It was bright red, and round in shape. It was traveling from West to East. It had a diameter of about 30ft, and it was not just the color of red, but rather glowed red. I quickly noted the speed and oddness of it and my step father said he was wondering about it too, out of the 4 of us only him and I were facing the best direction to see have seen it. It was so quick that the other two were unable to turn quick enough to catch a glimpse. It was not a light reflected off the clouds, because I saw it in the opening of the cloud cover first then it traveled under the cloud bank as it headed Eastward. There was no sound associated with it and no other affects from it. It did not leave a tail or anything visible behind it. It did not vanish but rather maintained it's speed and direction and traveled out of sight. A few minute prior to the passing a shuttle had went over head landing at the local airport. Nothing else was seen in the sky.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,36.71205652173913,-97.09243913043478

On the evening of Wednesday, July 4th, I got a strange feeling that I was being watched.   I had photographed a cigar shaped UFO about two week prior following repeated helicopter flyovers and the sighting of a fast moving disc, which was submitted to your site as well as to MUFON.   This was the same sort of feeling...a powerful sense of presence.    I grabbed my Sony DSC-H5 digital SLR with 2x telephoto and 10x internal optical zoom.   I set the internal zoom to approx. 3.5x and to the automatic setting.   I began to shoot a series of bursts at treetop level...the camera will shoot anywhere from 3 to 5 images in quick succession, usually less than a second apart.   One of the final series of 'bursts' captured a V-shaped formation of at least nine objects in the second of five shots.   I did not see anything when I shot the images.   I was making sure to not photograph birds as I first framed the shot and focused through the viewscreen and then visually scanned the skies before hitting the shutter button.   There were no birds in sight.   The fourth image also showed an object sittng just above a branch.   I later put together a rough animated gif (which is being sent to you) in the hopes that I can be told that these are bugs that fly in formation and then do zig zagging maneuvers. Speaking of maneuvers...the Blue Angels were in SE Michigan that evening, temporarily based at Willow Run Airport approx. 30 miles to the east of my location.   They did a flyover at the start of the Detroit Tigers-Cleveland Indians game at Comerica Park in Detroit.   I did not hear any aircraft when shooting these images... This series of photos as well as the previous cigar shaped object photographed have occurred in the skies which seem to be a main air corridor for large commercial and cargo jets flying eastward out of Chicago.    These objects are flying around in relatively busy airspace.   I would think that the FAA should be concerned.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,42.1257,-84.3717

After a few minutes it started throbbing in light intensity at maybe 80 cycles per minute. It then started to move on after being virtually still, gaining speed then suddenly disappearing, as if it were switched off. It then reappeared a little further down range moving southeast.  Thought at first it might be a flare but it did not move like one because it would stop, change in intensity, then move on, slowly at first but rapidly gaining speed, plus it did disappear briefly and suddenly only to reappear maybe 20 seconds latter.  None of us were drinking or using any sort of drugs...size wise it had the same perspective as the planet Venus. It actually was near Venus, as well as Saturn , at one point, and separate from the two, so it was not the planet Venus as I could see both Venus and the object in question.

On or about March 15, 2007, my husband decided he wanted to go for a drive.  I went, my two daughter's and my sister.  We had our three dog's as well with us.  We all entered our Suburban and left.  This was around eight p.m. We like to go out into the desert, so we drove out to the Gunnison Gorge, because it is peaceful, very desolate, secluded, and quiet.  We took our time, and finally reached our destination.  We like to stop and watch the sky for unusual things, so we did this for almost an hour.  Nothing was seen by anyone, so all five us climbed back into our vehicle, my husband driving, and started heading towards town. As we were driving, I looked out of my window.  I shouted to everyone to look out and we saw an amazing sight. What was out the window was some kind of bell shaped craft landing.  It was glowing, and on the bottom were all kinds of colored lights.  I yelled at my husband to stop the Suburban, and we all scrambled out to see this awesome sight. It was very large, and took about 10 minutes to land.  My daughter screamed out, ""look over there!"", and to our surprise, a second craft was taking off from the same area the first one was landing.  My heart was pounding.  I had waited my whole life to witness this phenomena, my lifelong dream coming true.  I was elated. After it was all over, we went on home.  The conversation in the truck was one of excitement all the way home, not stopping until we all went to bed. The next day, my husband wanted to go for another drive to the same place.  This time it was my husband, myself, our two daughter's, and three dog's.  I believe my sister was a little scared to go again, so she opted to stay at home. We arrived in the same area, and could not believe our eyes.  This time I brought a camera.  On the ground was a large, circular, UFO.  This craft was big and white, and very large. My husband was the first to spot it.  Slamming on the brakes he yelled out ""look over there!""  My eyes were popping out of my head.  Another one, and this one on the ground.  It was completely different from the two of the previous night, but got my attention just the same. My husband pulled over, we all jumped out, and I took several pictures of this ""UFO"". My camera was digital, so I went and had pictures made as soon as we got back home.  The next day, we decided to go again, and the UFO was still there, but had changed places. The drive on the next day also revealed something disturbing.  We had discovered three dead cows.  One in the desert, and two in a field.  These cows had been cut open with precision, all organs missing.  No blood could be found around them, either.  The birds and all other scavengers steered clear of these animals.  I also discovered a skunk in the same condition. I photographed all of these animals, but had my film camera that day, and still need to develop the film.  Someday I will, and will show these pictures as well as the landed UFO to those who are interested ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Lights inside a cloud-like covering over a pond.,Windham,NH,1993-12-01T02:30:00,other,1/2 hour but not sure,"Occurred : 12/1/1993 02:30  (Entered as : 12/1/1993 2:30) Reported: 12/27/2007 2:29:07 AM 02:29 Posted: 2/14/2008 Location: Windham, NH Shape: Other Duration:1/2 hour but not sure",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60522.html,"Lights inside a cloud-like covering over a pond. I am about the most skeptical person you will ever meet but after about 15 yeas I am going to recount an experience that I and my wife had. I have only spoken about his with my wife since but it is still very much in our memory. Extremely clear and, in fact about the most clear memory I have from my past. That in itself is very odd to me.  It was early winter (Dec/Jan) 1993 and we were living in a rented house on a pond in Windham, NH. I was sleeping at about 2:30 am and was awoken by light dancing on the ceiling of our bedroom. It was not that unusual as the pond water would reflect car headlights going by. The odd part was that I felt threatened and actually a little scared and I am not sure why. I am a pretty big guy and not much scares me, but this was very creepy. I do not know why, but I got up and went to the back yard. When I looked up I saw what appeared to be a round cloud (like a big cotton ball) about the size of a tractor trailer, slowly rising and hovering at the other end of the pond. Inside this cloud were several lights that were pulsing on and off. They were blue and white and the “cloud” material seemed to expand and contract around it, almost like liquid. There was absolutely no noise at all.  I actually do not remember getting to the shore of the pond or even leaving the house but when I realized what I was looking at I was completely amazed. I do not remember being afraid at all but what is a bit frightening now is how I got to the shoreline of the pond. This loss of memory has never happened to me before. That really haunts me because I have no absolutely no memory of it. At this point I went back into the house and woke my wife up. I asked her to come outside and she did. It was still there and she saw it. It had moved a little further away and higher in altitude (I would guess it started at 100 feet and when my wife saw it, it was at 500 feet) We stood there for a few minutes and didn’t say anything. She looked at me and said “let’s go in”.  As we went back to the house I do not remember if it was still there. That is another thing that really haunts me. We went back to bed and looked at each other and were pretty much too amazed to talk. I do not remember falling asleep but I did and as soon as I woke up for work I asked my wife if she remembered it and she just said, yes. I asked her to describe it and she did to a tee. After that she asked if we could not talk about it. She was clearly shaken by something neither of us could explain.  Every now and again we do talk about it but never with anyone else. I know this sounds weird but this is coming from a guy who just does not believe any of the UFO stuff. Even today I find myself doubting every report I hear but I listen closely to see if what is being reported is described as a cloud with lights pulsing inside of it. I have yet to hear a report that comes close to what I saw so I will just leave it at that. I am a professional manager with a large software company. I still live in NH.

It was a very calm and peaceful shade of florescent blue or soft powder blue light To whom it may concern,  On approximately June, 1994 at 21:00 hours a girlfriend and I were at a Carnival in North Bergen, NJ. There was a crowd of people there but no one seemed to catch a glimpse of what my girlfriend and I saw that night. She tapped me on the shoulder and said “What is that!” I looked up to where she was pointing and there was a disk shaped object out in space.  It was a very calm and peaceful shade of florescent blue or a very soft powder blue light. It was a very clear night and I know definitively the unidentified object was out in space and not a hoax. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and as soon as I tapped my husband’s shoulder and asked him to look up at the sky, from the time it took me to tap him on the shoulder and the time he looked up which was only about a split second, the saucer left in a flash and instantly disappeared into space. My guess it was traveling the speed of light to disappear that quickly. I would say about 0 to light speed in approximately ½ of a second. I thought to myself how lucky I was to have seen it because most people have to go through life wondering if UFOs and life on other planets exists. Now I know the answer and I consider myself privileged to know. When my girlfriend and I tried to tell our husbands what we saw they just looked at us like we were crazy and then she dropped the conversation. I just kept telling everyone and did not care if they did not believe it. It was an amazing memory. This is the first time I am reporting it because I did not know there was a site where I could report such events. I just came across your site today.

This was just my friend and me in the car.  Anyway we were driving on top of South Mountain near Stabler Arena when I noticed what look like a helicopter above a new housing development.  They were still building this development.  This was about 7 football fields away or so.  I said to my friend as a joke ""look its a UFO""!  We thought it was a Helicopter because it was just staying still and hovering.  I said to my friend to flash your lights at it in which he did.  This object began to move upon us flashing our lights coming directly towards us.  We then began to drive towards it as well.  It amazed both of us that it responded to our flashing.  There were no other cars in the area either.  Anyway we drove closer to it arriving at the main road and we stopped our car in the middle of the road.  This object was still coming right at us and moving very slow.  I got out of the car and my friend stayed in until curiosity finally got him out of the car as well.  I said to my friend ""what is that""? We both at this time were filled of adrenalin as this object slowly passed right next to us. It was close enough to throw a rock and hit it.  We could both see it wasn't a Helicopter or a Airplane.  I can remember it was Triangle shaped with 3 lights.  One in the front and 2 in the back.  You could see metallic on it as it went by, we looked at the side of the ship and some under belly.  We were both stunned at what we were seeing, the thing that always got us was that there was no sound, maybe just a slight hum.  You couldn't hear an engine!  It slowly went passed us.  It disappeared when it went behind the other side of the mountain.  I'm still shocked at this.  We both got back into the car and drove off.  My mind still tries to figure out what really was that thing.....My friend and I talked about this recently bringing back a lot of memories etc and we wanted to report this to you.

It was somewhere around 10pm in late November or mid December, probably 1994. We decided to take a short-cut over the back roads through the cornfields just outside of Blanchester Ohio. It was very dark, no street lights and no moon, and I noticed some lights approaching us over the cornfields from my left. At first I thought it was a low flying aircraft but it was moving very slowly. I took a second glance at it and noticed that there were three white lights in a triangular formation (one in the front and two to the rear). The lights did not blink and there were no red or blue lights, only white. I was intriqued by the fact that it seemed so close to the ground it must have been coming in for a landing, but I didn't know of any airports close by. Thinking that it must have been in trouble and was attempting a landing in the cornfield, I pulled the car over, turned off the engine and got out to take a closer look. My wife followed. By this time it was crossing the road in front of us. It was and equilateral triangle and appeared to be the size of a small jet flying very low. From our perspective it was about five inches long in the sky. It was a very quiet night... no tree frogs, no crickets and no traffic.... the object made absolutely no sound. We watched it fly over and off into the distance. We live in a flight path and I have seen all sorts of aircraft fly over at all times of the day, It wasn't like any aircraft I had ever seen. I had thought at the time that it must have been an hang glider, but why would anyone be flying a hang glider in Blanchester Ohio after dark and in the middle of winter? Maybe it was an experimental aircraft from Wright Patterson? It wasn't until years later, when I heard of eyewitnesses in Belgium seeing the same sort of objects around the same time that I realized what we had seen. While I have always believed in the possibility of extraterrestrial visitations, I! have al ways been very skeptical when it comes to eyewitness accounts. I'm still not certain that this was extraterrestrial but I am certain that it wasn't like anything I had ever seen before. I have seen all sorts of aircraft (military and civillian), I have seen flares dropped from aircraft, I have seen blue flaming meteorites and hundreds of ""shooting stars"", I have seen durigables and hot air balloons, I have seen high altitude weather baloons, I have seen satilites.... planets.... and comets.

The sky was full of stars but I wasn't seeing much in the way of shooting stars, so after a few minutes I was ready to give up and go inside. That's when I noticed a star moving very fast from east to west across the sky. By my estimation it could have crossed the entire sky in 5 or 10 seconds. At first I thought maybe it was a satellite.  I've never seen one before but it just popped into my head that must be what this is, and I remember feeling a bit proud of myself for figuring it out.  At least that seemed like a pretty good guess until it got about 75% across the sky moving due west when it suddenly turned north and just took off so fast it was across the sky in a couple of seconds and gone. I don't know much about space but I don't think satellites can turn or move like that, so for me - this was a UFO.  It was flying and I couldn't identify it, put it that way.  Like probably millions of people, I never told anyone about it.  It's not dramatic or exciting but sometimes I wonder how different the world view would be if everyone who's seen a UFO would submit a report and I couldn't keep refusing to report my sighting with that thought in my mind.

I opened the window to stop the vibration, and looked out south towards Avon Rd. and Livernois Ave. in Rochester Hills, MI and saw a giant triangle UFO.  My house was right next to two 'busy' streets, at least 10 cars a minute during the night, during this I did not see one car the whole time the UFO was in the sky. At each one of the corners, there was a colored ball, greenish, set into the craft.  It looked like a propulsion system, it seemed like something (a liquid) was flowing within the pods. I don't know how big it was, I had nothing to compare it to, somewhere between 250 m  and 1500 km long, and three-quarters again as wide, and the depth was about one-third of the width, like an isosceles triangle, or an arrowhead.  Traveled very slowly E to W. It seemed blocky, like it was back engineered alien technology.  It didn't have the sleekness that is usually attributed to UFOs, though I am not an expert. Within one month of this sighting (I didn't put two and two together for several years) I found a bump on the back of my neck.  Went to the doctor to check it out, he had no idea what it was.  He brought in other colleges to check it out, they were clueless as well.  The told me that it seemed harmless but that I should go see another doctor, which I never did.  It is still there, 13 years later, hasn't cause me any harm that I know of, but it does seem to be shrinking in size (or maybe I just grew). ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.

I was in the house of one of my aunts ((name deleted)). We were on a family reunion celebrating the nearing Christmas Day. I was sitting in the balcony of the house looking at the sky when a flashing white light appeared. It looked like the strobe of a plane but it had a very dinstinctive motion. Everytime the light flashed the object would appear to be static but in the next flash the object would have moved to a new location in it's path of travel (like forming a dotted line). When the strobes of a plane flash the motion of the plane is visible on the flash, this was not the case. Also there were no other lights in the object like a plane has.  The light object was moving east to west on the south side of the sky. I told my uncle ""DS"" to look at the light and I told him that it didn't looked like a normal aircraft because of the strange motion. He replied jokingly that it may be an ufo and we both laughed at the idea. I told him also that I was seeing that same aircraft every night for almost a month travelling on the same course and that it would return back a few minutes later after it dissapears. About 10 minutes later it dissapeared in the western side of the sky.  Like I told ""DS"" 5 minutes after dissapearing it appeared again, this time traveling west to east from it's last position. ""DS"" told me that it was really strange that the aircraft was turning back again, then he told me that maybe it was a patrol aircraft guarding the coast for drug boats. Another uncle ""DP"" told us that maybe it could be a police helicopter patrolling the area, this was possible because there was a narcotics police department in our neighborhood and it had a helicopter landing pad and landings were frequent. But usually the helicopter would have it's searchlifht on when it was on the area and there was no sign of a searchlight. Again the light object dissapeared, but this time in the eastern sky.  Then around ten minutes later, 2 identical lights apeared on the eastern sky traveling on the same course to the west side by side, this time all the people in the balcony was curious about what were those lights. Again the lights dissapeared on the wertern sky.  Then about 15 to 20 minutes later both lights reappeared on the western sky going to the east, but this time a third light appeared almost at the same time from the east going west in the same course. When the three lights were next to each other, one of the lights going to the east changed direction and joined the light that was going to the west, the other light remained on it's east course.  After a minute or so suddenly a big light apeared west near the two western going lights, it was like the apparent size of a marble but it's distance was more than a mile away this light was static unlike the others and wasn't flashing, it also had a yellow glow instead of the white glow of the little lights, it made a sound I've never heard before, the most close relation would be like a metallic cracking sound mixed with  an electric sound. the light remained in the same position in the sky for about half a minute or so. The two small lights moved towards it and dissapeared inside the big light, then the big light dissapeared in the same position.  There were 9 people sitting in the balcony watching the event, and everyone was terrified after the big light appeared. There was total silence for almost a minute, and nobody was able to talk because of the shock. My aunt ""MI"" almost fainted because of the shock.  Notes: During one of the times I watched the lights before that day, there was also a plane in the sky. The movement behavior of the light was totally different from the plane, also the ""strobe"" flashing timing was totally different from the aircraft, the flash duration was longer than in the aircraft and the flash timing was slower than that on the aircraft. Also the aircraft course was different being from the northeast to the soutwest. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

I was driving from North Carolina to Indiana to visit my girlfriend.  It was around 3:00 AM in the early summer of 1996 (to my best recollection).  I was driving north on a one lane country highway near the Indiana/Ohio border.  I am not sure of the city or county I was in, having been on the road for 7 hours or so.  At first, I saw what I thought to be the biggest ""shooting star"" ever witnessed.  If you were to put a drawing of it on my windshield for perspective purposes, it would have been about 3 inches wide and the tail would have been about 3 feet long (almost the entire width of the windshield).  I could see what appeared to be molten metal flying off of this streaking ball of flame as it fell through the atmosphere for several seconds.  I semi-expected to hear or feel a great thud as it hit the earth.  At that time I was just amazed at the size and duration of this ""shooting star.""   About 10 minutes later, a very large ""hershey kiss"" shaped brilliant orange, yellow and red light appeared to my 10 o'clock position.  The light and colors merged and moved together like a fire.  I would guess it to be within 1 mile of my location.  There was a field on my left with a forrest behind it.  The object was just above the tree line by 30-50 feet.  I estimate that the object was about 300 yards wide by 200 yards high.  Of course, not knowing exactly how far away it was, I can not be certain.  I drove for a few minutes further until the object was at my 9 o'clock position.  I knew at that time I was watching a UFO.  I pulled over and told myself, ""I am not taking my eye off this thing until it zig-zags into the atmosphere.""  After watching it, motionless, for 10-15 minutes in amazement, it appeared that someone just pulled a curtain in front of it from left to right.  I continued my drive with a renewed energy and arrived in Wabash, IN at my girlfriends house around 5:00 AM.  I went to sleep for a few hours and met with the family at the breakfast table.  At first it seemed I had forgotten the entire event.  Then, all of a sudden it hit me and I blurted out, ""Oh my God!  You'll never believe what I saw last night!""  After telling them what I had witnessed, her father set down the local paper and showed me the headline: ""Over 300 UFO Sightings in Indiana/Ohio.""  Not that I needed that as confirmation, but it could be helpful in putting an exact date on the event if needed.  My best guess as to what I had seen would be that an extra-terrestrial space craft had crashed to the earth (""shooting star"") and a salvage was taking place.  The actual shape of the salvage craft is most accuratley described as: if you took your thumb and index finger of both hands, made right angles with them then connected your thumbs together and your index fingers together.  It makes a point at the top and the bottom with rounded corners on the side.  I was just made aware of the National UFO Reporting Center tonight while watching a TV special hosted by Peter Jennings, or I would have submitted this years ago.  I am certain that what I saw was not made on this planet.  It looked like a perfect campfire in the sky.  I hope that this report might help piece together what actually happened that night.  Maybe someone else saw what I saw from another angle.  I would also like to figure out what the exact date was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

After dinner, all four of us went for a walk to the beach via a long boardwalk.  As we were walking, we passed an older couple and the man was pointing up and saying to his wife, ""There!  Did you see it that time?""  Not wanting to appear rude, we continued our walk, but did glance upwards as we passed and saw nothing.  About 15 - 20 minutes later, as we walked back to our hotel, the same couple was still looking into the sky.  At this point, I had to ask what they were looking at.  The man told me to look at a particular grouping of stars in the sky.  It was a perfectly clear night, and there were many stars out.  My friend saw it first, then his wife, then I did.  My wife never got the visual.  Here is what we saw:  About every 5 - 10 minutes, way up in the sky, it appeared as though one of the stars would shoot accross to another star and stop.  After another couple of minutes, it would shoot to another star and stop.  It kept doing this in the same triangular pattern between the same 3 stars.  We finally stopped watching, and eventually left.  I really regret not having my wife see the ordeal, because I swear I saw something I never will again!",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

Approximately 11 years ago, I had a sighting of an object flying over the remote Olympic Peninsula town of Brinnon, Wa. It was my first day at a camp site about 1 1/2 mi. West of Brinnon. I was hired as a carpenter to complete an octagon cabin to be used as a Lama pack base camp. That night about 11:00pm. as I was getting ready to retire in my tent, I looked up to notice a strange light moving through the trees. I was looking South and could see Mt. Jupiter in the background. The object was glowing with a Yellow/White light and appeared to be moving in a Northeast direction, straight towards Bangor Wa. It was a quiet still night in mid Summer as this strange object made no sound or noise and appeared to be floating over the ground at a steady speed I can only guess at, maybe 100- 150 mi./hr. It was gone from my sight in about 15 sec. It was not enough time to arouse my friend out of his tent to witness it. I sighed and thought to myself, no one is going to believe me! The object had no other identifying lights on it as navigation or strobes. We were located near some power lines and I thought about some phenomena that would involve    high voltage electricity. I have heard of all the different phenomena of Earth lights and ball lightning. Neither of these seem to match as an explanation. I have sailed on several ocean voyages and have experienced lightning, St. Elmo's fire and phosphorescence, but this was really weird! If I held up my fingers at arms length, the object appeared to be the size of my first two joints of my little finger. I can only guess it was flying at about 50-100 ft. in elevation. The trees were silhouetted in front of the object with the mountain in the background.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

I was flying a single engine civilian aircraft on an IFR flight from Monterey California to Santa Barbara. We were southeast bound flying direct to the Gaviota VOR (a radio navigation beacon near Santa Barbara) at 9,000 feet. We were in visual meteorological conditions with clear skies and 30+ miles of visibility.  I really don’t know how to describe what I saw. This wasn’t a classic “flying disc” type UFO.  As I stated earlier, we were in cruise flight at 9,000 feet pretty much directly over the Grover Beach area when I noticed a small object or objects at about our 10-11 o’clock position perhaps 300-500 feet below us and traveling in the opposite direction. It passed under the wing and I lost sight of it for a few seconds until it reappeared just behind the wing. I lost sight of it as it passed to about our 7 o’clock position. I observed it for perhaps 15-20 seconds. Not long, I know. The first thing I want to emphasize in my description of this object(s) was that it was small. I would say no more than 5-10 feet across. At first, I thought I was looking at two birds flying close together.  There were two distinct “bodies” or shapes that were either attached to one another or flying in a very close echelon type formation. One object slightly behind and to the right of the other.  As it approached, I became unsure if I was looking at two separate objects flying close together or a single object. As I said before, this thing was small but as the object got closer, I thought the two separate bodies looked somewhat triangular or diamond shaped. What was really remarkable about the object though was its color. This thing was an amazing blue color. I find it difficult to describe the shade of blue but I would say it was slightly darker than a “sky” blue but not much. The color is what really made me think I was looking at something artificial. It stood out against the generally brown/tan color of the ground but if you were below and looking up at it, it would have been very difficult to see.  A wayward kite? Some sort of remote controlled aircraft or UAV? Something else? I have no idea.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,35.1212,-120.6193

I live in East Camden, and we were on Highway 9, headed there from Sparkman (South).  It was about 11:30 pm.  I saw what looked like a shooting star in the sky, in front of us (it was in front, in the general direction toward which we were heading, slightly toward the right) and I immediately pointed it out to my 11 year old son who was in the back seat.  However, (and this all happened pretty quickly, driving around 65mph) as I continued to look where the shooting star was I noticed there was a blue light with a red light next to it right where I had seen the shooting star.   I figured it was a plane.  I kept my eye on it, though, and it didn’t move.  We got closer and closer, until we were both looking up at it, and eventually driving under it.  I slowed down a bit, to see if maybe it was moving, but it wasn’t.  I didn’t slow down for long, though, because once I realized this thing wasn’t a plane I got out of there.  The lights were in a cigar shape, right next to each other, both sort of elongated, if that makes sense – I say this so as not to give the impression that they were two dots next to each other.  They were sort of like a bar, some blue to the left, red to the right.  I didn’t get a good enough look to see if there was anything black behind them, or any other shapes.  I am a little freaked, as before posting I read two other recent reports from Arkansas where both descriptions sound a little similar to our experience.  I definitely saw the white light, it made a flash, moved a bit (I figured shooting star?) then the defined blue and red lights.  Again, it was stationary as we approached, stayed right where it was, and we passed under it, with it staying a little bit to the right of the car, high overhead.  I am a college graduate and an agnostic (rare for these parts) if that makes any difference.  I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

But, as I watched it it moved slowly from left to right. It also changed in light intensity. When I initially spotted it it was very noticeable; it would fade and re-brighten. After a few moments I decided to get my brother to come look at it too (to make sure what I was seeing was real). Once he came downstairs and I pointed it out to him he also thought it was very strange. He confirmed that it was indeed moving back and forth. At this time he also noticed some fainter star like objects close to the main object which also appeared to move slowly. As we watched them some of the objects would disappear and then reappear a few seconds later.  I have seen satellites on clear nights moving across the night sky, and know that these were definitely not satellites. As far as I know satellites move along a linear trajectory; these definitely were free moving. The fact that they could disappear and reappear in a different spot was mysterious.

The Colorado River (or Town Lake as it is called) runs through the city of Austin and there is a green belt, with hike and bike trails running parallel to the river on both sides.  I was looking up at the sky, which was particularly blue with beautiful cumulous nimbus cloud formations, when I spotted a small white circular object almost directly above us.  The object appeared to be stationary and was positioned very high in the sky.  I was very surprised and I pointed it out to my two (almost) teenage daughters.  I tried to recognize it as possibly a planet, or a balloon or even a strange and bright star but could not say it was any of those things.  It was the same color as the beautiful cumulous nimbus clouds but of apparent solid structure with a definitive circumference.  We stopped walking and began to only observe the object.  Like I mentioned it appeared to be stationary, white in color and circular in shape.  While observing the object a large plane, which I recognized as a commercial airliner, flew near it and I was able to compare the object to the plane.   The object appeared to be higher in the atmosphere than the plane which looked pretty small.  The plane was at an angle as if it was climbing to cruising altitude.   The airliner cruised on by the object, strengthening my conviction that the object was not traveling in the sky, but was stationary.   I looked around often to observe the people out walking, running, biking and fishing along Town Lake.  No one appeared to be aware of the object.  We began walking again and periodically looking back up at the object.  After a few moments, my daughter started exclaiming that the object was breaking into two pieces!  I looked up again, refocused my gaze.  I too observed what appeared to now be two circular objects; however their sides appeared to still be touching.   I readjuste! d my eye s for several different looks as I know that an object at a distance can appear to be two due to a trick of our eyes.  No matter how I readjusted my gaze the object did appear to be morphing into two circular objects.  After only a few moments, it appeared to morph back into one object again.  My daughter and I where exasperated and excited by the strange behavior!  A few minutes later, we came upon a man fishing and we stopped to point out the object to him.  Due to his confinement in a wheel chair and apparent poor eye sight he never was able to see the object.    He could not position his head to look almost directly above us to see the object.  The man felt it might be a planet and politely dismissed us.   Not wanting to appear strange I quickly agreed with him.  About that time a cloud began to move in front of the object.   I could still see it through the cloud cover for several more minutes but by this point the novelty was wearing off and we resumed our hike.   Even if it is a UFO, I thought to myself, it is positioned too far off and people where not even noticing it.   Nevertheless, I looked diligently in that area of the sky for the remainder of the hike and did not see the object again even though the cloud had moved on.  I took the man’s assumption that it was probably a planet to heart.  I felt that if it was a planet I would be able to see it when the clouds moved on, but I never saw it again during the rest of the day.   I scanned the whole sky looking for the object but it was gone.  So upon returning home I looked on the internet to see what planet might be visible to the naked eye during daylight hours at this time of year and at our location.  I could not find any information pertaining to a day time planet visibility for our area or anywhere near us for that matter.   I am baffled as to the odd behavior of the object and felt that if it was a planet it would not have apparently morphed into two objects nor would it disappear from view.   A planet would have remained on its path thro! ugh the sky.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

When: Friday, October 26  Time: 8:15 p.m. Where: Waukesha, Wisconsin  What: I am a teacher and I had just arrived home from work and was walking around my car in the driveway when I looked to the Eastern sky and saw four lights in the low-lying cloud cover directly above our suburban neighborhoods. They appeared hundreds of feet in the sky, not thousands.  Three of the lights began to spin around in circles, at one point coming together in the middle of the point they were circulating, but for a moment, and then moving out apart again where they continued to rotate. The three circulating lights appeared to chase each other independently in an almost triangular configuration around a central light as they were nearly an equal distant apart from each other during most of this spinning “dance” in the clouds. Never in my 40 years have I seen anything like this. The lights appeared to emanate from the clouds, but I noticed no objects other than the strange lights. I was about to grab my camera from the house when I watched the lights dart off to a point in the southeast part of the sky, pause for a few seconds, and then blink out as simply as if one were turning off a light switch. Before blinking out, the lights appeared to be nothing more than a crack of light in the clouds. I’m willing to believe that this was somehow manmade, but I am at a loss for how it was accomplished. This was no ordinary lightshow. Unfortunately, although this is an urban neighborhood, I didn’t see anyone else outside at the time to confirm what I saw.

The aircraft moved out of site to the west and turned around and began flying east toward the Sandia Mountains, but this time I noticed a faint orange light was leading the pack of aircraft.  It was very small, very faint and I could make out no shape, which was odd because the moon was almost directly above.  The shape of the aircraft was quite clear and they also had 3 white blinking lights underneath them.

This evening, Saturday, October 27, 2007 at 7:48 Pacific Time, I saw 4 lights, shaped in a tight V-shape (2 on each side), fly across the sky from North to South almost directly over me; but passing slightly east of my location.  I was in a dark area near the corner of Convoy and Armour Streets in San Diego, California.  This area is directly under the flight path of Montgomery Field and a few miles south of Miramar Marine Air Station.  I have lived around the Miramar Marine Air Station for 20 years in several locations.  I have seen just about every possible plane and plane formation flying over me in this area and I have never seen anything like this.  Each light was about the 3 or 4 times the size of a normal star (so they were very obvious). A plane close enough to have a light that large would be very loud; but there was no sound.  The distance between each light was about the same as each light (making it seem like all 4 lights were linked) but I could not see anything in-between the lights.  This was a tight formation.  This V-shape of lights traveled from north to south across two-thirds of the sky in about 5 seconds  (5 seconds is not a quick glance---I watched it clearly).  Tonight, at 7:48 pm, there was about 10 to 20 percent of wispy cloud cover and these lights were above the clouds; but I do not know how high above the clouds.  I could see the lights through the clouds as they passed over the clouds.  The quality of the lights needs mentioning.  The lights were solid and bright; but not a bright light like a star or blinking plane light.  These lights were different, maybe softer.  These lights did not blink.

I pulled the car over to the shoulder and rolled down the window. In the eastern sky there was a large band area about a 45 degree angle from the horizon that had satellite looking blinking lights, but there were many, perhaps as many as 50 or sixty, that at each blink were in a different position, none being in a sensible trajectory.  The lights were so amazing I turned off the engine and my girlfriend I both got out of the car and stood at the side of the road and continued to watch the lights flash as they headed in a north east direction. We both concurred we were seeing something that was not like any aircraft we had ever seen.  Suddenly one of the lights stayed on and shot across the whole eastern sky. If it had been an aircraft it would have gone hundreds of miles in a matter of a split second. The other lights continued to flash, sometimes very close together sometimes far apart, but like they were traveling together as a large spread out band.

All objects were similar to the ones I saw the previous night, that is small white lights the size of stars. Observation under binoculars revealed they had no other lights of any kind.

I started noticing a star randomly blinking light that was very obvious and bright. The sky then began to flash at random, like a camera, but much softer than lightning. I started noticing more activity within the stars, such as random blinking red and green lights as well as the flashing.  My attention turned back to the original blinking star. It would flash, disappear, then flicker around frantically while alternating red and green lights. After about 20 minutes of watching this the star shot abrubtly into the sky at tremendous speed, and proceeded to come across the lake at the same incredible speed.  Within about 15 seconds, I could see a flying saucer above the lake which looked to be about 350-400 feet above the ground. The main body of the ship was like an intertube ((sic)), wrapping around a circular dome on top of the ship. The intertube part had magnificent white lights, in vertical rectangular forms, surrounding it in an even pattern as it was rotating clockwise with the lights flashing in no particular pattern. The dome top was rotating the opposite direction as the intertube (counterclockwise) and had smaller, circular red and green lights surrounding it, which were also being lit up as it spun.  The outline of the ship was very clearly defined by the extremely bright lights it was emitting. It's strange though, because the lights were something I had never seen before, as if it were an energy source we couldn't even comprehend, but the lights weren't too bright to look at, even though they were by far the brightest lights i've ever witnessed. It's trajectory was perfect, flawless, as it came from the stars towards me across the lake. It was absolutely silent and moved at a rate I couldn't even describe, but was still very visible and clear as it moved.  As it neared me I debated for a split second whether to stay out and see what happens or to run inside, because half of me was incredibly curious and in awe while the other half of me was more terrified than I had ever been in my life. I ran inside and woke my friend who accounts me being ""white as a ghost"" and ""frantically explaining what I saw"".  To me, the best way I can describe what I saw, is that the stars were camoflauging some sort of ship, which then proceeded across the lake towards me uncamoflauged and in perfect sight.

What happened next is still unbelievable to me as I sit here and write it. I sttod there in the same area of my backyard, for a few minutes, I had my spotlight with me because it is so dark out there and I try to watch for snakes, we have alot of copperhead snakes around here! Well' here comes another object, now the first two objects were approximately 30 40 thousand feet in altitude, it is really according to how big they were, they looked small of course. This next object was much lower and it was coming from the east. it was traveling at a relitively low speed, just to be silly and playing around I shined my spolight toward the object. What happened next is wild, The object slowed down to almost a complete stop as I flashed and blinked the spotlight at it. It then continued to gain a little more speed and it continued on. As I was still watching that object, here comes another out of the west. This one was about 15 to 20 thousand feet in altitude, and again no sound or no flashing beacon, just lit up. All objects were low enough that I could have heard an engine. Again, I shined my spotlight at it and held it on it for several seconds, now remember you can see a spotlight from an airplane if you are looking for it. Already amzed and almost chilled from the last craft, this one began to slow down as well, almost to a complete stop, I wasn't believing my own eyes.And then it bagn to speed up after I continued shining the light toward it, as it was speeding up it was climbing, at a rate that was just unreal, it looked as though it shot into space, within seconds I just simply couldn't see it anymore. People say ""oh those things are those UAV's that the air force uses, I am sorry I don't think so,at the altitude that these objects were, I could have heard them and they are not capable of climbing as fast as that object did. Those objects, especially the last two without doubt were under intelligent control, and I don't think it was of the this earth. If they were UAV's of the Air force, why would we be spending tax dollars for them to fly over Pocahontas Ark.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,36.3064,-90.97720000000001

I saw 4 bright lights ascend, and then hover in the air for approx. 5 seconds and fly away. The area is rather remote so I ruled out being commercial aircraft. I work at a military installion, NAS Oceana where we have many F-18 fighter aircraft flying. It was not F-18's because the only time they fly with their lights on is when they are on the ground taxiing, or when they are approaching the runway. I know there is a coast guard facility about 30 miles from the track, but I don't think what I saw could have been done by a helicopter. I have lived near an airport (CID, Cedar Rapids Iowa Municipal Airport) all my life, and never seen anything like I saw this evening. I can't say I'm 100% sure it was something abnormal, but being around aviation my whole life, nothing I have ever seen was like I saw tonight. I was with two other friends, and one dismissed it as he figured it was just a small aircraft, but my other friend thought it looked quite out of the ordinary as well. I saw 4 lights, which where white in color, and I saw them moving across the sky at a fairly quick rate, and then they stopped for about 5 seconds and continued on their way. It looked to me as if all four lights were independent, but my friend who agreed that something weird had happened wasn't sure. I heard someone else say that they were Speed TV's helicopters covering the race, but I was at the track before the sprint cars were racing and they never passed over the track, and I never heard them or anything. The only possible explanation I can come up with was that they were F-18s flying in formation, but why they did they have their lights on? Why were they 80 miles away from their normal fly zone? Why didn't I hear the engines? How did they hover in the air for nearly five seconds without changing direction? The objects were going to fast for how close the lights were, but I didn't hear anything, and that was one of the main reasons I found what I saw very strange. Please get back to me to let me know what was going on. I've always been a skeptic of UFO's but what I saw tonight was nothing like I have ever seen.

Just to state, I was just driving home from a friends tonight when I saw it. It is now 12:05 AM as I write this sentence. What I saw happened not less than an hour ago.  I was driving westbound on Old Sumner Buckley Highway just behind the fairly recently built Target. I was on the phone with my girlfriend at a redlight admiring the stars on an unusually clear night. I then proceeded westbound with the greenlight when to my right (north of me) I saw a bright light moving VERY swiftly in an arcing vector. It was moving relatively parallel to me heading westbound and dissapeared behind the treeline. It looked as if it were already on a trajectory somewhat like a missile coming down to a target in an arcing manor. To be honest as stupid as it sounds, I thought it was in fact a missile. It looked fairly high in the sky but nothing like an airplane. Maybe a 2 or 3 thousand feet at the highest. It came eastbound across a large field in a straight trajectory until getting closer to the treeline when it took I'd say a 15-20 degree angle change and dove in a curving manor behind the treeline. All of this happened so quickly, it couldn't have been more than a second. It must have moved a a mile or so in that time.  The light was basically just a white ball. There was no tail like a comet what have and no blinking lights like an airplane. That's why I thought it might have been the tail of the missile and not a comet or something. After it passed however, there was no exhaust trail and furthermore why would there be a missile flying over Bonney Lake. I then repeated what I saw to my girlfriend who is thanks to me probably having trouble falling asleep right now. I took a few side roads driving home in hopes of seeing it again, but had no such luck. I've never reported a UFO before and feel silly doing so right now, but I'm sort of hoping to find out what it really was or could have been.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,47.1771,-122.1865

I was sitting in a chair in my backyard brushing my dogs and talking on my cell phone occasionally.  I took a break and leaned back in my chair scanning the southern sky for a few minutes when what I first thought was a plane entered my view.  This object flew in a straight line from my western point to an eastern point in about 6 seconds.  The object looked like a commercial plane (say 727 size) from underneath it. As this object was flying across my view the underbelly of it was lite up (white metallic looking) which I thought was probably from the way the sun was hitting it from underneath as dusk was approaching. In my estimation the object was flying at a lower altitude (10,000 to 15,000 feet) as I could tell the body resembled that of a plane's size.  Two things really stood out at this time:  first, this object had no wings (I repeated this several times to myself) and second, it had none of the underbelly lights (red/green) that you would see on a commercial airliner.  To say truthfully, I was shocked and kept saying how can this be a plane as it doesn't have any wings.  I stepped outside of my backyard area to attempt to listen for any noise as it began to go out of my view to the east, but I live in a condo and there were 3 airconditioners running within a 20 ft area of me so I couldn't hear anything other than the a/c.  I live on the flight paths to both the N.O. International and Regional airports and see planes around me all the time and have never seen one flying without wings.

Star watching, observed what appeared to be a ""disturbance"" in the northeast portion of the clear night sky.  The only way to describe it is to say that the sky itself began to move in different directions, like a wave action, and was becoming distorted in a small area.  There was quite a bit fast distortion with apparent motion of the stars for about 4-5 seconds.  I cannot really describe this distortion with accuracy because I have never seen anything like it.  A huge, in ""width"", (estimated width of a 727's length from my vantage point) thin, dark, crescent shaped object emerged from the distorted area of the sky headed in a south westerly direction.  It had several bulging circular dull yellowish shapes on the bottom of it but they did not appear to be lights or if they were lights they were not on.  Each of these circular shapes lined the entire bottom of this object side by side.  It displayed no illumination at all, but I could still see that it was a physical object.  There was no sound, and I would estimate its altitude to be at or below 1,000 feet above ground level.  I have no true frame of reference for this altitude or size other than the fact that I am an experienced pilot and judge distances constantly with good accuracy.  It was obviously not low, rooftop level, and it was equally obvious that it was not at a high altitude or in orbit.  What struck me as being very odd is that as it emerged from the distorted area it was traveling SIDEWAYS, not in the direction of what one would expect from a crescent shaped airfoil such as the B-2 Spirit.  It traveled so fast that it was out of sight within 2-3 seconds.  It did not appear to climb or descend, just shot away at tremendous speed after appearing from the disturbed area of sky.  I have no logical explanation for this.  If I was not star watching just prior to the disturbance occurring, I doubt I would have even seen it at all.  Note: I immediately ran into my house to tell my wife, she looked at my face and said, ""What’s wrong? You look like you have just been robbed!""

This morning, before sunrise (approx. 5:15am), I was on my patio having a cigarette looking east/northeast towards the bay.  High in altitude I noticed a blinking light.  At first glance, I thought nothing much as a passenger airline corridor is directly overhead (transatlantic fligts).  But I soon realized what I saw was not a jet's navigational beacons.  The light would become very bright (I would say 3-5 times the brightness of Venus at dusk/dawn), stay on for approx. 2 seconds and fade out. Intervals would be approx. 5 seconds, then the sequence would start over. What struck me was the fact the light was stationary. Insofar as altitude is concerned, it is somewhat hard to tell. I would venture a guess as being 35000 - 40000 feet and 5-10 kilometers east north-east. After observing this phenomenon for approx. two minutes, I noticed another blinking light, the 1st to my twelve o'clock, the second to my 10:30-11 o'clock. The second light was just as bright, would flash for about the same period of time, however the interval between blinking was closer to 10-15 seconds. These two lights remained stationary, maintaining their respective sequence. These lights were not a reflection, as sunrise is approx 7:00 am. This lasted for about 6-7 minutes (from the time I noticed), then the sequence stopped abruptly. As a matter of confirmation: these were definitely not navigational beacons.  We see a good 30-40 flights daily pass overhead.  Further, we can clearly hear the jets as they pass through.

Oval-shaped and at the least, i could tell its shaped was horizontally stretched more that its vertical stretch.

My roommate and I left for work early in the morning at 3:00 am. As we were drving east on a country road we noticed what seemed to be a very bright flashing star very high on the southern horizon. At first we ignored it but then noticed something was odd about it so we stopped in the middle of the road. The object was moving very fast towards us while the bluish-white lights were almost blinding. I was trying to point out to my roommate the object but in a few seconds it had bypassed over the car so I could see what seemed to give me the idea that it had a very old space-capsule body (like Gemini)as well as dull red lights that were permanently shining in the center although they couldn't be seen with the major lights on and facing towards you. The object passed over the car and it disappeared to my vision although my roommate was able to see it. He saw that the white lights seemed to be a pair and that they were maybe of a part of a propulsion system. He also saw that it had some dull green lights also before it moved out of range towards the north horizon. All of this happened without the seen vehicle making any sound for ten minutes. We continued on our way to work and for 7-8 minutes we kept an eye on it before it literally vanished. An hour and a half later in a very close proximity to where we had left it we saw the same type of object at a distance from us. The bright bluish-white lights were rapidly flashing although the vehicle was suspended while moving in a circular pattern.

Me and 3 of my friends were hanging out in my backyard looking at the stars when one of my friends points to an aircraft.  He said that the plane should be blinking because the light it had was solid.  Looking at the aircraft, I noticed that it resembled one of those planes from star wars. A circular body with to rods parallel to each other on each side of the body. We joked about it and didn't pay attention to it as it could have been some unknown plane.  I felt that this was one of the three things I saw.  The second sighting had me baffled.  In the very far distance we saw a light, very similar to that of a star and it was moving.  We all acknowledged it and after a few seconds the light started to go very very fast to the right, then down for a short distance, move right again, down a short distance and then right one more time.  It looked like 2 steps of stairs.  Anyways, the light stopped moving and just stood there.  I was very confused and scared because I was trying to find a legitimate explanation.  I was wondering if the military had a new and very quick airplane.  While my friends and I were talking excitedly, the light seemed to have vanished.  Or maybe it just flew behind some clouds.  The third sighting was odd.  I am not too sure if it was UFO but considering the strange things that we saw that night I felt I should include it here as well.  After a few minutes of the star, in the same vicinity but just lower, we noticed a bright light illuminating the sky.  At first we thought it were fire crackers because it lit that area of the sky quite well.  Then we saw a very very bright light starting to come up but then it froze in mid air.  We had a very poor position for this because my neighbor's tree was in the way but the light made it very easy to see.  We all saw this bright yellow (almost white) light through the trees branches and leaves. Then that bright light started to move up and the next thing we know, we see this aircraft to our right very low to the ground making a loud noise. It was like humming and it was very loud.  It was moving quite slow.  It first appeared from the left (where the bright light was) and then proceeded to go right.  Since it was low to the ground, we all saw it crystal clear.  Their were numerous lights on the bottom of it.  All yellowish white in color and very bight.  The outline of the aircraft was triangular and the lights were like this... Two small circles on top of each other and two cigar like lights parallel to each other and in between were those two circles. Again, it was low to the ground and the humming sound was very audible.  I suppose the first sighting was nothing.  And I suppose the third sighting could have been a military aircraft.  But what about the second sighting? what kind of aircraft can move as fast as I described and come to a complete halt?  I thought of getting a camera but I was just mesmerized and stunned by what I witnessed.  I'll try to get some pictures next time, if there is a next time.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,40.550250322580645,-74.46203032258065

My main concern was in trying to identify the object, so I went into my house and got my binoculars and digital camera. I got back into the hammock and attempted to look at the object through the binoculars. Because of the hammock’s movement and my arms moving I couldn’t keep the object steady in the binoculars. The image was moving back and forth so fast that I couldn’t really tell much about it except that in the binoculars it looked more cylindrical with some sort of darker areas at the ends. Getting more frustrated at not being able to see the object better, I got down on the ground and tried again to get it in the binoculars. About this time I noticed that without the binoculars I couldn’t see it at all. I grabbed my camera, a Canon A610, and ran the lens out to maximum zoom including the 4X digital zoom. I took a series of 12 pictures of the area where the object had been. One of the pictures has a bright white spot that I’m sure is the object.

We do not know the precise dates of the alleged incidents, described below, and find it unusual that NUFORC has not received reports about the alleged sightings before now.  PD)) Multiple-type UFOs are witnessed multiple times, in multiple states, near U.S.A.F. bases in LA and CO. Several other individuals and me have been observing clandestine military ""UFOs"" for approximately five years now. Two to four distinguishable crafts have been observed during this time period. The locations I speak of are Shreveport, Louisiana area and the Denver, Colorado cosmopolitan center and Bailey, Colorado, approximately 45 miles south of Denver. Both in Shreveport and in Colorado, United States Air Force Bases are nearby. In Colorado the sites are the U.S. Air Force Academy plus NORAD within Cheyenne Mountain in and near Colorado Springs. In Shreveport, Louisiana, the site is Barksdale Air Force Base.  I will first comment on the history of others and my observations. Beginning in 2003, my brother, a friend and me began seeing large, glowing and color-changing objects over Lake Bistineau in Bossier Parish about 20 miles from Shreveport and near a very small rural town called Hall Summit. Periodically, on a darkened road very near Hall Summit, LA, my brother and I (and occasionally others brought along)witnessed several aerial crafts in the night sky and depending on the evening of observation, one or more different crafts were observed. Typically, the activity in this country area peaked in the late AM hours, before dawn. However, there was some activity as long as it was dark. The most prominent and constantly witnessed UFO was a large, bright orange oval object in the sky which was capable of hovering, moving at an variable speeds, none of which were considered to be ""high-speeds,"" as seen in LA, anyway. These identical crafts were also seen hovering above the lake named above with the same light/shape configuration and rapid color changing properties. These ""color-changers"" were discoid in shape, appeared metallic and when viewed by high-magnification binoculars They all moved from side-to-side or if viewed from directly below,they made small concentric circles as if their propulsion was possibly related to the harnessing of the earth’s own (geo)electromagnetism as the movements were identical to that of two magnets of opposing poles when brought close together. The propulsion of these type crafts were silent. The most often seen color was orange, however, all colors of the visible spectrum were viewed at varying times; often the type of craft mentioned cycled through this spectrum rapidly.  The ""color-changers"" were often but not always associated with faster moving crafts we termed ""strobers"" as they displayed strobe-like qualities flashing intense bluish-white light at extremely high frequency when moving and a slower frequency when  approaching a landing area on government land, in the middle of virtually zero population. They were difficult to look upon as a prolonged gaze requires.Their propulsion was, too, silent. These crafts ""buzzed"" our vehicle at a very low altitude while stationary or when driving--multiple times over the years. I cannot comment on the shape of these crafts, due to the light intensity. These were much smaller than the above crafts that appeared at least 100-200 ft.in diameter and were rarely witnessed hovering except as they were about to land. They were capable of high-speed maneuvers such as small angle turns and abrupt stops and change of direction without deceleration. These accounts of the aerial ships seen in the country were near government owned land and is inaccessible. One evening at about 4:00 AM CST while driving on a small rural highway nearby, an orange-glowing ""color-changer"" passed over us at a very low altitude (150-200 ft. perhaps) and my bother and me were within 1 mi. of our usual observation point and we sped there, eyeing the orange ship until we reached our stationary observing position. The huge craft proceeded to land about 1000 to 2000 yards away. Two ""strobers"" buzzed by us as the larger craft passed over us toward its landing spot. Upon landing, either the orange ship’s lights were turned off or it proceeded underground. Too, we had seen lower hovering crafts ""cloak"" or shutting down their lights.These UFOs seem to be of military association. Gasoline? Free energy appears to have been harnessed.  In Denver and Bailey CO, the hovercrafts (""color-changers"") were seen yet in massive numbers, at higher altitudes and typically emanating only bluish-white light. The same small movements--as if magnetically-related propulsion was used--were identical to the ships in LA. An extremely large hoverer appeared over the same mountain peak nightly and the intensity of its white light was remarkable. It was viewed from a much greater distance (~1.5-2 mi.)and using the LA crafts as a reference,was at least 1000 feet across. In Bailey, (not seen in LA) the crafts at higher altitudes often zipped away with no apparent acceleration and, too, could stop on a dime. On an average evening, barring unfavorable weather conditions, there were 30-40 of these objects scattered in the sky. Other times there were much fewer present. They were over the urban area of Denver, also, at relatively low altitudes.  I have not returned to the country viewing area in LA for several years. Now, the same ""color-changing’ discoid crafts hover over Shreveport proper, a few at higher altitudes and typically one or two at lower altitudes. The lights however appear to remain white. While hovering, if viewed from binoculars, rapid color changes are seen. Many I know have witnessed these crafts and agree they are presumably military. The last time I spent time observing one of these was April 30, 2007, with a friend, within the city, from my front porch. Their presence in the evening sky is constant. The sightings are regular yet the crafts over the city do not maneuver, they just hover and make their small nutated  movements. The fact I’ve read absolutely  no reports of these highly visible ""UFOs""  is incredible to me. They need to be evaluated by experts with the proper equipment and brought to the largely unknowing public’s awareness given the potentiality for a cheap or free energy source. They are obviously higher aerial technology that has been disclosed and I feel as though they are at least partly used for surveillance/security. They fall under the definition of a UFO as they are not identified.  Two other type crafts were witnessed in the country, both similar: rectangular shuttle-like crafts heading in the direction of the Air Force base. Propulsion could be heard (a low uniform hum); these were of such a low-flying altitude (~60 ft.) that 6 (on one of these crafts) to 8 (on the other)circular propulsion devices were viewed beneath each ""shuttle."" Windows were present on the crafts' front which were very small and rectangular. Side windows were large and square with yellow light inside seen along with human shaped figures near the windows. There were no exterior lights present on either and an estimated speed of both is 40-50 mph: an atypical, very slow speed for an object of their size and apparent weight. The rectangular humming crafts appeared 40-50 ft.long by 15 ft. wide.  The high level of activity in the region warrants investigation. I have seen the same hover-type crafts not only in the two locations mentioned but everywhere I have traveled within the U.S. I am an M.D. and a trained observer. To let this slip by without investigation would be tantamount to continuing to allowing the government and its military to fund and operate these specialized crafts without inquiry and to continue to use hidden, inexpensive propulsion, likely in most cases presented above, to be geo-electromagnetism harnessed and likely regenerated--for free.

At around 3 am I saw towards the SW at around 30degree above flat ground a very large stationary moon like object. It was not the moon, and much larger. This was through my living room window. I gawked at this sight for a few seconds, moved a few feet left and right to see if the object was a reflection off my window, It did'nt move. I am certain that this object was real and outside my window.  It was the size of a large Grapefruit held a couple of feet away from my face. I turned to get my Binoculars from a closet for 5 second and then when I reentered my living room it was gone--vanished. The most likely explanation was that someone was shining a huge searchlight towards a new building that was located in same direction  1 1/2 blocks away. This flat concrete surface most likely would light up in a circle to resemble this "" faux moon"". However in examining this sight in daylight I had the impression that the ""faux moon"" was higher on the horizon, but perhaps I misjudged this. Also I find it strange that someone would be shining a huge search light which would have needed to cover the surface of old fashion outdoor movie screen at a new building at 3am in the morning.

I was about a mile away from the object and the first thing I noticed were bright lights in the sky. My first reaction was wondering why an aircraft would be flying so low near a city, from the distance I was at I couldn't tell the colors of the lights but I was also confused about why the lights of this aircraft were so bright, much brighter than airplane lights would be. As I got closer I could see it more clearly, I could see that there were bright lights on either end of something, at that point I wasn't close enough to tell the body of the aircraft, and the lights had a large light pink color in the middle with green, blue, purple, and yellow lights on the side that were not as large as the pinkish light, both ends had identical lights of equal size and brightness. The lights were flashing in a strange pattern that made no sense to me. The lights seemed to flashing in a nonsensical way, the lights were also very bright with very rich hues. As we were coming up to it we were looking straight on at it so I couldn't see a third light from our first vantage point, but I could see faint light coming down from the middle of the object. When we got close to it we could see that it was hovering, not exactly over the freeway but to the left of it a little bit, since I was in the driver seat I got a better look at it than the passenger did. The craft was moving very slowly and was hovering effortlessly, it didn't seem to have a destination, and it was moving slightly higher in the sky and to the left, but more so it seemed that it was just surveying things. The way it moved seemed very effortless and moved in a diagonal motion while going up. It was about 30 stories high above us and had it been flying in a city it would have ran into buildings. We drove under the object and this is when I looked up at it and saw perfectly that it was a large triangle with a dark circle underneath it and the lights on every corner of it. The color of the entire craft was grayish and the black circle stood out in contrast to it. The lights were equally large and bright with the same colors on each corner. The music in the car was off and the windows were down and we listened to see if we could hear any sound coming from it, but there was nothing, had it been a plane or a helicopter flying that low it would have been very loud, but there was no sound radiating from this.

June 15, 2008  UFO Report   Around 16:30 hours while lying in the shade near our pool and looking up at a CAVU sky I observed a silver/white rectangular shape at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet.  The rectangle was emitting two rather short jet trails which came from the rear two corners of the rectangle. There was a soft jet exhaust sound.  The speed was comparable to that of a commercial jet- liner...and the shape was clearly rectangular with a L/W ratio of about 6 to 8.  There were no wings visible and there was no frontal streamlining.  The shape of the bottom was truly rectangular.  Its course was south by south-west. I watched the shape cross the open sky for about 7 seconds until it passed behind the tree tops.  In doing so there were bright glints of sunlight bouncing off part of the surface.  It looked like there were only some small surfaces or points on the structure that reflected the light...as the entire shape was not reflecting light at that time.  I then lost sight of the craft. Approximately 5 to 7 seconds after I lost visual with the craft...there appeared a military type jet which was following the rectangular craft.  This was a B52 type craft emitting four jet trails of more usual length.  The engines were mounted out on the wings as the jet trails did not come from the rear of the fuselage as in civilian craft.  The wings and horizontal tail surfaces were clearly visible and were of the standard rear sweeping design.  The wing span of the military jet was approximately three times the width of the rectangular craft...and I would estimate that they were at the same altitude.

As i was observing this another helicopter flew accross my building heading for the object. The objeect was below cloud leve at the time, the sky had broken cloud but other than that it was clear with some sun shine. The object then begane to rise verticle in to the cloud i managed to take a couple of pictures but they are blured due to the distane i was observing from. After seeing this i rang the mod and left a voice mail message after following the instructions given.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,,

My bed and my sleeping side are right next to the window, which at the time was wide open. Out of the corner of my eye I could see lights moving. Just like the posting from Barberton, Ohio I also live very near an airport as well as several smaller airports, the blimp hanger and an army arsenal. At any given time there is something flying over our home and we’ve become quite immune to lights and loud jet engines. However what caught my eye was the erratic flight pattern. I immediately told my husband to turn off the T.V. so I could hear the plane. As stated before we have become immune to planes overhead but have also established a very discerning ear to plane types and sizes. My husband then looked out the window and was as startled by the lights as I was. They seem to be moving slowly back and forth in a weaving pattern and eventually moved in closer. I would say within a mile from us. His words word “what the @#%$ is that?”   The lights were in a cross pattern with several down the middle and two to three running left to right. I can only remember the lights being white and thought to myself this is unlike any landing lights I have ever seen. We both jumped out a bed and my husband ran out into the field which is behind our house. But within the 5-10 seconds it took us to get out of the house the object was gone. I was ready to chalk this whole thing up to a strange plane from the recent air-show until my husband pointed out the one thing that didn’t add up, we heard nothing the entire time, just the crickets.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,41.0299,-81.3367

A smaller bright white light shot off from it later I’m not sure if this is a UFO sighting or not, honestly. I’ve never had much cause to believe in them or disbelieve, but I’ve never personally witnessed anything that I couldn’t explain in the sky. The last few nights, my family and I have been watching something strange going on. I’ve tried finding cosmic explanations for it, but this doesn’t fit the pattern. I’m reporting it- feel free to use or discard the information as you see fit. We’re only able to see this at night. There’s something stationary in the sky with lights going in a circular pattern from right to left.. they then blink several times and start the pattern all over again. If the moon were a clock, it’d be sitting at the 8 o’clock position in relation to the moon.  It continues this pattern for several hours, then around 11:30pm, something shoots off from it.. it looks like a bright white light.. it goes much faster than any falling star we’ve seen, and it zips over into the big dipper and fades out. This is the fourth night we’ve watched this happen. I live in northeastern Maryland. I called friends in Baltimore who also saw the same thing happen. There were 8 of us here and 10 more people in Baltimore who all saw the same thing. As I said before, I’ve never seen anything like this, and I honestly don’t know if this is just some technology we haven’t seen before, or if this is something unusual. I just thought I’d pass this along on our behalf. Until this incident, I had no idea there actually was a place to report this kind of thing. I ran an internet search just to see if we might find some government agency to discuss this with. Thank you for your time.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,39.542417073170725,-76.3287487804878
