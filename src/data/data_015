The craft appeared to be a teardrop shape or possibly two spheres.  One larger toward the front and one smaller directly behind it.  It was moving very fast and heading west/southwest.  It made no noise, and appeared out of nowhere and disappeared just as fast.  It was moving horizontaly over the trees (high over the trees) and was in front of the clouds.  I couldn't tell if it appeared and then disappeared, or whether the lights came on and then went off again (which would hide it from view in the night sky).  It was not a spot light or an airplane.  A spotlight would change in distance as it tracked across the clouds, and the beam would be visible and could be tracked to it's source.  It had no running lights like a plane would, and as I stated earlier, it was silent.  I live near and work at Paine Field, so I see planes come and go all day long, and this was something completely different.  I believe it was one craft, but might possibly have been two, assuming they could travel VERY close together.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,47.92466490727532,-122.21939985734664

I saw it on Sunday evening (May 6th) at about 9:30!  I went outside as I do every night to ""check out"" the sky. I sat down and looked across the valley having a wide range of sky to view.....then, I looked straight up! That's when movement of something caught my eye slightly  toward the left (south) of me. 2 huge lights were moving south toward San Francisco away from me! I thought, ""Gee, I didn't know planes had tail lights like that! Gee, that plane is awfully low!  Hey! absolutely NO sound!""    By now I am very interested!!!!!!  I tried so hard to make this a plane! Yet, no red or blue lights blinking, I couldn't make out the wings either! During the week I have watched the full moon change size as it rises. I would say the size of the moon at about 70 degrees-maybe 60 degrees- above its horizon, is the size of  each of the 2 lights/portals on this craft! That's pretty big!  (I was expecting portals to be about the size of cruise ships portals.) It was difficult to see the body of the craft as it seemed to match the sky. The moon was not up far enough to cast any light on it. I did have the impression the area of the lights was oval and I felt that the outer edges of the circular lights marked the outer edge of the craft. I felt the lights/portals were in the lower Â½ of the height of the craft.. I could be wrong here...... I also had the impression that the height of it was long. And, above the light section the craft started to get narrow. Maybe my eye caught this, I don't know how I know this. The Height: Now, I am not good at judging heights in the dark, but I will do my best here. I am 700 feet up from the valley floor, oak trees in question are about 60ft. tall, and the branches reach out to about 45 feet. The area I viewed the craft in was: (with one eye shut)one hand from wrist to fingers plus the length of my another hand's fingers. The width of the craft where the portal area was: (with one eye shut)4 palm knuckles across. My guess is that the craft was 1000 feet above me, making the craft large. If the craft was up higher than that, this was a huge craft! Hard to tell for the lights were SO large. When I first went outside apparently the craft was going right over my head! When I noticed it, the craft bottom had already passed me. The brightness of the lights/portals dulled everything else about the craft as well as no moon shining on it. No light was emitted outward from these lights/portals, it was all internal lighting. I had no missing time. During the long 6 to 10 seconds of viewing it and afterward, I felt calm, happy. There was like a gentleness to the craft. What a treat this was for me!!",2001-08-05T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

On the evening of Wednesday May 9th 2001 about 10:00 PM I had noticed there were a few jets that I could hear from the second story of our home. I thought that I would open the small upstairs bathroom window which faces West and see if I could spot what was going on. I stuck my head out the window for about 3 minutes or so, looked around, and then I suddenly saw one fairly large orange light which was illuminated for about 2 seconds, then went out. Imediately after that, a second one appeared closely to the left of it (from my view) and repeated the same thing. You could still see a dim halo of the first one, so it seemed as though the lights were paired together. The object/s were dead silent and completely stationary in the sky. I would have estimated that they were 5-10 miles away.  I yelled to my wife and son so they could hopefully witness this. We watched out the window for another 10 minutes or so and didn't see a thing. My son became quite frightened because he knew I was not kidding. The jets seemed to be continually cirlcling around overhead while this was happening, almost as if they too were trying to identify the objects. For about another half hour we could still hear the jets, so I thought I would look again. This time I chose to open and look out my son's bedroom window which also faces west. Now it is about 10:35, and this time a total of four large orange lights had flashed and went out in about a 3-4 second duration. I yelled for my wife and son once again, and only my wife was able to witness a second sequence of flashing orange lights. This time it appeared to be two pairs of lights equally spaced between one another. We were all quite excited about this and contemplated notifying the local police to see if anyone else had witnessed this. Shortly after the second sighting, the sounds of the jets suspiciously went away. Hopefully someone else out there witnessed this and can file their report.

I happened to be looking out of a back window at 2:30 AM  when I saw a very bright, white light come out from behind the trees behind our house. It was so brilliantly bright that I called to my mother to come and see it too before it disappeared. It looked like a moving flash of light. The object itself was not flashing; it was a constant, extremely bright, white light, which I've never seen anything like. If I had to describe it further, I would say that it reminded me of a clear Christmas tree light, laying on its side (that is, horizontally) - only a thousand times more bright. The shape of the object - other than its eliptical bias (it was NOT round) - we couldn't determine because the ""rays"" shone out from the center of the light, extending away from it, obscuring its actual shape. I can't emphasize enough what a BRIGHT, large light it was. It's difficult to estimate its distance, but it seemed to be moving at the approximate height of a helicopter a fair distance away. It remained at a constant altitude from the time I first saw it to when it crossed behind the trees out of our field of vision. It made no discernible sound. The window faces to the north and the object passed from the west to the east. For maybe 10 - 15 seconds or so it disappeared behind some trees, but it emerged again (where one would have expected it to) and continued moving to the right. The whole thing lasted approximately 45 seconds. If one would have been directly underneath it, I suspect it would have lit up the ground below, it was so bright; it was like a huge, moving star against the dark clouds - we had had a thunderstorm earlier and the sky was still very dark.

My girlfriend and I saw something very similar last night (5/10/2001, at roughly 11:35 PM) from the Checkers parking lot that was definitely a jet aircraft (I think a commercial airliner). The aircraft was very low in the sky (larger than a quarter at arms length) and moving from the SW to the NE. It was moving rapidly relative to an observer on the ground, though not especially fast relative to another conventional aircraft in the sky, and due to the darkness of the sky and lighting pattern on the aircraft when viewed directly underneath it had a vague boomerang or triangular shape. However, as I was standing outside and could concentrate on watching the object (unlike the person who reported the 1999 sighting, who was driving in his car), I could barely make out an aircraft body and tail section bisecting the boomerang. The craft looked very strange when I first noticed it, as it had two unblinking(?) white lights (one on each wing) roughly 2/3 to 3/4 of the way back on each wing (measured from the body to the tip of the wing) and a single unblinking(?) red light on the body between the wings (thus the apparent V shape), but as before once I stared at it awhile I could make out the body of the aircraft. I heard no sound when it flew overhead, though as there was a thunderstorm some distance to the north (thus significant winds at the jet&#8217;s altitude) that&#8217;s not surprising. The jet was in sight for about 30 seconds or so (very rough time estimate). Lawrence is in the flight path of several commercial airlines stopping at MCI (Kansas City International) airport and has been for the past several years (as early as 1996 my friends and I used to sit out on the patio with cigarettes and beer and, to pass the evening hours, played a game where we would see who could see each jet first as it flew overhead from SW to NE). Between 8:00 PM and midnight dozens of jets cross over the town from SW to NE, though not usually at such a low altitude. I suspect that what the man and his wife saw on 9/29/1999 was a low altitude jet on approach to MCI.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,39.0001002739726,-95.25458794520547

The unofficial number is almost 100, though police have recorded 50 cases only. According to medical experts, ""If it is the monkey bite, then an anti-rabies shot must be administered. In case of a metallic injury, tetanus shots must be the option"". However, no such treatment has been given to any patient till now. The District Administration just sought medical opinion from Dr AK Sharma, superintendent, District MMG Hospital. ""These are simple abrasions. There is no risk of any infection,"" he said. Commenting on the observations, legal expert Mr Surender Rathi said:  ""This is wrong, once an FIR is lodged, the medical examination and proper treatment is a must, otherwise it will affect the case"".   ""This is an important evidence of the prosecution. So any error or laxity on the part of administration would be a blunder,"" he added. Meanwhile, attacks of the ape-man on the residents in and around Ghaziabad are reportedly to be continued. The mysterious creature attacked four persons - ((four names deleted))  in Indergarhi locality here. The irate residents jammed traffic for three hours on Delhi-Lucknow Highway. The traffic movement could be restored after the assurance of providing power throughout the night. ""Six cases of 'shadow attacks' were reported from Loni town of this district. The victims' were identified as ((four names deleted)). They were attacked at Laxmi Garden colony. Jagmohan of Dasna town was also attacked by the same shadow creature"", stated the ADM (city).

I was parked near the Conejo Valley Art Center in Newberry park, CA on a deadend road. I sat there to relax & enjoy the peace and serenity. I saw 2 red objects move from right to left. At first I thought they were airplanes, but the one object merged into the other & became one! Also, I felt very anxious & afraid. I don't feel that way when I see planes in the sky late at night. The object stopped in mid-air & hovered! The moon was out & it was very clear so it was easy to see. I didn't hear an engine. The object would change in shape- get smaller, then bigger. It jst hovered. It stayed red, & did not flash on & off.  I watched it for about 20 min! Then I began feeling extremely anxious & afraid. I wanted to stay & watch it, being curious; yet, I felt afraid.  I turned up the hill to the right of the object, & the object got closer & closer to me! I left & went up the hill. However, this was the wrong way! I'm not familiar with Newberry Park. I don't live there. So I turned around & went down to where I was before. The object was still there. I wanted to leave, feeling very afraid, so I did. I watched the object in my rearview mirror, until it was out of sight. I have never had a UFO encounter before. I am actually very skeptical. However, after this experience, I am a believer. I have never had such intense feelings of fear before from seeing an object in the sky. I have seen many airplanes in the sky before at this time of night & never felt fear. This was different.

She is highly educated in the medical profession.  She had not witnessed what she thought might be a UFO before this event.  We assume that the time and date are correct.

It was round and bright but too low to be a star and seemed to be following the highway. It was no chopper or plane becaused it was sphere shaped. The following day it appeared again and spotted by several people at the park and ride.  The following day expecting another sighting of the sphere my uncle grabbed his binoculars to get a close up view.  What he saw was bright orb surrounded by a outer layer of of some sort like the way and ameoba looks under a microscope.  As hit traveled down the highway the outer layers moved around like water ripples.  I don't know if this is  extraterrestial or not but it is defitely wierd I am going to check it out and see it for my self as it has been spotted four days already by several people. Im going to take a digital camera to get some shots. Only problem is it is only seen like at 4:30 in the moring and its hard for me to wake up that early even for a ufo spotting and with my luck I will show up with a digital and the sphere will not appear that day.more to come hopefully,2001-08-05T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

The lack of visible wings and lack of any vapor trail behind object was most notible; one observor speculated it may be a rocket of some sort, but no exhaust was seen and no sounds were heard. The object passed behind broad Vapor trails created by passenger aircraft moving in opposite direction. As we talked and walked westward toward my garage, it became easier to lose sight of object as it slowly receeded into the southwestern sky into haze and partial overcast.  No wings or rudder structures or emanations noted by any of us. It moved much faster than the occasional Goodyear Blimp often seen in this area, and any lighter than air craft we've seen is shaped like fat cigar, with markings or running lights which this shiny object never displayed. We are hoping to see a report on this sighting on the 11 pm news, but still skeptical.  It was suggested this object could be a large satellite in orbit, but even the ISS should not appear so large from this latitude.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,41.47117691601652,-81.65460330426801

We are almost directly beneath a southeastern approach corridor to Vancouver International Airport. I looked up to watch the passing commercial passenger jet, which was heading northwest about a thousand feet or so above. I suddenly noticed a strange ""light"", which seemed to suddenly zip in front of the jet, before coming to a sudden stop. As it moved through the air, it left  what looked like a vapor trail that almost instantly disappeared. I thought that the movement seemed very strange, and continued to watch the light, but it did not seem to move, or only moved slightly, as the jet passed by. I believe that the jet was beneath the light when it passed it. My estimate is that if the object at the same or higher elevation than the jet, then it was probably traveling at a velocity of about one thousand miles per hour when I first noticed it, before coming to an instantaneous stop. I rushed inside to get my binoculars, and when I returned, the object was still there. I focused on it and discovered the object was actually shaped like an orb, although I seem to recall that it looked slightly flattened in the vertical dimension. It had a pronounced  metallic or pearly luster. The outer edges had a reddish color. The brighter, more reflective center seemed more like a silvery gold color. It was hard for me to guess at the height of the object, as I had no real reference point - other than the passing jet. I reasoned to myself that maybe it was a type of balloon, even if its initial movement did not seem to indicate this. The object did not seem to rise, as you would expect from a balloon. It did start to move, in a sort of random manner until it was finally hidden behind a nearby tree and I lost sight of it.

It was moving very slowly in an eastern direction. We scanned the sky and noticed another to the east much farther off and another to the west which was much brighter and semmed to be much closer. I looked with my binoculars and could actualy see that the closest object to the west of us looked to be revolving with the light patterns. My wife looked and confirmed what I was seeing. The fourth object appeared close to the first object and could be seen moving in an easterly direction and went out of sight behind a tree. I'm no expert in judging distances, but I estimate that the closest object in the west had to be at least 100 feet in diameter for us to see it so clearly. It did not appear saucer like at all, but rather more spherical.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,49.26892572695909,-123.11223982257269

The sky was clear, with no haze or clouds to speak of. I had trouble locating the object initially, but he persisted until I saw it too. It was a small yellow light, not unlike a distant star, but was moving steadily across the sky on what appeared to be a satellite orbit path. However, seconds after I laid eyes on it, we both watched in amazement as it suddenly stopped dead in it's tracks. Almost instantly, it changed direction 180%, back-tracking on it's orginal path. About three seconds into its new path, it flashed very brightly, at LEAST 10 times as bright as it had been originally, and moved rapidly upward in an arching path, fading from our vision within four or five seconds. It did not re-appear in the next 5 minutes, and we came in to report it somewhere, which I guess has turned out to be here!

(There's really not all that much to describe about Scappoose other than the fact that it, like my hometown, Astoria, sits alongside the Columbia River.)  Just out of town, in the sky, I noticed a very bright yellow/white light descending -- straight down and northerly.  I pulled my truck off to the side of the highway so that I could get a better look at it.  My first thought was that it was a meteorite and I was concerned that, because of its speed, size and direction, it was going to hit the Pacific Ocean!  As it got closer, I noticed it wasn't as far away as I had originally thought, so, ever more curious, I got back on the road.  Then it went behind a hill with large pine trees -- or so I thought.  Assuming it was going beyond the horizon, rather than IN the trees, I figured it was just a (REALLY BIG) shooting star and the âshow was over.â  But as I neared the hill, I saw that it had ""morphed"" into an actual ""ship.""  Bright lights -- ((colors temporarily deleted until investigation is completed)) -- began blinking within the trees and the craft rose straight up out of the trees.  I pulled the car over again, in disbelief, and watched it for a few seconds. It began moving as though it were going to cross the highway, so I got back on the road after two cars drove by.  The craft, wider than the 4-lane highway and approximately 10 feet above the telephone wires (50 feet up), flew directly over the cars.  Both carsâ brake lights came on, but neither stopped!  I sped up, and as it crossed the highway, I anxiously looked for a road to turn down.  I turned east onto a small road, crossed the RR tracks and sped up, all the while keeping my eyes on the craft, which I could see through the trees.  It was now heading south at approximately 20-25 miles per hour. (I want to note that these lights -- ((colors deleted)) -- were blinking very brightly and in an interesting rhythm, but there was no reflection on the actual craft.  Though it was nearly invisible, the best way to describe its shape would be to say ((deleted)), based on the blinking light pattern.  More importantly,  I was able to make out this shape in two previous sightings several months ago in Astoria.  Iâm quite certain that this May 12 sighting was the same kind of craft my partner and I have witnessed {she, three times, once with photos; and myself, twice}, based on the light patterns.  Theyâre very distinctive.) I got out of my truck and watched as the craft stopped and hovered above ((deleted)).  It was approximately 1/10 mile east of me, and 50 feet up. After a few seconds, the lights ((deleted)). There was no sound or movement.  Strangely aware that they knew I was watching, I became frightened, and, legs shaking, got back in the truck, where my usually very active dog was sitting quietly staring in the direction of the craft, and turned west for the highway.  I drove about 20 feet, then stopped when, through my side window, simultaneously, a car pulled up behind me and the craft ((deleted)) -- lights on.  I jumped out of the truck and pointed, yelling, âUFO!â  The ((deleted--people))), got out of their car as well and stood staring at it as the lights became very active -- fast and bright -- and it zoomed off to the ((direction deleted)) (maybe 3 miles?).  It stayed in the same location there -- far up in the sky.  We were all understandably excited, yelling, âUFO!â  âCan you believe this?â  The man said, âI was in the ((government)) for years and that was no plane!  It wasnât a helicopter either -- Iâve never seen anything like that!â  He said they had just driven past the location of the craft where I saw it hovering, but hadnât seen it. Directly below it was, as he said, âA big herd of cattle.â Just then, with the original craft in a stationary position in the distant east sky (lights still blinking), another very bright white light appeared from the southeast and flew very fast in a northwesterly direction.  I said, âNow whatâs that?!â  The man said, âMaybe theyâve sent a plane out to check it out.â  I replied, âThere isnât a military base around here, is there?â  As I said it, he yelled, âThat ainât no plane!â  I turned to see it that it had stopped abruptly behind a cloud.  Lights flashed and reflected in the cloud, and it shot straight up, with a trail of light behind it, and disappeared. The show was over.  Without even thinking to get their names or give them mine, we got in our cars and drove off.  I can only hope that they may be doing the same thing at this moment -- reporting the incident -- so that we can connect and relay more details to this amazing account.

We were lying on cots when I noticed a three ""stars"" in a triangular fashion. They were very high, like a satellite in distance as far as how high they appeared. Difficult to judge. Regardless, I felt dizzy because it appeared that the ""stars"" were moving. Kind of like when you lay back and watch the clouds move and get disorientated. I realized, however, by watching other stars that the objects were indeed moving. I basically freaked out. From the distance that they appeared to be away the objects had to be MILES apart. Possibly 10 miles each? I would have to ask someone who is an expert on it. They moved slowly, from the distance we were seeing, and in an arc. Certainly NOTHING man made could make the arc shape movement at that height and with such an abnormal movement. They didn not go in a perfect arc. Rather the formation somewhat lumbered along. I didn't notice and cannot say for sure that the object was not a whole oject rather than a formation. I was to excited to pay attention if it blocked out stars as it moved. It didn't appear that it did. It was an arc overall but no apparent path that they were going. Everyone watched it in amazement. The formation was not an even sided  triangular. Easy to draw but harder to explain. The object literally faded into the night after, what seemed like, about two minutes in view. Not going fast, just disappearing.

I was outside with my friend ((name deleted)), skygazing like I have done for years, I am an avid astronomy buff. I know all of the things that should be in the sky, why and all of that. Tonight I saw something in the sky that I cannot explain, and when I think of all the possible things it could have been, the closest thing I can envision is a formation of Air Force jets. We were skygazing all over the sky, but when I first saw the formation, it was in the south/ south east.   It slowly moved from the S/SE to the North then vanished out of sight.  I quickly asked my friend if he saw it as well, and he looked and said what the hell is that ((name deleted))?  I said I have no idea, standing there with my eyes wide. My first reaction was that it was a seagull being lit up by the street lights and we could see the belly of it. But then i realized it was not, due to the fact that this was WAY too high to be any bird. Or was it? I quickly took the binoculars we were using to tour the city sky and focused on the formation. to my surprise, it looked the same as it did with my naked eye. These were 10X50 binocs, and I cannot explain why i did not see any more detail. Now this is where it gets tricky, because it was either a very large object, or perhaps dozens of small objects flying in formation. they were all a solid red color, but *very* faint. My friend thought they changed color to a dull orange, but I could not see that. They did not blink, it was just a steady, *very* dull red of basically dots moving across the sky VERY high up. Have you ever seen a sattelite from earth when it passes overhead? Well, it looked like that, a steady light, but not white, red, and much duller than a sattelite. I only wish I had my telescope out. I was SO mad later on for not bringing it out. When we could not see them anymore, my friend wanted to go do something else, but I said wait- listen. Do you hear anything? He said no. I heard nothing the ENTIRE time, and I know what a plane sounds like even that high up. It was dead quiet, no sounds after they passed over head, nothing. It was very errie in fact. I in my 10 years of being an amature astronomer, have never seen anything like this in the sky, and nothing I know of in space can produce this, and nothing I know of in terms of aircraft can produce this to my knowledge.  And I know alot about space and the sky. The weather was crystal clear, with great seeing and no humidity. A cold front passed by about 2 hours before the event, and when I thought about it I wondered if I saw my first ' ball lightning' but the stories I have heard about ball lightning none of them say it can last this long, nor be this high. I do not know what else to say. I never expected to post to this website, I only started to come here to read the reports people post and try to think what they could have been in the 'real world' , like a certian star out that night or something. etc. I wish I could find out what it was in the sky, it confused me. It scared me frankly, cause nothing I have ever learned prepared me for this. This is the first time I saw something in the sky that I could not explain right away since I was a child, and learning in school. Well, here is the report, as quickly as I can write it. Sorry for the typos, I am so tired. :)  Oh wait I just remembered, as always, there was tons of air traffic in the NYC metro area, planes going to kennedy, newark, etc. I am used to their patterns and they were flying the same patterns when this was going on to my knowledge.

All evening he had been explaining to me about constellations.  It was a clear moonless night.  There were no clouds and the stars were very clear.  At about 23.00 hrs we went up to the roof of my house to see the sky.  My friend was showing me the constellations Scorpio and the Great Bear.  We were facing North at around 23.15 hrs when suddenly we saw an object in the sky right above our heads.  It was as huge as as an aeroplane as normally viewed from the ground.  We do not know when it actually appeared in the sky before we saw it.  The object was brown in colour, moving gently and steadily across the sky from south to north.  It seemed like it was sailing in the sky.  There was no sound or lights emanating from it.  What was clearly visible was that it had a honeycomb like structure (as if it was made up of many similar cell like components).  It was almost T-shaped with a long tail.  The horizontal of the 'T' formed the front of the object. There was a haze around it.  It seemed to be surrounded by some form of energy field or flux which looked like the object was in a fluid like state.  The whole object and the surrounding flux was shimmering as it sailed past (the shimmering was similar to the view one gets when looking at something through the gases emanting from the exhaust of an aircraft just before take of or when one looks at the horizon on a hot day). Within about 5 secs from when we first saw it, the object suddenly faded out of view as if went into an invisible mode. The size of the object was the same visually when it faded away as when we first saw. It did not diminish in size. My friend and I then sat down to explore all possible explanations for the phenomenon and when we were convinced that it was a alien craft, we decided to call the office of the city's largest daily on the night of Monday, 14th May to inform them about the sighting. They were least interested in the sighting. We immediately sat down to record all that we could remember about the sighting. I have tried my best to give a graphic representation of the sighting. The .jpg file shows what the object looked like. In the gif animation I have tried to show the shimering nature. The flash file shows how it looked as it sailed past and how it faded away right before our eyes. Also enclosed is a map of Bangalore city and its location in the Southern India. What was really surprisng was on the morning of 15th May, the dailies all over India carried news articles about this strange mysterious ape like creature with robotic features that was sighted in Delhi. This creature has apparently attacked and injured more than hundred people over the last few days. (The first of these attacks started on April 8th, 2001 at Ghaziabad, India). Though none of the victims have been fatally wounded, there have been two deaths reported where one the victims reportedly jumped off the building while trying to escape the creature and the other, a pregnant woman tripped on the stairs and sustained fatal injuries on her head in the fall. All other victims carry abrasions on their hands, face and legs. Some have even commplained of their toes being bitten off. Reports of the appearance and capabilities of the creature vary slightly from person to person. Some have reported that the creature can jump to great heights when chased. It has been able to move at phenomnal speeds. There are also reports that simultaneous attacks have occurred at different places giving rise to the suspicion that there may be more than one of its kind around. The lastest sighting of the creature as of May 22nd, 2001 is that it has been spooted in the sate of Rajasthan to the west of India. The police initally suspected aliens but for some reason known only to them the stopped giving those versions and went on to propound other theories. I am very sure that there is a connection between the our sighting and what is happening at Delhi. That is why we have taken pains to carefully reconstruct the sighting in as detailed a manner as possible.

Was it self-luminous, for example, or was it dark, or unlighted? What was its size, relative to a full moon, or the disc of the sun, for example?  Any color to it?          Thank you for sharing the information with our Center!          Cordially,          Peter Davenport ((END QUERY)) ((BEGIN RESPONSE))       It was self-luminous. The clouds reflected its glow as it passed by and thru the clouds on its departure. Estimate size is difficult as we are all still sicky-feeling. Guesstimate size baseballl if held at armslength. Very white, not colored, possibly goldish.Casual in its display, then moved on to other places things. In command, not worried that we see it. We are all very quiet now. This party is over and the girls won't go home now because they are afraid. We're all around fifty years old, we know better. Nobody is saying ((deleted)) to anybody else. Took us awhile to think up netting you with a message. Oh well, another day on planet earth. ((END RESPONSE))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,38.62382493417588,-90.30852769878884

It was perfectly quiet and still outside and I scanned the sky as I always do for UFOs and I have done so the past nine years with no results until today. I was facing northeast, then looked up and just overhead and to my right I saw a lumious spheroid shape, moderately bright, white and yellowish-tinged, passing in a straight line from the Santa Barbara Channel in the southeast, to the northeast towards Bakersfield. It travelled in what seemed to be a course crossing directly over the southern end of town. At first I had to eliminate other possibilities: airplane, satellite, meteorite, space station, etc. I felt that it was too low to be in space and it was silent, so it couldn't be a plane of any kind. Also the light itself was too round and uniform in shape, and too yellowish in luminescence, from the point when it was over my right shoulder to the time I watched it disappear over the horizon of the mountains. A conventional space vehicle or satellite would show bright white and gradually either brighten or dim out as it crossed the terminator. This did neither. This thing was just too big and yellow anyway and did not change much in luminosity. It was just too big to be either a marker light or a landing light of any kind and it was not on any established airways. I estimate that it was at somewhere around 30,000 feet give or take a few thousand and the light was easily the size of an airliner. I also rule out any natural phenomena such as meteors. There was no flaming tail and no streaking. It was just not that fast either. It cruised along at a fairly brisk pace which I would estimate at a up to 300 hundred miles per hour. But it was high enough for me to watch it for at least two minutes. I noticed no fluctuations in its course, but it did seem to fluctuate in speed and altitude slightly. I am extremely careful about such things and this is my first report in nine years of sky-w! atching. I feel I have a good sense of such objects from being a private pilot and having spent four years in the Air Force. I have never seen anything like it in my life. I am about 90% sure it was not of this world, but am open to other explanations.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,34.317038103448276,-119.72054137931035

Had I not seen this I would have never believed in UFO's. I was taking my dog out before I turned in for the night. I live approximately six miles from town so it is quite dark at night. I sat down on my porch waiting for my dog, the porch is orientated to the due West. My eye caught something moving and at first assumed it was an airplane or helicopter. It was not moving 'right' for a plane and then thought it must be a helicopter at a high hover. It was slowing drifting and then changed color. It was then that I was curious, it was not a plane, why then would it have wing lights that are different colored? I called my for wife to see it and she was not very impressed. It was nothing spectacular. An aircraft was then flying nearly over me at this time and I used it to attempt to judge the distance and altitude of the light. I judged it to be approximately 20 to 25 miles west of me and at 5000 feet above the ground. During the time I observed the light it changed colors several times, at times appearing red, white or blue/white.When it changed colors it blended, it just did not change as if one side was one color and another side was another color. It never moved quickly or any higher or closer. My wife observed it for approximately 5 minutes and then called my Father in law to watch it with me. He watched it with me for another 10 minutes. He said that he observed another two lights to the south that resembled the first. I then called the County Sheriff and asked if they had had any other calls. The Deputy I spoke to then went to the roof and attempted to observe it as well. I know nothing of his observations or lack of. At 0010 hrs the light darkened to a dark red and descended out of site slowly and I did not observe it again. I have served in the Army during Desert Storm and have seen many of the worlds' high performance aircraft at very close and far distances in combat maneuvers. I have ridden in Pavelows, Pavehawks, Ch-53's, British High Pro Ch-47's, and other conventional types of aircrafts and I have never seen anything like this. I can not explain what I saw. The only other point of interest is that the light had to be very close to the Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Labratory, site of many nuclear reactors and testing facilities.

The lights appeaed to be about thumb to little finger in size at arms length. The two green lights were bigger than the white lights.

The evening of the event I had just returned home, noticed the clear, moonless sky with only a slight haze that reduced visibilty approaching the horizon, and decided to spend some time seeing what I could see.  I shut off all the lights on my property but one that was blocked from my view by a tree, other than that the nearest light source was from my neighbors over 200 yards away.  As my eyes were somewhat adjusted to the dark by my drive home I was able to see that even through the haze lower in the sky magnitude four stars were still visible, except to the south where the glare of Syracuse blocks all but the brightest.  Scanning the sky for the usual satellite pass (I'm a great fan of Heavens Above & J-Pass) or even better the elusive meteor I caught a flash in my peripheral vision.  Knowing well that it was probably too late to see the display I turned in the direction of the flash (northeast) looking for any trace of a faint afterglow of the shooting star.  To my surprise in direct and clear view, three more flashes, points of light, brilliant, white, each about a second in duration, travelling on a path from low in the North to high in the East, each at a different angle.  At the time the lights seemed to rotate as though what I was seeing was actually sunlight shining off a highly reflective spinning satellite, or it may just have been twinkle do to the atmosphere.  The event was only a matter of seconds.  This was like nothing I have ever seen and over the years I've seen alot. (hundreds of satellites & meteors, aurora, fireballs, and even a re-entry!)  Continuing to watch the sky for about fifteen minutes for something to help me realize what this was turned up nothing, no ""flying star"" of a satellite, no regular red, white, green pulse of an aircraft, no jet noise.  I did not realize immediately because of an ubstructed view but the lights occurred in the constellation Cy! gnus, sp ecifically in the triangle described by Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, and Deneb.  The lights (I would equal to the shine of the ISS on a good pass) were much brighter than these stars as well as nearby Vega.  I have checked the mentioned Web sites and found satellites in the general wide area of the lights, but I do not believe that is what I saw. (no fade in/out of a satellite)  I am skeptical of UFOs but not ETIs, so here are some wild theories based on what I saw:  a bird or bat flying in and out of the shine of the one floodlight I left on; a satellite boosting to higher orbit; shooting stars entering head on in my direction.

It seemed to be stationary and several thousand feet away, I watched it for about about 3 minutes. It did not move in relationship with our aircraft. I had unbuckled my seat belt to get a better look when the stewardess told me to refasten my belt. In that brief moment that I looked at the stewardess and then looked back out the window, the UFO had disappeared. At 8:22 it reappeared about 50 to 100 miles away! It was much smaller now, very close to the horizion and I could see that it was moving very fast, it was not leaving a vapor trail but it was still glowing very bright. We were coming up on a thunderhead and our flight went to the left of it. The UFO went to the right of the thunderhead at 8:25 PM. When we got around it the UFO was gone and I never saw it again.

We live on the West side of Lodi, our house faced north but to the west of us across the street is nothing but fields going towards the delta.  The only houses around us are to the east and north.  As we were outside waiting I happened to turn to the west towards the field and noticed two large orange/red fireballs hanging over the field just a little above tree level.  I had my cousin go in the house and get three more of my relatives.  As we watched these lights they would appear and disappear as if throwing alight switch, and sometimes they would just get real dim then glow real brightly.  Around this time four more of my relatives were driving by so we flagged them down to watch.  There were other motorists on the road, and some looked like they were looking at the objects, but I'm not sure if any one else saw them.  Anyways, this whold thing lasted about four and a half hours of these huge fireballs appearing, disappearing, dimming, and darting back and forth. And the entire time aircraft was circling them, I mean lots and lots of airplanes.  AT one point a huge military plane flew right over our house and it was so low you could see the missles attached to it. One of the unknown craft went flying down the field, just barely over the grapevinyards, and it seemed to be spinning as it flew.  It had red and blue lights andit was so fast we couldn't even tell where it went.

This report is from Bev Trout, Iowa MUFON State Director, E-Mail address is: btufo@netins.net and she would welcome questions, comments, etc. about the following report:  PhD at Iowa State University,his wife, and three children witnessed this sighting of a ""huge,"" silent triangle, with bright white lights blinking/strobing/pulsing, first seen at about 50-55 degrees up from western horizon, last seen about 30 degrees up from eastern horizon, with traverse time of 3 minutes at 23:45 (9:45 p.m. Central Daylight Time) on May 17th.  5 minutes later witnesses called Iowa MUFON State Director.  Subsequent investigaton shows cloud ceiling at 9,000 ft. with family estimating altitude of 5,000 feet, with closest approach 85 degrees almost overhead.  Viewed through binoculars by husband and wife, with 378 feet linear diameter field of view @1,000 yards(translating into approx. 7 degrees angular field).  Binocular field of view could not contain the entire triangular object.  That is, husband and wife could NOT see the entire object within the field of view of their binoculars.  Obviously, these witness estimates cannot pinpoint the exact altitude, dimensions, etc. of this object, BUT these are credible witnesses who are able to question their own perceptions.  Investigators on this case, having checked law enforcement, Iowa state climatologist, and FAA, are convinced that whatever was seen was, indeed, ""HUGE,"" and since we cannot easily explain it, it remains in the UFO category. ADDED TO INVESTIGATORS' INTEREST IN THE AMES AREA, are reports of a neighbor to the above family having seen an unexplained aerial object BETWEEN/BESIDE their adjacent homes on a previous occasion. ALSO, the wife witness in the above case had a daytime sighting three years ago near the southwestern part of Ames (this is town of permanent population of around 30,000....student population at Iowa State University obviously swells the population considerably) PLUS, we have been contacted with abduction reports by several individuals in the Ames area - all witnesses thus far check out as highly educated, credible individuals with (as far as we can tell) their ""psychological"" feet on the ground, i.e. not wanting to over-conclude, but realizing that they've been able to remain conscious at least part of the time during encounters involving UFOs. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT - only 7 miles from Ames in 1996, two crop formations were discovered, with plant and soil samples subsequently being submitted to Dr. W. C. Levengood's non-profit laboratory in Michigan, with lab results clearly showing anomalies associated with the formations. AS AN INVESTIGATOR, I NOTE THAT someone else from the Ames, Iowa area turned in a report to NUFORC recently, without leaving their name so that they could be contacted by MUFON investigators.  I would like any individuals who are reluctant to report to us to know that MUFON DOES NOT REVEAL WITNESS IDENTITY, unless that witness is willing to be revealed publicly.  We have NO WISH TO EXPLOIT ANYONE!) ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Bev Trout for submitting the report.  We encourage any other wintesses to the event to contact her directly.

I am a music teacher.  I was with three of my students in my car after a long vocal recording session.  Two youngsters were in the back seat, one was seated up front. It was approximately 10:20pm, we were just leaving the recording studio, which is located in the back yard of a private resident.  I pulled my car forward and was about to make a U-turn when I saw a large object moving slowly South, in the sky, just over a large tree.  It had one light on the belly of the craft, which illuminated the bottom.  It appeared to be a light gray metallic color.  The shape of the craft appeared to be triangular, however, we could not see the top.  It was in close proximity though, because we could clearly see the color, and a metallic reflection from the light. I stopped the car and pointed out this low flying craft to my students.  We all thought it was a military vessel because of how big it was, and, we were about fifteen miles away from McClullan Air Force Base. However, one of my students commented on how slowly it was moving.  It appeared as though it was just hovering, because it moved so slowly.  I shut off the motor of my car and rolled down my window.  This is when my students became agitated.  There was no sound whatsoever.  Then the craft went beneath the tree line quite suddenly. My students became very nervous and asked me to re-start the car and begin our trip home.  The car started fine.  We all continued to gaze at the large tree as I cirlcled the car in the opposite direction.  It was when I stopped gazing, and put my eyes back on the road that I heard my students cry out, for the craft had re-appeared and was moving much faster now.  I stopped the car to watch.  It was indeed moving faster, and in the same direction. One of the kids started to cry, and become almost hysterical, yelling out  ""Go, Go!"".  I turned my eyes back to the raod and hit the trottle.  All three cried out again, almost shrieking, because the craft had shot straight up in the sky and disappeared.  I did not see this however, but by the pale faces of the kids, and the tears welling up in one child's eyes, I didn't doubt for a moment what had happened. The kids begged me to drive faster to get home, all the while, keeping a fixed eye out the back window. I am not an expert, nor amateur in military or commercial craft, and neither are the kids.  It could have very well been something that could have been identified.  But, for a craft to suddenly move straight up and disappear seems brow raising. What is also interesting, is that the kids have not spoken a word of this to any of their friends.  I asked why, they stated that it scares them too much to talk about it.  Well, I suppose you can blame that on too much tv and movie influence, I just don't know. All I do know, is what we all saw that night, and how frightened the kids were...yes, I was a bit nervous myself.  I know the kids and I won't forget this experience either. I personally would like to know what it was.  If this sounds like a common craft, I would like to be told what it is, so I can tell the kids.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,38.6501,-121.2534

The object never made noise and had allmost a wobbly, eratic way of flying,though it flew quite fast.

My friend and I were leaving the hot springs at the Sheeps bridge East of Horseshoe Lake on my new 660 raptor Quad. I was driving the Quad and my friend on the back seemed to be shocking me with static-like electricity. We both were feeling very odd in a good way. I saw a bright light ahead of me and I stoppped the bike and turned off the ignition. We were hearing very high frequency sounds that would change pitches to sounds I have never heard before. Sounded like the pitch a cricket makes but steady. The sound also sounded like we were under very large power lines. The sound a neon light transformer makes. They were effecting our emotions with the sounds they were making. We felt totally enlighted by these visitors. They were giving our bodies rushes of chills and overflowing feelings of peace. Best feeling either one of us has ever had. They were doing this at will and we were loving it. We stopped 3 more times along the 12 mile road to watch them. Same things happened every time. There were at least 10 of them following us down the road. We were surrounded by them. They also made a very low frequency bass noise too. They were having fun with us. One of them was on our left coming over the hill. A bright white light that we could see approaching through a Palo Verde tree on the hillside. It came closer and closer to about 100 yards away about 120 feet high. Then it went to the right going slow. Behind us were smaller red lights flurrying around like nothing I have ever seen. I feel they know what you are thinking and you can communicate with them. I would ask questions to them in my mind and the answers would come in feelings corrisponding spontaniouslly with the sounds (vibrations) that they would make to us. The second time we stopped I heard and felt a presence behind us about 50 feet on the right. I was not ready to see an alien yet so I did not even look. I just started my bike and took off. This was the most incredible experience my friend and I have ever had. Now he is a believer and I am 100! % convin ced now. We are not alone.,2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

After leaving our garbage route for morning break, I noticed a bright lightin the sky to the east.  First thought that it was a jet on approach to Pierson International A.P. Closer observation as we sat at the stop lights left us with no earthly explanation as to the object. On the morning of January 14 2000,my partner and I witnessed a sighting over Toronto.  At roughly 9:20 A.M. ,My partner and I decided to go for break.  Northbound on Bayview Av.,we turned east on York Mills.  Just after passing over the crest of the hill nearing Versaille cr.,I decided to have a little fun at my partner's expense. When I saw what I thought was a jet on approach to Pierson International,I said hey I just got beamed in the eyes by a ufo.  The object then ""deluminated"" and re-appeared all within the time of two seconds or so.  The smile droppped when I realized the light had not changed position. As a blue collar pilot and by necessity trained observer,I began to go through ALL the posibilties as to what it might have been.   Second, though was it could have been a planet ,but no ,any visible planet would have been behind and to my right and not visible this late in the morning due to light pollution from the sun. Third thought was the most likely ...helicopter...but no rotor was seen . Lastly and possibly a Harrier jet on manuevers,...the afternoon before, I saw a military chopper hover over roughly  the same area. Fortunately,we were able to be stationary ourselves long enough while waiting for the light to change at York Mills/Leslie to make out it's altitude(roughly 1000ft AGL) and it's shape . It was cigar shaped I'd hazzard to say 20' long and 3' wide at it's widest and shimmering(like mirrage on a road)but only close to it's skin ,if you can call it that. There were no control surfaces whatsoever ,although bright ,it was more like the reflection of the sun off a mirror than anything else. I had noticed a light aircraft approach it then veer off to the north back toward buttonville airport . I hope someone there can corroborate  the sighting, from or pireps atc... After the light changed in our favour,we proceeded through the intersection to turn right into the parking lot of the Coutry Style donut shop. Just before I jumped out of the truck to get a better look,I thought to myself ""I'd really like to see this baby move out""and as my face was pressed against the glass it moved ,but just before it did,the shimmer effect around the craft inceased then three puffs of what appeared to be steam were expelled in smoke rings from what may have been the anterior end of the craft. Three puffs each larger than the other took a shape simmilar to that of a torche flame when ajusted to form the cone in a cone. What I thought kind of odd was the lack of vapor trail,I've watched jetstake off and they've always left a dark vapor trail. This thing didn't! It was at  this time that I took advantage of a slow moving truck to jump out. Unfortunately ,I didn't get to see it in full flight before re-spotting it N.W. of my present postion. The Last I saw of it was somewhere in the neighborhood of the HWY.401/Bayview. Since then ,we've been keeping my eyes to the sky more often. P.S...Roger's Cable transmiters and recievers are located just across the street from the sighting..Hmmm...coincidence?",2000-12-02T00:00:00,,

Then some of the lesser lights moved around at astonishing speeds as the very bright light stayed in place. It was like fireflies in the sky. Then the lesser lights stopped on dimes in the sky and remained still. They appeared to be elevated about 7500 ft to 10000 ft in the sky. It was hard to tell how large the craft or lights were.

It looked like a small airplane was in the sky with landing lights on. Location South of Famington Road by like 5-20 Miles and South of the hills in the back ground before hillsboro metro. (Say go left for 10 mi. from Farmington at 210th) As I saw it I told him I thought it was a plane and went back to watching the show. THEN, he said oh my god look at that, THAT IS NOT A PLANE! I looked and saw the light suddenly get wider in the sky like 10 airplane landing lights side by side and it was at like a 25 degree angle in the sky! It was flashing as bright as an arc welder and looking like a giant crack in the sky with an arc welder showing through from behind! Then it got small and dim once again. Then it faded out and came on in an area that was across the sky and this time had a dim red light that pulsed dim then bright. It was moving very slowly towards the original spot and then it kinda started to glow brighter and the red light faded and it kept repeating this dimming out of site on a clear starry night and then appearing in another spot and then flashing very brightly not like any thing you have ever seen in the air. Like sparks in an arc welder at say maybe 2000 feet. I ran for my video cam and started to film what this light was doing as it seemed to have a kinda revolving black circle or spot that went around it and the whole thing started to change colors like a lava lamp of rainbow colors very bright. At sdome points the lights were almost to bright to look directly at. This whole color thing lasted for only a short few seconds, but made us all gasp as did the bright welding flashes. I said enough and ran for the van with my cam. I went out to Farmington at about 206th and started West. I stopped after turning left onto a side road. I could see it about 5 miles away between me and the hillside. It was not just blinking kinda red and looked a lot like a helicopters lights but made no sound on this very quiet country road. Suddenly as I pulled over up the road (I thought I still had the cam on stand bye but I later found I was too shocked to hit start button.) I stopped to see a better cam shot and it pointed a direct red light more in my direction that looked sort of directional. Then it let got dim white and let out a very bright! white b urst of light that made me gasp! I went on but couldn't get closer and finally lost it among the skyline.

The craft emitted a blue laser beam from the craft to the ground and a blue egg shaped object which looked like it was comprised of millions of tiny particles of energy,was ""beamed down"" to the earth from this craft as if from some star trek movie. The blue egg shaped object was carefully projected down the laser beam and once it was ""released"" at ground level the laserbeam retracted back into the spacecraft.  We had the local airport tower on the phone during the event and the airtraffic controller on duty assured us that there was nothing on the radar fitting this description and that the only thing they had on radar was a medivac unit coming into san antonio from boerne flying from west to east into the airport.The air seemed to buzz with an electric/static during the event, and as soon as the blue egg was released from the beam the spacecraft took off at an extremely high rate of speed then disappeared.Could anyone tell us what it was that we witnessed being beamed down ?

Meanwhile i was using the binoculars and the fireball was so dim it looked like a peice of charcoal that was fading out and losing heat but the fireball never actually disappeared it continued flying slowly until it was out of sight.  while the whole experiance was going on i had noticed several Awac planes flying around and also some type of smaller fighter planes that appeared to be following the crafts around. My friend and I had dismissed the whole event as some military test flight for some new plane but then i thought to myself...if they were testing a new plane than why were there so many of them?

On April 23rd at approximately 9:30pm I was leaving My parents home after dinner and was walking out to my car. I noticed how clear the sky was as it had been cloudy, cool and rainy for quite a few days prior. Astronomy is a hobby of mine and I was facing west adimiring some of the stars when I noticed a plane approaching from the direction of Pearson International Airport. It wasn't to high up, probably a few thousand feet and I could see the wings, tail and fuslage as it flew over head. Just as it passed over I noticed three disc shaped objects that formed a triangle moving north and seemed to be lower than the plane. I could not see anything in between the discs such as a body or wings, and I began to wonder if they were in fact three separate objects moving together. They were not very bright and did not have any flashing lights nor did the brightness fluctuate but the discs themselves were well defined and not at all fuzzy or blurry. I called to my father who was at the top of the driveway but by the time he came down they had moved over the house and were getting lost in the light of a large mall directly north were they went out of site. The object/objects were larger against the sky than the plane and seemed to be lower in altitude. They made no noise whatsoever, they were silent, and moved quickly in a straight line north with no noticeable change in altitude. The siteing lasted about 10 seconds. I do not believe it was an aircraft as I could not see anything other than the discs and I could make out all of the jetliner that passed by. They did not make any sound, and it most certainly would have, had it been a plane. It was moving quite fast and must have been fairly low. If it was in fact much higher, than the speed was allot quicker than I origianally thought and the object would have been huge. The object/objects were about the size of the nail on your small finger held at arms length and about 1/2 inch apart at arms length.

However there was no noise and the ""lamp"" was very, very bright. It was also very big. I estimate about the size of a finger tip with arm outstretched. Furthermore it never moved for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then the light faded back to a small star size over a period of about 10 seconds and moved north and disappeared after another 10 seconds. The move to the north was only about two hand widths before it vanished. I thought it could have been an aircraft turning away from me. But aircraft with landing lamps do not turn that quickly. There was no noise and no other aircraft lamps (strobe, etc). I have watched other aircraft this evening and when they are near (about 2 miles) I can see the other lamps and the ""headlamps"" are not anywhere near the size or the brightness of the unidentified flying object. Here I speak literally rather than emotionally. Another thought was of a meteorite. But meteorites move quickly. This was stationery and then moved to one side after fading. Very strange.

At best guess, I'd say between 700-1000 feet above the highest peek and perfectly aligned with the horizon, one bright, star-like light/size appeared from no where. The first light split into a second identical light and quickly moved horizontaly southward leaving a very faint and momentary light stream behind it. It moved about 300ft to the left of the still lit, first light and came to a complete and sudden stop. At this point, the second light did the exact same thing as the first (eg: same split, same size, same light trail, same distance, same sudden stop) leaving three identical lights above the mountain for about three seconds. Then, once in position the first light dissapeared (much like someone switching off a light), followed by the second, and then the third. Since there was still enough dusk light in the sky, I scanned the sky for the silouet of a plane, a glider or anything that might have given off such a light.......the sky was perfectly clear, with the exeption of a few faint stars just beginning to appear.

My wife and I were on a TWA MD-80 from Phoenix, through St Louis to Cleveland, Ohio in May of this year (2000). As we were approaching Cleveland from the west, it was night (nearly midnight), but there must have been a full moon as we could clearly see the clouds below and around us. I don't think we had really begun our decent yet. We were sitting on the right side of the plane and were both looking out the window at the clouds, when suddenly something crossed our path. The MD-80 didn't even wiggle, so I don't know if they saw it. It came from our left and shot out from below and forward of our plane, going off to the right. I would say it was about 50 yards off our wing and forward of us. It lifted it's right side, then it smoothly lowered the right and lifted it's left side, and then  shot past us going in the opposite direction of our plane. This whole maneuver took about 3 second to accomplish. It was almost in slow motion, but it accelerated past us very quickly. We saw the following: 1.    No obvious wings 2.    It was rounded across the front 3.    It was more or less flat (not like paper) but it definitely had a low profile. 4.    There were no vertical stabilizers or fins. 5.    The tail appeared to be sort of flat not rounded like the front. 6.    It was sort of oblong (not round like a saucer). 7.

We saw nothing that would suggest an exhaust or jet nozzle. 10.  We could hear nothing, but then we were in an MD-80 going 500mph at the time. 11.  We saw nothing that looked like numbering or letters of any kind. This was all amazing enough to see, but what was really amazing I did not realize until it was over and I had a chance to think about it some. This thing crossed our path and completed nearly a ninety degree turn to the right which in itself was amazing enough, but the really amazing part was that during the approximately three seconds it's took to make that turn, the MD-80 we were in (which by the way was traveling about 500 mph at the time) did not speed past this thing. It made this maneuver almost suspended in that position. We saw it commence that maneuver in the same position out the window that we saw it complete it. It was like we had not moved forward at all. I know we did, but can't imagine why this craft was visible to us for so long in the same position. I suppose perhaps it was larger than it appeared and perhaps farther away which might explain it's lengthy stay in that position, but I don't think so. When it was over, we looked at the others in the plane to see if anyone else had seen it and I doubt anyone else was even awake. Nobody said anything about it, so we felt it was best not to mention it then. We didn't want others to laugh, but the longer we thought about it, the more we wanted to speak up. We did tell our relatives in Ohio when we arrived, but I don't think they really believed us. I personally have always believed that the universe is too large and deliberately constructed to belong to only us. I have always thought if we were the ultimate in intelligent life, the universe was really in trouble, so UFOs were never out of the question for me. I had never seen one before and may not have now, but I always had an open mind. My wife on the other hand is oriental and is not at all open to science fiction, or anything else like that. She believes now though. I served in the USAF for 8 years during the VietName war and I am now a software quality engineer for a large high tech corporation. My wife works in a semiconductor manufacturing plant as a process technician.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,41.47117691601652,-81.65460330426801

We were a group of hikers camping at 14,000' on the Marcahuasi Plateau located northeast of Lima on the eastern ridge of the Andes.  Just after the sun set, around 7:00 pm we witnessed 14 to 16 luminous sphere like objects in the sky for one hour.  They would slowly fly across the sky, change direction and then reappear in another portion of the sky altogether.  At one point a sphere ""flashed"" us appearing to have increaded tremendously in size briefly in an intense flash.  We were able to clearly discern these objects from other meteor ""shooting stars"" that evening which were occasionally present as well.  This event took place in a clear night sky without the moon, which rose hours later.  The ""flash"" occured when I directed a question  internally whether this could be my imagination.  A few of the individuals in the group had other sightings but most of the group had never seen anything like this before.  It was an entirely fascinating and extraordinary event which covered three days in total as one person in the grop had a contact experience the night before in the high andean village we stayed at before the ascent to the plateau, and again the following two nights on the mountain.  We later learned of another group near Mt. Adams (Washington State), witnessed by reporter Michael Miley of UFO Magazine,  had a sighting similar to our on the following days of May 23 and 24.

I was facing north and it was a semi clear night with lots of small clouds.  I was ready to get up and head home and noticed something which I thought were clouds moving above a taller apt. building.  I realized what I was looking at weren't clouds but a craft of some sorts.  This was the best view I had of this craft. Even with an excellent veiw of this, I became terrified when I could not identify it, and was able to continue viewing it as it nearly flew above me.  It was traveling south (up pine st. just a half block to my left)  and low to the ground (1000 ft)  having no sound, and a smooth fast flight path.  It was black and white (or grey).  I remember thinking it was odd because at times all i could see were the lighter parts,  it blened well with the few clouds out that night.  My first idea  was, that it was a stealth plane.  It seemed to be the only match as in size shape.  It disappeared from my sight (the apartment buildings blocked my vision from it).   An intense fear over came me, due to having a good look at something so unfamiliar.  I was extremely close to an unexplainable craft. (?) I had dismissed the sighting as perhaps a hang-glider.  When telling this to friends and family, they say that a hang glider would be unlikely.  (what are the likely chances of some one hang gliding or gliding over that area that time of night?)  When reading a recent sighting on www.ufobc.org web site, ""2000 - Boomerang-shaped Craft Over North Vancouver "" It re-created the experience for me, and every description in that article, along with the date and time is too close for comfort to forget about.

Ok this was some years ago but i can not remember when. posibly 4-5 years ago from the day 2001 so in 1997-1996 Was in the car with my mum and small brother going home from my nans house. While on the way back in total daylight and in a built up buissy area at what must have been around 3:00 i looked up into the very lightly clouded blue sky and saw an object hovering. Now i have not writen a recording of this down so the exact info that follows may not be 100%. We pulled over in the car and parked in a side street to look at the object. to me the object looked to be a dull silver colour not verry shiny at all. it was what appeared to be a cone wedge like shape from the angle that i could see it. there was some detailing on the object but i can not recolect what it was  just that it had it. we saw the object for around 10 minutes hovering in one spot and slightly altering its orientation in the sky over a slow period of time. Me my mum and my younger brother all witnessed this object. the object then changed it orientation to what seemed to be vertical and slowly rised upwards. this is when it god a bit more exiting and a large lokking flam of what looked like fire came out of the bottom (as u would see in a hot air baloon) and the object shot upwards very rapidly and out of site. I would also note that nasa was develaping a vertical take off and landing roket thing that i saw on discovery chan that has a similer sort of shape and movement in the air to the object i saw. I know that what i saw was not a NASA thing but it gives a compparison.,,,

We were going west on Figueroa St and just crossed Olympic Blvd. I looked to my left at a hotel (Holiday Inn I think) and I saw  what appeared to be a metallic colored disc shaped object shoot up from behind the taller buildings nearby. It got to a height of 100 feet into the air. At this point I told Bob to check out his left near the buildings and he did but he told me he had to keep his eyes on the road so I had to watch it for the 2 blocks it traveled in a straight line occassionally dipping 30 feet. We turned left onto 12th St and then the sun shined on it and I could see inside the ship because it turned transparent. I could see 3 or 4 people inside of which 2 were looking out at me & they were leaning over a console /platform. They looked like 2 handsome ordinary human men. I gave them the peace sign because it seemed fun to do. They didn't respond and showed no emotion other than curiosity. I had to go to work at 1200 N. 12th St. so he dropped me off after I told him to follow it. He lost it about 1/2 a block away. I risked being made fun of once when I called radio station KROQ after they asked their listeners if anyone has ever seen a UFO in Southern California. I don't think they believed me but I was curious if anyone else had seen that craft. I have a copy of my calling KROQ. I don't tell many people because of my fear of ridicule. My husband saw them too but not as clearly as me. He has a pretty good description of it all. It reminded us of a soap bubble where the setting sun shone on it. Where the sun didn't hit it , the craft remained steel gray opaque color. My husband doesn't think it's a good idea to tell anyone but I've been keeping quiet too long because of fear of someone coming around and telling me to keep quiet.",,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

Some type of vehicle was, very slowly, floating from the northwest to the southeast. There were a series, slanted downward, windows in the craft. We could see figures moving about and some were apparently looking down out of the windows. The background behind the figures was red, making the figures look like silohettes.  The strange thing about the craft was the rather bobbing motion it had while moving along as it wasn't a smooth motion.  We watched it for about 10 minutes altogether.  Because of the darkness it was impossible to see much of a shape of the craft other than the lighted windows were in a curved arc.  I have been rather hesitant in talking about this sighting.

I happened to be in Alaska because I had been working for Washington Fish & Oyster Co. at their cannery on Shuyak Island, called Port Williams.   I was a mechanic doing all manner of repair work besides making cans for the salmon with Continental Can Co. equipment.  I made the cans and then we checked constantly to insure proper sealing.  When the salmon season was over I decided to go to Anchorage and secure a job.  This was not to be and I found myself working for the Civilian Conservation Corp.  I helped establish the Camp at Eklutna, 27 miles north of Anchorage, on the now old highway.  This was the construction site of Eklutna's Power Plant buildings and all were still intact and we took it over.  The exact number of young men who arrived there was probably ten and they were all, I believe, from the Eastern States--New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts.   It was cold, 20 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit, with about ten inches of snow on the ground.  We all slept in the large bunkhouse and free time was spent around the coal burning stove playing cards, reading or just conversation.   One of the fellows was called Peterson.   Weekends were long and the biggest activity was chuckingcoal in the stove.  Everyone took turns to keep the fire going during the night.  On this particular Saturday night Peterson and I decided to try to hitch a ride to Anchorage and go to a movie.  The others thought we were out of our minds with the freezing cold and all.  The two of us started out, the sky was pitch black with the stars glistening like jewels and the air was still.   Walking along at a brisk pace, to keep warm, we much have covered four or five miles and no cars came.   As we entered an open area we heard this sound, turned around and saw this intense bluish light.  Oh, joy!...a truck it had to be with one headlight burned out.  Wrong!  It was not on the road but up in the AIR!   This was startling to say the least.  The sound we heard was like the sound of a jet turbine being shut down--not a high pitched sound.   Dumbfounded--it took a few seconds for us to react.  It seemed it was moving rather slowly--maybe 35-40 miles per hour.  In the ensuing moments we flattened ourselves in the snow when it passed overhead.   In the few moments I looked at it, it was to all appearances cigar-shaped with the bluish light on the side.  However, a few seconds later, when light faded some, I looked up and it appeared wider.  Peterson and I were now standing up looking at the object heading east.  It was headed toward a mountain or high foothills.  As we kept looking at it, we both thought it would crash into the mountain.  It seemed to lift up and went over and down the other side.   We looked at each other and exclaimed, ""What the hell was that?"" We decided to return to the Camp, which we did, wondering what it was we had seen.

Watched it for about 5 seconds or more when it (just a small bright light, no brighter than any other object in orbit) flared a very bright, roundish, white light for one brief second.  After the flare diminished I noticed that the direction it was following had changed by approximately 30 degrees from my perspective with one difference, it was now moving out of orbit as the object had increased it's speed in that flash and moving at a new constant speed.  As it was moving on the new direction it was progressively going from the small bright light (1 - 2 millimeters across) to a smaller and less bright state until it could no longer be seen.  I noticed it while facing west, looking upwards at approx 70 degrees ascention.

PD)) Dear Sir: At midnite on June 24, 2000 myself and two others witnessed a flying object that exhibited controlled flight characteristics.  As a commercial pilot and flight instructor, I know what is and is not an aircraft. Given the extremely poor weather conditions, its location and direction of flight, the complete lack of any sound or proper lighting, and its' very low altitude at a high rate of speed, I thought it would be proper to submit a report to your offices, which we did in July, although for some reason it has not been posted in your reporting database. What is of extreme interest to me personally is the following report: Occurred : 6/25/2000 00:45 (Entered as : 06/25/00 00:45) Reported : 6/29/2000 09:02 Posted : 7/11/2000 Location : CALGARY, AB Shape : Unknown  BRIGHT LIGHT TRACKS FROM WEST TO EAST IN SOLID OVERCAST AT 12:45 AM A LIGHT DECSENDED INSIDE SOLID OVERCAST, THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT IT LIT UP THE CLOUD. THE OVERCAST WAS ABOUT 6000 FEET. IT REMAINED STATIONARY IN THE CLOUD FOR 2 TO 3 SECONDS AND THEN PROCEDED TO TRAVEL FROM THE DIRECTION OF WEST TO EAST. IT DID NOT COME OUT OF THE CLOUD,AND STAYED ON AN EASTERN TRACK UNTIL I LOST SIGHT OF IT. ALSO THERE WAS NO SOUND EMITTED FROM THE CRAFT. I CALLED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO SCHEDULED TRAFFIC IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME.  Someone else in Calgary has apparently seen the same thing, about half an hour or so after we did.  He is correct on the wx at the time:  Calgary's altitude above sea level is 3439 feet, with solid overcast about 1000 AGL in heavy rain and lightning.  The object we saw was below the cloud deck, moving at about 300+ knots, was lit white, had no visible nav lites, made no sound, and carried out two course changes before leaving the area. It was too fast for a helicopter, too low for a jet, and far too quiet.  The nearest military aerodrome that operates anything that would move that quick is CFB Cold Lake, some 400 miles north of our position. Again, the F-18's that they operate would certainly have been audible and have been properly lit, even if for some reason they chose to fly at night in such poor conditions, low to the ground at a high rate of speed. I don't know what your policy is regarding contacts between the authors of the reports you list, but if its' possible I would like to compare notes with the author with what we saw, just on a curiosity basis alone.  I've never witnessed anything like what we saw, and I have lived and breathed aviation in all of its' aspects for as far back as I can remember. Thank you for your consideration Best regards, ((name and title of aviation professional deleted))",2000-12-02T00:00:00,51.8333,-113.2333

It was ""as bright as"" the full moon and did not vary in intensity of light, witness states.  On that evening, witness recalls no coulds, no wind, stars visible, and no moon. Investigator consulted an ephemeris and confirms that on the date and time in question, the moon was not visible. Witness states the bright object was white in color, surrounded by a white halo edged in blue.  As both witnesses watched, the object extended a white beam downward (left angled) to the canyon wall.  The white beam was edged in ""defused blue""as was teh object.  Witness states she saw the beam's leading edge move downward and then retract, whereupon the object diasppeared.  Duration 10 seconds. One possible explanation for the subject light is a helicopter-mounted searchlight.  Telephone calls to the area-wide helicppter facilities revealed no helicopters airborne within 24 hours of the event.  Calls to two local sheriff's offices (responsible for search & rescue) and the two local airports revealed no helicpoter activity.

I spotted a light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting back and forth...moving to the left, hovering, then moving to the right.  It would hover there, than move to the left again.  Rather than a straight to and fro motion, it's path had kind of a circular jog at 9am and 3pm.  It was like it was circling around in a very tight arc instead of going in reverse, if this makes sense. It repeated this pattern over and over again the whole time I was watching it.  It was not exactly regular though, the time it hovered at opposite poles varied slightly.   As I recall, the light was comprised of three smaller lights, red white and green side by side, perhaps slightly triangular.  It randomly glittered but was not blinking.  It didn't seem to always return to the same place...it would dart rather quickly to it's next position, seem to hesitate momentarily, then move back again.  Because of it's dimunitive size, it was hard to gauge it's distance.  I could think of no earthly object or reason for this manifestation.  I finally became cold and went indoors.  I went back outdoors several times in the next hour to see if it was still there, and it was.  I finally fell asleep around 4am and that was the last I know of it.  Not very spectacular, but that's the way it happened.  The thing that most stands out in my mind is that I could think of no rational reason for this to be occuring in the middle of the night in the middle of North Dakota.

PLACE:  					Brandonanitoba TIME:  					Saturday morn (7 am), Summer of 1951  LENGTH OF OBSERVATION:  	Approximately 30 minutes DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:		Circular, Saucer Shaped, Wingless Aircraft, 4 ft. to 6 ft. in diameter, 2 ft. to 3 ft. in height, bottom half:  black, top half: clear canopy with a 1 ft. square black box centered under the canopy, no insignias on the craft.  SPEED OF CRAFT:			Varied from 0 mph to max. of 5 ph PROPULSION:				No sound, smell, light or visible means of propulsion  DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION: Me and another 5 year old boy (canât recall his name) were playing catch with a ball in front of Flemming Elementary school located in south west Brandon, Manitoba.  The aircraft was first observed by the other boy when he missed catching the ball that I had thrown to him.  I asked him why he had missed the easy catch and he told me to look over my left shoulder into the sky.  The object was first seen as round and black, about the size of a quarter, against a white cloud.  The craft was slowly descending until it reached about 30 ft. above us and about 30 ft to the west.  The craft was tilted on a 45 degree to the ground.  It leveled off and stayed motionless for a few minutes.  It then began to move at about 5 mph directly over our heads until it stopped across the street a few inches above some power lines.  It wobbled slightly as it hovered in this position for about 15 minutes.  During this time I threw a rock at the craft but was unable to reach it.  I shouted to the other boy to notify some adults residing in the nearby houses but he did not want to leave the area.  I crossed the street to a park about 50 ft away from the craft and sat on the grass without taking my eyes off the craft.  After about 15 minutes the craft started to move away from the power lines at a speed of about 5 mph and ascended over my head, disappearing into the clouds. The next morning, just before sunrise, I was visisted in my bedroom by a man in black standing at the foot of my bed.  I heard a sound, which woke me up, like many bees buzzing.  Very small dust-like particles were swarming at the foot of my bed.  The particles converged forming the image of the man in black.  He was translucent, ghost-like, and wore a black suit.  He had white hair in a pompadore style.  He did not make a noise but moved his right arm in a slow upward motion of greating.  A whiteish, blue light was emited from his direction.  I was so scared that I hid under the covers of my bed in terror.  I must of finaly fell asleep and when I awoke everything was back to normal.  I have never seen anything like this again.",,49.825168292682925,-99.96341138211383

I have never seen a UFO; however, my father told me an interesting sighting he had when he was in junior high school - sometime in 1948-1950 - in Korea.  It was during the daytime when he saw a bright bluish-green light in the sky.  It was so bright that it seemed to light up the whole area even in daylight.  It seemed to be hovering in the sky and my father assumed that it must have been a comet that was flying directly towards him so that it created the illusion of hovering.  It disappeared after a while, and he never told anyone about it because it was so strange.  Also, he noted that there seemed to be some sort of cylindrical/prism-like shape inside the light and sketched it out for me. I happened to be flipping though a book on UFOs and noticed a blurb about Project Twinkle and realized that the dates and descriptions matched exactly.  So, I guess that this means that the perceived phenomena was not restricted solely to the American Southwest. Also, my father is highly rational and pragmatic and doesn't indulge in thoughts about the paranormal.  Neither of us previously knew anything about Project Twinkle.  The perfect match between his description and dates with the Project Twinkle sightings confirms that what he saw was real. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1948-1950 is approximate.

Finally, just as suddenly as it landed it took off and was gone.  Everyone who had been present for the event and had been told that the incident was to be classified top secret and that they would not speak of it to anyone. It also interesting to note that when my mother told me about this she said that during the time they were stationed at walker no one had ever mentioned the original Roswell incident.

I can't be specific as to the shape of any craft but the lights were clearly visible. They moved back and forth in sinc then they started to take off from the formation each craft going a different way. My boyfriend(Mike) and I and my sister decided to chase one.  I don't remember how we were able to jump in the car and keep track of the craft but now I feel that the craft was somehow waiting for us as if it was going to ""guide"" us. I remember seeing a pure blue round light shine down on the grass next to the road we were on. (left side).You could see through the light clearly and it illuminated the grass next to the road.  I felt as if we were driving 100mph but the speedometer registered about 35 mph!

I had never seen such a pure bright intense light before! I just remember thinking ""pure"".  Mike was trying to look up to see if he could make out any kind of craft and drive at the same time but he told me just recently (he is now my ex-husband) that he was unable to really see it.  I wish I had looked up!I believe my sister was unable to see anything because she was on the passenger side of the car.  After we had followed it for what seemed like awhile I was overcome with intense fear and told Mike to stop.  I realized what it was doing (leading us out into the country).As soon as Mike hit the brakes it shot up into the sky. It was dark which made it difficult to really see but we could see the light disappear and it seemed as though I was able to ""perceive"" it. At that point we were able to get out of the car and look up into the night sky. It was a dark object. The red lights appeared again. As we watched it bank to the left a jet approached it from behind and followed it. They both disappeared in the distance. The next day the paper said what we had seen was ""swamp gas""! I don't think so. It was so long ago but you've stated on the Jeff Rense radio program that no matter when they happened these sightings should be reported.  I'm sorry I can't fill in some of the details but I will tell you that this was REAL and it scared the heck out of me! !

They had lights on them that changed in Sync from blue to green. They darted around each other for about 10-15 seconds before I lost track of them.

I am now 50 years old and have never reported this although I have mentioned it to a few people I know. I was at that time a military dependent.  My father was stationed at Lajes AFB,Azores.  I was camping out at the school grounds on the air base with four of my friends from school.  Ages ranged from 13 years old to 17 years old.  It was a summer night and the sky above was as clear and full of stars as it could be.  We were commenting to neach other that it looked as if we could see every star in the heavens.  As we were gazing upward one of my friends said in a completely astonished tone that one of the stars was moving.  We thought he was crazy and were kidding him till he pointed it out to the rest of us and sure enough that bright light was moving slowly across the sky from right to left.  We followed it's progress wondering if it could be a plane although it didn't look like any plane any of us had seen before and being Air force dependents we had all seen a lot of planes.  The bright light appeared to be very high in the sky and when it stopped it looked exactly like a star.  It stopped and started a couple of times and all of us had our eyes glued on it then it started moving again and kept moving to the left across our night time horizon toward the atlantic ocean.  A wing of the school was about to block our view and we raced to keep it in sight, falling down stairs and hills as we kept looking up.  We did manage to keep it in sight till we got around the building.  We got there just in time to see it stop. It started to move again very slowly then to all our amazment another one, lower in the horizon, started to move from left to right while the original one kept moving from right to left.  We thought the second one was a star till it started moving.  The two lights moved toward each other till one was right above the other then they momentarily stopped before the one higher in the sky moved down.  the lower one moved up until they joined ! to becom e one light in the sky.  We stood entanced not daring to look away.  Then the two separated in the exact oposite manner in which they joined ( a reverse Z).  The higher one streaked away to the east the lower one to the west.  They moved at an incedible speed as each moved out of sight in opposite directions completely gone from our horizon, our line of sight now totally unobscured for miles.  We agreed amoungst ourselves not to mention it for fear of ridicule from our peers but I'll never forget it.  The next day one of the guys that was there said there was a report on the base radio station that a ufo had been detected by the base radar the night before.  I didn't hear that report and I never heard anything else about the incident.  I haven't seen anything before or since that time but I'll never forget it and I know UFO's are for real.

My brother was around 12 years old and the neighbor was a male around 40 at the time.  We lived within 5-8 miles of Seymore-Johnson Airforce Base and were used to B-52's and Tankers flying directly over just prior to landing.  On this day, 3 to 5 tankers were landing one behind the other with approximately 20-30 sec. between them.  When the first one flew over, (which is about 1/2 mile up), my brother and I and the neighbor saw a round object, no color, just black, hovering just outside of the flight path, but at the same altitude as the tankers.  It was approx. the size of the horizontal tail section of the tanker, not very large.  It kept it's position until the last tanker flew over and then the object instantaneously began flying along side the tanker at the same speed.  This means it went from zero speed to whatever speed the tankers were flying, I'm guessing 200 mph.  The object followed the tanker until it went behind a row of trees.  The object did not seem to be making any sounds of it's own at least different from the tankers, but then the tankers were very loud and the object could have been making some kind of sound.  We told our parents who didn't seem too concerned and we never discussed it again.  We know it wasn't a bird or balloon, but it was an aircraft without wings, round or spherical and could go from zero to 200 mph. instantaneously.  We did not call the base either.

Early Saturday morning of May 26th around 0100, I went outside for some fresh air and gaze at some stars. It was very nice outside so I went back in to tell my girlfriend to come out and see a very beautiful nightsky, since we're both avid stargazers. She came out and I went back inside for a few minutes, as I watching TV, she ran in the house to grab the binoculars, saying she's seeing strange lights flying around. She ran in again and told me to hurry up and come out. OK, OK I said to myself, probably a airplane or something. I waited for a commercial to come on and went outside. She excitedly gave me the binoculars and pointed to the direction of these lights. Before raising the binocs to my eyes, I saw a couple of flashes in the distance, low on the horizon maybe 20 to 30 degrees up. As I looked in the glasses, sure enough, a flashing & dancing light, blinking reds, whites and blues. The direction we were looking was a SSE direction from our patio. It was flashing on & off changing colors and moving so erraticly, I knew right away I was seeing something strange, not an airplane, a star, or planet. We're both amature astronomers and look at the nightsky alot, we both never seen anything close to this! My girlfriend had been watching this object for about 10 minutes before me, and I observed this for about 10 minutes myself. The way this light was moving around was so strange, blinking and showing up in a different direction, but staying in 1 general area the whole time we watched it. I strated getting dimmer towards the end and slowly sank below a distant tree and disappeared. We both are clueless on what this was, a definante UFO dancing under a very beautiful Mars and flashing in and around a rising Sagittarius constellation. Just Incredible! I thought about this websight right away since I reported a fireball a few months earlier. Low and behold!

The points grew short then long (At first I thought this might be a new two tailed comet). I took my view finder off of my telescope and observed that the object was divided into three colors. The left edge was purple, the center was lime green, and the right was an orange/yellow color. Couldn't utilize my telescope due to the Tripod being attached to our Jet Ski. As we continued for our Arizona destination, all inside the truck kept observing it. At this time it was fully dark. Small cloud formations were seen moving under the object at various intervals, until it just disappeared.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,33.8974,-107.02609999999999

Exact date unrecorded. I have hesitated to say anything up until now.  I work at a hospital in Midland Michigan on midnight shift.  I was outside on break walking west on Sugnet street at a little after 3:00 a.m. At the intersection of Valley Drive and Sugnet street I looked to the west up above the trees ahead of me.  It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were out.  I saw a VERY BRIGHT star hanging stationary just above the angle of the tree tops.  I thought maybe it was Venus, but it was VERY BRIGHT, too bright to be Venus.  It was so unusual that I stopped and just stood watching it. I had never seen anything like it in my life.  All of a sudden, over a period of 5 to 7 seconds the light gradually dimmed.  It dimmed down to approximately the same brightness as the numerous background stars.  It either dimmed, or it was possibly moving directly away from me at high speed.  There was no way to tell.  I kept my eyes on it, and suddenly it started MOVING slowly to the right (south) at a constant rate.  It moved for about 15 seconds and then stopped again.  I still had my eyes on it. At that point I pulled out my pocket laser that I carried to ping deer with when I'm out on break, and using some twigs high up in the trees across the street as an aiming aid, I started pinging it with my laser. I was zinging it pretty good, but got no noticable response.  I then lost track of which speck it was amongst the faint stars.  I thought about it for awhile after returning to my work area, and decided to call Midland 911.  I asked if they had had any reports of strange lights in the sky that night.  The gal said, ""No, why did you see something?""  I responded, ""Yes.""  ""Do you want to talk about it?"" she asked.  I hesitated, and then thought what the heck, and I told her.  She was very interested in all the details.  I told her it was really weird.  Neither she nor I knew what to do with the report, so I said ""Just put it in the log,"" and we both laughed.  Later in the shift, around 4 or 5am, someone told me ! that the re had been two ladies standing outside of the Labor and Delivery entrance smoking.  They were under the parking lot lights and saw nothing but total darkness above them, however, they HEARD what sounded to them like something passing overhead in the darkness.  Whatever it was, they said it sounded BIG, it was flying low, and it was moving FAST.  Come to find out, THAT incident occurred about ten minutes AFTER I was pinging the mysterious light in the sky with my pocket laser.  It felt really strange when I suddenly realized that the two incidents may have been connected.  It sounded to me like whatever I saw and pinged with my laser maybe came back for a closer inspection of the hospital campus with its lights off.  Maybe.  I hesitated to post this report up until now, because I didn't record the exact date that it happened, but after reading the sighting posted out of Sanford Michigan I decided to break silence and submit this report of what I experienced (as well as the two ladies outside smoking ten minutes later).  Nothing else unusual was noted.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,43.62923466666667,-84.29416711111112

My family and I were waiting to watch the fireworks display in Colby Park, Windsor Heights (Des Moines), Iowa.  We were facing west, watching the sun set.  As the fireworks began, I found I was drawn to a bright red light just to the right of the fireworks.  I pointed it out to my husband and we speculated on it.  If it was moving, it was very slowly towards us because we couldn't discern much, if any, motion.  We thought it must be a plane and tried to focus on the fireworks.  But we kept being drawn back to it because it wasn't behaving like any plane we'd seen and it didn't seem to be at the right altitude either.  It stayed there a long time and we heard others around us pointing it out as well.  It was there through the whole display and possibly longer (we had to get the children home). Later, the local free paper ran an article on a local UFO investigator and the recent sighting.  The report mentioned the light moving from West Des Moines to Windsor Heights and that it was seen to have dropped 1 or 2 objects (flashing red lights, I believe they said), but we hadn't seen that.  Of course, looking near and through fireworks likely obscured any other blinking red lights!  Many people in the city saw it, since so many of us were out for the holiday shows.  A follow-up report in the same paper said that it could not have been a plane, fireworks, weather balloon, etc.  There is no explanation as of yet.  I am probably just one of many voices reporting this sighting, but I thought I'd add what we saw that night in case it helps.

We were returning from getting some food when we stopped to talk to some people at a house party. As we were talking a light caught my attention. I looked up to the South/South West where I saw what appeared to be a light that grew and was glowing a brilliant white. As I continued to watch the light, it travelled in a North/North East direction and began to fade to a cool star blue colour. I continued to watch for the light but it became so faint that I could no longer see it. The speed of the light was relativly quick, I could judge the speed because I could see it passing in front of the stars. I am an airline maintenance technician at Pearson Airport in Toronto. I am used to seeing a/c in the sky. At first I thought it may have been an a/c on approach to Pearson since I was only 100km from the airport. However as the light dimmed I looked for evidence of strobe lights, position lights or navigation lights and there were none present. Also the altitude of the object was very high, not characteristic of an a/c on approach to Pearson. In fact the size of the light and the colour after the brightness dimmed looked just like a star. I would have easily have mistaken it for a star. And finally as an employee of Pearson Airport in Toronto, ON. I know for a fact that the airport has a curfew on aircraft traffic between the times of 12:30am to 06:30am, therefore it is unlikly than an a/c would be approaching Pearson with a landing light on. A/C do not fly with these bright lights on unless they are landing. I am going to try and get in touch with some friends at Air Traffic Control to see if their was traffic in the area at this time.

Dad was driving, mom was laying down snoozing in the back seat of the car.  I was in the right front passenger seat. We were going up a hill and off to our left suddenly a large light came on and lit up the hill and the inside of our car.  Dad pulled over and stopped the car and told mom to get up.  The light went out.  There was no sound, nothing then the light came back on again and off again and I guess took off. This thing was round and was roughly as big as our car.  The light it emitted was rather like looking at a brilliant silver dollar, it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  We could make out no distinct features and it made no sound.  The area we were in is the Peace River Valley and the bank at that location falls away steeply about 600-700'.  The evening was dark, no light, no snow on the ground but there were a few large lazy flakes falling.  My dad went to the RCMP and asked if they had ""heard of a helicopter in trouble or anything"" no they hadn't and dad never persued it.  My dad and mom owned their own business at the time and were very reliable people and wished to remain that way so we never talked outside the family about it but privately we thought it was a UFO not from this world and that they were here checking the mega project that was underway at that time (the W.A.C. Bennett Dam Project) where before there had been nothing but a few farms in this remote area of British Columbia, Canada. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,,

Then he returned and we wanted to know where he had been, his reply was to the shop.  He did not realise how long he had been away.  Then my son started talking about where he had been, he described somemen and what I realised later was very much like the inside of a space ship.  He did say what the men had done but to be honest I cant remember that bit. This child was too young less than 3 years old at the time so he had no prior knowledge to draw from.  It has been on my mind ever since and I am glad that I have told you now at least I have shared the experience.  He was not harmed in any way but was always intelligent as a child.

At the time I was by myself in the back yard of a friend whose home was at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Skies were clear with just a few wispy clouds. While admiring the sun setting over the mountains, I noticed four bright spheres of light traveling due west at a high altitude and a fairly high rate of speed. Because the sun was reflecting off of the surface of these crafts, I could not make out any details. However, one craft was much larger than the other three and it traveled in a straight line. What made this sighting unusual was that the other three craft kept darting around the larger craft, which made no sense. Understand that I was in the Air Force at the time, and I worked at NORAD inside of Cheyenne Mountain where my group analyzed secret data about new satellite launces worldwide. At first when I observed these bright craft, I thought that three fighters were trailing behind a tanker plane to refuel. However, I soon realized that none of the craft were lining up behind the tanker. In addition, these craft as a group did not form either a V or diamond or box pattern, which is required by military law. Instead, the three smaller craft seemed as if they were ""hotdogging,"" and at the rate of speed they were traveling and as close as they seemed grouped, this struck me as very dangerous. I watched these craft, scratching my head all the time, for three to five minutes until they disappeared over the mountain range. I later discussed this event with some of Air Force friends, but none of them did not see the event nor had they witnessed anything like it. This event prompted me to go out and by several books about UFO sightings. While paging through one of the books, I came across a chapter about ""mother ships,"" and that they had been observed to have smaller craft darting around them. As soon as I read that, I realized that that was what I had witnessed. I will admit that it's possible that three fighters were hotdogging around a tanker, but I guarantee you if the pilots had been caught, they! would h ave been court-martialed.  By the way, I was in the Air Force for eight years, and though I witnessed hundreds of all types of aircraft in the skies, I never saw an event like I did on that one particular day.

Late summer/early fall before dusk.Object as described passed over town headed in general direction of thr park (nw).The year was probably 1964 or 65-66.I was a toddler but distinctly recall the object passing overhead dissappearing beyond the treetops in the distance. My mother witnessed this, and my sister(3yrs older)-but sister doesn't recall.The area was a hotbed of activity in the 60's. My father a physician and formerly, an airforce pilot during Korean war recounts that many of the sitings corroborated ufos generally travelling northbound following rt98. Bray road is one of the highest elevations in the county and people living there and in the area of Lost Nations witnessed several objects. One physician Dr. Oestriche (now deceased) saw lights back in the field and found circular depressions when he investigated the next day. Krueggers, who still live there have mentioned seeing things also. It was so common and widespread knowledge, that people used to park up and do!wn Bray Rd. to ufo watch. The last I've heard is that there is a dome shaped building 1/2 way up Bray rd. which is under 24hr guard. Even the farmers next door to it don't know why it's there. I hope this old archival info may be useful. It is definitely truthful and deserving of scrutiny. One other point (of potential interest) is that Arcade is pretty rural-about one hour south of Buffalo; the only other interesting thing of note in the vicinity is the West Valley nuclear facility (about 15 miles south ). This was being built in the early 60's. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,42.5856,-78.3869

UPON OUR RETURN TRIP FROM ALBANY NY, OUR GROUP WAS APPROACHING THE THROGS NECK BRIDGE FROM THE NORTH (BRONX) SIDE.  WE ALL NOTICED SOMETHING FROM A DISTANCE OF 5 OR SO MILES AWAY WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER THE BRIDGE.  I SAID IT MUST BE A ZEPPELIN BECAUSE OF ITS HUGE SIZE IN RELATION TO THE BRIDGE, WHICH IT APPEARED TO BE DIRECTLY OVER.   AS WE APPROACHED THE BRIDGE, THE WHITE LIGHTS AROUND THE CENTER GIRTH OF THE OBJECT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THE SHIP WAS SPHERICAL AND IN SOMEWHAT OF A SUSPENDED STATE.  THE LIGHTS WERE CLEARLY OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED TYPE THAT SURROUNDED THE CENTER, AND WIDEST PART OF THE OBJECT, LIKE A STRING OF PEARLS.   AS WE WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THE BRIDGE RAMP ALL THE PEOPLE IN EVERY CAR HAD THEIR EYES FIXED UPWARD TO THE SHIP THAT WAS JUST UP AHEAD, HOVERING. WE LATER REMARKED THAT IT WAS A WONDER NOBODY GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT THAT NIGHT SINCE NO ONE WAS WATCHING WHERE THEY WERE GOING. WE WERE HONKING OUR HORNS TO GET OTHER CARS' ATTENTION AND WHEN WE DID THEY WOULD LOOK AT US WITH THE SAME TERRIFIED FACES WE PROBABLY HAD ON OURSELVES AND WE WOULD NOD TO EACH OTHER THAT SLOW KIND OF UP AND DOWN 'YES RESPONSE' THAT CLEARLY CONVEYED ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND FEAR.   THEN THE CENTER OF THE SHIP STARTED TO SPIN, WHICH WE COULD CLEARLY SEE BECAUSE THE RING OF LIGHTS WERE MOVING IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION.   AS WE DROVE CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE THE SHIP'S SIZE WAS HARD TO COMPUTE: WE COULDN'T TELL IF IT WAS 100 OR 1000 FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE BUT WE KNEW IT WAS HUGE AND IT WAS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.   THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I FELT BECAUSE WE WERE DRIVING OFF OF THE BRIDGE, ONTO THE CLEARVIEW EXPRESSWAY AND AWAY FROM WHERE THE SHIP HAD STATIONED ITSELF, WAS QUICKLY CHANGED TO JOY AND WONDERMENT BECAUSE THE SHIP BEGAN FLYING ALONG THE SAME ROUTE, AND QUICKLY MOVED AHEAD OF US.   WHEN WE GOT ONTO THE LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY (LIE)THE SHIP WAS JUST IN FRONT OF US AND WAS DARTING FORWARD AND BACK! , UP AND DOWN AND SIDEWAYS ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY.  AT ONE POINT IT WAS JUST A FEW HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US AND WE COULD SEE HOW HUGE IT WAS: IT EASILY SPANNED THE WIDTH OF THE LIE-WHICH IS 6 LANES WIDE AND HAS A ONE-LANE WIDE DIVIDER BETWEEN THE EAST AND WEST TRAFFIC LANES AS WELL AS BETWEEN THE MAIN LANES AND A SERVICE ROAD OF 2 LANES ON EACH SIDE OF THE EXPRESSWAY.[13 LANES IN ALL]  IF WE HAD TO GUESS, IT WOULD BE THAT THE SHIP'S SPAN WAS AT LEAST 200 FEET AT ITS WIDEST POINT.  THE SHIP LITERALLY FOLLOWED THE LIE WHICH WAS HEAVILY TRAFFICKED, ESPECIALLY IN OUR DIRECTION. WE WERE ABLE TO WATCH IT UNTIL IT LITERALLY MADE A RIGHT TURN SOUTHWARD AND FLEW ABOVE THE SEAFORD-OYSTER BAY EXPRESSWAY, UNTIL IT SHOT AHEAD WITH SUCH AMAZING SPEED THAT IN AN INSTANT IT WAS A MASSIVE UFO THEN A BLIP THEN GONE.  WE HAD CAMERAS WITH US BUT THEY DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING WHEN WE DEVELOPED THE FILM, WE CALLED UP THE THEN-ACTIVE A/F BASE IN WESTHAMPTON BUT THEY DENIED SEEING ANYTHING OR THAT ANYBODY ELSE HAD CALLED WITH SUCH A SITING.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN WE CALLED THE LOCAL PAPER, NEWSDAY, THE FOLLOWING DAY.  SO, OVER TIME IT HAS BECOME A STORY WE HAVE TOLD OUR CHILDREN AND VERY FEW OTHERS BUT BOTH MY BROTHER AND I KNOW WHAT WE SAW AND ALTHOUGH OUR OTHER PASSENGERS HAVE GONE THEIR SEPARATE WAYS, I KNOW THEY TOO WILL NEVER FORGET THE EXPERIENCE.   I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT THE DATE BUT IT WAS JUST BEFORE THE START OF COLLEGE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS AT ALBANY STATE UNIVERSITY FROM WHICH WE WERE RETURNING.

At first I believed it to be a police helicopter or a satalite of some form, this was until it began moving very quickly to the east. The speed inwhich it moved ruled out a helicopter and its direction ruled out a satalite as they move with the Earth to the west. We looked through the telescope and saw a pyramid shaped object with four red lights, one on every corner. The object seemed to be rotating as it moved. The rotating increased in speed just before it moved away at a speed which seemed to be very slow although the object became very small very quickly, this leads me to the conclusion that the object was moving at an incredible speed away from us.

On 5/28/2001 at 10:10PM CT in Schaumburg, IL I witnessed the following event while walking my dog in the office park where I work.   Visibility was moderate to good and the moon was clearly visible in the high SW sky.  I normally witness slow moving lights at least every other night which I generally assume are low orbiting satellites or other orbiting man made objects visible to the naked eye. This night proved to be no exception when I sited a slow moving light, which came into my visible horizon from the center of the constellation Orion on about a 15 degree arc westbound.  The slower then normal movement and higher than normal arc suggested a higher orbit to me.  The light was of the same power relative to the constellation, constant, clear and easily discernable.  After approximately 35 seconds the light was approximately 20 degrees past straight above me in my eastern horizon when a very fast moving light appeared overhead (I was lying on my back, looking up and slightly NE so ""overhead"" means S/SE).  This light crossed from my Southern horizon a few degrees east of due north to the first light in not more than 5 seconds. Its  speed initially startled me. This was too slow and deliberate and visible for too long to be falling debris or a meteorite.   Also, it was about twice as bright as the first light.  I took these facts to mean it was a very low altitude satellite.  My heart literally skipped a beat as the odds of catching two visible satellites crossing paths flashed in my mind.  Rather than simply cross paths, however, they met exactly.  The brighter, fast moving light was not visible after the intersection and the slower dimmer light seemed more slow and more dim and in fact disappeared within another 10 seconds.  While the first of these facts may be explained by the slow moving object exceeding my eastern horizon, it was at least 1/3 higher on that horizon when I lost site of it than in the Western horizon when I first sited it.  I see no simple explanation for the disappearance of the fast mover 20 degrees past directly overhead when I sited it at least 90 degrees in the Southern Horizon. I returned to the site today with a compass and took accurate readings from the very place I sat the night before (the grass was still pressed down).  The data above should be exact to within about 5 degrees.  The amazing fact is that I did not look at my watch.  A friend did call me when I just left the office on foot with my dog and the phone log read 9:45 on my friends phone.  It takes me 7 minutes to walk to our spot and as it was chilly night here, I started thinking about leaving after only 15 minutes. I own a software consulting company here in Schaumburg Illinois and consult for a specialty coatings company that caters to the U.S. Navy and U.S.A.F. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally skilled observer and reporter of objective fact.  Under ordinary circumstances, we would have assumed that a witness who reported such an event would be describing two satellites, which happened to be visible in proximity to one another.  However, the witness in this case had allowed for such a possibility, and had rejected that on the basis of facts of the case.   Further, we observe that an orbitting body in polar orbit, traveling to the north, would not enter the Earth's shadow.  We share the witness's interest in this sighting.

I was driving west on highway 10, north of the Boundary Bay airport. The sky was absolutely clear with no clouds. I saw a small propeller powered plane, heading west. It was probably getting ready to land or had just taken off from the airport. I suddenly noticed an object in the same part of the sky (from my viewing perspective), as the airplane. At first I thought it was a passenger jet flying at a considerable altitude higher (and further away), than the propeller plane. The more I looked at it, the more I thought that it did not look like a jet, and it appeared to be hanging motionless in the sky (although I was of course, moving west at about 80 km per hour). It was quite light colored (whitish), but I also thought it had a bit of a silvery look to it. I did not see any winglike features, but the object did not look round or ellipsoid. Plus it did not really seem to have any distinct shadowed area in its underside. I very much wanted to stop to get a better look, but I didn't want to pull over on the narrow highway shoulder, so I drove on to the Delta Community Hall intersection (keeping an eye on the object as best as I safely could while operating my vehicle) and drove north a short distance, where I found a spot to pull over and stop. I got out of my vehicle for a better look, but I could no longer find the object in the sky. I thought it quite odd that it had disappeared so fast, when it had not appeared to be moving when I had observed it just a minute before. My best estimate of the object position would be that it was probably at least 2000 foot elevation, (and quite possibly a mile or two elevation) and appeared to be situated directly above Boundary Bay, between White Rock and Point Roberts. I would estimate that the object was probably at least five meters across. It was situated in a SSW direction from my viewing position, about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon. My estimate on the objects height is partly based on the fact that it had a far away and indistinct look (contour and edges obscured by distance, no sharp outline, color contrasts or shadow).  I probably observed it over a distance of about one half a mile, without it changing significantly in direction, indicating the object was potentially moving in a westerly direction and close by (less than a mile away), or more likely, not moving much in east/west direction and further away (which matches perceived distance perception). A high flying jet, moving directly away from my observing position and increasing in elevation would explain the lack of movement. But this would not account for its fairly sudden disappearance (although the object seemed far away, it did not appear to be moving away at a fast rate). The perceived shape of the object did not match an end view of a jet, although unfortunately, I never had a chance to get a really good look at it.

I had driven east on Sepulveda Blvd and turned north onto Madrona (Prairie Ave), traveling north. As I was passing Del Amo Fashion Mall, I casually glanced up at the sky and saw what I first thought was the exhaust trail of a jet plane. I was going to dismiss it but it looked kind of odd. It was white and kind of short and stubby looking, like the plane had just turned on the exhaust.  The shape reminded me of the forked tail of a bird.  The thing that was most unusual was that it appeared to be at an angle that looked like the ""jet"" was diving.  This was an angle of about 60 degrees or more from the horizion.  It was sighted to my left, northwest of where I was driving. I thought it was somewhere near LAX Airport or over the ocean near the airport. Because of that angle, I began to keep my eye on it because it looked like something that was crash-diving.  I thought that it may be a meteor or space junk re-entering the atmosphere but it did not appear to move.  The trail did not get any longer and it did not dissapate.  It did appear that the two tails were merging into one. At this time I looked at my clock and the time was 7:55 PM PDT.  When I noticed that this ""exhaust cloud"" had not moved I paid closer attention because it did not act like a jet or anything leaving an exhaust trail behind.  Then at about 8:00 the exhaust cloud appeared to move!  At first I thought it was an optical illusion since I was still driving so I closed my eyes quickly and then looked back at it and it was moving!  The whole ""cloud"" had began to move! What I thought was the leading end (pointing downward) started to arch around, pulling the whole ""cloud"" with it into a horizontal line!  As it moved it began to glow and changed colors from white to a  bright orange-white line that then remained stationary in the sky glowing orange-white.  At this point I came to a stop light where there were cars ahead of me that cau! sed the view to be obscured.  When we started to move again, this ""line""  was still horizontal to the ground but it also seemed to be lower in the sky than before.  Unfortunately as I moved toward Hawthorne CA, the houses and trees were more dense so it was more difficult to see this object.  I continued to sight it until I reached the area of Marine Ave and Prairie Ave where it was then obscured by trees and buildings.  I stopped at my home for less than 5 minutes and then tried to spot it again as I drove toward the 105 freeway but I could no longer see the object.  I don't know how it moved away or if it did but it was no longer visible.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

We did not have an air conditioner at the time, so we had all the windows and doors open trying to stay as cool as possible. When it happened it did so very quickly. As I said we were watching TV, with the TV on the north side of the room, the doorway to the kitchen on the west and the exit to the bedroom and the front door on the south. As we were watching TV (except my mother who was looking into the kitchen) a 6inch sphere of pale orange light entered through the kitchen window, and traveling very quickly came into the living room, left through the north doorway and went out the front door. It happened so quickly that I turned to my mother and asked her if she saw that, which she did. Apparently my father and brother who sitting closer to the TV, and who were directly under its flightpath (6ft off the floor) didn't notice anything. As I said it was pale orange and glowed, and as my mother put it (who is present at this writing, and from whom the bulk of this report comes) ""it looked like a ball of fire"". It took about 3 seconds for it to cover the distance it traveled (About 10ft through the kitchen, 6ft into the living room, turned and traveled about 8ft into the bedroom, crossed it (7ft) and went out the door.). Also it moved in a straight line as it came through the kitchen, then with a slight up and down bobbing motion as it crossed the living room, then again traveled in a straight line out the front door.

I sensed it was heading toward me so  I ran into my roomates room to wake him up.  The next memory I had was standing outside looking up at the bottom of a craft from about 15 feet.  I can still hear the sound of the engine as it moved away slowly.  My roomate was standing in the doorway and looked frightened.  At the time I called the Air Force Station and they suggested I report it to a UFO ""club"" or something.  I called and they sent someone out, but I never filled out the form.  They had told me that I would get a pin or something and become an ""Official"" member. I was not interested in that. The interviewer was weird. I did, however see a report in the paper, Orange County Register, the day after that a number of people had reported seeing a UFO from Los Angeles to San Diego.  (Laguna is in the middle).  Years later I went back to get a copy of the article, but left it behind after a divorce. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of three reports by this witness.

At the time, I saw an article the following day in the Santa Ana Register that many others had spotted UFOs in that sky that evening.  For fun, I called the library a few weeks ago and they found the article and it is Dated October 24, 1973.  I had put down September 1 as I knew it was sometime around then when I was living there.  I do not know if the actual date is important, if so, could you change it?  Also, would you like to have a copy of the newspaper article?  Also, while searching for  the one I had remembered seeing, they found another dated October 18th about a man that had been frightened and reported seeing a UFO to police.  They are sending me that article as well. The librarian said that they had also come across an article from 1991 making reference to a number of sightings made in Orange County in 1973.

This report is in response to the 9/20/73 incident in Mansfield , Ohio which was reported January 1999. I have just now read this and am compelled to send in the account of my observation , which is remarkable only in that it occurred one mile NW from the location of the 9/20/73 incident. Regrettably, I can only narrow the date to between 1972 and 1974, though it did occur during the regular school year. I was a pupil of the Woodland Elementary school at the time. It was early to mid morning with clear skies. I was leaning with my back against a SW wall looking south when I looked up. I do not know why I looked up, but when I did I immediately saw an oval image directly overhead moving slowly from west to east. It was pure white with a slight homogenous glow over its shape.  The major axis of the oval was several full moon widths long and the minor axis was about half of the major. The edges were slightly  fuzzy due to the glow. The image had no colors or marks and I did not hear any sound from it. The lack of markings or sharp edges prevented me from judging itâs altitude, but I did have the impression that it was low, maybe tree top level.  I observed this for three to six seconds until it passed out of view behind the school roof. I paused for just enough seconds to say to myself, âwhat in the...?â, then ran away from the building expecting to see it again. If it had maintained itâs velocity, I would have definitely seen it in the clear sky, but it was gone. Other kids were outside, but none were looking up. I wish I could provide a more accurate date, but I do not even recall what season it was. I am fairly sure of the year range, so there is a chance that it may have been 9/20/73.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,40.74201321839081,-82.54685747126437

I was very entranced by this and they were extremely clear to the naked eye.  They did not move sideways, but as stated above.  I'm not sure how high they were, but would guess about 3-5 thousand feet up, about the height of a plane at the mid-line of take-off.  When I arrived home, my roommates stated that there was something on TV that UFOs were seen by a number of people who had called this in.  I told them I saw them, and they said they would not have believed it if I hadn't said that as they were in disbelief.  I will never forget it.  I haven't seen anything like it before nor since.  What was so outstanding to me was not only the shape of the objects, but the beautiful silver look without any glare from the bright sunlight.

This sighting occured in a rural area 4.5 miles west of Avoca, Ia. I was home on leave from the Coast Guard, and was visiting my mother and step-father who lived on a farm. Earlier in the day I went to visit a friend on his farm. My friend's farm is located in a hollow area between two hills, therefore I couldn't see much of the surrounding sky. I drove east 1.5 miles to a road that runs north and south. When I turned to go north, I started looking around, and noticed a bright white light low in the southwestern sky. The evening was crystal clear, because we had an ice storm the night before, and the night after an ice storm is usually clear. At first I thought it was an aircraft moving toward me with its landing lights on. To the southwest is Eppley Airport in Omaha, Nebraska, and Offut Air Force Base which is near Omaha. I am also an amature astronimer, and I know there were no planets or bright stars in that area of the sky on that date. I stopped the car and watched the light for a few minutes, then I drove onto the next road and turned west. As I drove home, I noticed when I crested the top of each hill, the light was still in the southwest. The object didn't appear to have moved any, because I took visual measurements using the farm yard lights near the object. When I got home I took out the binoculars, and tried to see if I could make out what it was. All I could see was a very bright white light. I put the binoculars in the house, and went back outside to watch the light. My step-father came out of the house, and wanted to go to town. The town he wanted to go to is Shelby. As we drove west down the hill I saw the bright white light go out, and the object turned to what appeared to be a reddish glow which appeared to envelop the object.  The object went from a standstill to a very high rate of speed in just a few seconds. I watched it travel north and inside of a minute or two it was gone. I said to my step-father that the bright white light that I had been watching was acting strange. It was bright white and dead still one second, then it turned red and sped off in the next second. I said to my step-father the U.S. doesn't have any aircraft that can do that. He who is one not to believe in anything strange unless it can be proved, said it was just an airplane or something. I thought it was an ""or something"". The next day on the front page of the Council Bluffs Nonpariel newspaper was a story about the object I had seen the night before. A woman was driving with her children down a country road to her father-in-law's house to stay with him, because her house didn't have any electricity. The woman said she was driving west and saw the object. She said that when she went over the next hill, she drove right under the object. She said when she drove under the object the bright white light went out, it turned red and sped off to the north. This is occured exactly at the same time I was watching it. I will never forget this sighting as long as I live.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,41.4841,-95.3617

We were approximately one mile out of town from Hopkinsville and had come to the end of the Concord Lane.  You had to turn either left or right onto the Greenville Road.  As we both looked to the right toward town we saw three saucer shaped craft several hunderd feet in the air and looked as if they were between a quarter to a half mile from us.  The craft had multicolored lights on the underneath side that sequentially flashed.  The sighting scared both of us of course, and I instinctively turned left and continued heading out of town. We were both looking back to see what the craft were doing and noticed they appeared to be following us.  About a quarter of a mile down the Greenville Road was a secondary road.  We turned right onto the Antioch Road and noticed that all three craft were still following us.  Approximately one to two miles out this road was a small lake.

This really caught our attention as we didn't believe any jet could do this. This went on for possibly 10 minutes and then just seemed to disappear as if fading away.  Later the same night, guessing 1 hr. later we were discussing how bright this particular star was, and how it didn't seem to moving with the passing of time.  Several minutes later, to our astonishment, this star began getting bigger and within a few seconds was guessed to be about half the size of the moon, as if it were falling on us.

The sky was clear and we were traveling in a westward direction. The object was at about the ""11:00"" position in a south west direction from our position. Because of my interest and background in Ufology I tend to pay a little more attention to things in the sky then the average individual. I naturally assumed this was a plane ascending from the Sacramento airporrt, and was at such an angle that I could not see it's wings. As we drove for a few blocks the object seemed to hang in the air, which again I assumed that we didn't notice it's movement because ""we"" were moving. At that point we made a left turn, proceeding south and the object was now directly in front of us at about the 11:00 position.Being that we had traveled a good distance I and were a a different angle to the object, we should have seen the wings at that point. Having no reference point, I'm going to guess the size of this thing as that of a commercial aircraft as that' what I thought it was in the first place. It was a very shiny metalic and all one color, and cylindrical in shape. Well now as one might imagine, I became very excited, and pulled over to get a good look at this thing. When I did so, my vision was obstructed from some trees, so I got out of the vehicle and walked to the other side of the trees until I had that portion of the sky back in my field of view. The object was gone. Based on the rate of speed this object was traveling, and the length of time we had it in our field of view, if it was a conventional aircraft, we should have still been able to see it. So in conclusion this object was only out of our sight for a few seconds, and would have had to move at an incredible speed to be out of our field of view.

On Wednesday, May 30th, 2001, I was watching tv. When it was 9:00pm, I turned to the nightly WGN Chicago news program (courtesy of a cable channel; I'm in TN). I had decided to watch it because I wanted to see if they were going to follow up on a report they'd had the night before. Some minutes into the news cast, they began to do the weather. Before I go any further, there's something I need to explain so you can understand what I'm talking about. I have a lot of time on my hands, I guess you could say, and for about the last year or so I've been taping (with a VCR) those shots I suppose most news casts have where during the weather the screen switches to some live view of the city. I've been doing this all this time in hopes of catching something strange on tape. And Wednesday night, after a year or so of waiting, it finally paid off! So, when that sort of shot came on, I was taping it. And within seconds, I was shocked to see what I'd been waiting for all this time: a bright streak of light shot across the upper middle part of the screen and went BEHIND some buildings in the background, going INCREDIBLY fast. MUCH MUCH MUCH faster than ANY jet could go! So fast that I was only able to get a good look at it when moments later I went downstairs and used the other VCR to slow the tape down to a minimum. When it wasn't on slow motion, this is what it looked like: almost identical in appearance to a common shooting star, kind of streak-ish, but it was very different in that ITS DIRECTION MADE A HUGE CURVE!!! I couldn't believe my eyes. It (or another one) would also appear again a few seconds later, this time shooting up from the lower right hand corner of the screen and zooming just as quickly to the upper left! (AGAIN, THIS/THESE WAS NOT A SHOOTING STAR!!!) Upon playing it like I said in slow motion, it was also noticed that a third streak could easily be seen (you couldn't miss it!) coming into the picture just as the camera finally went back to the newscasters. Needless to say, I HAVE THE TAPE and I'll always keep it. I don't remember the exact time, but it was around 9:20pm CST. The streaks were a bright yellowish-white in color.

We got pretty close so we pulled into a back road two miles west of onoway we drove for a bit while keeping an eye on it . We drove until it  was a little to the left of it and it was hovering.

It then started to move westward really slowly then it was directly above us.the green and red lights were at the front of the craft. It slowly accelerated and then made an abrupt turn left heading south while the red and yellow lights were facing south so the craft didn't really rotate.it then stopped and hovered for about 15 seconds we then turned my truck around and started to head home.  I live on the other side of the highway from the back road I was on. the Craft started to follow us. We went north towards my house while the craft went northnorthwest we got home and it was still tavelling the same direction.  We got home and could not see it because it was probably behind the trees.  We jumped on the quad and drove into the field we seen it again it was coming straight at us and then stopped and hovered while the only lights we could see was orange and red beccause of the angle it was at. It then dissappeared.  we seen it aways higher and then dissappeared again. it was then higher tan before and had travelled double the distance it had before it this once more and there was like lightning that lit up the sky and the craft was gone.but there was not a cloud in the sky. we could see all the stars Thats about it but I have seen lights similar to this for the past week or two.

We were on our way back from gathering chestnuts from a farm just outside the town of Elmira, Ontario, Canada.  It was about 4pm.  After we came out of the farm field we walked down a road (walking northeastwards)  I looked and saw this object above the trees directly ahead of us.  It was about 400 feet or so away from us, it was moving very slowly towards us and up but slightly moving to our right.  It was triangular shaped.  From my position it was about the size of a baseball diamond.  Silvery/ grey in colour, it was raised in the centre, it was very smooth looking.  It made no sound at all.    I don't recall seeing any kind of windows.   It slowly moved upwards and went through the clouds and that is were I lost sight of it.  I saw it for about 4 or 5 minutes.

The family consisted of a Mother, Father and two daughters.  I remember the car was a ""Duster"". The incident happened on the way home.  There was some discussion between the parents whether or not to look for the object they had seen.  (I think one wanted to and the other did not.  Us kids really weren't paying attention yet.) We found the ""ship"" on the front yard to a farmhouse.  It had, I believe, 4 legs that were quite long (2 or 3 metres) with a sphere on top.  It was grey/metallic in colour.  The door/hatch was in the shape of (what looked like to me) a lions head. I saw the hatch start to open and the family start to get out.  The next thing I knew we were driving down the highway, singing to the radio as if nothing had happened. I always used to think of this a ""my encounter"".  But since learning more about the phenomena of ufos (through programs such as Jeff Rense and reading Missing Time by Budd Hopkins) I now suspect that a member of the family I was with was/is an abductee and that I was simply ""switched off"".  I don't know how much time is missing -- I was just a kid -- but it seemed to me at least an hour or two darker after the encounter than just before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The reason I say this is because the movie ""Jaws"" had just came out at Drive-ins and Theatres. I was double-dating with a friend of mine and we decided to go to the drive-in to see ""Jaws"". The Drive-in had Four Screens which were positioned North & South, East & West. My friends and I were waiting for the movie to start, we were facing the East Screen. The Sun was beginning to set below the Horizon which at that time the movie that was playing on the West Screen started. I had turned around in the car and was watching it when I noticed a bright object approximately 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon, West by Southwest. I thought to myself that it was a bright star. I watched it thinking to myself that this was kind of odd because it was still light. I watched it and it began to move at a high speed from West to East. I thought I was possibly watching a SR-71 aircraft from Beale A.F.B. stationed at Marysville, CA. and it was in full afterburner and this was why it was moving so fast.

At first we thought it was a prank of some kind but then we both suddenly got a strange (but exciteing) feeling. We did not see the body of this craft...only the lights. They were blue, red and green - 3 of them. They were in the shape of a saucer dish. And I remember the lights seemed to 'jiggle' a little (vibrating with no set rhythm). There was no sound. It was like this thing was on mute. As we were looking at this thing, a 4-wheel drive truck came tearing around the corner and skidded up to a stop right beside us...the driver leaned out his window and said; ""did you see that...I've been following it for 1/2 an hour!"". And we just pointed upward. Anyway, this thing suddenly disappeared and we scanned the sky and saw it off in a distance at the other end of town. It disappeared again and immediately re-appeared at the other side of town. The only other thing I remember is that it felt like this thing was right above the telephone poles. I still remember thinking that I could have thrown up a rock and hit it if I wanted too. What really surprised us was the next day when there was an article in the local newspaper stating that there were several sightings of a UFO reported to the police station. I need to go back and see if I can retrieve that article somehow (if its possible). I've never spoken of this experience (only to a few people).

It is also remarkable that the voice of speaking from that object sounds like sound of the alarm signal. Suddenly when everyone looked at around to see source of the voice, that object flying away and disappeared when the bright light covers it. And later at the same place I heard the sound as alarm signal, and about a few months later I heard clearly the voice of laughing and I saw not clearly a few images of the girls through the bamboo tree. and i talked to them that I want food and suddenly a table with a chair appeared in front of me.

During the game, a cameraman focus and zoomed-in on a couple of spinning diamond shaped objects that were over the Los Angeles Coliseum.  The network broadcasters noticed it and started talking about ""how curious"" the objects where.  The objects appeared to be metallic in structure and were hovering a few hundred feet above the staduim.  As they turned, you could make out the obvious flash of metal when the sunlight hit the sides of it.  It appeared to spin on its corner points (as if a compass - north and south) and in a left to right spin.  The cameras stayed on this for about 2 minutes and then the cameras cut back to the game.

Its been awhile . . . I was in or just out of high school and the years were between 1984-1987, (I know I was driving so probably closer to senior year of 1985), and had driven over to a friends house to hang out. We were listening to tapes and talking upstairs when the entire house began to rumble and shake. The window sills, door frames etc actually were vibrating and shaking. It sounded like a plane, low distance rumble which slowly increased.  We both ran to the window and to our amazement were shocked to see a v shaped object with wings and windows and coloered lights flying just over the tree tops of the house and development.  It had to be at least 100 feet long. Lights shot out of it hitting the ground and house. As it moved over the house we ran to the back window and looked at it.  It appeared to change shape or get smaller with long red, yellow and blue beams shining into the house windows on the first floor.  During this time my friends family had guests over and were eating in the dinning room.  We ran down the stairs to see the Dining Room flooded with these beams of colored light but no one seemed to notice us or was even aware of the lights except for my friend and I.  It was as if we were privy to see this and no one else was.  As we watched what must have seemed for awhile we noticed the lights scanned the entire inside of the home where my friends parents were entertaining.  Everyone appeared to be moving in slow motion but us. We diliberaely stayed aware from the lights.  We grabbed our car keys and ran out side to the backyard which was boardered by trees and watched as it slowing moved over the shubbery and out over some empty farmland in back.  The shape appeared to be long and rectangular but the beams of light gave it a spider like quality.  We then hoped in our car hoping to follow it, the car didn't start right away and when we got out to where we could see it again it had just head out towards NYC up into the air.  The funny part is -my friends parents didn't see anything we! re compl etely unaware of anything during the whole experience.  Needless to say, to this day my friend won't talk about it and what we saw I can not explain - just that later that summer, I and my mother were visited by a bouncing ball of blue light which slowly bounced across our backyard and then after I got back in bed appeared at my bedroom window - flooding my bedroom with an electric blue light.  My bed shock and I was paralized and unable to move unitil it left. To this day,  I do know that since I have been real little I've had experiences at seeing things and encounters up to my present age. I just don't have anyone to talk to about them or to turn to.  If anyone during 1984-1987 saw anything like this late in the evening can you please right about it.  I know this was to large for someone else not to have seen unless it was meant to happen like that.  Please note, at this point in time I would like to remain unknown.  Thank you.

It was below the horizon, so I got the feeling it was on the ground. It's color was pretty much the color of a blue street light, but it was much too big to be a street light. It was shimmering.  I thought that maybe there was a lake in that direction and the moon was reflecting off of it.  I went back to sleep, but would wake up every now and then to see if it was still there.  I am sure it was there for at least two hours, maybe more. As soon as it was light enough, I looked in that direction expecting to see a lake or a barn or house, but there was nothing there.  It couldn't have been more than a mile or so away due to the fact there were hills in the way. I estimate the object was about mini van size.

I wasn't able to determine the height of this craft because there was absolutely no sound.  There was also a definite glow to the object.

(The 70's}   We lived by a cornfield and the corn was still green, so it must have been some time during the summer.  This happened in Yorktown Indian, right beside walnut street, a few miles out side Muncie, about 40 miles from Indianapolis.  I remember that my parents would invite my grand parents over to watch the strange lights and vehicles in the sky.  I remember seeing a few cigar shaped objects in the sky my self, but this isn't the main part of my sighting.  As a kid the neighborhood children and myself would play in the cornfields.  Most of us knew about the lights, but being young we really didn't think much of it.  What we did find that that struck us as odd was a circle burned into the corn, far out in the field.  It was as I remember a perfect circle of charred corn stalks about six inches wide, and the circle was about fifteen to twenty feet across.  The corn was pressed flat, as was the unburned corn inside the circle.  We knew the field pretty well and there was no farm machinery that went through the field during those summer months.  Out side the circle were sets of footprints that led out of the circle, but not very far from it then back to the circle.  What we found so unusual about them to us was that they were maybe 4 to six inches deep, with no tread marks, the bottom of the prints were flat with no tread that would be on a normal shoe or farmers boot.  On the surface of the footprint in the dirt was something that looked like green moss.  There were no tire marks leading to or away from the circle.  The soil wasn't soft, we didn't leave prints this deep, while we ran and played in the field, and that's what we found odd also.  I brought my mother out to the site so she also witnessed it.  She didn't know what to make of it ether.  My older brother was one of us kids that saw it also.  There are no military bases in the area, or even a airport of any size, so I don't think it was some ""government project"".  As far as I know the field is still there, and Yorktown is a very small town sleepy farm town, so I don't think anything has been built over the area.

"Fast moving, silent, blue and red orb seen over Lake Conroe, Texas.",Lake Conroe,TX,1979-09-01T23:59:00,circle,10 SECONDS,"Occurred : 9/1/1979 23:59  (Entered as : 9/79 MIDNIGHT) Reported: 2/5/2001 09:54 Posted: 2/18/2001 Location: Lake Conroe, TX Shape: Circle Duration:10 SECONDS",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16172.html,"Fast moving, silent, blue and red orb seen over Lake Conroe, Texas. We were fishing on Lake Conroe for crappie about midnight in early fall.  We had a lantern out over the water to attract the fish.  It was dead quiet and no breeze whatsoever.  My father-in-law and I shifted around in our small boat and ended up virtually back to back (east to west).  The fish had quit biting for some reason, so we tried to get comfortable and be real quiet hoping the fishing frenzy we had just experienced would return.  My eyes started wandering from my fishing rod when I looked up and saw directly over me an ""orb"" moving incredibly fast.  It was perfectly round and I mean perfectly.  It was divided in half by bright ""colors"".  I believe the blue was in the front (or the direction it was heading)and the red in back.  Perception wise, it looked about half the size of the way a full moon looks to the naked eye when it close to the horizon.  . It was almost directly above me, possibly a little to my right or south.  I watched it fly by at an incredible and steady speed. What made the experience even more awesome was that it appeared just above the clouds.  There were a few small cumulus type clouds slowly passing overhead.  Each time the object passed over one of these clouds, it lit the cloud up and turned it a beautiful red and blue (the whole cloud) for about a fraction of a second.  To see those clouds light up one by one as the object streaked by was unbelievable.  What made it seem even more eerie was the fact the there was absolutely no sound from the object and everything else remained perfectly still.  It disappeared on the horizon somewhere pass the trees and I just sat there in disbelief.  It was then that my father-in-law finally broke the silence and said something about how ""God really knew what he was doing....etc. And I broke in and said ""Did you see that"".  I immediately told him that we had just seen a UFO and he said he wasn't sure what it was, but we both agreed it was an awesome sight.  Before we could discuss it much further.  The wind picked up and clouds rolled in! at an a larming rate. We barely got the engine started when all hell broke loose and we almost got blown off the lake.  We managed to get to shore safely in a full blown thunderstorm. I've brought up the incident to my (now x-father-in-law) a couple of times thru the years and all he does is shake is head and agree that what ever it was, it was âsure somethinââ.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

I was awakened by the sound of cats fighting I stood up on my bed to look out the window and found the source of the noise across the street under the streetlight at the corner.  After watching them for a minute or so I noticed a bright white footbal shaped object to the right of my view. The window faced east so it was traveling roughly south to north and coming down at about a thirty degree angle until it dissappeared behind a really big tree and house. As far as I remember it was about the size of a nickel or smaller held at arms length and took just a few seconds to cross the view I had before being obscured by the trees and houses. I kept watching for several moments but did not see anything else.  I questioned what I actually saw for a really long time, believing it was a meteor or some kind of debris, but this was a solid white light, almost bright as the full moon but with no glare and very defined edges.  There was no trail left behind or any change in brightness or color and was definitely football shaped or eliptical with pointed ends.  I think my sister saw it also but I'm not sure if she did or remembers, she is 18 months younger than me and we shared the room with at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I do not recall the exact property, but looking at a map, and recalling a brook that passed through the farm, I would say that I was on the south side of Rte 253 right where the brook crosses 253.  After a day of helping around the farm, just after dark, I was sitting leisurely on the grass against an embankment  facing the highway.  The hill I was leaning against sets back about 3-400 yds from the road. I was chatting with a young lady that joined me there as a guest. I was 19 and she was about 24.  As we spoke I noticed what appeared to be the wing lights of a small plane, above the hills which are beyond the highway. The lights looked to be about a mile or so away at that time. The lights came directly over the road and over the farm toward us. They took quite a while (perhaps 5 minutes)to reach the farm area and by that time I had surprisingly noticed that there was nothing but space between the two lights.  A plane that travels at 60 mph would have taken only a minute to get to us.  They were glowing a subdued dark orange, were about 12-15 feet in diameter with maybe 40 feet separating them. They were not discs, but were spherical.  They made an almost inaudible crackling noise like static electricity and appeared that way too. The two balls went directly over our heads perfectly parallel and side-by-side bearly skimming over the hill I had been leaning against, which is to my memory, about 2-300 ft up. They passed over us without slowing down, but they were moving at only about 10 mph.  Immediately trailing the two spheres were like a static-y charge, like a kind of faint sparkle. Stunned for a few moments as I realize what we had seen, I ran inside the mobile home there, which was the camp kitchen and screamed about what I'd just seen.  The couple of folks that were there were busy and thought I saw something way up in the sky.  So I ran back outside and there were still 2 trails where the two UFOs had p! assed ov er.  I never pursued any action, nor did I call police or any authorities.  What I saw was real, and very close. Twenty years after the fact I want to know what I saw!

The weather was warm and the sky was blue with no clouds or obstructions. When I first observed the object it appeared to be a small dark mass resembling a spot the size of a pencil point. However, when it reached the vincinity of Liberty cap rock formation,which is at the top of the plateau, and is approx. 7000 ft in height, the object dived down towards the ground to a height of approx. 50 ft off the ground and in so doing changed directions and shape. While desending towards the ground the object continued to move at a speed of approx. 50 mph and had no sound associated with its movement. During the decent, the object chanded from a dark mass to gray/white appearance that had no defined shape. It appeared as though it had a electromagnetic field around it that was giving off a heat signature. When it reached the ground it changed shape to a perfect sphere that was pure white and extremely brilliant that resembled the light passing through a diamond. It maintained this appearance while traveling approx. 1 mile to the South at an altitude of approx. 50 ft. off the ground. When it stopped at the one mile mark it begain to hover and in so doing changed from a bright white flashing sphere to one of a bright orange. It continued to hover approx. 50 ft. off the ground while maintaining the brilliant burnt orange color. After approx. 10 min. of hover the sphere shot straight up into the air at approx. 200 mph and stopped at an altitude of approx. 8000 ft and started hovering again while maintaining the orange appearance. At that time a jet aircraft approached from the South and appeared to narrowly miss the flying object. When the jet passed over the hovering object, the unknow craft appeared to be as large as the front of the aircraft. After the aircraft flew pass the object, the object changed back to a brillia! nt white color which started to flash as a strobe light. It then flew off to the north at approx. 100 mph while maintaining the appearance of a flashing strobe light with no discernable appearance between flashes. The next day, an article appeared in the Rocky Mountain news that the Grand Junction area had experienced problems with the Radar system operated by the F.A.A. The F.A.A. had made a public statement that their computers had experienced a glitch that had shown flying objects over the Grand Junction area that has appeared to merge with air traffic. They wrote it off as soft wear problems. The following day, a c130 aircraft flew along the cliffs where I had observed the flying sphere. It flew at approx 200 ft. off the ground and made two passes along the cliffs in a dangerous flight path. The was the first and last time that a military aircraft was observed flying in this dangerous manner at a height and speed which would never be flown in a normal operation. I have it on good authority that the F.A.A. placed the radar data on a plane and flew it to Washington the day after the so called false sighting over Grand Junction. In summary, I am a trained observer with experience from the U.S. Army ((deleted)) operations. Also, I haved worked for ((deleted--federal employment with substantial responsibility)), and served as a police officer in Ohio. What I saw was beyond the scope of our military and industrial machine. I have never reported this sighting until now.

I was gazing into the early morning sky at around 03:00 during the time that Haley's comet was supposed to be seen, hopeing to view what was supposed to be visible by eye.  It was a very clear, quiet night with no moon visible.  As I was looking southwest I noticed movement in my periferal vision from the west and glanced in that direction.  I was stunned by what I saw.  An object traveling from the west to the east was blocking out the stars in the sky as it flew past at an extremely high rate of speed directly over my head.  The object was triangular in shape with the widest part being wing tip to wing tip.  The shear size of the object took my breath away.  It flew low to the ground, less than 600 feet.  From wing tip to wing tip I would estimate it to be 300 yards across.  From nose to tail approximately 100 yards.  It appeared to be rather flat from top to bottom, no more than 20 yards thick.  All of the edges seemed rounded, not sharp or crisp.  This object had no external lights that could be seen from below.  It had a dark, dull metallic sheen similar to the dull side of aluminum foil which reflected city light from below.  It's stealth and speed was nerve shaking.  As it passed I looked for exhaust flames, ports or vapors and I was astonished that there were none.  I waited for the sonic booms to follow as I new that this aircraft was traveling in excess of Mach 1.  I have seen small Air Force jets at Mach 1 or greater and know the speed and sounds they create at those speeds.  This huge object flew faster than any aircraft I have ever seen and did not make a sound, not even a low rumble.  There was nothing but silence.  I was in awe and disbelief of what I had witnessed.  I stood there for 30 minutes or more hoping to see another flyby and still contemplating what I saw and if I really did see it.  The total length of time of this brief veiwing lasted no more than 5 seconds. I waited for days to read something in the newspapers to verify what I saw by others.  I lived very close to March A.F.! B. and t hought that surely they picked this craft up on radar and would leak something.  I have told only a select few friends of what I witnessed that night, not wanting to be labled as crazy.  They think I'm crazy.  I just happened to be at the right place at the right time, looking up at the sky.  What prompted me to write my account at this late date was an account by someone else that was very similar to mine, who posted with your site.  The occurance date was 4/27/2001, location-Alpine, CA. and Triangle shaped.  My mm/dd/yy may be off slightly as I am not sure of the exact date but I can pinpoint very close due to certain events that took place during that time.  Haley's comet was to be visible by eye and a certain pilot of a famous politician or celebrity died in an experimental aircraft testing crash in the Nevada desert I believe.   I am an honorably discharged veteran of the Air Force and have seen many of our government aircraft including the stealth bomber and stealth fighter aircraft as well as the SR-71.  This craft is none of those or even close.  I only hope that it is one of ours, if it's not, we are seriously outmatched! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This is real, there is no other logical answers to this incident. i have told few people, as i'm afraid they'll think i'm crazy. it all started on a rainy, Saturday,fall evening in 1990. The exact date I cannot recall as it's been about 11 yrs. I was pregnant with my daughter, i must have been approximately 4-5 months, as I was not showing much. My husband worked a Saturday at a plant close to Regina, sk. where we lived at the time. He did not come home straight after work, and being a Saturday night, I decided to go looking for him, so i could also have a night out. So because we lived on the west end of Regina, I decided to use the backroads to Pense. I was not very familiar with these roads. There was pavement for a few miles, but after a while it turned to gravel. So once i hit the gravel, it was very difficult to drive due to the heavy raining. still travelling west, i knew i'd have to make a left turn in order to get to Pense, but was not sure which road was the turn-off. So, i took a guess, and saw lights, which appeared to be a small town(it was). So i made a left. When i was turning, I saw no lights, directly in front of me, but once i completed the turn i looked down for a second looked up and there appeared to be a vehicle in front of me. I thought at the time how weird this seemed, but i thought that perhaps someone was pulled over and started their vehicle right then. So i slowed down and followed what i thought to be a vehicle of some sort. i thought the lights at the time seemed unusual, but i kept making excuses, like maybe they looked weird because it was so dark? at first they kind of looked like a vehicles lights? maybe. it was so long ago. but after awhile there seemed to be wiggling lights in between two red lights. i thought ""what the heck would make wiggling lights like that?"" i thought ""ok, it must be a car or something, maybe pulling a trailer, and that would maybe explain the wiggling ?"" I was a little afraid, but calmed myself down be thinking i was imagining things. So i was! getting closer and closer to pense, this thing was in front of me, i looked down for a brief second and up again, and whatever it was completely dissapeared. Far fetched hey? i thought there had to be a logical explanation for this. There was no right hand turns for this vehicle to go down, it was not ahead of me as i would have seen it, as highway #1 was ahead a few miles and the road was a little illuminated by lights, so i would have seen it, and the left hand turn into Pense would be the only place that this vehicle could have turned onto, but there was not enough time for this object to make a left-hand turn into town. But i decided to go down this only road and drive fast and look to see if there were any vehicles that may have just turned, but there was nothing for vehicles around, and the adjoining streets also had nothing for vehicles. and that is my story. I still wonder about that night. there are absolutely no explanations. this is the gospel truth, i swear! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

I was driving on Sept. 15, 2000 north on Sheldon Rd., north of Cherry Hill when I saw two disc shaped objects fly very low (just above the treetops), making no sound, and very fast. They were dark.  I had just crossed Cherry Hill where there is an open view because of fields.  The sky ahead was cloudless and blue with large, puffy, dark clouds to the west and lighter ones to the east, but these ""objects"" were against clear blue sky.  They caught my eye because they were moving so fast from east to west (crossing Sheldon Rd. and seemingly traveling parallel to Ford Rd. which is a very heavily travelled road) and so low that I could see two of them, one flying in front of the other.  I live approximately 10 miles from Detroit Metropolitan Airport and see planes flying all the time, and less than 6 miles from Willow Run Airport whose flight path is directly over my house and these objects were not planes.  Planes never fly that low, east to west, around here.  These objects were too high, too big and too fast to be birds.  As I continued to travel north, and they to the west, it looked as if there were really three distinct objects with space between them with the first one hiding the one in the middle until I was farther north to see it.  Then they went behind the trees and out of my sight.  When I got to Ford Rd. I looked to the west but couldn't see a thing.  Then I turned west and parked in a large strip mall lot to search the skies, but I could not see a thing.  I looked at my van's clock and the time was 7:06 p.m. Eastern Standard time.

I was out on my patio relaxing and watching aircraft pass over my home.  There is a busy air corridor that passes over my home, probably mostly Chicago - Dallas traffic. I enjoy watching the aircraft pass by.  About 7:45pm I noticed an airplane I believe to have been a twin turboprop commuter plane (maybe a Brasilia) traveling the usual flight pattern from northeast to southwest.  I am not a good judge of elevation, but I would guess the plane was at 9,000 to 12,000ft.  The sun was down and it was dusk so I could see the usual red, green and white strobe lights on the airplane.  I could hear the plane faintly.  The plane passed behind a tree in my yard and I watched to see it come from behind the tree.  The airplane came into sight again and after a moment, I noticed a dark, triangular object that appeared to be following the airplane. The object did not display any lights and was behind the airplane at an apparent distance of about the width of my hand at arms length.  It appeared to be at the same elevation as the airplane and of similar size.  My first thought was that I might be seeing a large bird that just happened to be gliding along a similar course as the airplane, but after a few seconds I could see that it was not a bird.  It then occurred to me that I might be seeing a shadow cast by the airplane on the thin clouds.  There was also a contrail that was thinning out and creating some cirrus-type clouds.  The clouds were thin and broken and a lot of brighter stars were becoming visible.  I observed that there was no direct sunlight striking the airplane and that the angle was wrong to be some kind of shadow.  I concluded that the object was some kind of triangular craft and that it was indeed following the airplane.  There was a denser contrail running north-northwest to south-southeast and the airplane crossed this contrail as it continued southwest. When the triangular object crossed the contrail it disappeared.  It was suddenly just not there anymore.  I carefully watched behind the airplane until it was out of sight but I did not see the object again.  Since the airplane was approaching the lighter part of the western sky, the object should have been more readily visible the further west they traveled, but the object was just not there anymore and I did not see it again.  The airplane maintained a straight course southwest until out of sight.  As for the triangular object, it was dark and I could not see any details, other than it was triangular in shape, it was similar in size to the airplane, it did not display any lights, and I did not hear any sound that I associated with it.  It did not appear black, but rather a dark charcoal color around the perimeter and a lighter gray in the center.  This difference in color was not sharply delineated.  About fifteen to twenty minutes after I saw the object, a large jet aircraft came from the northwest and virtually bisected the point where the object disappeared. The jet then curved from a southeast course to a south-southeast course and moved rapidly out of sight.  It may just have been a coincidence, but if the jet had been sent to the area to look for the object, its most likely point of origin would have been Tinker AFB near Oklahoma City.  Curiously, the jet left a contrail across the night sky that seemed to glow softly and the contrail persisted for almost an hour.  That is all that I recall about the incident.  I hesitated to report it, but maybe someone else saw it and will report it as well.  I do not believe the triangular object was an F-117 or a B-2.  I have seen both of these aircraft in flight more than once and really don't think it could have been either one.  I would not be surprised to know that it was some kind of secret aircraft, but I can't imagine why it would be following an airplane in a relatively busy air lane.  I also can't imagine how it could have vanished like it did.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,35.0044,-94.8091

The object was observed while gathered around a campfire. We were singing songs with approximately 10 other ""campers"". It was about 8:00 in the evening. Someone noticed the object in the sky and we all stopped singing and became entranced with the object. It was very Large, perhaps 100 yards wide, and had lights all around it.

It seemed as tho time were standing still ...other than the fact that we could plainly see the object and that we were aware of our surroundings. After the object began to move away, everything went back to ""normal"". The singing was started again and the cars on the highway took off. No one mentioned the object we had just seen.

Dear Mr.Davenport,... At your request as heard on the ART BELL radio program on 2/5/01, I am sending you MY UFO story...IT IS TRUE... I don't remember the exact date, but I AM POSITIVE it was in the EARLY 1980'S... My best friend and I, in our early 20's at the time, decided to go ""Back-Roading"" on a clear Summer, weekday night around 10:30 PM... We were out driving the country roads surrounding Red Wing, MN., traveling East in the vicinity of Whiterock, MN. when I, (The Passenger) , saw an unusually bright light, approximately 500-1000 Ft. Up & 1-2 Miles North of us, that seemed to be moving South VERY slowly... We pulled off to the side of the road, turned OFF the engine, and got out of the car to get a better look... The ""Object "" was now almost directly above us and STATIONARY & the bright light was now gone... We listened, but could hear NO SOUND at all coming from it... It appeared to be TRIANGULAR and very dark, If not Black...(Please Read On)... I took some small binoculars out of the glove box and looked at the object closer... I SAW a definite TRIANGULAR shape, but slightly angled inwards at the back, like the back end of an arrowhead... I also saw 5 LIGHTS on the Bottom of the object...Each a DIFFERENT COLOR, arranged in a CIRCLE, with the lights placed at points as the points of a star shape would be within a circle...The lights did NOT blink or fade On & Off... I don't know what this thing was, but I DO know what it WAS'NT...A Plane OR a Helicopter... It just stayed there in the sky STATIONARY for approximately 5 MINUTES, and then SLOWLY moved Northwest... We got back in the car and followed it at about 10-20 MPH...to 40-50 MPH...Then to 80-90 MPH... It still outpaced us moving off Northwest untill within 30 seconds or so, it could not be seen... We slowed down & went back home feeling Thrilled, Spooked, & Thoroughly Mystified... We told only our close friends & family about the sighting, fearing ridicule, and went on with life having no answers on the subject... Within a week we were busy trying to convince ourselves it HAD to be a plane or a helicopter, and we were starting to believe our excuses... A week after that, on the FRONT PAGE of our local newspaper, the Red Wing REPUBLICAN EAGLE, were sketches of the very object we had seen 2 weeks before... Apparently several eyewitnesses had seen this object floating at tree top level at various spots in an around Red Wing,MN. where we live... Needless to say, that ended our excuses...But, to this day I am sill left without answers... As I said, this sighting happened in the EARLY 1980's, and with a little help from our local newspaper, mabey you could get the exact date... Or they might still have the newspaper archived... Also, mabey ART BELL would be interested in this TRUE Story...?? Feel free to forward it to him if you like... Thanks for listening & the IMPORTANT job you do!!",2001-02-18T00:00:00,44.5232,-92.5378

This incident occured several years ago when I was 7 or 8 years old.  Since the incident I have been keenly interested in military technology and the UFO phenomenon. I have always sought an explaination as to what I observed but so far have been unsatisfied. I was staying up late with a younger child.  I believe it was a summer night about 1:30 or so in the morning.  I don't think we were supposed to be up but when you are that age and you have a friend over you sometimes want to stay up all night and play.  My bedroom window faced north just outside a highway and I was looking outside at the sky and hills when I noticed an airplane.  I would guess now that it was 5 miles out?  The airplane was rather odd however.  Instead of the alternating red/green wing strobes it had 2 red strobing lights evenly spaced that flashed slowly and simultaneously.  I became very interested because I had never seen an airplane at night that had lights like that.  I watched for a while and it seemed like the aircraft was floating in the air.  It was moving (north-south), but every airplane I had seen fly before would have passed over by then (I had been watching for maybe 5 mins.)  I wanted to know what kind of airplane it was!  I opened the window hoping to hear any engine noise.  Was it a jet or rotory craft?  as it came closer over the window, I turned off the light partly out of fear partly to cut the glare from the room light.  Fear.  I still couldn't make out the shape, just the lights.  I began to stop thinking it was an airplane.  I was very afraid but excited and curious at the same time.  The object was just overhead.  I cannot remember the silhouette.  But it must have been 200ft overhead just gliding over slowly lights blinking.  Absolutely no noise!  I could have ridden my bicycle faster than it was traveling.  My friend saw it too, but I don't remember his reaction.  As soon as it left my field if view (directly over the roof), I ran to my parent's bedroom.  I wanted an adult to see it!  They told me to go to bed.  I rushed out the front door I was no loger afraid, I wanted to see it closer.  At the rate of speed it was going it should have still been over the roof.  When I went outside the night was still and quiet and the object was gone. I have seen all kinds of airplaned since.  Blimps, ultralights have motors...  Other airplanes have engines that make much more noise.  I have seen a jet at night with only a single red strobe, but never two that flash slowly and simultaneously.  Now that I know more about aircraft, I realize that at that altitude and speed it should have stalled.  It couldn't have been going more than 15mph. I wish I had more visual details to report.  Many years have gone by and it was night.  The memory still strikes me.  I hope taht someday I will find a decent explaination but I am afraid I will never find one.  The impression after the incident was that it wasn't man made. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-02-18T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

I lived on a hill, giving an excellent view of the river and the craft from about 1/4 mile away.  My friend and I had just returned from a coffee and pie outing at the local Perkins.  We walked around to the back of the house and entered through the sliding glass door.  The two children were in an almost hysterical state, shouting about the ""tornado"" which had passed over our house at a very low level.  I tried to calm them down, and told them to draw me a picture of what they had seen (in separate rooms).  They drew virtually identical pictures of an upside-down ""ice cream cone""  with spinning marks and colored lights.  They estimated that it barely cleard the top of my 1-story rambler.  It continued to the river and either landed or hovered just above the opposite bank. (north of our house.  Evidently it had come from the south & traveled north.  As we spoke, the kids pointed to where the object still was, on or near the river bank.  I saw only a red (sometimes light green) pulsating light on or near the river bank.  We watched it for 1 hour and 55 minutes exactly.  During this time, it kept getting brighter; then dimmer.  As it brightened, it seemed to become larger.  I watched it thru binoculars, but could not make out a shape behind the light.  My friend, the kids, and the 15 year old babysitter, watched and talked.  Toward the end of the sighting, it did some spectacular things; the babysitter had gone home, but my friend stayed and watched with us.  During the time we watched, we all tried to come up with some type of explanation for what it could be; we all concluded that it could not be human made; it was just too bizarre looking.  There was no road or path it could have taken to get where it was.  It was basically a swamp.  We went there the following day to see if it had left any evidence of itself; it had not.  We had to go on foot, climbing over fallen tree! s, etc. Anyway, just after 11:30, it suddenly turned an intense white, shot to the center of the river, and dispensed a laser-like dirty-white light onto the river. This lasted about 5 minutes or so.  Then it suddenly turned that intense white again and took off up to the top of the opposite river bank; a distance of approx. 1/4 mile.  So now it was a full 1/2 mile away.  It stopped above the only other house in the area; a new, large multi-level home.  The object shined a spotlight-type light that lit up the whole house and the yard; it looked like a helicopter search light, but much larger and brighter.  The house lights had previously been off, but when this light show happened, all the house lights came on.  I don't know if they actually saw this thing; and I haven't called them or discussed it with them.  The owner is the county court administrator, and currently the mayor of Cloquet.  I was just too embarrassed to ask a county official if he had seen the ufo.  I was also too embarrassed to make a report right away.  The next day I did call the local police to see if anyone else had made a report; none had.  After about 2-4 minutes of scoping out this new house, the ufo suddenly brightened and shot off over the top of the hill and out of sight.  I told the kids to go to bed; that they'd never see anything like that during their lives.  I barely got out that statement when Zoom!! Back it came, shined its blinding whit light DIRECTLY AT US for several seconds before shooting off to the north and out of sight.  The movements of this ""thing"" were completely unbelievable.  It moved so fast that it reminded me of a child playing a flashlight on a wall in the dark.  Nothing moves that fast.  It's impossible!!  During the sighting, the kids flicked on the floodlights to see if it would respond. It did.  The kids turned the lights (6 of them) on and off three times.  The object responded by brightening three times.  I had the feeling it could hear what we were saying and thinking, because of the ways it seemed to r! espond t o us.  The weather was completely clear, no moon visible.  No wind at all.  About 5 minutes after it left, however, a heavy fog came rolling down the river west to east, and completely obscured the view.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,46.744,-92.5739

PD)) Observed bright light at close range, amasing movement, then hovered and my vehicle quit and lost all electrical system. I was 25 yrs. old at the time, married, 1 child, worked in the automotive field, licensed pilot. Was working late at the shop and upon heading home(12:30-1 a.m.) I stopped at intersection of hwy 91 leaving town. Intersection is on top of a hill or plateau w/ a small private airstrip directly across the highway. I glanced to my right before pulling onto the highway and noticed a single bright light approaching slowly from the east at approx. 1000 feet AGL. I first thought someone was possibly going to try to land as it was noticeably descending and it looked like a aircraft landing light. (I am a pilot and had a friend who had his airplane hangered there.) Thought it unusual as there are no runway lights. I waited thinking I would shine my headlights down the runway if he circled to land. The light crossed in front of me at about 300-400 feet AGL, I thought, this nut is going to try it. At the same time as it passed directly over the airport hangers, it drops instantly into the valley that drops off the plateau immediately west of the hangers. It went strait down to within a couple feet off the ground FAST and then flew west across the small valley at a speed several hundred mph in a zigzag pattern still hugging the ground. I sat open mouthed. At the other side of the valley was a stand of tall cottonwoods and it flew right up to them and then did another 90 degree strait up without slowing down to a height of probably 1500 feet AGL and went west a short distance and appeared to stop in midair. I sat for a minute astounded by what I had just witnessed, and then turned west on the highway still watching it sit there. (I lived two miles west on the highway) I drove to within 1/8th mile of my house and stopped on the side of highway when it appeared to be strait north of me approx. 3/4 mile. I got out of the car to get a better look at it and to see if I could hear any type of sound from it. It was silent, I thought about shutting off my engine to get complete silence, but decided it might be wiser to leave it running. I stood and watched it for several minutes, it never moved and I had an eerie feeling like it was watching me also. I remember I was lighting a cigarett! e when s uddenly my car QUIT!! Didn't miss or stumble, just quit like I shut off the key. Goose bumps rushed over me as I was a mechanic by trade and that car NEVER, EVER quit before since new. I looked down into the car and there were no dashlights, no digital clock, engine/oil lights...nothing! I reached in and pulled the headlight switch on...nothing. I knew the battery was only 2 mo's old (multimiles best 5 yr. batt.) and I thought this can't be happening to me. I walked to the front of the car and the light was still sitting there motionless. Scared/angry, I yelled at it not to even Think about it! and began walking toward my house 1/8 mile away. I reached home and still it never moved, went in the house, sat in the chair and chain smoked two cigarettes while watching it out the window, never moved so I went to bed. I awoke about 4 a.m., got up, looked out the window and it was gone. Got up next morning, I walked back to my car, thinking, this will tell the story, actually hoping it wouldn't start, proving that it was just coincidence, got in it, stuck the keys in the ignition and turned them...lights, buzzers, everything...tried starting it, it started instantly, I shut it off and it started instantly again. I never could make out any shape of the craft or whatever it was, just a steady bright white light, didn't pulsate or change colors or anything like that. It should be noted that for a year or so before that and after that, there were cattle mutilations being reported in central Nebraska.  Don't know if there is any connection. Later that summer I personaly witnessed one about 4 miles west of my house. A white charlia cow, a ""perfect"" 4-5 inch hole where they removed the sexual organs in the rear, and a perfect 4-5"" hole in its chest in front where they removed the heart. The cow was still sitting in it's sleeping position with it's head curled around as if it was still sleeping. It never awoke or moved, no sign of any struggle, no blood anywhere! Not on it or near it. None! several other people saw it also, along with Greeley co. sheriff. There were no tracks of any kind around it, happened on a saturday nite/sunday morning. My sister also had a light follow her for 10-15 miles home late one night down two different highways.

Most importantly was it's movement - it would move quickly from right to left or up and down (or vice versa) and then come to a dead stop before immediately dashing off in another direction at a 45 degree angle. This was observed by my college roommate and myself while we attended Grand Valley State College in Allendale, MI (near Grand Rapids). We first noticed the ""star"" moving through the night sky while we driving back to our dorm. I thought at first it might be an illusion, because we were driving, but then my roommate (who was the driver) mentioned it to me. We stood in the parking lot outside our dorm and watched it moving, occasionally confirming to each other which way we observed it moving, just to make sure that we were both really seeing this thing. We watched for about 15 to 20 minutes before going inside, the object still doing it's manuevers in the sky.

It moved slowly at first, as it moved futher away it did an erratic pattern of movement, the movement was like a child scribbling on paper, I describe it like this because you could see the entire outline of its movements ""a light trail"" behind it, all of this within a second or two. It then moved out of sight in a straight line in less than a second. The object only left a trail of light during it's erratic movement. There was four of us who witnessed this event, 3 white males, one black male, ages between 20 and 25 yrs old, all of us in the US Army.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

During the summer of 91 or 92 I saw the following: My friend and I were flying kites at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.  If it wasn't for that fact we would not have saw what we did.  We were seeing how high we could get our kites on a light windy day when out of the corner of my eye I saw three disks.  I pointed them out to my buddy and we stood there speechless.  They were traveling on an approximate magnetic heading of 360 to 010 degrees at a 80 degree angle from the horizon so almost directly overhead. From my perspective it was from the right to left.  They were solid luminescent white in appearance in a close triangle formation like military jets.  They were at high altitude traveling at extreme speed on a straight course.  At arms length they each would be the size of a dime.  They traversed the sky in about 6-8 seconds.  Traveling much faster than the speed of sound.  They made no sound, and no sonic boom.  About me: I'm a private pilot with about 5 years flying experience.  I've been an aviation enthusiast since I was a kid attending many air shows at Edwards Air Force Base, Point Magu and many other locations.  Including the Edwards 50th anniversary where the SR71 flew at plus mach speeds.  I've also seen the Space Shuttle land there many times so I know these disks were traveling at extreme speeds.  By silhouette alone I can identify every aircraft know to the public.  I've also been reading Aviation week magazine for years.  These disks are not conventional aircraft to say the least.  Thank you for your work. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-10-12T00:00:00,34.12998527397261,-118.14257345890411

At the time I was looking in the diection of Logan Airport so I didn't give it much thought.  For some reason though this light kept catching my eye. I reached the intersection of the street I lived on and rounded the corner all the while keeping my eye on it. it would slowly drift one direction, stop and drift back the other way. Something in the back of my mind told me to stop in my tracks and observe it (which I did) and it seemem to almost be taunting me with the way it moved. It's movements were subtle but most unusual in that it seemed to have no clear direction. Also of note was the fact that the light remained at a farly consatnt magnitude unlike the lights of say a circling helicopter would if one is standing still observing it. It almost seemed to be taunting me as if it knew I was observing it. I must have watched this thing for a solid ten minutes just playing ""peak a boo"" descending just below and ascending just above the tree line drifting left to right. As I watched A black sedan pulled up near me and one of the occupants asked what I was looking at. They were three middle aged men three in the front one riding shotgun. The man in the front passenger side asked what I was looking at. Before I could answer he flashed a badge and said he was a Boston undercover police officer and that people had been reporting UFO's in the Roxbury Blue Hills avenue area. My jaw dropped and I told them I was indeed watching something in the sky I couldn't explain. They asked me a couple more questions that I can vaguely recall and drove off. At that point I felt very unsettled and tried to relocate this object I had been viewing but it was gone. I continued walking down the street keeping my eyes glued to the Eastern horizon and saw nothing until I got to the next intersection. I saw an object flying very silently and very low directly twoards me and i rememb! er feeli ng how surreal it looked because it was somewhat hazy that night and I couldn't make out any detail only that it seemed awfully low and traveling awfully slow. My ears kept straining to hear engine sounds but I heard none. There were two people approaching me and it appeared to be directly over their heads. I asked them to stop and tell me what it was but one didn't even look up, and the other gave me the sarcastic reply ""UFO"" dude. I felt like I was in the twilight Zone. After they past me the craft approached my position and hovered directly over head. I was so surreal triangular in shape silent with a solid red light at the nose and yellow green and blue lights that blinked rhymithicaly counter clockwise. It was huge. The size of maybe the infield of a a baseball field. The thing seemed to have some type of light absorbing field around it like a halo. It hovered above me for what seemed like a minute. Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone else across the street and I shouted for him to look at it and tell me what it was. He was by a gas station and I realized from his vantage point he was looking almost directly into a street light. In the moment I asked him and released my gaze from the object it had completely vanished from sight. I could not fathom how something that big could move that fast but it was completly gone from view. It was almost as if it knew I was watching it.It seemed to leaze the air with an ozoney kind of electric charge like just after a thunderstorm.It was the most unusuall/unsettling thing I have ever experienced.

They would fade out then come back either were the where or close.  We remembered we had binochulars so my brother got them out.  The car was vibrating too much to tell what they where.  We decided to stop.  As we did ! come to a stop the objects disappeared.  We waited awhile since they had been coming and going out of view.  But, they never came back.  We proceded on our way did not see them again.  We thought they may have been jet fighters at a very high altitude so as to appear as no movement.  Or possibly military aircraft dropping flares.

Last night we were both admiring the clouds which were nicely highlighted by the moon. We eventually noticed an amber colored light just to the west of the moon. At first we thought it was a star, but instead of twinkeling it sort of pulsated, also it appeared to be infront of the main haze of the atmosphere but behind the lower clouds as there were absolutely no other stars viewable. It seemed to stay approxamately the same distance from the moon and gave the faint impression of rotation. Neither of us had any binoculars of course so we simply sat and watched it. With the moon highlighting the clouds it was apparent which ones were more dense and which clouds were very thin. This is important because the light would appear through some of the thicker clouds but would disappear behind a mere wisp of cloud. The light also caught our attention because it seemed to be about twice the size of a star, it didn't move as fast a a plane, and it gave the impression of being oblong ( wider to the front, or the western side; than at the back, the eastern side). We saw it again tonight, same place,same time, same location in the sky; but tonight (06/07/01) it doesn't seem to pulsate as much and also it gives a stronger impression of rotation.  I suppose there is probably a natural explanation for this but I simply can't think of one.

At approximately 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday, September 19, 2000, I walked out on my back porch and looked up at the sky.  I was standing facing south. It was a clear night and the stars were very visible in the heavens.  From out of my right  came a formation of four to five objects, grouped closely together in flight, but clearly individual objects, traveling west to east straight across my field of vision.  Within 2-3 seconds they were clearly visible in the sky straight ahead of me.  They then paused, banked slightly and shot upward  to the south disappearing in the sky at about a 100 degree angle from where I first spotted them.  The objects seem to glide rapidly as opposed to ""flying"".  There appeared to be no ""drag"" to the motion as one would expect if watching a plane make its way slowly across the sky.  Instead they glided effortlessly, silently and quickly like a shooting star. They paused in mid-air for only a fraction of a second before changing course.  When they banked and changed direction, they moved all as one unit.  Not one of the objects appeared to lose the slightest distance in its position to the other objects when turning.  They turned synchronized in perfect unison as if one unit.   Each object in the formation was very large (about the size of our moon in the sky), triangular to boomerang in shape and completely illuminated in a brilliant, but unusual white light -- as opposed to having lights ""on them"".   When they paused for the split second and my mind could fully view and assimilate the formation of objects which had just sped into view before me, I had an incredible sense of awareness and knowledge that I was viewing something awesome and extremely technologically advanced.  I say this because of the speed and agility with which they glided across the sky; the fact there was no associated engine sounds; the ability of the pilots to fly in a formation so perfectly at the speed they were achieving; and the size of each object as compared to the stars and other objects in the sky.  I refer to  ""other objects"" because at the same time they were crossing the sky, there was a jet plane to my left traveling eastward.  Had the formation of objects continued on a straight line eastward, they would have passed just south of the position of the plane at a very close proximity.  In fact, I was hoping the plane passengers would see them also.  Instead the formation paused, banked and headed southward well out of view of the plane. When the objects turned, I saw the underside of each object and realized that the illumination of each object was emanating  at different intensity levels.   Hence, it was not a reflection of one object appearing as several, but in fact several.  When the objects turned they increased speed dramatically and disappeared from view in about the time it would take a person to blink their eyes.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,41.1601,-81.1675

Suddenly I thought it was a teridactle(prehistoric bird) by the look of its bent around ""boomerang"" shape and it seemed to move very quickly and effortlessly as if it were gliding.  It glided directly above and across us.  Suddenly it seemed to change shape into a triangular, hard object which moved as if it were on one part of the sky but still in another.   It was a short distance that the triangular shape moved and then object disapeared. We didn't talk for about two minutes, we just laughed.

It varied speed dramatically, changed  shape and we didn't believe anything of earth had capabilities like that no matter how much technology had advanced.

The light source was the city of Naha which is 5 miles south of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.  The light that was reflected off the bottom was also oval in shape giving it the idea that the bottom was convex and had bulges(like that of a bird...air that goes around must speed up to catch up to the air that goes straight through). Plus the light was formed in a ""V"" formation like geese heading south for the winter which suggests the object was triangular. there were no flashng lights like a commercial airliner.  There were no headlights on it like a KC 130 aerial refueler(the sir station has KC-130's, CH-46's, and CH'53s).  Th object did not make the sound of a KC-130 which has 4 propellars.  The object produced no sound at all!!!!!!  I also thought that it was a B-2 bomber but B-2's make a lot of noise even.  This unidentified Flying Object was gliding through the sky.

I had not been drinking :) i was too young for that. any way i vidly remember being outside with sombody and seeing a shooting star. the person i was with says to me "" that means u are going to have good luck"" Not to long after i went out back of the wedding reseption to the large outside garden that lead onto the country side. i remember how fresh the air was and how clear the night sky was. i remember that the garden was softly lit by a flood light witch was no good as the garden was to large to be fully illuminated by it alone. i recall the calm fealing and stillness of that night. I remember walking over to the far fence away from where the wedding reception building was and behind the pond area that was surounded by furn trees. i looked at the sky abouv the towering fence then saw a second shooting star. seconds later i remember a silent ""ship"" flying down and hovering abouv my hed. the ship slowly tilts forward and i see a pain of wraparound sunglases for windows. well they looked like windows all tinted out and black. it felt  like i was beeing watched, looked at through them. the ""ship"" hovered silently abouve me for a fiew seconds then it tilted its front end back up while roling over to my left so tat it was facing the other way and it shot off as fast as it arrived. ship details. i include a rough 10 second sketch to show you what i belive to have seen. the metal or material that the ship was made off was a greeny grey colour more grey i think. it also looked to be made from panal sections. the windows where like a shiny black colour not tto diferent to a shiny plastik, well sort of inbetween plastick and shades or sunglasses. they was verry dark. also i recall lots of grood looking apendijes like areals on the object and some thing on the top of it... one thing i remember was the strange triangle shaped thing at the bottom of the ship. there was no light flashing no hazes no flames or anything. it looked like somthing that had been used, somthing that was weathered in.. not shiny and gleaming nothing like a saucer shape. i remember that. the shape was very long looking at the back i supose like a sauser but streatched out and it had overhanging rims to the lower part.. the most rememberable thing was the shades for windows... also i recal numbers or simbols on the fromt of the object... i dont know what but i remember syimbols... i think when it was hovering over me there was a strange low leval humm almost like wind sound. it might have been the wind. I also remember while looking at it that i was not upset or skered in any way. i felt pecfull. after this i ran in and told my mom i saw a plain. my mom confirms today that i was all exited and was pestering her and my dad to come out side and look at the plain.

After watching this for 20 seconds we both got our father's attention who was sitting a few isles in front of us on the other side of the plane. He got out of his seat and came over and we showed him the rocket. He then called my mom, my youngest brother, and a family friend of ours to come over to our side of the plane and look out the window in order to see this object too. By the time they all got out of their seats and saw the object, approximately 45 seconds of time had elapsed since the beginning when I first saw it. By this time the rocket appeared much larger and was located just a hundred feet from the end of the wing. Instantaneously, the rocket fizzled out and changed shape into a ""typical flying saucer."" The saucer remained just off the end of the wing tip and then several white lights appeared in the middle of the craft; they looked similar to small windows. The craft then expelled a bunch of white sparkling lights and fire trails (simliar to sparklers) and then emitted all kinds of different colored lights that flew in all directions. Then the craft  literally disinegrated before our eyes and vanished, but I should note that it streaked away from the airplane while it vanished. The whole sequence of events lasted over a minute. Furthermore, we immediately questioned the flight attendants about it and one or two of them said! they sa w the craft too. Shortly thereafter they inquired the pilots about the event. They told us that the pilots responded to them by saying that they had personally not seen the craft or the event, but that they were contact by 2 or 3 other commercial aircraft flying nearby who reported they saw an unidentified aircraft flying close to our airplane. They wanted to know what was going on. Our pilots said they never saw the object(s). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

I am not sure of the exact month, but I remember it being warm enough to go with out a coat. Both sightings happend on a Thursday and both occured at around dusk. I was in high school at the time. On the first sighting two of my friends and myself were standing on Owen Hill Rd. near the four corners of the small town of Killawog, looking south. From up over a hill to the south, maybe a mile and a half in distance, I saw a bright yellow light. I pointed it out to my two friends and as you can imagine, the three of us were mystified. I could not tell whether or not it was just a ball of light or if it was a light attached to something. The light was too bright for me to clearly see if there was a shape behind it. It was flying somewhat towards us. Mainly north-west, us being to the north. It passed over a hill to the west, out of our view. It was in our view for about 30-45 sec. Within 10 sec. of the first yellow light leaving our sight, a second ball of light came of the hill to the south from the same location as the yellow one. This one was much different. It was bright red and at least 3 times as large as the yellow one. It flew in the same exact path that the first one did, and disapeared from our view over to same location on the hill to the west. The third and final ball of light came exactly as the previous 2 had gone. the third ball was the exact same size and color as the first one. My friends and I waited where we were for about a half an hour. Partly to see if there were anymore, but mainly to listen for engine sounds. We heard none. The balls of light were definatly not traveling fast enoughto break the sound barrier. At first we all thought that they were helecopters, but we quickly relized that if they were we would have heard them. The next encounter I had was exactly a week later at roughly the same time. This time I had a different friend with me. I had told him about it and he just laughed at me. That night (dusk) we were in the ! yard of a residence a few hundred yards from where my other two friends and I had been a week prior. There is a hill that is fairly tall and has a very steep incline roughly 50 yards behind this residence. I again was to first to see it. It was coming over the hill behind the house to the south. From the south to the north. I quickly pointed it out to my friend saying "" See!I told I wasn't lying!""

I did some quick research on the web and found the Satellite came down on March 12 1996 at 11:05pm EST. As I recall, I saw the UFO at about 5.30pm UK time and I think the satellite had come down around midday but I didn't know this at the time of the sighting. I was walking home from the bus stop after college, it was dark but the street lights were still an orange colour as they were still warming up. I glanced up at the moon and a light to the right of it caught my eye, it was the same colour orange as the street lights but was bigger and at about twice their height. I stopped and stared at it, trying to figure out if it was a light on a crane or something but as well as being illuminated it also seemed to have a spherical metallic surface and I started to think maybe it was a helium balloon. Then it started to move, it floated up with a slight arc (not straight up) and seemed to be swallowed up by darkness. I lost sight of it and continued walking, still looking up in case I could see it again. I then noticed some small misty white lights above me, as I looked at them I suddenly realised that they were arranged around the sides of a huge black shape which was blocking out the stars. I'm about 95% sure that it was triangular, it definitely had straight edges and there were 5 lights as I remember. The object pretty much filled my whole field of vision which combined with the fact that it was a black object against a black sky made it hard to be 100% sure about the number of sides. There was also a rectangle of light in the center but it was like light reflecting off a flat raised section rather than a light source, the long edges of the rectangle were sharp and the short ones were more diffuse. The object passed directly over me from right to left, rotating very slowly. It was completely silent, and I'd estimate it was flying or rather floating at roughly treetop level. Altitude and size are pretty hard to judge from below but I would estimate it was about the size of a house and the orange sphere was about the size of a beach ball or maybe a bit bigger. The triangle(?) slowly gained altitude and I lost sight of it as it passed over the houses to my left. I kept looking for it as I continued home but all I saw were the lights from normal air traffic which wer! e at a m uch higher altitude than the object I had seen. I kept an eye on the local press for a few weeks afterwards but I am not aware that anyone else saw this object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

All three round lights were pulsating very fast. It was like looking at an arc welder. I woke my friend up and we both observed this phenomena for approximately 60 seconds. I stepped on the gas in an attempt to get closer, for I could see that the road went to the right up ahead in a closer direction towards the lights. As we went around the bend, we could the lights through the trees, when they just vanished. Within ten minutes, we seen, what looked to be, a white light, 60ft long,20 ft.in diameter, round on each end, moving very slowly, against the back drop of a mountain. I stopped the vehicle and shut off the lights to observe this light. It moved very slowly, horizontally and started to pick up speed. It left a trail behind it that got duller the further back the trail went. This lighting phenomena lasted approximately twenty seconds and what looked to move about three miles, then all of a sudden, took off extremely fast and left no trail after itself, all we seen was the light traveling at an instant high speed acceleration that looked to travel the distance of maybe 10 miles, in less then two seconds.

It is hard to beleive that was over 10 years ago.  Where has all the time gone?  I still don't know what it could have been.  It is thought provoking that it made its appreance in a wild and remote part of British Colombia.  Almost as if it didn't want to be seen.  Perhaps we will never know just what it was?

I have seen planes in this area before, but usually they are high and just passing over from St. Louis to Kansas City. This night, this plane looked ""odd"". It had two bright lights on the front and no blinking lights.  I stopped the truck and turned the engine off but I was a little too far away to get a good look.  I figured it was a (regular) plane.  The next night, Friday, at just about the same time, it was the same route, only with a slight variation which put me closer to the path of this ""plane"". Once again I stopped the truck and turned off the engine.  I watched as it flew almost overhead.  I thought, that's odd, it looked triangular, it had three whitish lights on each tip, but I was still thinking it was a plane, and then I saw the red light in the center of the triangle, it appeared larger than the white ones and I also noticed smaller lights which seemed to be closer to the body of the craft, so that the others seemed to protrude. Then it hit me that this might not be a conventional aircraft! It traveled a path, each night, from northwest, making an arc just about the 122 mile marker on highway 70 and then heading southwest. Northwest direction would be the direction that Whiteman AFB is and the home of the Stealth.  It wouldnt surprise me to find out that this was a Stealth aircraft. I did call Whiteman and spoke with the airflight control, who told me they didnt know what the underside of the Stealth looked like at night. So no info there.. Nor were they aware of any flights at those times, but...? I assured them I wasnt a spy, of course if I were I would all ready know all this!

We were walking toward our car which was in parking lot N4.  As we neared Balmer Hall I happened to look up to watch aircraft coming from the northeast on their approach toward Seatac. Planes have always fascinated me and was a Private Pilot for a number of years. When I looked up I noticed a stationary, apparantly rectangular, black object in the sky directly over the north east end of the UW campus which seemed to be at an altitude considerably above the approaching aircraft.  I called to my wife, who immediately looked up and observed the same object.  At first we thought it might possibly be a large bird.  We dismissed that idea since it wasn't moving, didn't have the shape of a bird and appeared to be way too large for its apparant distance from us. We also considered that perhaps something had fallen off an approaching aircraft. Once again we ruled that out since the object seemed to be above the approaching aircraft.  After 15 to 20 seconds the object began to move very smoothly at a very high rate of speed in a Northeast direction directly opposite the path of the approaching aircraft.  At approximately 30 seconds from the time we first observed the object we lost it from sight behind some trees. We discussed the sighting all the way home and have concluded it did not fall into any of the usual bird/aircraft sightings in our experience. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length over the telephone.  The husband is a former military officer, who considers himself to be quite capable of being able to identify aircraft.

It was black, as far as I could tell.. but it was so far away that I guess it could have been some other color.  Anyway, normally I would have thought it was a plane.. but it wasn't moving at all.  It was just sort of floating there.  My next thought was, ""must be a helicopter.""  But it was much, much higher than I'd ever seen a helicopter.  Then again, I'm not an expect on helicopters, so maybe. We kept looking at it and it seemed to change shape a little.. or it was rotating so that I was seeing it from a different angle.  At one point, I _think_ I saw it split into two pieces.  The two pieces remained right next to each other, though, so it could have just been thin in the middle.  The distance may have made it seem like the parts were separate. After about 15 minutes or so, the object was so faint that we lost it. I realize my description has a lot of ""seemed like""s and ""couldn't exactly tell because of the distance""s, but that's the best I can do.  The object wasn't zipping all over the sky or shooting out laser beams or anything.  It was just behaving in a way that didn't match what I expect planes/helicopters to do.

From my far east a disk or ball (somewhat obscured by the light clouds) appeared kind of as a soft white glow, like the moon light, and traveled to my far west in about 1.5 - 2 seconds.  It moved so quickly that it appeared to have a short tail coming from behind.  It disappeared to my view for about 5 seconds.  The object reappeared to my far west side and in approximately .5 second moved to a position just in front of me and slightly to my west and stopped.  While it was stationary the soft glow stopped and all I could see were four lights which were green, red, and white.  The object hovered at that position for about 15 seconds and then moved off to the north at a slower rate, but much faster than any airplane or jet.  While it traveled northward I could see the lights and it did not during any of this sighting make any noise.  At first I thought maybe it was a shooting star or an object entering the atmosphere.  However, it was unlike any falling star or other object I had ever seen before and, it was much to large, I thought to be such an object.  I also thought maybe it was a search light, however you can see the trail of a search light as it cuts the sky and this did not have any.  When I saw the lights I thought maybe it was an airplane, jet, or helicopter.  However, there was no noise, no airplane or jet I know of can hover, and a helicopter noise would have been very distiguishable at that range even if in a silent mode.  I followed the object as it traveled northward until I was in front of my house (on the other side from the drive) and then it was lost to view shortly afterward behind the trees.

The cloud deck was at about 8,oooft and the object went above them to about 10,000ft and then hovered as if caught in an air pocket. Several other people thought it looked like a grocery type white bag, but there was a smaller piece of a white object that we saw traveling along with the larger ""bag"". It looked unattached.

We have corrected the date to 23SE00.  PD)) Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours. I was sitting in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I witnessed what I thought was a shooting star. It looked like a shooting star in color and quickness. But then it shot right back up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed. I have never seen any airplane move that fast. My husband compared it to the speed of a laser pointer moving across the sky. The object did circles in the sky, it went up and came down, moved east and then west. I thought maybe I was seeing things, so I went and woke up my spouse so he could see it too. He too saw it and could not explain what it was. It did not have the usual airplane red and blue blinking lights, it was a solid color, not really a color, but it glowed evenly. I sat and watched it amazed for about 3 hours. At one point it looked very low in the sky, to the point where I thought I could hear its movements. It sounded much like a kite sounds when it is flapping through the air, and it had more of a shape to it at that point. It had a a triangular shape to it when it got down low, and it appeared to be white in color, or maybe it was just glowing. It came down in circular movements, but then it shot straight back up into the sky. I know it was not a kite, because kites don't have such a range on them. I thought maybe a secret military craft, but this thing moved super super fast. I had a hard time keeping my eye on it at times. I had never in my life seen anything like that before. My spouse and I were equally confused as to what it could have been. I even called 911 to see if anyone else had reported seeing an object in the northern skies, no one had according to the 911 operator (at least not to her knowledge). I eventually got tired and went to bed. I have not seen anything or heard anything about it since. Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours. Just wanted to make a correction, I realized that I witnessed this after midnight, so it would have been 9/23/00.. not 9/22/00 as I previously reported. I am not sure if I need to retell the story, but I will. I was sitting outside on my back porch smoking a cigarette, when I saw what I thought was a shooting star in the northern sky, but unlike a shooting star, the ""light"" shot back up in the sky at an incredible rate of speed. I watched this thing move around, up and down, east and west, circling at times for about a half an hour before I decided I should go wake up my husband so he too could see it. I knew if someone else did not see it, no one would believe me or think I was hallucinating. I ran upstair and got him out of bed to come and take a look. He came outside and after about 3 minutes, he too saw what I was seeing. He compared the speed at which this thing moved to the speed of a laser pointer moving across the sky. The sky was clear that night, and I do not remember seeing a moon (may have been south of me as I was looking north). Someone suggested that maybe there was a laser light show in the area that night, but it was after midnight, and I would think that the lights would have to have something to reflect off of, plus there were no beams coming from the ground up. This thing was up there looking like a moving star. It has also been suggested that maybe it was a satellite, because that it what it looked like in color and size. But I have seen satellites in the sky before, and none ever moved with such quickness, and so sporadically. This thing was all over the place, doing dives, circles, back and forth, up and down. I was just amazed at what I was witnessing. My husband was not as impressed as I was, however he could not find a logical explanation for me. He ended up going back to bed after about 15 minutes. I stayed out side watching this thing until about 3:30 am. It moved all over. When I first saw it, I would say it was at about a 60Âº angle, falling down like a shooting star to about 45Âº then back up to about an 80Âº angle. At one point it came down really low in the sky, however it was still quite small. But when it came down ""lower"" I thought I could hear it. The sound reminded me of a ! kite fla pping in the wind, and some of the moves it did (the spiralling downward) reminded me of a stunt kites' movements. I also thought I could make out somewhat of a shape, and it's shape reminded me of the Stealth Bomber, triangular in shape, but white, or glowing in color. It did not blink lights, the light stayed solid. It did not have the red or blue blinking lights like airplanes have. It did not blink at all for that matter. I thought maybe a remote control airplane (like the UAV) but this thing moved so fast, I had a hard time keeping my eye on it. Sometimes it looked like it hovered, but I am not sure, it may have been going up higher and away from me. I even went as far as to call 911 to see if anyone else had called in to report seeing an object in the sky. The dispatcher told me that no one had to the best of her knowledge. She offered to have an officer come out to my house so I could point it out to him, but I declined (I felt foolish). I watched it for a long time, then it started heading east, and I was tired, so I went to bed. I am still perplexed as to what it was that I saw that night. And I might think it was a dream if my husband had not also witnessed it. It amazed me, I was so in awe and so excited about it. I still smoke, and I cannot smoke in my house, so I sit out there every night hoping to catch a glimpse of something like that again, but so far there has been nothing out of the ordinary. I will never forget this as long as I live. I just wish I knew for sure what it was..and if anyone else besides me and my husband witnessed it.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,33.57603490701001,-112.19439241773964

This is the first time I've officially reported my sighting.  I'm doing this because someone official must know. In the later part of 1989, at approximately 9 p.m., while driving home from dinner at my mother's house, I noticed bright lights moving very slowly toward my right, above the tree line.  I've always been intrigued by U.F.O's and feel I'm quite knowledgeable on the subject.  I had always thought that if I had ever saw one,I would not be afraid, but rather I would want to approach it.  Was I ever wrong.  I stopped to observe a round shaped disk coming my way above the trees to my right while still in my truck.  Slowly it approached.   Surrounded by very, very bright lights, not blinking lights but solidly lit.  At this time, the object is right by me so I get out of my truck, leave the door open, walk around the door to the driver's side fender and look at the craft.  When I realized there was no noise coming from it, that's when I knew what it was.  The biggest rush of fear went through me like I never  knew.  The craft was only about 50 yards from me.  I jumped in my truck, drove forward 200 yards, made a left, stopped and watched it slowly move away for about five minutes until I couldn't see it anymore.  My house was just around the corner.  I went in and woke up my roomate, ((name deleted)).  He went to bed way early because he had to go to work at 4:00 a.m.  I told him what I had seen.  He said I was crazy.  We went out front in the yard and I started telling him the story.  Just a few minutes into my story, as I was pointing in the direction of the sighting, we heard a noise from behind.  We turn and look.  About 3 or 4 black helicopters buzz the house and fly in the direction I'm pointing.  Steve didn't think I was so crazy then. I'm reporting this because lately it's been weighing on my mind.  50 yards is close!  If someone would contact me, I would like to tell them things about the craft and the amazingly effortless way that it moved. Please take this sighting seriously.  I am a business owner in Austin and have a reputation as an honest person. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-02-18T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

The craft was triangular with 7 red lights across the leading edge. The lights did not flash and were very bright. The object moved very slowly. (too slow for for any aircraft to stay airborn)I would say the craft was 100 yards across Min. The most amazing thing about the whole sighting was when my brother inlaw shinned a high power flashlight at it. It shinned a VERY bright white light back at us!

I was doing seasonal work on an Island, approximately 14 miles off the R.I. coast, called Block Island. The house I lived in was on a hill with its front porch facing South. The house, called Langdon House, was leased by my employers for we, the hotel and kitchen staff. That evening there were only three of us home out of 13 other housemates. I, on the first floor, and two women on the second floor. At 8:45pm (eastern) I left my room, and to this day I don't know why I felt compelled to do so, grabbed a pair of binoculars and went out and sat on the front porch, facing south. It was mid to late June and still pretty light out. I remember this like I remember my own name. Due south was a light, midway from the horizon line, that seemed to be pulsating and changing colors. At first I thought it was a planet or a star, but when I peered through the binoculars the light looked too close, and its colors too distinct. Red, blue, green and white. I watched it for some time with binoculars. In fact I thought ""oh my god, this can't be what I think it is,"" when I heard a buzzing or a humming. I, still seated on the front porch, turned to my right and saw an object moving very slowly and seeming to hover at about 100 feet. It was vaguely triangular because it looked hazy, like orange translucence. But it gets even stranger. In the moment that it took to turn my head to the right, the evening light blackened and I could see no stars. Just the light in front of me facing south pulsing, changing colors and the object moving round my to my right. Right then and there I decided that I was not going to be the only nut witnessing this and ran into the house and up the stairs, where I found two female coworkers and housemates. I blabbered something about lights, my words travelling 80 mph. They followed me outside. When the three of us got back outside, we walked around the right side of the house where there is a driveway and a small side yard. The west side of the house. The island has virtually no street lights. There are no traffic lights. It is 7 miles long and three miles wide. Outside it was dark. There were multiple objects, all orange and hazy looking. They were everywhere. Hovering, bouncing. I also noticed that there was a light pulsating just like the first light I saw, only Due north. The three of us saw at least a dozen odd shapes performing many different feats. During this not one person walked past our house. Not one car drove past. Not one airplane flew overhead. This was strange because the Langdon House is on one of the ONLY main roads on the island. Less than a mile, SW, away is the Block Island Airport. The only way on or off the island is air or sea. It was a weekend and its usually a busy airport. The event ended at 9:15pm (eastern) according to my watch that evening and according to a clock radio in the room my companions shared on the second floor. Being keyed up by this nerve racking experience, the three of us walked less than a quarter mile down the hill to a local tavern, the Yellow Kittens. We left the house within fifteen mins if I recall correctly, after the event ended. When we got to the Yellow Kittens tavern the clock on the wall read 10:45pm. My wrist watch read 9:30pm.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,41.1891,-71.5678

A night in the Fall of '93 my little brother and I were driving on a county road near our home.  I am interested in the stars and as such I glanced up at the sky.  I saw what I believed to be a passenger plane flying west.  A few seconds later I witnessed an additional object flying directly toward the first.  I knew that the distance between the two would be great by differences in altitude.  Still, I watched off and on until they met.  Then amazingly enough, the second light stopped and reversed direction to follow the first.  Immediately, I stopped the car. I rolled down the widow to hear what I figured to be a low flying helicopter.  I heard no sound.  Then, the second light accelerated and began flying circles around the first.  As I watched in awe, the first light continued on its trajectory while the second stopped again.  When I took a wider view of the sky, I discovered not just one object but between thirty and fifty similar sized lights of varying colors.  They all appeared to be flying in what one could determine to be geometrical shapes.  I told my brother to get out and look.  We both stood in amazement for about five minutes watching the aerial display.  Then being only two miles from home and my small telescope, we drove on.  When we got home, we looked up to see if they were still there and discovered another light.  This light was much larger, white, and stationary.  The smaller lights would fly to the larger one, stop, and then resume the geometric ballet.  I went inside to get my telescope and my father.  My father, argueably the most skeptical man in the world, was speechless as he witnessed the show. I tried to get a better look with my telescope, but they only appeared as bright lights. After about a half an hour, they just diappeared.  I realize that this may seem odd to report five years after the event, but I had no idea who to contact until now.  I will not wager a guess as to what we saw but it is deffinately worth reporting. At the time of the event I was seventeen, my br! other tw elve, and my father forty one.

Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sightin","Coober Pedy, SA",SK,1997-02-06T09:41:00,light,,"Occurred : 2/6/1997 09:41 Reported: 2/12/1997 18:41 Posted: 10/12/2001 Location: Coober Pedy, SA (Approx. 250km south of) (Australia), SA Shape: Light Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01983.html,"SUMMARY:  A stormy night on the Stuart Highway. Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sighting of a man which was extremely unusual looking. The first event to happen was the sighting of a 'roadwork' man sweeping the highway.  Whilst driving along the highway, an extremely bright light suddenly appeared in front of us. At first we thought it was a truck coming towards us - common on the highway-but as we drove towards it we realised it was a stationary truck with a bright light attatched to the front of the grill. Upon getting closer to the light, it was that bright and blinding that we had to slow down to 10kms just to see the road and where we were going. Half the road was closed and suddenly we were able to see a man. There he was sweeping the road at 21:30(approx) 200kms from the nearest roadhouse. We slowly drove up to him to explain that we could not see the road due to the light and essentialy could not see him. We now believe that not being able to see him was what he wanted. The man hardly showed his face and what we did see - he had an extremely high forehead and very wide set eyes. He was approx. 7 fee!t tall and of stocky build. He did not want us talking to him and made every attempt to get us to move on quickly. As we drove off the light slowly disappeared - which is what got us thinking. Due to the cloud cover that night, a light of that intensity would have cast quite a bit of glare i.e. we would have seen the light from quite a distance, however the light suddenly flashed on and we were not descending or ascending a hill! My questions at the time were who was he, what was he doing that far out of town at that time of night and what was he sweeping off the road?Eventually that passed as we drove along the highway again.Approximately 30mins after this happened an extremely bright light came up from behind us - we had not passed a car since the roadwork man - to within 50m of us. It followed  our car for about 4 seconds before disappearing. The lights intensity was similar to that of a cars high-beam headlights and was orange-yellow in colour. Neither of us said anything - we were starting to get spooked.As we were driving up the road we were heading into a storm. As we got closer to the storm I was checking the stars to see where the storm cloud started - it was that black that there was a definite black line where the storm cloud startes. As I was watching the stars I noticed an extremely orange star. As I continued watching it moved forward so it kept up with the car, not falling behind like the other stars were. From where we were this 'star' was about 5-6mm across. As I continued watching the light moved on a diagonal path towards the horizon and was now in front of the car. This light continued downwards until it reached a point slightly above the horizon, if not on the horizon, and that is where it stayed until the blackness of the strom blocked my view.Among these happenings we passed a military style vehicle with no insignia which was cruising up the highway rather slowly. We could not see the driver as we passed the vehicle.The storm that we drove through was extremely active for about 2 hours until we actually reached it. (there had been continuous lightning for these two hours). Yet as soon as the light was blocked out by the clouds all lightning stopped. As far as we know a storm does not just stop suddenly.As we neared Coober Pedy, a white 4WD suddenly pulled out from the side of the road and forced our car to slow down considerably. In the back window of this car two shapes could be seen moving and I can tell you with all honesty that they did not look like dogs or humans or any other animal but I did not get a very good look at them so I cannot accurately say or judge what they were.We eventually made it to Coober Pedy and were relieved to see other humans.The whole event really spooked both me and my fiance and we have vowed never to travel on the highway agein at night. (the highway runs directly from Adelaide to Alice Springs and continues to Darwin, passing through townships and roadhouses.It passes through some of the most lonely land in Australia).As we checked out of our motel the next morning we metioned these events to the receptionist who just smiled and said oh well you wouldn't be the first to talk about things like that. That was all we could get out of her,she wouldn't talk anymore.For my fiance, it is the second time that he has witnessed events of a 'supernatural' kind - he is in his late twenties. I have witnessed other happenings including metallic cigar shaped objects and other orange lights resembling stars but moving otherwise to indicate that they were not a star. I am 18.I am not providing my address as yet for security reasons - as well as I only connected to the net yesterday and haven't bothered yet to set up an e-mail address on my computer. I will watch this site for further information.I have provided this report because I know how hard it is to gain information on these matters. As well as in the interests of 'science'.I hope you make some use of this report.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

April 14th, 1997. Between 02:15 AM - 02:30 AM I was driving my crappy, navy blue '91 hyundai excel on Interstate 287 North between the town of Edison and Piscataway with my friend who would also be a witness.  This part of the interstate is elevated to the point of being a small bridge and so provided us with a good view.  My approximations of distances between the ground up is based on the elevated point from which I and my friend stood. The cloud cover at this time of night was very dense and extremely low, moving at 25 to 30 mph.  The lowest clouds were only 200 to 300 yards above.  It was a very rare sight to see this type of cloud cover here in New Jersey as it is usually only seen in the more southern areas of the United States.  I commented on such nebulous formations to my friend as he too looked up into the sky.  Soon after, I noticed a large light patiently appear from out between the clouds about a 1/4 of a mile away.  I started analyzing it's most awkward arrival with extreme precision.  My thoughts and analyzations were as follows: There's a light the size of a street lamp light up in the clouds... It's a Fire Ball!!! No...it's moving too slow, it would of hit by now. The light that it's emitting is equal to that of a street lamp. Why is it floating above the lowest clouds and under the highest ones? To this I would point and yell to my friend of the unexplainable sight.  We were both frantic. But not as frantic as when the second light appeared from out of the clouds.  I pulled over immediately for us to get a better observation.  It was at this point that we could both see more than just light.  It was an actual physical object.  Very Dark Gray, slightly darker than the clouds.  Once the third light  finally exposed itself we were able to fully identify the shape of the floating object.  It was a perfect triangle.  The lights were located at the ends of each angle, but the angles were not pointed. The were rounded off. My friend and I were sobbing, crying in sheer terror, but we were more overwhelmed with happiness for we knew we were taking part in witnessing the unbelievable. Once we were both able to make full visual contact of the object we became very serious in order to obtain more visual information.  I will now become more descriptively technical so that there is no misunderstanding as to where I was positioned according to the ""object's"" location and my own. Going North on 287 we pulled over to witness the clouds come in from the North West and move South East.  The object also moved in this direction.  It moved in a straight linear axis from left to right where we were standing.  But while it was on this axis it rotated 360 degrees clockwise, patiently, without a sound.  All of a sudden the object in its immense proportions snaps into a perfect 90 degree turn and would begin to rotate instantly into a Counter Clockwise rotation North East from us.  In essence, the object's movements were perfectly geometric.  And so it was with this turn that it would make it's decent into the thickness of the low cloud cover. We could not tell of the object's full dimensions, for we witnessed it from below.  If it was the bottom of the craft that we may have been looking at then we do know for a fact that it appeared flat.  Nothing protruded from it in any way.

As I looked east I noticed two clouds ended in a curved line. I also noticed a distorted look to the sky in that area about 100' in diameter. I call two friends outside. As they came out there was a loud buzz and a blast of hot air. The leaves on the trees about 200' from our position rolled and turn up as if exposed to heat. They never recovered and died. My friends asked what was that to which I had no reply. ((NUFORC Note:  Date appears to be approximate.

Upon leaving work I was heading home.  On the horseshoe of Nike Ave. I saw against the mountains ( north of the  artillary range area) what looked like fire.  The year before we had fires in the same area and this caught my eye.  But this orange ball of fire moved  from upper part of the mountains downward onto the White Sands Missle Range where I work.  This ball then moved horizontally northward and then eastward in my direction.  I was driving westward towards the object.   The horeshoe is just a curve in the road on Nike Ave.  and after the curve it is a straight road for about 9-10 miles.  As I drove towards the objest ( about 5 miles ) it also came towards me. It traveled about total 8-10  miles (not sure this distance) from mountain top to middle of the missle range where I stopped my car midway down Nike Ave. The object in its travel changed color from fire orange and circular to a luminous white.  It was about  a block away in the desert.  It looked like a huge lightbulb desending from a height of about  30 feet  to where I thought it might touch down on the ground but it did not.  It kicked up a little desert dust for only a second then huvered in one spot about 10 feet off the ground.  It did not wobble or drift in any direction from the first time I obsevved it to the time I later lost site of it.  It traveled like it was programmed to follow a digital course or never made any course corrections as it moved.  I figure it took about less than 5 minutes to travel from the mountain top to the middle of the road or the 8 mile trip. When I stopped my car on the road I stopped delibertly  to have my headlights facing the thing.  It did not land but stopped and did not move in any direction.  It just stayed put and it did not rotate or pitch.  It looked like a lightbulb about 6 feet across and about 10 feet tall.  glass end up. it had a dark socket underneith....just like a litebulb.   I thought it might be a hot air balloon but it was incondesently bright.  If people were in it they would have to be in the glass section the bottom socket section was too small.  There was no ropes between sections.  The two sections were connected directlly together.  I then saw the thing turn its light off and I told myself don't blink and watch to see if this thing would turn on again.  I was thinking if it was a hot airballoon I would see the delay of small fire ignition to maximum turn on of full throttle propane burn. Well, I did not blink and I thought I could see beyond the thing (like it became transparent for a second)  then it turn to full brillancy instantly (like you turn on a lightbulb).  There was no flutter of flame as a hot airballoon does and the thing never changed altitude.  I thought  that if anyone was in the thing they would have had there night vision obsured for the high intensity of the light that came from within.  I couldn't see anything inside if it even had a inside.  All I saw was a giant lightbulb flying in the air.  Next I decided to flash my headlights on and off to see if anything would happened.  At that point the thing started back the same way it had came back the exact course traveled before up to the mountain top.  As it was heading back I followed down the road in its direction but it was faster than my car.  Then it went over the mountain top and I lost site of it for a few moments.  About 10 minutes later it came over another mountain top and it looked like two car lights coming over the mountain top (above the mountain).  Each light came north together then flew away from each other (one east and the other west like synchonized swimming and then flew back to the mountain to be lost from site.  I also absorved a flashing red lite that looked like the light on a helicopter above the mountain right where the two lights flew.   Also this object didn't make any sound as it travel or stopped in the air.  When the object first came down along the mountain it lit up the mountain with its orange glow.  If this was balloonist they were flying in an are forbidden to fly (White Sands Missle Range artillary range) and they would be flying over very trecherous and dangerous mountain at night.  When the object flew back over the mountain it remained luminous white.   I don't know if it turned into two headlight at the end of the trip but these two lights were alot smaller in size and the flashing red light would be a third light .  All three lites were three seperate units.  The red lite stayed motionless over the mountain top while the white lites were moving in two different directions to each other.  All three came to the same are on the far side of the mountain and that is where I could not see them anymore. It was the one day in my life I wish I has had a camera.

I was a few miles outside of Warsaw, Poland in a summer home in a desolate part of the country right next to wooded lands with my mom, sister, and family friends. One evening, I believe the 15th of July, we were sitting outside. It was about 10:00 p.m. I was getting back from the horse stable right outside the fenced property of the house with the man who owned the summer home, a family friend. As we were getting back and approaching the house, I noticed my mom was holding our camera and recording something. Her, the family friend, and I were the only ones outside at the time. I asked my mom what she was recording. She then pointed I believe Southward right over the treeline of the nearby woods. As the family friend and I proceeded to look in that direction, i suddenly noticed a diamond shaped white light. It was completely silent. It was positioned in one location, without moving even the slightest bit in any direction. I only saw the light, and no other structure around it, making it impossible to be a helicopter or any other type or air vehicle or structure. We proceeded to watch the light for about 3 minutes. It remained unchanged. Then, it became a little brighter, and I noticed the color of the object was changing to a sort of bluish light. It then proceeded to move downword toward the treeline at an unusually slow, but constant speed. It seemed to move straight down without any other movement. Then, it disappeared below the treeline. After that, we went our ways, but I kept looking in that direction every few minutes. Unfortunaltely, nothing else happened that I noticed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I have seen sat. before but never in a group and never in that direction (I always thought sat. went straight east-west or north south Or vise versa)These objects were in a triangle with the leading edge having 2 and the 3rd behind the left side.(if you had a square and blacked out the bottom right corner thats what it looked like). They were moving steady like sat. but slower than any I've seen in the past and on this night.I watched them for probably 60 sec. before I desided to go inside and wake my wife up and have her come out and see what she saw. This probably took another 60 sec. to get her shoes and coat and her outside(I was afraid they would be gone).But they were still there I pointed them out and asked my wife what she saw(I had just told her that I wanted to show her something)and she verified what I had seen. She was able to watch them for probably 30-45 sec. before we lost site of them behind the trees.

The clouds had covered the sun.  I was staring into the sun area as i had sunglasses on. I stared for about 10 minutes up at the clouds not looking for UFOs blah blah. I live right near Philadelphia airport and have seen many airplanes etc and hear engines all the time. This, this was different, I couldnt believe my eyes.  There amongst the clouds was a circular shape. 5 inches in diameter at least 12000 feet in the air.  The clouds were high yesterday the ones that we had.  There was no airport takeoffs or landings at the time i saw this object. Is kind of wierd but for about 10 minutes there was no jet engines nothing. In the clouds i could see the circular shadow of an object curving toward the thicker clouds.  I started pointing up to the sky, my fiance was next to me as well as about 10-12 other people. I couldnt say anything i just pointed in awe.  The clouds were thicker toward the philly area and that was when it took off into the thicker clouds.  No engine noise no nothing.  I know what i saw. Be it a ufo or hi tech govt vehicle is was nothing of this planet in my honest opinion.  I dont know what it was but i do know it had perfect symetrical form from where i was laying it was about 5 inches in diameter it had to be at least 10000 feet in the air, as the clouds were super hi yesterday.  And that is my story.  Next thing i know i couldnt stop thinking of it all day.  I have no photographs i have no video only my words to describe it. Believe or dont i dont really care.

It appeared stationary to me at this point.  We went outside (had been on our enclosed patio) and saw two neighbors, to whom we gave the binoculars to observe the lights.  One (occupation unknown) noted that the lights were moving.  I looked again, and noted that through the binoculars small darting movements could be observed, although the lights remained in the same relationship to each other and in the same general location.

I had two teenagers, one preteen, one todler two adults and one tent. About 2300 I was trying to rearrainge the beding to provide some relief from the cold. Went to my pickup for a ground tarp. My ex-wife had abandoned the tent and was sleeping in the cab of the pickup with the engine running and the heater on. The kids were all with me in the tent. As I recall, the pickup engine stoped for several minutes; Tina woke up and nearly wore out the starter trying to get it going again. Vehicle was 1969 GMC 1/2 ton (with several dozen USMC sticker on it). I heard a sound that I initially thought sounded like a water fall. Looking up, I saw a large object that I initially thought was 4 military helicopters flying in a formation. I did not see any red or green lights, only white ones. I then noticed that the stars behind the paralagram formed by the four lighted helos were occulted.  The sound was not the typical (womp womp womp) made by military helos (I spent 2 years in the Marine Corps and 6 years in the Navy, I know what helos sound like.)  It sounded more like a waterfall, using a bass voice. The object(s) were traveling slowly west to east. Their speed was about the same as a flight of helo as seen from the ground. It is difficult to guess the altitude, however I have seen military helos overhead many times. The altifude of this object(s) was similar. The shape was not square, or prehaps square seen from an odd angle.

One day in the summer of either '94 or '95 I saw a craft from my window(as I was on the phone with a fiend) on the North side of the house.  Basically, this craft appeared during the daytime and was travelling N-NE at a high altitude.  It was definitely travelling above the normal flight path of the incoming planes which usually come in the E-W directions at a few thousand feet.   This craft flew over at a constant speed and looked spherical in shape, I say this because the reason it caught my eye when I was talking to my friend on the phone was that it was glaring like a silver object reflecting the sun.  I have seen planes glare the sun before, but this was not a plane because it was pulsing this glare.

I know this was a while ago, but I will describe this the best I can. I used to live in Darby,Montana about 7 years ago. One night while a friend, and myself sat around a camp fire, I saw something different than I have ever seen before. I am not sure exactly what it was. I was looking up at the night sky, and saw what looked like stars moving. These objects seemed to be pretty high up in the sky, so I really could not give details about what shape they were, etc. They just looked like stars moving very fast. They were all moving in pretty much a straight line at first. I watched these things moving, and told my friend to look. We were both kind of wondering what this could be because we had never seen such a thing before. The objects appeared to be fluttering, kind of shaking rapidly as they moved. I grabbed a flashlight, and beamed them, and then one branched off. The others went on in the same straight line. I kept my eyes on the one that branched off, and after a minute or two lost it behind a tree. My friend, who is the toughest guy I know went inside with his eyes wattering! I just wanted to share this with you because it was pretty unusual.I remember at first thinking these might be satellites, but I am not sure that a satellite can flutter, and make a ninety degree turn in the sky! I wonder if anyone else has had similar experiences. What I saw was not to spectacular, but pretty unusual. Not sure of exact date and time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I decide to go out for a little walk to stretch my legs at about 21:30 (9:30pm). As I was walking west on the enterance road I happened to look up and saw a ball of light come out from behind a building to my right. This ball of light was a very bright white and was approximately 1 mile to the northwest of me about 300 feet in the air, possibly a little higher. The ball of light was traveling from the north to the south at a speed I would estimate at about 200-250 miles per hour. As the ball of light was approaching the centre city area, it all of a sudden did what I think to be a 90 degree turn and go straight up into the air for about 200-300 feet. This ball of light hovered for a second in one position and then came back down to its previous position and proceeded back off to the north towards Scranton, PA. By the time I got to where I can look to the north, the ball of light was gone and never saw it again. What I found very surprising is that the ball of light took the same track out that it came in on. There was no noise with this ball of light. It was just a ball of white light, no other colors in with it. There was no streak or trail behind it. I am not aware of anything in the world that can do such a perfect maneuver without some variation off of its track. I would estimate the size of this object to be like extending your arm and holding a little rubber super ball or a quarter in the air. I asked around to other people I was working with that night, if they saw anything but they said no. I know I was not seeing things. Some people say maybe your mind was playing tricks on you but I don't think that is it. Like I said, it was pretty early in the evening about 2130 hrs.

I was out for the evening with a group of friends. We were warming our cars up outside of a restaurant we had spent a few hours at. I was standing outside of my car talking with some of them in another car through their windows. For some reason, I happened to look up and notice how clear the sky was. A few seconds later I either looked up again or something caught my attention. I saw this enormous ""thing"" that took up my entire peripheral vision. It seemed football fields in size. It was transparent except that you could somehow make out a cylindrical or cigar form (I couldn't really see the ends fully - the transparency sort of tapered off). It was rotating as it was moving across the sky (similar to a cement truck travelling down the road spinning the cement). It had (what appeared to be) stars attached to it that seemed to be evenly spaced apart, but not in any particular formation. The same size but maybe a little brighter than ""normal"" stars. You could tell they were attached to this ""thing"" because you could see them going around with the rotations of the anomaly as opposed to the typical stationary stars I could see through the object. One of my friends in the car I was standing outside of heard my exclamation and saw my expression and pulled himself out through his open window quickly to try to see what I was looking at.  He is an amateur astronomer and knows how quickly things can disappear. Without making a noise the anomaly made its way across the sky travelling quite quickly. The sighting lasted about 10-15 seconds until it was too far for us to view it any longer or disappeared. My friend and I were quite shaken after the event. He describes it as if the sky opened up. I describe it as if a piece of sky was cut out and was moving against the rest of the sky.

We were at a point in the canyon that begins to open up (and eventually turns into flat desert about three or four  miles further ahead of where we say the object.) The night was clear.  There was enough natural light from the stars that you could see the cabins and ranches though not much detail.  The other side of the canyon terrain was visible.  It wasn't ""pitch dark.""   All of a sudden we noticed movement in the canyon just ahead of us.  We could not make out WHAT we saw because the object was dark.  There was an eery silence.  We both saw it and slowed down to view it. It was in the center of the canyon heading in the direction (into the canyon) that we were leaving.  The massive size of the thing was what struck us as odd, not to mention having no idea as to what we were looking at because it was too big to be going into that area.   We slowed the Suburban down to watch it.  It was silent, we could see the outline of it due to the way it blocked out everything.  In other words, we could see where it wasn't because the background of the canyon was illuminated enough to outline it.  It was as if this thing absorbed light because there was no reflection from it.   We both asked one another ""what is that?""  It had lights at the front and back.  Just small lights.  It moved in a graceful manner with simialr motions to that of a helicopter (up, down, sideways, forward backward).  There was no sound.   I remember thinking it reminded me of the Hindenburg photos I have seen though it did not look ""balloon-like"".  This thing seemed solid.  Just the shape reminded me of it though this was a bit more oval instead of ""cigar-shaped"" as I would refer to the Hindenburg.   We watched it for a mile or so and then when we looked back again it was gone. There was no way it could have gone into the canyon any further as the canyon narrows.  It was too large.   We were probably a quarter of a mile from it when we passed it.  Trying to give an idea of its size is difficult.  Maybe the size of a DC-10 jet (if you drew an oval around the jet that is.)

We stood there for 20 seconds and we watched it move in a sharp parabolic path and then resume a straight direction as if it were turning on to a course. I got very exited and i asked my friend whether he had a pair of binoculars and he said yes and ran to get them from inside his house. Once he got out i still had my eye on this faint object. At the beginning of the sighting it was bright and then later it started getting darker as it moved over away from us towards the distant horizon in a diagonal motion. I managed to aim the binoculars at the light dot by using one eye to focus on the light dot and the other eye to search through one of the binocular lenses. Next, I saw the most remarkable sight that almost sent me into tears from exitement. I saw the little dot clearly in my binoculars and obviously it was much larger due to the binoculars' magnification. It still was a light dot though but a bit larger and no real distinct features were seen. Further on through the sighting, I kept focusing on the light dot as it moved and then i lost sight of it due to myself shaking from the cold. I managed to regain the sight of the light dot but i also managed to gain sight of something even more astounding that i cannot comprehend clearly. The light continued on but it ""met up"" with a larger cigar shaped craft that was around 12 times the size of this light dot. I could see the whole craft and it was truly enormous compared to the light dot. The dot then moved towards this huge craft and went up very close to the cigar shaped craft and stayed really close for about 30 seconds and then started shining brighter and became a bit larger and move perpendicular to the cigar shaped crafts hull ! or fusel age. It moved away to the left in my point of view and i felt heart broken to have to be able to choose which craft to observe since they both were increasing their distance from each other. I decided to look at the light dot and it was bright for a short period of time before resuming to a darker shade like the shade observed before the approach of the cigar craft. I was describing everything that i was seeing to my friend who was standing next to me and asking what was happening. Once the craft was some distance away from the cigar shaped craft (I presume) then it started travelling faster and faster until i could hardly keep up with the binoculars. It kept going faster and became darker and darker and dissappereared into black. I tryed refocusing back on to the cigar shaped craft but i could not find it in the night sky. I knew that i was viewing all of this near the horizon but it was up in the sky, very high up. I was shaken because of the sight that i encountered and I till today remember it very clearly. It remains one of the greatest sights that i have ever seen in my life. I have sighted similar lights when i was out on holidays but i never saw such variations in movement and interaction with other lights in the sky. I currently go out in summer on hoilday to the country just to dedicate time into viewing the lights and/or even greater observations.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

What began as interesting ended in fright. Let me explain further of my sighting. My friend and I were sitting and talking in front of his home on a warm June (Sunday) night. We both were talking on how are day went and mind you we were never under the influence of any kind of narcotic or alcohol for that mater. Both of us are in the status of the upper middle class society (at least I am uper middle class).Well, so we both sat talking when we heard an ""intense whistling and displacemnet of air"". These sounds are not foreign to us, for we both heard them at least 10 other times the last year and a half. After hearing these ""intense whistling and displacements of air"" all was quiet again (except the loud planes from O'Hare airport). Sitting proceeding with our conversations I saw an intense bright object in the shape of a circle floating in the western sky.At first I thought it was a visible star/planet but this was much more intense in lighting. It was flying northbound, but as it ""hovered"" north it gradually faded until nothing of it was visible. A few minutes later we heard the ""intense whistling displacement of air"" seemingly right above of where we sat. My friend has a street light/lamp in front of his home that has always shone (at night) as long as we both could remember, which suddenly turned off and we were imersed in darkness. At this point both of us were quite scared and I had to go. Wanting my friends company on the way home, we heard the same ""intense whistling and dispplacement of air"" above us. When we arrived at my house, which is only down the block, my friend needed me to drive him back home. Granted, he only had to walk about a block to go home but that is to show how sacred my friend was. Indeed, I too was quite affriad so after I dropped my friend off and parked my car I ran inside my home in utter terror.

Directly after this, I noticed that not only was I seeing and object, I was seening 3 points of light triangular in shape moving at the same speed and never getting any nearer or further from each other. This entire object or group of objects was moving to the south-east at a very steady pace only seeming to get slower as it neared the horizon.  All three lights seemed to be the same in intensity as well as size.  If these were seperate objects, they must have been at least 700 to 800 miles apart if not more.  It was about a 2 finger widths distance the hand measure.  I went inside and told my friend that he needed to come see this and He saw the same thing for about 20 more seconds before a gradual decrease in brightness caused the object/s to not be visable.  It would be important to note here that the decrease in brightness happened about 18-20 deg above the horizon.  I have heard of Geo Syncronized Satelites and geo-stationary as well. I am assuming that Geo Syncronized means several satelites are syncronized to do work like global mapping and such.  To do such work effectively would take at least 3 satelites to triangulate a position to be compared to the ground ;ie (temprate rainforest studies) and so on.  This might be the most logical explaination to my sighting and to a another reported sighting that was in May-Englewood California. Please let me know what you are thinking on this.  I have found the use of a stealh blimp to be an interesting yet unlikely scenerio.

A bright light, I will say white-I am red and green color-blind a little, flashed or pulsed or lit-up or whatever to my right, south mostly and a tiny bit west-- I am lying flat down feet pointed directly east.  Pretty damn bright, I think I saw it light up with my eyes closed or maybe partially open, dont really know.  I thought I had missed one of those bright meteorite deally-bobbers.  Approx 5-15 seconds later, now fully alert, a second flash, not really a flash more like a long flash lit up the same area , about like a street light at 2 or three blocks.  I could now see it was moving almost directly north, a tiny bit east.  I pointed my binocs at it and watched it pulse, light up, all the way across the sky, about 30 seconds, maybe 40 seconds, through the binocs until it went as far as I could see to the horizon.  There was no sound,  it looked at first like a aircraft landing light but I really think it was up a lot higher,  like maybe a satellite reflecting sunlight while spinning, but I have probably watched hundreds and hundreds of satellites or space junk or whatever, and they never pulse light like this.  The pulses were not evenly spaced, they were anywhere from 8 to 12 seconds apart, they were pretty bright, and this was a little hard to follow with 10x50 binocs because the light pulses were timed so far apart and not evenly spaced. It disappeared completly between light pulses.  It was about like tracking a satellite across the sky, had to have been visible to a huge area on the ground, About 2 to 6 minutes after this, a satellite went over from west to east, all the other satellites were going north to south or south to north-cant remember now. Never saw anything like this before, pretty wierd, you would agree if you had seen it. I remembered the west-east satellite for reference and checked all my times with the clock in the kitchen.

I could barely make out a triangular shape with red lights below each corner.  We drove 60 mph to follow it but it disappeared within 5 seconds and it was gone.

This was in a wooded residential area on a little street that is only about 6 blocks long, end to end.  There were no other cars on the street except mine, which is not uncommon since the street just leads to another road that is a dead end.  The craft had very bright green lights in the front and very bright, bright white lights in the back, one on each corner.  The white lights were so bright they illuminated the back of the craft and you could see it was solid across the back.  The green lights in front (one at the point and one or two on each side very close to the front point)  were also bright and emitted a green glow downward as they passed over my vehicle.  It was similar to witnessing a traffic accident where the crash may have only taken 1 or 2 seconds, but everything seemed to move in slow motion.   Looking out my windshield, first I saw the green glow from above, then the green lights as the first aircraft passed over my car.  I thought it was a plane that was going to land in the street and I slammed on my brakes and the green and white lights from the 2nd craft passed over my car and I realized they were 2 jet like aircraft, except they were triangle shaped and I said out loud ""What is that?""   They appeared to be flying in formation and reminded me of the way the Blue Angels fly, so close together.   The 1st one was in front of and a little to the left of the 2nd one.

The party was quite convincing, and the person occupies a position of responsibility in the business community.  We have checked with the administrators of local sky cameras, and have found no record of the incident yet, but if the objects were at as low an altitude as the witness suggested to us, they would not have been recorded on the camera in Woodinville, WA; its effective horizon to the west is some 20 degrees above the horizontal plane.

We usually take the main road up to Conifer, CO, but we decided to take the side road (Turkey Creek Canyon Road) this time. We were travelling about 30 mph when I noticed a glowing light up by the ONLY street light on that road. Just as I noticed the light it moved VERY QUICKLY towards the windshield (I thought it was going to hit us) then travelled with us for about 2 seconds when the driver suddenly hit the brakes and swerved out of the way at which time it QUICKLY flew off to our left through a clearing and over the ridge out of sight. The driver and I got out of the car and his date remained in the car crying and very scared. When we returned to the car we gathered our senses and I demanded that we each write down what we saw (as to avoid convincing each other of our encounter). When we compared what we saw, we all came to the same conclusion that we had seen a UFO. It was a translucent image about the size of an SUV. It had, what appeared to be a fan propeller, but it moved rather quickly for it ot be powered by a propeller. We could tell it had a very bright light because when it took off to our left it lit up the trees around it before darting down the ridge about 60-100 yards away.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,39.4994,-105.26090000000002

For those of you familiar with Winnipeg it occured in South St.Vital on Warde Ave and St.Annes Rd. I was the passenger in a friends car. As we were driving I looked to my right and noticed some bright lights over top of some houses. I thought about what I had seen and requested that we turn around and investigate. As we approached the object we noticed that it had 3 distinct lights in the form of a triangle. One on top and two to its sides. The lights seemed to have some color to them, at times I remember seeing hints of blue and red, but white was the most frequent. The object just seemes to hang there. It was no further away then 200 yards and was no higher than 50 ft. It hovered motionless for a few minutes. Meanwhile we were fiddling with the radio and flashing our headlights at it. Nothing out of the ordinary occured. Soon thereafter it proceeded top move in a South easterly direction. The lights were always visible. It seemed to move backwards. We proceeded to move east on the road we were on to try and intercept the object. We made it to a road which went North-South and turned south and then just stopped. The object was hovering over the road in front of us. Maybe 20-30 ft above the road and 200-300 yards away. It hovered, slowly moving backwards by some trees lining the road. At that point I rolled my window down and stuck my head out to listen....dead silence. There were no other cars on the road. We must have sat there 5 mins until it started to move in the direction in which it had come from. So we quickly turned around and headed down the same road we were on before only this time we were following a moving target. The lights were still visible at this point. The object seemed to accelerate quickly. We were doing about 80 -90 km/hr when it out accelerated us and vanished. I have never seen anything accelerate like that before. It was fast. I will never forget that night. We were 19 and 20 years old and we were not under the influence of any substanc! es.

Arizona I was driving East on I-??? (the one that goes thru Yuma.) And I was about twenty miles west of Yuma. When I noticed, a REALLY brite lite.(to the South side of the Interstate) I look'd as if it it were only about fifty or so feet off the ground. And about a mile(mybe closer)or so off the Interstate. So I kept on driving. And the light would shine real brite and then kinda dim out. But the more i drove. (say five or so miles) the light would appear and disappear. Staying directly parallel with me. Then I noticed some more lights. So I pull'd over on the side of the road. I was looking at the light. Which was really brite. It was a clear night that night. And I could see other planes in the sky. Thats what made me think that this was an UFO. Cause the planes had lights that blink'd. And this lite that I was seeing in the sky wss not blinking.(like a plane does) It was like one major lite. Then there would be more lights, appearing to the left of the first light. It was kinda like a formation it made.It lite up from the right to the right to the left.....and then diagnally. (I count'd at least 13 to 15 lights simotainisily) The lights would shine real brite then dim out.

It was a cloudless moonless night from our perspective. looking towrds the SE at the mountains a 'silver orange' or 'chrome orange' ball popped up from behind the mountain range and made a very slow circle around our camp at an altitude of aproximately 5-6 K ft. The object moved from the SE to the East and then headed to the NW, then to the NE and then popped back down below the mountains. It made no noise and moved as if it were drunk - it jerked back and forth and wiggled a bit. It appeared to be about the size of the end of a pencil held at arms legnth. The beginining and ending of its journey was very strange because it looked as if it was on a spring. I turned off our coleman lantern during its flight so it would not spot us and so I could see it better. We had seen a small private single engine propeller plane about a 1/2 hour before that went from east to west.

This is one of many strange things I have seen while camping. I hope to be able to file the other events as time permits.  At the time my girlfriend saw it too but, she is now my ex girlfriend and I have had to file a restraining order against her. I am unable to give you any details about her whereabouts at this time.

Sure enough, a dimly lit object came from the south and halfway across the sky gained in brightness, reached a peak of brightness, and slowly dimmed and moved on.

Long.N.44 2x.xxx W.113 3x.xxx  ((exact location deleted; is known to investigators))  While on a hunting trip, myself and 2 others of a party of 4, a very strange object was observed at a very close range.   While getting some food for dinner out of the back of my pickup at 9:45 pm, I got a feeling of a thick heavy blanket above me and chills down my spine.   As I turned to look up, the double AA size mini mag flashlight I was using scanned across the corner of a dark triangular object floating directly above us  and our camp trailer.  The object was COMPLETELY SILENT, no noise at all!  I started yelling  HOLY S--T!, HOLY S--T!, HOLY S--T!, YOU GUYS HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!  I was extremely upset and shaking.   As I was running (stumbling)  to the trailer my brother and another party member came running out the door.   I did not take my eyes off of this object.  As my light moved across the corner of the triangle, I could see rounded dark edges and the flat bottom.  The bottom had a texture that looked like suede leather and had a gold-grey color to it.   After the light shined on the object it ""throttled up"" with a very deep low sound of intense power, increasing in intensity slightly and began to float straight up and then move forward(?) up a steep narrow canyon that goes from 6700 ft to 9800 ft.  The object moved up the canyon very slowly like a hockey puck sliding on ice.  My brother and the other party member had time to look up at the object just as it started to move forward then they both ran to the pickup and grabbed their 10 x 42 Ziess binoculars and continued to watch the object until it was out of sight.  As the object began to move forward the sound stopped and movement continued with complete silence.  This object was only about 200 feet straight  above us when first spotted, about 300 to 400 feet above us when it started to move forward.   When it ""throttled up,"" three lights, one on each corner of the triangle came on.  Each one of these was about ten feet in diameter and glowed like a dim dome light.  Another ""light"" in the center was about 20 feet in diameter and protuded below the bottom (!) about 8 feet and was deep red in color and pulsed about once a second.  The outline of the object had a slight light halo around it.  None of the lights illuminated anything.  The shape was a perfect triangle with radius corners and radius edges.  The size was enormous with every detail seemingly in perfect proportion.  Each side of the triangle would be approximately 250 feet long.  The thickness of the body looked to be about 30 feet.  Other dark circles in a symetrical ""design"" were slightly visible.   The night was clear, lots of stars, no wind.  There was no smell, no feeling of blowing, prop wash or thrust of any sort.   My bother and I are building contractors and like to think we are normal, educated, business people. The third witness is a successful stone mason contractor.  We all have excellent eyesight.

After watching it we determined it was not rising upwards, but coming toward us. We then noticed a flashing red light approached the craft at the 1 o'clock position, and remained beside it for a moment, before moving ahead of the craft at about the 7 o'clock position. It steadily came toward us and we noticed that the small flashing red light in front of the craft appeared to be a jet, and the large craft was following it.  As it began to move above us, we no longer saw the one large white light we had seen before, but we saw six fairly large white lights on the bottom of the craft.  These lights were rectangular in shape, and looked very similar to flourescent lighting fixtures you would find in a garage or kitchen.  The larger craft stayed very close behind the jet (obviously following its' flight pattern), but made no noise whatsoever.  The sound from the jet's engine was all that could be heard.  It was moving much too fast to be any type of balloon, or anything like that.  As it got directly over us, we could make out a somewhat triangular outline, and saw what appeared to be a semi-circular shaft coming down from between the six rectangular lights.  We wondered amongst ourselves if this could be some sort of secret military plane, and we noticed that the large craft had no flashing lights, only the six lights on the underside.  This craft was extremely large and absolutely dwarfed the jet it was following.  We watched the flight pattern as it seemed to be going back from where it came from.

V-shaped craft observed flying east over Phoenix.,Phoenix,AZ,1997-03-05T14:00:00,chevron,60 minutes,"Occurred : 3/5/1997 14:00  (Entered as : 030597 1400) Reported: 2/7/2001 00:21 Posted: 2/18/2001 Location: Phoenix, AZ Shape: Chevron Duration:60 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16322.html,"V-shaped craft observed flying east over Phoenix. On a clear sunny day I observed what looked like a V-shaped silver craft approach Phoenix, Arizona, directly from the west. I watched it cross the ""valley of the sun"" for an hour. At the time I was at work. My desk was next to a window on the second floor of a building that was situated on the side of South Mountain. From my vantage point I could see the entire valley for 20 miles in every direction except south. I could also see dozens of aircraft approach or depart Sky Harbor airport all day long. When I first saw the V-shaped silver craft approach from the west, I at first thought that it was a specially designed aircraft coming into Sky Harbor. I pointed it out to a co-worker and asked him what he thought it was. He didn't know. Strangely, as the craft neared Sky Harbor, it veered to the north and skirted the airport. Both my co-worker and myself wondered out loud about the craft and where it was going. Fortunately, as the craft continued to fly due east it got closer to us. It completely bypassed the airport and continued east. Though we couldn't make out details, we noticed that the V-shape of the craft began to change and warp. We then realized that we were probably witnessing a flock of silver-backed ducks. They eventually disappeared out of sight still heading east. I only mention this because it may have a bearing on the V-shaped silver craft that was witnessed at night flying over Phoenix just a week later. I did not see the night sightings because I was in bed, since I had to work an early shift. Though I had seen ducks in flight, I puzzled over why they were heading east. After all, this is a desert, and most migratory birds fly north and south. A week later I found my answer. Thirty miles due east of Phoenix there's a town called Fountain Hills. In the middle of this desert community there's a huge man-made lake. In the middle of this lake lies the world's tallest fountain. I drove out there. Once I got to the lake, there were hundreds of ducks, all species. Brown, black, white -- and sil! ver. I c annot confirm that the V-shaped craft many people witnessed that one night in March, 1997, was a flock of ducks -- but it's the truth that I saw them migrating during the day just a week prior. My experience might help provide a logical answer to why the V-shaped craft proceeded over Phoenix at such as slow rate of speed. Most people usually report UFO's flying at a high rate of speed. By the way, the V-shaped craft, if I recall correctly, was also flying east. I know that this explanation might prove disappointing to UFO enthusiasts, but not all UFO's are alien. Some are of earthly origin provided by mother nature herself.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I was driving between Jayton and Post on Highway 380 on a very hazy, humid night.  I had never travelled this highway before, but was told later that it was remote, unpopulated ranch land.  As I approached a rise, I could see the reflection of a flashing blue light in the haze on the other side of the rise, but could not see the light itself.  I assumed it was the flashing light of a communication tower.  When I topped the rise, to my left was a flashing blue light about tree top height over the fence line, right next to the highway.  To my astonishment, the light, which appeared to have been hovering, immediately went from stationary to 65 miles per hour, traveling still over the fence line next to the highway, as though looking at me through the drivers side window of my van.  The light was bright blue, about the size of a basketball, flashed about every second, and I heard no sound from it. For several minutes the light stayed right beside my van.  I thought maybe I was beside a train or something, but later found out there were no tracks beside the highway.  The light drifted behind me, and I slowed down to do a u-turn to try and figure out what I had just seen. As I slowed to about 10 miles an hour and was about to turn around, the light appeared outside my drivers side window, again as though staring at me through the window.  Now I am scared, and I jammed on the gas, only to see the light accelarate at the same speed I was going.  For the next 15 or so miles the light travelled right beside, behind, or over my van.  At times I could see it over the highway in my rear view mirror.  At other times I could not see the light itself, but could see the flash reflected in the haze, realizing that it was right over my van.  It would also move over the ditch on the other side of the highway(Blowing my theory that I was beside a train running on tracks beside the highway).  As I approached the city of Post, the light finally disappeared from view.  I reported the incident to a deputy sherriff I saw coming out of a cafe, assurring him I was not some crazy person or high on something.  He said I looked and sounded credible to him, and said he would drive out later to take a look.  He told me that there were no train tracks beside the highway, and that I had driven through ranch land that was largely unpopulated. He had no clue about what I had just seen.  I am a conservative, professional person, late forties in age, and don't do drugs or drink.  If this had not happened to me personally, in the past I would never have believed this story to be real if I had read it.

I never have considered myself as destined to sight a UFO, but did I? The other night I heard a jet passing overhead.  I looked up.  It was low but...the distance wing to wing of it's lights was small.  I can't guess how high it was but it answered a question I had been considering for a few weeks now.  This craft was not super high up and not low...and I could hear it clearly over the road noise.  And the distance, wing to wing of its lights was quite small.  Why is this important? A couple weeks ago I was about to enter my home.  I live in the suburbs. It was a very clear night.  Stars could be seen.  The city lights obscured the horizon though.  I looked up.  At about 45 degrees I saw something. I say something because I stared at it and could not figure out what it was.  I ran every explanation and captured as much detail about the experience in my head as I could because I knew I would be trying to recognize what I saw for some time. Hold your arm out at 45 degrees.  Spread your index finger and thumb apart.  This is the approximate distance tip to tip of two of the lights on this thing.  The front light, making a triangle, was not way out in front.  It made the shape of a  hangglider, not a jet.  There were 3 lights in this triangle shape.  The lights moved synchronous with each other so I assumed that they were attached to the same object.  Given it's wingspan I figured it was either very low...or if high...it was very big... If it was very high then it was larger than any aircraft I could even conceive. If it was very low then I should hear the noise of whatever was powering it. It was totally silent...not a bit of noise...it simply floated by.  It could have been a hangglider but it's movement didn't suggest that and there was no hill and again no sound from a motor so it would be governed by the wind...it did not suggest this...besides what idiot would do this in the dark? The ""thing"" simply cruised across the sky at a steady speed..not fast..not slow.  Making absolutely no noise.  It took a matter of about 20 seconds for it to move from me spotting it above me until it just vanished into the horizon lit by the city lights....it just sort of faded into the lights. I had an idea that between the 3 lights there was a craft yet it seemed like I could see thru that part to the dark sky behind it.  Since I was in the city and the stars...although visible, did not fill the sky...I had no means to determine if I could see the stars thru the craft or that there was a solid mass between the lights which would block out the stars. That's about it.  I keep replaying this happening for me in my mind. Over and over.  Trying to determine what known flying object that could have been.  I never dreamed that I would ever be destined to see a craft from another world...but now I'm reconsidering that.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,45.4835597,-122.8374352

My husband was getting ready to go to bed when he yelled at me to look at all of the airplanes flying by.  When I went in to look at the planes, facing the north, I glanced through the window that faces west.  There was an odd shaped bright light.  When it started bobbing around, I got my videw camera and started taking pictures.  It danced around, disappeared, came back, and came so close the first time that I got a stunning look at it.  It was round, except at the very bottom, it looked flat.  It had two lines through the middle, a round circle in the center of the paralell lines, and an emblem in the middle of the circle.  There were designs on the top and bottom parts.  I viewed this for about 5 seconds, then it gradually moved away and across the trees, then into a bright ball again, going further away.  It had a dark side and a bright side.  When it was bright, there would be a jagged streak of light moving upward, dimming the bottom part as it went.  After it dimmed, it would then get smaller.  It bobbed around, disaappeared and did all sorts of things for several minutes.  Then the dark side got very close and was very large.  It had the same markings on that side as the bright side.  There were red, yellow and orange lights that I could not figure out.  It came very close 3 times before it finally disappeared.  I have great movies of this.  What do I do with them.  I would love for someone to see them. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with this witness, and found her to be a good witness.

Just only several miles down the road, it was directly prior to our van.  I was driving, while my boyfriend hung out the window-- staring at what he knew was not a terrestrial spacecraft.

Moving in complete silence, it must have traveled up to thousanth's in the mile while heading downward, and then haulting to a hovering pace.""

I pulled my car off on the side of the road and watched it. It appeared as though it were simply floating but it did not look like a balloon or birds or a plane or anything like that.

She called the neighbor in whose field they were hovering and told her to hurry and look outside. The neighbor ran outside but forgot to take her glasses. My daughter ran back outside and spotted a flashlight at the objects. This action caused one of the lights to suddenly shine a strong powerful light directly down toward the ground.

Last night as I was going to bed at 3:00 am I noticed an extremely bright light in the skies over the city of Santa Fe.  My home is in the mountains and I have a very good view of both the city of Santa Fe and the city of Los Alamos. I observed this light for a while and noticed it seemed to have different colored lights flashing or something.  I got out my binoculars, and observed that there were indeed different colored lights.  It was too far away to observe the actual shape.  The object at first appeared to be stationary over the city of Santa Fe.  It did not appear to be moving at all.  However over a course of approximately an hour and a half, it very slowly moved over the city of Los Alamos, then very slowly moved lower in the skies until it appeared to disappear behind a mountain in or behind Los Alamos.  It went down not far from a red flashing light in the mountains, so I thought it might have to do with some sort of test or research going on in Los Alamos.  During this same period of time, I also noticed two other very bright white objects which appeared to be either round or elipse shaped in two different locations in the skies over Santa Fe.  Neither object appeared to be moving.  Both were very far away.  I observed an airplane during this period and compared the plane to these objects through my binoculars.  The three unidentified objects bore NO resemblance to the plane.  Two of the objects were still in the sky when I finally went to sleep at approximately 4 AM.  All of these objects were lower in the skies than the stars.  It was a very clear night.  All of these objects were much brighter than the stars and were easy to distinguish from the stars due to their extremely bright lights and to the fact that they seemed at times to move, although VERY slowly.

The star seemed very bright and as I said to my self, ""boy, that's a weird star?!?"" the brightness came down to the normal stars surrounding it, ( which in New Hampshire in a dark part of town can be pretty spectacular for a boy growing up in the subburbs of chicago for most of his life!). At that moment the star, or what it at fist appeard to be, gradually sped strait up into the atmosphere.

The light, which was only slightly dimmer than one of the stars in the Belt of Orion, at first was traveling very fast in a straight line toward the north.  It then abruptly turned westerly, then northerly, then westerly again and continued these erratic manoeuvers.  After watching the light for a minute or two, I went inside and asked my wife to view the light.  Although the sky was clear, after about five minutes of watchint the light, it faded from view, then reappeared and, and finally disppeared altogether, not to be seen again. Having spent many years as a journalist, I have observed many different types of phenomena, both natural and man-made.  Because of the apparent altitude of this light, its movement, its speed and its lack of any characteristics common to an aircraft or weather balloon (there were no anti-collision lights, for example, and its speed was much to great), I find it hard to believe it can easily be explained.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,37.696397848537,-97.32954010327022

I turned around very quickley to see a very bright white/blue object of great size traveling at a speed that my son and I agreed would see the object fall to earth very soon ( in fact I kept looking to see a mushroom cloud rise above the hills to our west) there was no cloud nor any sound at all.

A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN SIDE OF OBJECTS (BEINGS) ALL SAME SIZE SCURRYING RAPIDLY IN MOVEMENT. VERY BRIGHT INSIDE.  THEY WERE NOT HUMAN BEINGS.

THIS WAS ONLY FOR A BRIEF TEN SECONDS OR SO, SO INSTANTLY IN MY MIND, I KNEW I HAD TO ABSORB AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE.  I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.  MY VERY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THESE ""OBJECTS"" ANIMATED SCURRYING AROUND BY THESE CREATURES?...HAD SOMETHING TO ACCOMPLISH.  THEY LOOKED MORE ANIMATED THAN ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN, AND FRANKLY, ANYTHING I WOULD CARE TO SEE AGAIN.  MY KNEES KNOCKED TOGETHER FOR TWO HOURS AFTERWARD.

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STICKS IN MY MIND IS THE BEAUTY OF THE OUTSIDE OF THIS.  A RICH, HIGHLY POLISHED-LOOKING BRASS.  AMAZING.  I THINK EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON IN THIS WORLD, AND I THINK IT WAS MEANT TO BE BY GOD ABOVE, THAT I SEE THIS.  LIKE I SAID, WHEN WE WENT INSIDE, MY KNEES SHOOK AND MY HANDS TREMBLED FOR A GOOD COUPLE OF HOURS.  IT WAS AMAZING, AND MAGNIFICENT.  I SAID TO MYSELF, HOW GLAD I WAS THAT IT WAS STAYING UP THERE WE WATCHED THIS OBJECT FOR A DOOD HOUR AFTER THAT, COULD NOT GET TELESCOPE TO FOCUS AGAIN, NATURALLY.....THEN, WHEN IT DEPARTED, IT SEEMED THAT THE LIGHTS JUST, SIMPLY, FADED, THEN DIMMEND, THEN NONOTHING.

Date is approximate.  PD)) Woodland Hills, Los Angeles Shinning craft at midday. I was sun bathing at the pool in L.A fittness.  I decided to look up at the sky and block the sun out of my view to see if the theory of being able to see things in the sky was true, as i had just seen a story on doing that on a T.V show called ""Sightings"".  To my absoute surprise i did.  It was a very bright shining and pulsating object that appeared to shimmer.  I was much more silver than the sun itself, which seemed to be yellow in comparison.  This was a strange thing to see since i had a very memorable dream about meeting with aliens only a few days earlier.  In the dream they took me around the USA and showed me where they had bases, the strange thing was though, they all looked the same, and to me in my dream they looked like businessmen in suits.  I was wondering if i could communicate with the people flying it, this just came to me, so i asked them in my mind to fly in such a way that i could prove to myself that they were not an earthly aircraft.  In about 10 seconds it begen to fly in tight circles at an incredible speed, this clearly could not be a plane, helicopter, balloon or satilite.  When it finished, i heard in my head... ""there you go"". I was impressed beyond belief! I was in the presence of other people at the tiime and could not understand why they didn't look up to see what it was i was looking at so intently, it seemed that they didn't even notice me.  I felt the need to tell someone so i could get a second witness, however when i had that thought...I heard, or felt a thought that i should not do this and that this experience was a GIFT TO ME, so i din't tell anyone there at the time.  As i indicated this went on for 20 minutes.  The vehicle flew all over the sky at incredible rates of speed, covering an entire two thirds of the horizon in a few seconds, it was uplifting and joyful to watch, i had such a feeling of overwhelming wellbeing within me. At the end, after the spinning circles, they indicated that they needed to leave as they were being tracked, even though i never saw! any pla nes up there, and it took off to the west, out over the Pacific so fast that i don't know if it disappeared or left my view.  I have seen many lights in the sky and have had numerous strange experiences throughout my childhood in Australia, along with psychic events all my life, but this was the clearest i have ever seen in daylight.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,34.168753811659194,-118.61083318385651

Being an MP with the National Guard, I consider myself to be very attentive and aware of the unusual and out of the ordinary occurances within my view at all times. It was a very clear night, with light to no humidity, the moon was visable and 3/4 full. I noticed a semi-bright yellowish light hanging in the sky. It seemed to be stationary while comparing it with the moon which was about 3 feet away from the object.  We stared at it for quite sometime, about 25 to 30 minutes. During that time we noticed it move slowly to the left and remain stationary for a few minutes, then slowly to the right and remain stationary for a few minutes. It moved back and forth about 3 times, and on a straight horizontal path, no vertical movment at all. From my military experiance with roughly estimating distance to an object, I could tell it was no star, yet lower than an airplane would normaly be, and by movement, no airplane, helicopter or balloon of any type. And no known antenna towers in that direction of the Island. The low intensity and color of the light led me to beleive that it wasnt serving the purpose of a marker or for arial safty. The overall size of the light was about 3/8's of an inch when compared to my pinky finger at arms length.  For almost a two second time span, another light appeared to the left, as if it were turned up from a household dimmer switch, and was gone in an instant, the distance from the origonal light was roughly an inch, by perspective. My friend didnt notice the second light. The yellowish light was evenly illuminated, no bright or dim area, and no ring, or signs of any type of propulsion discharge or wake in its path. When I saw the second light come and go, I thaught they might be two baloonists and the second baloon was trying to gain altitude. Baloons are rare but not uncommon for the area. But the closeness of the two, and the consistent round ! shape an d duration of the second light ruled that out. After stareing at the unknown light for a while, and comming to no conclusions as of the source, other than that it wasnt going anywhere in a hurry, I told my friend of an occurance that happened many many years before, that involved the police from roughly 3 local countys giving pursuit of a slow moving object in the sky, which I beleive was first sighted and called in from a small single engine plane.  As for my background, I have four years of active military, and twelve years of National Guard, ten years as an MP with the Guard. For my friend of 4 years, he seems normal enough. We very seldom talk of UFO's or paranormal topics, as interesting as they may be. And as for the purpose of reporting this supposed sighting, I came across the web site while browsing and thaught that someone might find the information of use, or amusing.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,41.48576530612245,-71.30778163265306

I had personally seen and heard of many strange things from the farm kids around town, but I had never seen anything like this.  It was a sort of triangular shaped craft that didn't appear to be more than 50 feet above the roof line of houses, and hovered with quite a bit of force exerted on the ground, yet with little sound (if that makes sense when written).  I watched the object for another 20-45 seconds hover, or slowly advance, and then it left extrememly quickly out of sight, not up to space, but straight along the plains towards Garden City.  As I have said, I had watched the aircraft on the flight plan since I was 7, and have never seen an aircraft behave like this, Perhaps this is an undiscovered hotspot?

I said, it is a plane with its bright landing lights on, for we are very near Fernandina airport and private planes come and go all the time...But it kept on coming toward us and going lower...I would say descending from maybe 5000? to 2000? ft over a minute or two, but absolutely silent.

This is in the dark of the moon, just a fingernail already setting opposite this in the west.  Then it began to emit the mist or cloud also from vents above it, say at ll and 1 oclock.

Then the light was switched off, and the little cloud stood alone in the dark sky.

My little boy and I were in our front yard when I saw a black rectangular object hovering about 200 feet high and perhaps 500 yards to the south east of my home.  As we watched it the object began to drift to the west very slowly.  Since it was a very bright day with good thermals possible I thought the object might be some kind of debris that had been lofted into the air by a strong thermal and wind.  As we watched the object it grew a sprial tail that was at least as wide as the object itself and two to three times as long; this tail was black on one side and silver on the other.  It began to climb very rapidly with the tail spiraling in a clockwise direction.  Since it was in the local airport traffic pattern I called a report of flying junk into the ABE airport; they said they did not have anything on radar. Given the altitude and distance of the object, it must have been about 20 plus feet in length and at least six feet from top to bottom.  The cloud base was about 12 to 15 thousand feet that day and the object climbed to cloud base in less than two minutes.  I could keep visual contact as the sun reflected from the silver side of the tail. I have thought about this object nearly every day since we saw it and came to the conclusion that it was not just some kind of junk floating around for the following.  First if it was something like a cardboard box, the rectangle would have become mishapen when the tail extended as that would have been part of the box.  Second even in a boomer thermal I have never seen an object climb that fast (no whosh or whoom) it just climbed near vertical with the spiral tail flashing in the sun.  If it had climbed in a thermal, my experience is that a free flying object would circle and float not just climb like this thing did. This object is without question the most unusual thing I have ever seen. I would be very interested in knowing if anyone else has ever experienced this type of thing and if they did identify the object.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,40.60203012295082,-75.50084323770493

Okay, it was the evening of June 16/early morning of June 17, 2001. It happened some time between 11:45pm and 12:15am.  A beautiful starry night and myself and 3 others were star gazing with a telescope.  For some reason, the telescope would not focus too well, so mainly we were chatting and looking up at the beautiful stars.  We were all taking particular interest in an especially bright star that we were trying to decide whether or not was Venus. It was in the southern sky. So, just below and to the left of what we thought was Venus, a light appeared, much like that of a star.  Didn't think too much of it, the sky was full of them after all.  Then, quite suddenly this ""star"" burst a brilliant bright 'hot' light. We all squinted, it was that powerfully bright of an explosion.  So, of course we were all shouting out, ""Look, look! What was that!!?"" We all stared intently. It remained in the same spot for a few seconds as it slowly faded back to it's original brightness. Then, it began to very purposefully move westward.  One witness said, ""Look, there's another one!"" This one was of the same brightness (not the explosive bright, but now the average star brightness) as the first one now. This second light was moving towards the first, they were meeting up.  They melded together, then shot upwards into the sky and vanished. I'll never forget seeing this.  Someone suggested that the explosion was perhaps a revving of an engine, like a turbo or something.  I have honestly tried to dissect this, and think what logically it might be, but it was not a falling star(s), nor was it an asteroid, meteor, plane, helicopter. It was amazingly fast.   That they completely changed course was amazing too.  A moment I will never forget!

It is an extremely clear night tonight. Very beautiful with all the stars showing. We checked out a couple falling stars until one thing seriously caught our attention. We just saw this dim light flare up suddenly in the sky. We all thought it was a meteorite that seemed to be heading for us and it gave us a quick scare. It dimmed again and we saw it fly slowly away and then suddenly jet off at an intense speed and then stop practically on a dime. It freaked me out the most because last year, on Victoria Day I believe, I had taken my girlfriend on a canoe ride late at night. It was an equally clear night and we sat in the canoe gazing at the stars.

We were spooked but ignored it for awhile.Then we realized it was doing it again and once stopped and sort of shimmered back and forth. It was weird. We started to panic a bit but tried not to look at it. Then when we thought it had left my girlfriend told me to look in between two bright stars in the sky. No more than a mile away there seemed to be a cylindar shaped object just stopped dead in the sky. It seemed to be watching us. We heard no noise. We just saw a grayish object dimly lit near the bottom sort of spinning in the sky. It looked like just what you'd see on those UFO specials on TLC. We had not been drinking that night and I am a devout Christian who will swear by these words. It gives me the creeps to think about but it doesn't terrify me. I think it's probably just some top secret government experiment. Who knows. Oh, and if you'd like to know my mental capacity. I'm a second year college student.

"On June 19, 2001 at  3:00 a.m., I saw a bright orange rectangular object flying in a horizontal direction between 2 clouds.",Daytona Beach,FL,2001-06-19T03:00:00,rectangle,2 minutes,"Occurred : 6/19/2001 03:00  (Entered as : 06/19/01 03:00 am) Reported: 6/23/2001 08:25 Posted: 8/5/2001 Location: Daytona Beach (outside limits of), FL Shape: Rectangle Duration:2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18139.html,"On June 19, 2001 at  3:00 a.m., I saw a bright orange rectangular object flying in a horizontal direction between 2 clouds. I was on a vacation trip, driving north to New York City from Florida to visit family friends.  I departed from Fort Lauderdale around 9:00pm in my car and with my cat on Interstate 95 North.  Around mile marker 167 on Interstate 95, south of Daytona Beach, I was listening to my Yanni cassette while driving 70 mph on a dark empty northbound freeway, looking around for any sign of town lights because it was very desolate in that particular area.  It was a scattered cloudy night with patches of clear Florida sky about 3:00 am on Tuesday morning, June 19, 2001.  I was looking around the road ahead when something caught my eye to the right.  At first, I thought it was going to be one of those bright beacon lights for aircraft on a hillside.  When I turned my head eastbound to look up to check what it was, I was captivated by the sight I saw through my windshield.  I immediately took my foot off the gas pedal and on my brakes to slow down as I watched this bright orange rectangular object, positioned in a vertical ""I"" angle in the night sky, gliding smoothly from behind one cloud in a horizontal direction and it disappeared behind another cloud.  I kept looking at that cloud for about five minutes to see if the object would appear on the cloud's opposite side, but nothing happened.  The bright orange rectangular object seemed to move quickly in a straight direction between those two clouds, therefore, I assumed it would fly out from the other side of the second cloud.  I had to take my gaze off this object every 30 seconds to watch the dark freeway ahead of me (which was a level straight stretch), so I was able to watch this strange object for approximately two minutes.  There were no rocket flares (I've seen the Fort Lauderdale Air Show on May 5th where Navy jets flew at night through clouds so I recognize the rocket glare from behind the aircraft and how it made the clouds glow), no extra lights emitted from it, no trail or glow of this object as it flew behind the second cloud.  I checked my mirrors and ! around t he dark stretch of freeway for other vehicles or road lights, but I was the only one on that part of dark Interstate 95 at that moment as my car's speed was down to 40 mph.  I did not feel scared, but was excited to realize that I may have experienced a UFO sighting for the second time in my life.  I am a 45 year old single female native New Yorker and have been residing in Florida for three years.  My first sighting happened in New York when I was around 10 years old, during a city blackout (probably mid 1960s) when our entire neighborhood saw a bright multi-colored oval object hovering in the sky.  I personally believe that there is a possibility of other civilizations in the universe other than our human race, so I felt honored to have seen proof with my own eyes.

This past Sat. 30th Sept. 2000 at 9:47pm, I was just leaving the dept. store heading to my car when I looked up into the North Eastern sky and saw 9 to 10 RED objects dancing around glowing. Some were stationary(hovering)and the others were moving and winking out and return back in a differnt position. I yeld to the 4 ladies in front of me to LOOK UP, Look at that! They replied what is that? I only said call it ufo's for now I don't think they're flares. The Van Nuys Airport is in the opposite direction. The most compelling thing was before they vanished, they moved and formed a star constellation the Big Dipper and winked out a few at a time. This happen in just 2 to 3 minutes.

We are still uncertain as to what caused the event.  At least one newspaper reported that it had been caused by sky divers with flares attached to them as they descended.  However, one large group of observers at a church function allegedly witnessed the event for a measured 22 minutes, probably longer than sky divers could remain suspended beneath a parachute during a typical jump.  We will continue to investigate.  This note entered 04OC00, after the note below.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note #1/Entered 02OC00:  The lights were found to be flares, attached to the legs of skydivers.  Our gratitude to MUFON/Los Angeles for having investigated and found the explanation.  A letter from Don Waldrop, MUFON State Director, Southern California, and Bill Casey, MUFON State Section Director and Investigator, is below:   Hi Peter, A follow up to the reports of red lights over northern L.A. was reported in the Daily News on Monday, October 2 under the title ""Sky dives spur UFO reports"" by staff writer Elizabeth Rodriguez: It seemed like an episode of ""The X-Files"" to some residents who saw glowing red lights hovering in a V-formation over the northeast San Fernando Valley on Saturday night. ""It was really bizarre,"" said San Fernando resident Janine Alvarado, who joined her neighbors watching in front of their homes. ""I didn't know what it was."" An officer at the LAPD's Foothill station said police received a number of calls from people in the Pocoima area alarmed by the unusual sight near Whiteman Airport around 10 p.m. He went outside and saw parachutes. An employee at Whiteman said sky divers taking part in a show Saturday night had flares attached to their feet as they jumped out of the planes. The parachuters were entertainment for a party held in a hanger. The jumps were approved by the FAA, he said. ""Everything was legal."" Epifanio Baptista said he was with about 60 people at his house for a family reunion and his guests began to yell and scream when they saw the lights. But what they saw, he said Sunday, appeared to be moving to quickly across the sky to be sky divers. ""It's hard to believe,"" he said, ""My common sense says it's not possible, I don't believe the explanation."" As I indicated in my telephone call to you, we at MUFON-LA didn't receive any calls on the incident other than yours (which we appreciate very much). In the future, I would appreciate a call directly to me or Don Waldrop so that we can act more quickly to alert our team of investigators.

UFO encounter. But I was not able to get the all the information they needed. I will give you the just of it, I was 12 years of age and I had a older cousin in the Canadian military and at the time (1982) he was stationed at the Cold lake military complex in Cold lake, Alberta, Canada. I was 11 years old we (me and my family) drove from Edmonton to Cold lake to visit my cousin (he has been there for a good amount of time like 2-3 years) we went to the base and he then gave us a tour and some time into the tour he took me (only me) we went throw some hangers and hall ways and then into a space between 2 hangers and he lifted me up to have a look into a window into a hanger and what I saw was an image that will never fade away form my mind ever! What I saw was 3 objects one was a disk silver grey and seamless the size was as long as a city bus round the 2nd was a cigar shape and silver grey and seamless the size was as long as a city bus the 3rd I did not see very well. The thing that Chris and Stanton ask me was to get my cousin to come forward with this information. I did talk with him on this subject and he says ""he does not remember.""  And that's were it ended. As for my second encounter I was traveling north from Calgary to Edmonton in the summer of 1998 the time was 10:42pm or 10:45pm. And in the sky I saw what I thought was a very bright falling star, well I never seen a star do this   It was traveling (slow) southeast leaving a long white trial and if I was holding a ruler in my hand at arms length it measures 7"" to 7.5""; long the trail remand in the sky for 20 to 25 seconds  It stopped for about 15 to 20 seconds and then shot (very very fast) off in a 90Âº angle north east leaving a bright red trail the red trail did not stay long only for 3 to 5 seconds.

Peter Davenport and crew of the UFO Reporting Center. I wanted to relay a story that happened to me in early 1999, February 4th, on or around. A girlfriend and I took a trip to the coast from where we live in Santa Rosa, CA. We headed out to the Goat Rock / Shell Beach area. The coast is only 30 minutes from where we live, and it was around 6 or 7pm because the sun was still in the sky. We had gone out to catch a sunset. It was around 9pm or so that the coast was a little too cold and windy to be at, so we headed up the cliff to the car, to get warm and watch the sky for awhile, because you can see lots of stars at night on the coast here. Anyway, she pointed out that Venus was over my shoulder which would have been south. We were facing the ocean, and I was in the driver seat. I looked north to over her shoulder, and pointed out that Mars was out too and we looked at the big bright reddish light that we thought was Mars. Then Mars kinda.. started to move towards us. We watched in astonishment as it really began to move towards us, neither of us knowing what to do right away. It got to about 400 feet above our heads, and began to circle us. We could see the craft much more clearly now. The craft seemed circular if viewing it from underneath, with 4 yellowish white lights in the center like thrusters? And red and blue lights; two blues on the north and south points and two reds on the east / west points. I could faintly see some light coming from what would be the top too, but it was non-descript. Either way, not FAA standard. We watched in terror as the sky dark and somewhat cloudy now came alive with lights that were moving in unusual patterns across the sky in front of us and all around us. We could see the stars through the patches of clouds, but we could also see many white lights moving around and chameleoning themselves among the clouds and the blackness of the sky and the stars beyond. It was so odd to us that any aircraft would be out at the beach at all in the first place, much less flying in awkward patterns at night at the beach. These lights were flying over the water too. All of the lights except two showed themselves to us and the ones that did were the ""Mars"" craft - picture rendition enclosed - and one that flew from south to north from a LONG LONG way away very slowly making no noise coming all the while towards us. When it got close I could see it was a dark triangular craft. It horrified me to see this, because I had listened to Art Bell's experience seeing it, and others on the radio. This thing moved like a helicopter would. Like ONLY a helicopter COULD in my experience of seeing them move. Only it was fast. And agile. It - picture rendition enclosed - flew around our car the only one out there in the parking lot of the beach for about 20 minutes with the other craft, the circular one. I could hardly see the actual triangle craft's main hull or whatever it was really stealthy and dark amongst the dark sky, but I could almost always see the thrusters behind it. They reminded me of a Star Wars ship, the Empire's Star Destroyers. You know how they have three big thrusters in a triangular formation on the rear? Like that. One odd side note, we did appear to have lost about 3 to 4 hours of time as I know it was only about 9:30pm when this started and when all the lights in the sky ceased moving about in the sky  and it appeared to us to be only about 1hour in total that they did  it was almost 2:45 in the morning. Take it as you will, I have no explanation. Any earthly craft that could move like that would have to have made a lot noise, even over the pounding surf. No to mention the weirdness of them all flying around at the beach at night. Thanks!",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

When I first noticed it it appeared to be ( best guess ) 2,000 - 3,000 feet altitude ( just hovering silently ) and when it shot back it appeared to leave the earths atmosphere and diguise itself as a star. As I continued to watch it it began to move again in a half circle ( clockwise 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock ) and sped off at a unbelievable speed ( North ) until it had disappeared.

I immediately looked at my watch  and it showed 11:12 pm and I desperately wanted another I witness but as I looked round there was no one else just the silence, no wind just the cold ( approximately -32 C).

I was smoking a cigarette and my nephew had to go to the bathroom and went in the bushes. While we waited to go home, I saw a rabbit and then looked up and told my nephew to look at the huge bird flying above us. I initially thought it was a bird because there were no lights on the object. The craft resebled a wingspan of a bird, long and thin. I thought it was going roughly 20 miles per hour at an assumed distance of roughly 150 feet up. I continued to watch the object while it flew toward the horizon (southeast with 101 fwy, oceanside). The opbject had what appeared to be stripes on each wing and I waited for wings to flap. There was little to no groung wind. After watching the objectgo into the horizon I was confident still that it was just a bird but still watched. Then it did something amazing, the object split in two parts just before it was near the horizon and each part/wing went off in east and west directions until I couldn't make it out in the sky. I was in the Air Force for the past 6 years before the incident and have seen many  planes fly in my presence including the B2 and it was definately not a public jet. The object made no sounds, and it was a quiet night. At first I thought it was dumb to report this but then I thought about all the other types of sightings I had seen on TV and thought since mine was different then all of them I should report it.

We had driven about 3/4 of a mile from the valleys edge and pulled off onto an approach into a field and  we all got out to observe the sky.

They did this for a few rotations and then one object took off in a westerly direction and the second object  sped off at a high rate of speed in an Easterly direction. These objects were a very long way off and seemed to be mixed in with the stars.  The second object was heading east at a high rate of speed and then seemed to slow down and  drop into an arch, or half circle pattern,   until it rseemed to reach it's original path and then it accelerated rapidly again in an Easterly direction. It proceeded like this for a short distance and then dropped into that pattern again and then back up into it's original path. It carried on doing this until it eventually went out of sight in the Eastern sky. I had  binoculars with me and even with them it appeared to be nothing more than a star gone crazy.

PD)) slow moving object burning and dropping pieces of burning material My apologies for submitting this form twice but the first date I gave was wrong. It was a little over a year ago, in 1999, not 2000. sorry I've never thought of this as a UFO experience but I'm watching a UFO-sightings show on the Travel Channel and one of the things that people in the show had video taped in Florida is the exact thing that I saw from my backyard. I had borrowed a night vision scope from a friend and I was playing with it in my backyard just after the sun had set. I often look at the night-time sky and I live right under the approach path of Ontario airport. Looking north/north-west over my rooftop I saw a sputtering light which looked like something burning fiercely, like magnesium, but not as bright. It was moving too slowly (in my opinion) to be a jetliner, and it wasn't losing any altitude. When I saw it I wasn't looking throught the night-vision scope but the magnitude diminished quickly and I began using the scope which had magnification as well as light-amp. Through the scope I could see the sputtering light very well and before it stopped I saw at least two to three small flare-type objects fall from it.  This is when I realized that the main thing was moving very slowly, like a blimp or something.  The ""flares"" would vanish within a couple of seconds and were not nearly as bright as the main light, and shortly after they dropped from the main part the  whole thing sort of faded away until nothing was visible through the scope or without the scope. I kept looking for something in that direction for 30-45 minutes and saw nothing.and at no time did I see any structure attatched to any of the lights. All of this, in my estimation, was taking place at about 2000 feet in altitude and I think about 20-30 miles away, possibly over the high desert to the northwest of Wrightwood.  I must say however that my ability to estimate values, distances, and altitudes has never been great. I expected to see something in the paper the next day about a airplane/military accident or even on the news shows that night, but nothing ever came of it. So, there it is, I hope this helps.  I would be more than happy to attempt to submit a mor! e detail ed report if you like. I'm only sorry I didn't think more of it when it happened, and I could draw from a fresh memory. Thanks. By the way, I was reading some of the local reports and there is one in Fontana about 10 years ago- a red light 300-500 feet up- stationary, as rain clouds passed by it didnt move...yadda yadda.. Myself and a buddy saw a bunch of people out of their cars in slight rain and looking up, so we stopped and saw that red light.  But quite frankly think it was a light attatched to a kite or something.. but who knows.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,34.12327628865979,-117.38932371134021

Blinking light moving very fast in an airplane contrail.,Turku (Finland),,2001-07-15T15:00:00,light,about 15 seconds,"Occurred : 7/15/2001 15:00  (Entered as : 07/15/01 15:00) Reported: 10/10/2001 3:41:02 PM 15:41 Posted: 10/12/2001 Location: Turku (Finland),  Shape: Light Duration:about 15 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19802.html,"Blinking light moving very fast in an airplane contrail. I'm not sure if the date is exactly the right. A few days in both directions at most. I was sitting out on my balcony taking some sun as it was a clear warm cloudless day. As I took a break from it I watched an aircraft fly over me at cruising altitude leaving a contrail. There is a flight corridor right overhead (west -> east) for most likely intercontinental flights. About five to ten minutes after the aircraft went out of sight (balcony's ceiling). I noticed a bright white light moving thru the sky. It was a constant blinking light in about one second interval, moving in my point of view in the exact same place and direction as the contrail left by the recent aircraft. But the speed was 6 - 8 times faster (or even more) than the normal aircrafts that slowly move across the sky. There were no change of speed what so ever. I didn't see any object during the ""no light"" period. Maybe it was behind the contrail. But the blinking light was so strong it seemed to be below the contrail. This made me think this thing was actually moving IN the contrail. The contrail wasn't affected in any way as it was slowly disappearing. The size of the light was about twice of a big airliner flying at cruising altitude. I'd say the light moved over the part of the sky I can see (about 40% of total) in about 15 seconds. The huge speed, bright blinking light, moving exactly where the contrail was, made no sense to me and still I'm wondering what it was.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I did not think too much about it, because I knew I was near the airport.  So I drove on for about 2 more miles, listening to my scanner.  Suddenly the channels started changing rapidly and the damn thing went nuts. Static, squeals, etc...  I was about to reach down and turn the thing off when the engine on my van quit.  The lights went out, and I rolled to a stop on the side of the road.  I tried and tried but the van would not start. I sat there for a moment, I got out my wireless phone, but it would not work, no signal nothing.  I was getting a bit pissed.  That is when I felt like I was being watched. Every hair left on my head stood straight up. Like when a baloon is rubbed on your head.  I heard a really loud noise, then nothing.  The van started, the scanner started too.  I had no idea what had happened, but I was tired and decided to go on home. When I got home, all the lights were out.  I went in and asked my wife why she went to bed so early. She said 'Early? It's 12:30!'.  Well I nearly fell over. I checked my watch and it said 10:45! I got really concerned that I had blacked out or something, but I have no history of this. Then I started thinking maybe I was abducted by aliens! Then I thought I must be nuts!  I have struggled with this incident for a couple of weeks. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I have strange dreams. I feel like I am losing my mind, So at the sueggestion of a friend, I decided to write you guys instead of just putting a bullet in my head. I cannot figure out what happened to those two hours.

My boyfriend and friend became excited after seeing a satellite sized object move across the sky and then stop and become intensely brighter, then appearing to ""pan"" with this same bright light across the area.  At this time the circular object was to north of us.  After panning across the sky it dimmed as if someone had switched off a light and then became very small again and headed to the west.  After 20 to 30 minutes, my friend began to flash his flashlight upward to the sky overhead, wher I noticed to the south the same object, but much lower, repeating the signal back.  I told the other two and they confirmed this.  The light was larger and fairly closer this time.  Afterwards, it returned to the sattelite size and shot again to the west.  After becoming upset, we loaded up the truck and went back to Lewistown.  My friend riding in the back of the truck noticed the object again as we were leaving. He said it repeated a similar action to those of before. Each time the light was very bright, and much brighter than any star or planet in the sky.  It even outshone Jupiter which was clearly visible in the sky.  There were no clouds that evening to block our view.  After the first sighting, we noticed that within five to ten minuts afterwards, two planes intersected over the spot, one from the east and one from the west, almost as if investigating the incident.  This is meerely speculation though. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the ""flare"" that the witness describes might have been the phenomenon caused by Iridium satellites.

S..  PD)) Cursor shaped objects over SW Michgan Over the past week in the skies over SW Michigan we have been subjected to heavy contrail spraying.  This was my reason for watching the sky.  With my binoculars and video camera ready I watched and taped as continuous streams of high flying aircraft left trail after trail in all directions.  There has been a constant sound of distant jet roars in the sky but with no visible craft and this over a fairly rual area. This day though the sound was much louder and followed shortly by the sound of a low level helicopter.  While trying to get the helicopter on my video camera I noticed strange movements from behind the haze of a contrail directly overhead. After several unsuccessful attempts to focus in on the object with the camera I opted for the binoculars.  Looking in the direction of the roars I saw something move across my field of vision so I tracked along with it and could not believe my eyes. My first impression was that it was a bird soaring in a thermal but then it began to move in the sky so fluidly and was then joined by two similar craft and then performed a beautiful aerial display and crossed huge expanses in the sky seemingly accelerating and decelerating at will and turning on a dime. I was just recently at the Chicago Air show and watched the Blue Angels do their stuff and it does'nt even come close to what I witnessed.  My entire world has been rocked by this experience and I cannot seem to let it go as nothing.  My original reason for watching the sky that day was to gather evidence of contails on tape and stumbled upon this with an open mind and have been completly convinced of the existance of something in our skies.  I have some very interesting video that has freaked many people out but without the ability to see it frame by frame I don't know what I have here.  Many good detectable objects in the sky moving in strange ways but due to distance and speed of the objects focus is less than perfect. Some appeared to be similar to a cursor shape and some disc shaped objects that reflect su! nlight a nd have stealth type obscurity with different positions.  Now that I have seen this and know where to look when you hear the sounds in the sky I have seen this 3 seperate times and I feel that my eyes deceive me.  It is as though the contrais are acting as shield to try to obscure what is happening above. I'm frightened and feel that this was of significance enough to report it here.,2000-12-02T00:00:00,41.8439,-86.2164

I must have been starring up into the sky do south looking for anything such as meteorites, constellations, I had been scanning the southern sky for about 20 minutes when I suddenly realised that there was a patch of the sky that was starless. At first I didnt recognise anything beyond that until I watched that area a few more seconds when this very large triangular ship materialized right in front of me. Its hard to explain but it was like-cloaked in such a way that at first you could stare right at it you wouldnt see it but when I focused on it I could easily see it. This craft was very close. Estimate size 200ft. I would estimate 60 yards away. Light eminated from it as if it had a low glow to it. No specific lights only the craft itself was lightly ablase. This led me to believe that its stealth quality was do to its ambient light equal to the light from the stars and street lights. Anyway I could make out the ships color which was a light brown or tan similar to the camoflage color used in the Military for desert combat. It was in a position gaining altitude at least a 45 degree angle and yaued left pitch where I had a good view of its top surface but not its bottom.

PD)) Ultra-slow totally silent low-flying huge dull black triangular body with evident 'cockpit.' We're on a flight path here for either Dayton or Cinci airports, so I often see aircraft of all sizes flying overhead, day and night. However, one evening [late summer or fall??] I saw lights over the trees that were somehow different, and then I realized something very large was blocking the night sky.  I kept listening for the sound of engines or jets, but there was total silence. The craft was huge, so large that it may have been higher than I first thought.  At the time, as it passed over [an angle of about 30 degrees to the left of right over my head] it seemed to be no more than a couple of hundred yards above treetop level. The eeriest part was the dead slow speed and total absense of any sound.  The second thing I realized was that it had ""headlights"" under where one would expect the cockpit to be [4 or 6?], but none of the FAA required 'navigation' lights on wingtips, and no strobe light. The color was generally a dull black, a bit lighter than the night sky so some shape details could be picked out and not just  the silloette.  It was a wide triangular shape, wider than our stealth bombers but not as wide as the old ""flying wings"" of the mid-40's.  It was relatively thick, with a 'cut away' portion in front where what appeared to be cockpit windows were above the 'headlights' previously mentioned. Nothing of note was seen on the bottom, no lights, no indentations, nothing but smooth dull black. Living close to Wright Patterson AFB I might expect to see experimental craft in the area, but not ultra-slow totally silent craft lacking the FAA required lighting.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,39.4543,-84.2258

I saw something (I guess I thought it was a plane at first)that looked a little odd.  I walked out the my back yard to get a better view.  I saw 3 craft.  They  were triangular in shape and were traveling fairly close together.  They had very little lighting, but the shapes were quite clear.  They seemed to be flying fairly low, but I couldn't begin to estimate their distance.  I watched for 2-3 minutes in awe.  They seemed to have some movement, but they didn't seem to really travel across the sky.  After a couple of minutes, I ran inside to get my husband so he could see, but when I finally got him out there, the crafts were gone.  I happened to mention this to my parents on the following day, even though I knew they would think I was probably crazy.  Instead, they told me that their best friend (now deceased) had witnessed the exact same thing two months prior to my sighting.  He lives about 70 miles north of me, so it not quite in the same vicinity.  Both sightings included the three craft that were dull, black with white lights on each corner of the triangle.  This is fairly vague information, but until I listened to Art Bell tonight, I hadn't really considered reporting what I had seen.

We tried to look at it through a telescopic lense on a camera, but got no better resolution than with unaided eyes.  An airplane flew low beneath it and seemed not to acknowledge it.

As it hover us, the object turn on its bright light and I could see clearly for about a mile. It was like daylight with no heat.I would also like to add that I did not hear an engine sound from this object and thats what scared me. I thought to myself that this object is not from earth. Also, I have kept this a secret for 35 years, because I don't know what it was until last summer I saw on the television a special onUFO sightings. It was an astronaut orbiting around the earth who saw it first coming towards earth and I was the second one to see it here on earth. I don't Know if there are more people saw this on earth.

When I was young, my sister and I saw a UFO.  It was during the day and would have been between 1960 and 1962.  I lean more toward 1962.  We were just sent outside so I think it was summer.  I believe that it was mid morning, say about 10am.  The object flew from south to north.  It was at an angle of about 10 degrees from vertical. We could not see the object, it was shiny.  Like it may have been a mirrored ball with a very bright light shining on it.  It left a vapor or smoke trail.  It took approximately 60 seconds to travel from horizon to horizon.  I do not remember it making any noise.  I did not see the object disappear over the northern horizon as I was yelling for my mother and ran inside to get her. When we came back out it was gone and only the vapor trail remained.  Shortly two delta winged jets appeared chasing the vapor/smoke trail of this object.  You could hear the noise of the jets.  Now I could tell they were delta winged but I could not read the lettering or the symbols on the aircraft.  I would hazard to guess perhaps F106's.  I am going to guess that they were at about ten thousand feet or higher.  We saw them crisscross the vapor trail.  I feel that they were traveling fast but not as fast as the object.  I could not tell if they were going overtop or under the vapor trail though for some reason I have a feeling that they were flying under it.  The location of this incident was in the Northern Catskills of New York.  The village of Tannersville is approximately 110 miles north of New York City and about 30 miles west of the Hudson River.  I have not talked about this for many years and I am just curious.  I watched the news that night.  At that time we got two channels out of Albany NY, and nothing was mentioned about a meteor or anything such.  I know that there had to be other people that saw this phenomena.  Now I have to say that I do not know what it was.  It could have been some sort of experimental aircraft.  I may have been a meteor though I feel it was flying entirely to ! slow and the jets would not have been chasing it. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I said to my colleague, ""Did you see that!"" But he was reading, and didn't notice it. The object from where I was, looked like a baseball that had been soaked in gasoline, and set on fire. It resemebled the sun on a bright day, but with flames all around it. I would say from where I saw it, it was the size of an old school kickball. (I initially thought it was kids, but the area there is sparsely populated.) Upon proceeding with the train through the cut in the rise, about 3/4 of a mile further on, I looked back to the Northwest. I noticed what looked like a very bright, orange ball on the ground.  This would have been the correct location from where it had gone up in the air , and came back down again.  There are no houses or other structures there, just open field. I looked several more times, and the object at that time looked like a bright campfire, about the size of a baseball, as at this point, I was about 2 to 3 miles from it, and moving away.

Peter Davenport asked me to relate what happened to me.  Yesterday, 6 Dec. 01, I had a dentist appt. and I broght to his attention a  foreign object on one of the xrays.  He was curious about it and mentioned it was not part of a tip of a dental tool because it was to large for that and it appeared to be almost a perfect rectangle shape with just a slight extrusion barely visable to the eye.  I told him a dentist in Florida brought it to my attention in the early 60's and he said it was quite unusual and should not be there.  It is well above the roots and slightly below the nose,  right under it and slight to the side of it.  I remember very well one night I was out meeting a lover on the proposed causeway being dredged up and I was on my way back home (I was married at the time) and knew I had to be back shortly after midnight because I had told my husband I was out with a girlfriend.  While driving home I saw, what appeared to be a big ball of light streak through the sky and I expected to hear a huge sound but didn't.  I wondered what in the heck it was.  I lost approx. 4 - 4 1/2 hours somewhere in time because I made it home just in time to shower and get ready for work.  I was terribly confused about it but for some reason I buried the memory of it as if it had not happened.  (Looking back on this now, 40 years later) it does seem rather strange that I would just dismiss it that easily.  I've always been a very curious person even as a child and my mom would get upset with me because I would sleep walk and sometimes end up on the front porch in the mornings.  I know I was very different from my siblings and still am for that matter, and have always and still to this day remain almost obsessed with a sense of urgency to get a message out to others about the 'meaning of life'; however, I am cautious now and just let others come to me.   Over the years I would awaken every a.m. around 3 am to a twinkle in the sky and I felt as though someone was communicating with me.  I have seen, in the past two y! ears, 2 UFO's and they were very shiny in appearance and were stationary in the sky for 45 minutes one time.  I was out in the yard sun bathing and it was as though I was mesmerized and after 45 minutes approx. I started timing the object's appearance, it did not zoom off anywhere, it just, in the blink of an eye, seem to blink out of the sky.  I live in Lakewood, CO now and this is where I saw the two objects within the past two years.   A friend of mine saw the UFO the day I was sun bathing.   I did a series of airbrush paintings and titled them the Pleadian Series, and gave them all away but one which I still have.  I don't know if this is of any help to your web site or to others who may have thought they were ""seeing things""  but if it helps that is good.     Thank you.

It was a typical night staring out my bedroom window with my dog at my side.  I was looking out my window facing what would be north and suddenly saw moving at an incrediable rate speed about 6 to 8 bright white oval shaped discs low on the horizon (it was dark outside at the time).  It was amazing and at first and did not comprehend what I had just seen.  I actually remembered rubbing my eyes afterwards in disbelief!  The astounding speed and quitness of these ufo's was just incredible (window was opened).  The distance of these objects appeared to be far off as the shapes were small but very distinct.  I sat there and tried to understand what it might have been in those 5 or so seconds (it felt longer).  It was a steady speed and I had the advantage of a broad playing field in the sky to see the trip.  I tell you, I have never ever seen anything like it.  I recently saw, two summers ago, a small meteorite enter the earth's atmosphere (orange with lots of afterburn behind it) and it couldn't compare to the speed of that event burned long ago into my mind!  I have never before made public this event to anyone as I thought it would be shund upon or laughed at.  But now after all these years, I can still paint an exact picture as I think about it everytime I hear or see ufo information.  And, to all of those thinking, it wasn't a meteor shower, as it was too deliberate of formation and moving parralel to the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

I am fifty years old now.  At the time of the sighting I was fourteen.  The year was 1966.  I don't remember the day but it was before Columbus Day.  It was dark out and a was getting chillier as the night progressed.  I was playing hide-and-seek with lots of other kids from the neighborhood.  There were twelve of us playing.  During a break in the play I lagged behind the others, who'd changed their minds about the present game but couldn't decide on another game.  I was on the Madison Street side of the Madison and Eagle crossroad, and had just gotten up from leaning on the fire hydrant.  I was different from my friends because I liked (and still do) to look at the sky.  This night was very clear.  The street lights weren't as bright as they are now, in 2002.  Besides, there were very large, old trees still standing. At this time of autumn almost half the leaves were gone.  The stars were very bright that night.  I almost forgot my friends as they were now past the middle of the block away from my position.  I was comparing the stars to the constellations I learned about in school and admiring their beauty, when one of them moved.  I thought it might be like other stars I'd seen move before.  Only, the other stars I saw before would stop after only a short movement.  This star didn't stop.  It moved north for seven to nine of my quick paces as I followed it, and then it arced up!  The arc was wide as the star continued north.  Then I had to stop.  The star was moving up, first in a curved line, then a diagonal line, then it rose straight up.  The only star that was moving, remained very bright until it quickly picked up increasing speed and disappeared into the cosmos, leaving an envy in me for wherever it was going and a dread, knowing that if I told any one about what I'd seen, the taunting and ridicule I'd get would probably mess with my already weak confidence.  It took me this long to say something.  This was my first sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))",,42.902226093175315,-78.85083919084595

A arch-weld like beam attached between the two objects, than the second objects popped back to the first object, and once again popped out.

The first object took of south, and the third object returned east, where it originally came from. This took approx.5-10 minutes. We biked to our friends home and got a binocular, and my friend said he could se the second object which was going west, dissapear behind a few clouds on a otherwise clear and bright night-sky. This took place within 20 min. After this experience, I biked home on a lonely country highway. Very frightened. At one point I could feel electricity in the air around me. I bet my hair was charged up on top of my head. I just took one short look at a bright star on the sky infront of me biking south, but was to scared to look again.

I was out in the back yard grilling a steak. I saw an orange white light basically shoot down and across the sky and stop dead a hundred or so feet away about 30 to 50 feet above the ground. Well, I have to tell you it was pretty damn startling to say the least. It just kinda hoverd there then would wobble a little and move sideways then hover again. The first thing I thought was did anyone else see this but near as I could tell my nieghbors were all indoors and I was the only one there since I live alone. I really didnt want to move but i thought I gotta get a picture of this. I ran inside and started to grab my polaroid but it was out of film so I had to settle for my digital instead. Its flash is broke but its all I had so I tried anyways. When I got back outside it had apparently move some more and was a bit lower to the ground but not much. I was kinda scared to get any closer so I just snapped a couple pictures right where I was. One of them came out ok I guess so thats the one Im sending. It looked as though it was domed or kinda like a half a donut with some  smaller dome with a point on top of it. It had what looked like smaller lights all the way around it. There wasnt any noise really but it seemed like I heard a very low hum but Im not sure if that was this thing or something from the traffic down the road or not. The lights on it would kinda alternate between yellowish and orange to white now and then. It seemed like it would always wobble before it moved also. It would wobble then shift to the side. When the lights on it were mostly white it looked like it was shiny on the outside like silver or a shiny grey color. I tried to watch it every second it was sitting there doing this stuff. I just couldnt figure out what in the world this thing was. I was going to try getting more pictures of it and started to reset the camera but Im telling you this thing all of a sudden shot straight up! I mean like a rocket except it was like one second it was sitting still and the next it was moving at top! speed o r something. Either the lights on it went out or it just dissapeard becuase I lost sight of it almost immediatly after it went up. Im not really sure what else to put here so I guess this it. Its taken me awhile to convince myself to send this to someone but since I would really like to know just what this was I guess I have no choice. I showed a few friends this pic but I havent really told them the whole story. They thought the pic was ""neat"" but were more interested in making jokes when I asked them what they thought it looked like to them. Maybe someone else saw the same thing? At least thats what I am hoping. Right now I am not even sure I want to get more involved in this than I am so if I could stay anaonymous for the time being that would be great.

Looking to the northwest, we saw a flourescent green light that then slowly faded and appeared in the northeast and slowly moved in a westerly direction.  It then moved east again.  It was an extremely bright light, and there was a haze around the brightest part of the light with streaks going through it.  There was NO definite shape.

My husband and myself have been watching an object hanging in the sky since 0550 today (10/05/00).  It is quite high in the sky, above the large clouds (cumulus and cumulocirrus) that we are experiencing this am.   The object is silent and bright white approximatelly 45 degrees above the horizon lying directly north.  (I checked with a compass.)  The top of the object appears to be round on the lower portion with a dark vee shape cut out on the top.  Both the easterly and westerly sides of the craft are brightly illuminated.  We thought this was strange because if it were a weather balloon or something of the sort we would expect the easterly pointed side to be brighter during the sunrise.   It is now 0730 and I just ran out with my bionaculars and took another look at this thing.  It must be massive to be so high in the sky and readily visible.   My husband is a pharmacist and I am a registered nurse.   I reported another sighting to your organization last winter, but is was nothing like this  sighting.   What makes me wonder if this is anything important is that it is remaining essentially stationary.  It is just something that I have not seen before and I spend a lot of time looking at the sky.   Also, before the sun came up we both thought we saw very tiny lights traveling away from the large object.  We do not know for certain, but we both saw the same thing.    It is now about 0750.  It's still up there.   I'll keep checking on it and let your service know if anything else happens.   Thanks for being there. ((NUFORC Note:  The report may describe a high altitude helium balloon.  They are often seen in NM and AZ.  We will attempt to run this one to ground.  PD))",2000-12-02T00:00:00,33.0017,-109.8825

Sky was absolutely clear with bright sunshine.   I glanced into the sky and observed a small metallic spherical or disk shaped object moving at what appeared to be fairly high speed to the west or southwest.  The object was at about 30-35 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be about the size of the head of a stick pin held out at arms length.  I observed it to move about an inch and 1/2 if my fingers are held out at arms length.  It also appeared to be rising slightly as it moved.  I blinked and it was gone.  I did not really observe it dissappearing, but I pulled over and scrutinized the sky for about two minutes and did not sight it again.  The object appeared to be a good distance away from me, but I cannot estimate the distance or altitude.   I'm a professional geologist employed by a local county and am trained in various remote sensing techniques.  My job requires that I be very  observant while in the outdoors and that I be able to estimate distances.   I've always believed that there is something to the UFO phenomenon and I've looked nearly all my life for one.  This is the first time that I've actually seen something that I could not otherwise explain.  I've been initially fooled (and excited) by aircraft and rubber and mylar balloons in the past, but I've always been able to identify them as objects of common occurence.  This was entirely different -- I even felt that something unusual was going on, though I can't put my finger on what that something was.   In any event, I'll be interested to see if anyone else observed the object and if, in fact, it was identified as an aircraft, balloon, etc.  Thanks",2000-12-02T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959
