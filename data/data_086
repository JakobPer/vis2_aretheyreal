I walked outside of the porch and after looking around the house and only finding a slow moving truck cruising down the street I headed back to the porch.  The sky is very clear tonight and the temperature is nice so I was stargazing. In the southwestern sky I saw three bright white lights very brightly flickering.  Immediately I called for my mother and she quickly joined me in viewing these lights.  They were arranged in a triangular pattern with one of the lights pointed in the direction of north and the two others being relatively close together in the rear.   I then noticed that they were moving very quickly in straight lines.  The movement was far to fast to be an aircraft as it was immediate.  It appeared that the lights were defining the edge line of the craft.  It was completely silent and moved at the speed of a typical jet.  It was traveling south*west to north. As it moved another light appeared and the size of the craft was plain to distinguish from the rest of the sky.  However, the object was exactly the same color as the night sky. It was like a perfect reflection; it was as if it was invisible.  As I watched it move and watched the lights move back and worth I could see that it appeared like a gian! t rectangular panel.  The size of the craft was massive. It was only possible to know that the lights belonged to only one craft because as it moved it blotted out stars in the area between the lights.  It continued north (towards Wright Patterson AFB) and as it went further from my location it was possible to hear the sound of its engine.  It was the sound of a jet engine.  This was comforting, as it allowed me to have no fear that this craft was anything otherworldly. My mother and I are medical professionals.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

Given the number of aircraft in the skies normally, we were wary to assume it was a UFO as we have had false alarms before.  However, this orb was at least three times brighter than even airliner headlamps, and did not dim, twinkle, or flash despite changing directions several times.  We could not specify exactly where it was over, but it seemed to be near the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station or the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base/Airfield.  The orb seemed to float around lazily, then began to slowly make its way north.  We lost sight of it behind a house for approximately 2-3 seconds.  Once we realized it had vanished, I pulled to the side of the road to get out and look for it.  It was no where to be seen despite being able to see air traffic against the hills 12 miles to the north and ten miles south to the coast.  A couple of seconds later a blackhawk helicopter flew by overhead speeding in the direction of the light not in the direction of the airfield.

I constantly look up in the sky as an amateur weather buff and lover of astronomy.  So, as usual, I looked up and noticed a plane leaving a trail and then I looked back down, but did a very quick double-take because I subconsciously noticed something odd. I saw two spherical objects in the sky, approximately 800 feet or so off the ground, flying side-by-side, heading north by northeast.  As I walked along, I kept looking up and following them.  They were over Kappy's Liquors on route 16 by the time I got to the 16/28 intersection. The light changed and I needed to move, so I did and when I looked up again, they were gone. I observed them a good 10 minutes and was in shock that no one else looked up as they saw me walking along and staring into the sky.  I've seen UFOs before, but this is the first time I've EVER spotted them in daylight, much less at noon. I've fought with myself over whether or not to report this with UFOCenter, but right now... I just feel I need to. Description: -- Round, could not determine approximate size. -- They were ~800 feet off the ground, about 100 feet apart, staggered formation. -- They were a dull white color, but seemed to be sort of metallic. -- They were moving steadily, but not very quickly. Maybe 30mph or so as I was observing. I apologize for not having any pictures or video.  I was just in so much awe that I was seeing them at that particular time of day, that I was more concerned with seeing if anyone else had noticed them.

We arrived around 6. We sat down at the beach and drank coffee and tea and were talking about boats as we were looking around.  I was the first to notice what we saw. I could see the Seattle center area and space needle and that above it there were many white or off white things flying around. The things flew irregularly, they took sharp turns, while gaining altitude. Sometimes they would briefly remain still, but I couldn't tell if it was because they were moving towards/away from me, or remaining in place.  The objects would disappear frequently too, every 10-25 seconds.  Couldn't tell if it was because of clouds. My girlfriend could also see all of this.  First thing my roommate said to me when I woke up came to mind. ""Its windy today"" he said so I thought and told my girlfriend, ""They must be birds caught in the wind.""  At the beach many birds were flying.  I could see some birds more on our side of the water, flying.  The birds were just about the same size as the more distant objects, all the way across the water by the science center/key arena area, in relation to my location at alkai.  Not sure if there were any events going on, I tried to find some online with my phone but found nothing. All the time about 15 minutes pass, after my eyes begin to become tired I decide to stop looking for only about a minute as my girlfriend and I continued to talk.

I noticed in the corner of my eye what at first I thought was a reflection on the power lines beside the road.  When I looked over I could see that these were not reflections, but lights in the sky.  There were four lights of equal brightness in a row, seeming to keep pace with us driving at about 100 km/h (65 mph.)  At one point the third and fourth objects were above and below each other for a time but otherwise they stayed in a row. I was driving, and my wife was taking the pictures with my phone.  Unfortunately we did not get a picture of object 3 and 4 above and below each other. The light seemed to be reflected by the objects, it did not appear that they were producing the light themselves.  The brightness did seem to stay constant as the sun was going down however.  It looked almost like a small contrail in front and behind each object, and there was no colour or strobing/flashing visible, it looked like a very bright, white light as if sunlight reflected off a mirror. They slowly gained distance on us but it never seemed that they were actually moving.  They travelled in a westerly direction toward the City of Winnipeg where we live.  At one point an airplane could be seen travelling North to South, and it was clearly different from the objects, it did not produce the bright reflection and the contrail was visible. Our daughter also saw the objects, and said they looked like shooting stars.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,49.891260040733194,-97.15285022403258

I was trying to text my teenager and everytime I would text the message it would start deleting itself.  I heard this unusual silence outside the front propped open door of my office and then my 9 year old came in loudly saying ""MOMMY I THINK I SAW AN ALIEN"" I was startled and spooked because I thought there must be a dog in the yard that looked scary or maybe even a bear.  She was so scared that she ran over to me and the baby followed her and she was crying ""MOMMY IM AFRAID!""  She put her back to me so I could protect her.  I put my phone down yelled for my husband in the shop who didn't hear me and walked out the front door to see what she may have seen.  She said, ""NO MOMMY, IT WAS IN THE SKY""  Then my 2 year old said loudly ""MOMMY THAT AIRPLANE WAS SCARY.""  I started to ask her what it was that she saw. She said that it was a diamond.  But it changed shape like it was being squished. The surface was like boiling water and sometimes one side would be like diamonds and another would be black.  Then it disappeared and reappeared in the same area in the sky all the while racing around between 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock.  She would not stop telling me everyday for 2 weeks that she couldn't get it out of her head and when we would go to the shop she would be very afraid.  My 3rd child was laughing at her because she said she was sitting in the car and she saw the 9 yr old witness's face scowl in fear while looking up.  However the older 3rd child in the car did not see it.  Only the 9 year old and the 2 yr old.  Weird thing is it was near the Fairbanks Airport so I can't imagine why a ufo would be hanging out around there.

On July 22nd, 2011 I was sitting outside at around 10:45 p.m., watching the North Eastern sky.  I recall seeing a white glow come over the horizon, and which I had believed it was a satellite, only until I saw a second orb following, going in a circular type motion, and then a din third appeared behind it.  The craft did NOT make a single noise.  This occurred over a 105 second period and then disappeared in the south eastern sky.  I was dumbfounded at what i had seen.   Over the next year I researched what I had saw and found nothing,! and began to watch the skys even more.  A year later, October 2012, the EXACT same, in every detail, phenomena occurred, three orbs flying in a circular type motion.  At this point I was with two other people who also saw it, and I just had to take a picture, which came out clear as day exactly what I saw. And recently, on August 12, 2013, I saw this again, but this time, when i tried to take a video of it, the lights flew off 2x fast and I was shocked because I have never seen anything go so fast in my life.

On October 16, 2013, I was driving north on Hwy 77 between Winkelman, AZ and Globe, AZ at approximately 9:30 p.m.  I was about 5 miles north of Winkelman when I saw a single light/object drop from the sky and immediately illuminate another 6 lights to form 7 lights in an arc shape.  The object had a center blue light with a pink outer ring and 3 yellow/orange lights on each side of the blue center light.  The blue center light was at the top with three orange lights dropping lower to each side to form an arc shape.  Each individual light had an oval shape resembling the shape of an eye turned vertically.  The lights only stayed on for approximately 3-4 seconds, then went out.  The same light sequence then repeated to the right, and then the left of the original light(s) location. Following this middle, right, left sequence of light appearances, a group of six objects all lit up, each with the same pattern of 7 lights in an arc shape.  The 6 objects seemed to randomly oscillate up and down for about 3-4 seconds, and then disappeared.  About a minute passed, and the 6 objects all lit up again while still oscillating in an up and down motion.  About 15 seconds later, the objects all flew away to the east and over the horizon at extremely high speed, faster than any object/aircraft I have ever seen. I drove about another mile up a hill, and as I came to the crest in the road I was overlooking a valley.  Hovering in the valley ahead of me were the 6 lighted objects at what seemed to be at my eye level (same altitude as the crest of the road, but out in the valley ahead).  The 6 objects seemed to be only a few hundred yards away or maybe about a quarter-mile.  I saw the objects for about 5-6 seconds, and then they all flew away in various directions at the same extremely high speed. At this point the check engine light came on in my vehicle.  A few seconds later, my wife called and when I answered all I heard is a garbled/bubbling sound.  My wife hears the same sound on her end of the phone (I found out later).  This was an unusual sound I have never before heard on a phone.  It was different than the normal static/broken audio of weak cell signal, and I also had full cell service during this time. The above events all happened in about a 5 minute time frame while I was driving along the road at approximately 60 mph. About 30 seconds after the phone call, 2 of the objects reappeared to the east about a mile away and I could see them for the next 15-20 minutes as I drove.  The objects disappeared for the last time when I was about 4 miles outside of Globe, AZ.  I did not see them again after arriving in Globe. The objects each looked to be approximately 50 yards in size, both horizontally and vertically.  However, a thing that was odd about the objects was that all I saw were the lights.  I was close enough to clearly see the lights, but there did not appear to be any structure attached to the lights.  Each “object” seemed to be a group of 7 lights in an arc shape, but had no visible structure between the lights to keep them together.

You can see the halo around the moon, but then there is a separate halo that the object is in, but is not centered in this second halo.  This image was caught on a deer cam, on ranch property (approx. 1000 acres) out in Sisterdale/Sister Creek, Texas, during the date range of approximately October 19-20, 2013 in the night time hours during the full, or nearly full moon.   When the disc was removed from the camera on 10/28/2013, this image was included in the files.  Images immediately preceeding this image were images of a buck staring into the camera, and then using his antlers to nudge the camera, which resulted in it being redirected up towards the full moon.  This camera takes low resolution photographs at approximately 20 second intervals, and this is the only image of its kind on the disc.   It is not known if any aircraft was in the area at this time, if there is something on the lens, or any other details.  I am waiting for additional information at this time.  I've spent hours looking at images and reading details of other reported sightings on and around this date/timeframe, but can't seem to find any images that appear even minutely similar, nor do I find images attached to descriptions that sound as if they are similar to this image.   There is a very thin/sheer drape that keeps the camera somewhat hidden from the deer and other wild life, but a buck managed to move it causing it to face into a different direction.  If anyone else saw this, I would love to know.  Since we weren't present when this image was captured, it's simply an unexplainable multi-colored object that appears up and to the left of the moon.  We don't know how long the object appeared, but logically it would be less than 20 seconds if there is no other image immediately following this o! ne.  Perplexed.

I was traveling eastward when I observed 3 rather large rose colored or strawberry colored lights in a tight formation with the center light slightly higher.

I than observed a 4th object in the sky, this object appeared to be closer and larger moving very slowly in a southeasterly direction.  I followed down the road until I came to the east river preventing me going any further.  It was large I thought it may have been a helicopter but I've never seen a helicopter lit in such a manner.   The lights were not spotlights I'm sure of that.  The entire object was emitting the color.  I did not observe any navigational lights.  I'm guessing the object had to be 1/8 to  1/4 mile in front of me.  I shut the truck off rolled my window down and was expecting to hear the sound of a helicopter but it was silent.

Neither objects had blinking lights or any other familiar characteristics of known aircraft.   I immediately pulled off to the right side of the road as we were entering a rural village not more than 30-40 seconds after initially spotting the objects.   I pointed upwards to traffic behind me and oncoming traffic to which a few blinked their lights in acknowledgement.  We observed the objects for approximately 1 to 2 minutes and while doing so did not hear any discernible noise at all coming from the objects.  The objects did not look to be of a very high altitude although a good distance across the horizon from us.  There was a jet with its blinking lights noticeably higher in altitude above the two objects.  After observing the object for approximately 2 minutes, the trailing object moved in very slowly in an easterly direction and seemed to diminish in brightness and intensity until it vanished.   Approx. 30-40 seconds later, the lead object repeated the same actions as the trailing object prior.  This sighting has very, very much sparked our interest into what they may have been, but at the same time has left us with an uneasy and unsettling feeling.

I am a U.S. Army Active Duty Veteran and have been around many forms of military and commercial aircraft and I have never seen anything the likes of these two objects.

The time was approximately 10:00pm to 10:30pm. The object was moving south.  We were camping at Lion Head camp ground on the north end of Priest Lake in Coolin, Idaho.  When we spotted the object.   At the time, we were gazing into the sky watching shooting stars, meteorites, and other marvels of the sky.  When I noticed the bright object, I had my wife look at it because I knew there was something unusual about it.  In fact, I said, ""There...look...a UFO.""   The object was travelling at a higher speed than any plane I've seen before and there was  no blinking lights or any other alternative explanation.  It was simply an unidentified flying object.  While my wife still doubted what she was looking at, the object shot a beam of light, perhaps a laser, the width of the object, all the way across the sky, miles in length, to a point we could not see due to trees blocking our view.  The beam of light lasted for approximately a second or two.  I said, ""Whoa! Did you see that?!?""  And my wife did!  The object shot the beam of light the same direction two more times, but to two different locations across the sky.   We continued to watch the object move across the sky hoping to see more unexplainable displays from the object, but more campers showed up with their car shining its headlights near our direction, which distracted us from watching the object much longer. That same night, I witnessed various objects moving across the sky that would sometimes disappear while watching.  Some may say that I saw satellites.  However, the objects moved way too fast to be satellites.  I've seen satellites move across the sky, and these objects appeared to move 10 times as fast. I've seen UFO's before, but for some reason I feel this sense of apprehension to talk about what I've witnessed.  I even felt apprehensive about reporting what my wife and I saw.

I looked outside and walked to the outside of the house and could not see anyone on the roof.  Once again I questioned the footsteps on the roof.

I went into house to change and my friend was watching this object for a dozen or so seconds before I looked up from Orangeville looking southward; as if above the village of Alton in County of Caledon.  The night was starry and clear and a chill as well, but I quickly got excited as what was before our eyes made no sense.  It was alone and the size and sorta shape of a double-doubledecker bus kinda but up at a height a small plane could make it up to.   The UFO as, I'm comfy to call it, was flickering entirely in a random light as if it were on fire and wasn't fast but did alternate speeds a tad.   There was a plane in the higher sky from ENE to WSW and when we saw/said that, the ""ufo/object"" is in its line and then it went in a direct and intentional southward position and moved, nut not warp or nothing; BUT THE LIGHT WENT OUT FAST AND IT WAS OVER.   Never was it bright or obviously a normal object in the sky; like a plane, chopper, balloon or meteor or an object I'll likely ever see again and never thought I would.   IT'S NEAT TO HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE AND HOPE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS, THROUGH LIKE THE TORONTO PEARSON AIRPORT RADAR MAYBE, I DUNNO. I hope there is ways this can be possibly corroborated.

It seemed like an active flame (as in a fireplace) contained in some sort of transparent round, or cylindrical container.  The fire was extremely bright orange in color.  My first thought was that it was some sort of roman candle, but there was no sound at all, and the object kept moving across, not down.  There was no tail.

On 06/07/13 @ ~9:30pm, I was driving southbound on I-35 from 75th St. towards 87th St. and admiring the extremely decorated/illuminated 87th St. overpass.  I then noticed high in the sky just to the left of the overpass (just south of HEI) a cluster of red illuminated orbs (aka ""Fireballs"")... Instantly thinking it was either part of the color-lighted overpass (off the side), or more likely several cell towers with red lights, or helicopters, or balloons, etc...  So, in order to rule-out the bridge first, I cruised underneath it and clearly passed it.  And then I immediately realized it wasn't even cell towers because they always have a flashing red light up top and always red lights inline vertically and with a visible tower.  There were no towers in sight and I even double-checked the next day. These red orbs were slowly cruising/scanning SW in a nonuniform cluster-spread... Not too low, and not too high.  There was a grouping of ~5 or 6 in the leading cluster, and then three more following in a curved boomerang shape, and one loner following way behind (the runt of the herd??).  So, I next had to try and analyze/rule-out military helicopters (~10 red orbs) because they too move slowly/horizontally across the sky at quite an altitude.  So I quickly pulled the car off to the side of the highway on to the shoulder, with flashers on and windows down for the duration.  I didn't hear one helicopter, let alone a handful... And zero tails/wings/props, or port/starboard/taillights.  I also easily ruled-out ten horizontal asteroids or ten flares because they weren't losing altitude in a downward motion with fiery trails, and clusters of balloons don't fly at night in airspace cluttered with air traffic (I hope).  In one big visible sky zone, I could easily compare them to all the white stars in the background as well as one little red/green lighted plane in the distant background (up above and to the left), and another chem-stream plane on the other side, above and to the right.  Instead of trying to photograph or get poor quality footage on my old phone, I was far too mesmerized/fascinated and wasn't about to take my eyes off them and possibly miss something (like bolting at mach-20!).  Glad i didn't too... They slowly but surely, one by one, faded/dissipated/vanished~ Not shutoff like a light.  Almost like traveling up/outward at a high rate of speed, but they didn't get any smaller.  And btw- Pilots never shutoff their red/green/white port/starboard/taillights, unless monitoring/engaging.  Especially a cluster of ten, one at a time.  After well absorbing the big picture for several minutes, I stared at a couple individual ones and could barley see a slight twinkle on the outer circumference rim of the sphere~ not sharp edges ( o ), but fuzzy ( * )... Like all the ""Fireball"" descriptions on the internet (I googled ""red orbs in the sky"" and fortunately found this NUFORC website).  After noticing them slowly vanishing before my eyes (rats!), I stared at the last unit pulling up the rear until it faded away too... And I saw it fade to a dark circular silhouette (cloaked) while continuing to cruise at the same speed and in the same direction (camouflaged).  And I've seen how the military is capable/practicing this tactic now with tanks, etc... And speaking of~ Right before they all vanished, I also barely noticed for a split second an air force jet at the same ~altitude (without lights) heading them all off at an angle in the same direction (SW towards Olathe)... As if stealthily monitor! ing/escorting them from a distance with lights off.  The military is well known for practicing this safe maneuver every chance they get... After all, they are in ""their"" airspace with an air traffic control nightmare near airports.  I was truly hoping a policeman would pull up behind me... Or some other witnesses nearby.  I did call four educated friends and explained to them in detail... I explained what I witnessed and that it was all undeniably unidentified to me, and asked ""what do you all think they were??""  Since then, I've drawn a color picture and explained details to a dozen other educated credible people... All unexplained and baffled.  Later that night, I called the Overland Park police dispatch on Santa Fe... Hoping for other witness callers.  I didn't get mocked (while connected), but it's a known fact that they're trained to discreetly deny any/all info as not to create panic.  They all have nothing to gain and everything to lose... Especially astronauts, pilots and air traffic control.  After about a decade of researching ufology with countless credible documentaries containing footage/testimonies of ALL levels these days... For the past few years I have watched the night skies whenever possible... Hoping... Someday... For just a glimpse.  That entire image/experience is permanently burned into my memory.  I personally didn't even need a poor quality photo to thoroughly convince me... And that also spares me of all the redundant mockery/ridiculing accusations of photo-shopped hoaxes.  I don't need any of it.  I finally got what I wanted and needed... Peace of mind.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,38.92109229843562,-94.69181576413959

The sighting I am about to speak of was very brief, lasting only 5 minutes.  Ever since 2009 there has been an increased military air presence with planes flying overhead all day and night.  The air traffic has become somewhat normal so I wasn't shocked to go outside and see a plane.  However because the UFO's have tapered off since 2009 I was rather surprised to see a small bright light (not a plane, no running lights and considerably smaller) tailing the plane at several paces.  What was even more interesting was seeing the very large ball of light trailing the plane and the smaller light at an even greater distance.  This light had no running lights and was very much like the UFO's I and others had seen throughout 2009.  I was unable to gauge the shape or size of these ships due to how high both UFO's and the military craft were flying.  I would also like to add that on 6/03/13 another family member watched a large stationary light (she thought it was a star) suddenly start moving quite rapidly upwards until it disappeared.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,,

As I was driving home late last night after picking up family in Willard, I thought I saw lightening on the left side of 13 South between the Cook Rd. exit and Straub Rd.  I then noticed it was flashing at a consistent rate of about one second.  My mother, 2 children of 11 years, and I saw this most of the way towards the I 71 exchange. I decided to take 71 north to figure out what was going on since I had never seen anything like this before.  Going north we could see that it was stationary, in the air and not one of the airplane towers, which had red lights and were lower down. At the 39 exit, I turned around and headed south.  We were better able to see the light source. It was wide, round and not very tall in comparison to its width.  The lights went around in a counter-clockwise manner, so that it looked to be flashing.

It was silent and was below the cloud deck, but the size was extremely large.  Giant in fact.  I've never seen something so large and distinct in our sky ever.  I am truly touched, enough to write this note tonight.   Each light was equidistant from each other and faded out quickly.  One light went out and then the other 2 went out at the same time and not a Chinese lantern.  I've seen them before as well.

As I was leaving Taco Bell on my bike I noticed an orange object hovering in the sky to the south at about an angle of 45 degrees to me.  It seemed fairly close, and I would guess within a mile.  It was hovering over the hills just south of Pacific Coast Highway..  It was unusual I thought so I stopped riding my bike and began to watch it.  It stayed stationary for approximately a minute when it began to move slowly upwards into the sky which was slightly cloudy.  It got fainter as it got higher into the clouds until it was about to disappear.  During this rise I noticed a what I thought at the time was a plane flying low into view in the same general area off to the right.  As it got closer I realized it had the same coloration of the previous object.  An orange perhaps slightly red color.  it proce! eded to the same spot in the sky that the previous object had hovered and stayed there for perhaps a minute or so.  There were no blinking lights on either of these objects, just an orange color the shape of which I couldn't make out.  (I didn't have any glasses on which would have helped me to see them more clearly)  This second object too began to rise higher into the sky and about this time 2 more object flew into view to the lower right and proceed to the same spot in which the first two had hovered, and they too hovered in that spot for several minutes, both slowly moving while hovering.  These eventually disappeared also.  And I proceeded the remaining half mile to my apartments down the street.  I looked back before heading in, and saw another orange light of the same type in the same general area and watched it for about 5 minutes.  A person walked by as I was watching and asked me if I saw it too, and I said I did. I can only speculate on what I saw, but it is very intriguing and I hope to get more information on this sighting.  I at first thought it could be a hot air balloon, but then when it moved upwards into the clouds and others flew into the area I ruled this out. The other normal explanation I have thought of is that perhaps they were a group of people flying helicopters in a cyclic pattern for some unknown reason (Perhaps to simulate a UFO event).  I didn't see any red or green blinking lights in the objects, and I am not sure if I saw any white lights.  It was predominantly orange.  I do not remember hearing any noise coming from that direction, though I am not sure if I would have been close enough or not to hear any if they were helicopters.   When I got back to the hot tub at the apartment right after the sightings, I asked if any one else had seen them an one man in the hot tub said he had seen an orange object in the sky about 10 minutes earlier. The whole sighting ! laster perhaps 15 minutes.  There were at least 3 objects involved in this sighting and as many as 5.  I saw 3 at one time after the first disappeared, and the fifth 5 minutes later.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

I reported seeing 8 tiny points of light over Newcastle, Australia.  It was (11:10 am ).  I watch them with my mouth open for ten minutes.  The main thought on my mind at that time was, ""What in the bloody hell are they?""  I was in my work are in security on my own.  After oprox 5 minutes I thought I had to tell someone I can trust & whiteness what I was seeing.  So I rang my wife.  I described their location in the sky but to my frustration she couldn't  see anything.  I just put it down to luck that I happened to look up at that time and that place in the sky when I did.  They were hard to see unless  pointed out to you.  I was am in my late 50's, but my long distance site is very good.  I don't wear glasses and I removed my sun glasses to rule out reflections.  I told my close family what I saw & thats all.  To this day I can still remember every detail.  I have no doubt these things exist.  After watching many documentaries since the 1970s with scepticism I have read a great deal of books on the subject since then.  I don't believe all I read and I understand others not believing me.  I watched these tiny dots for ten minutes.  Seeing is believing that is the only way I could believe wether they exist or not.  But what I find almost as amazing as the siting it self is that there was no news about it in the media.  I just can't beleave that the RAAF only about 20 kilometres north of Newcastle said nothing reported nothing not a word.  Did they know they were there or not?  And parks observatory to our southwest.  Not a word.  I still feel I have what I saw bottled up onside and would a simple explanation why...  I may never see anything like this again and in the middle of the day?  But I hope I do.  Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM))",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

My wife and I were on the BYU Campus in between the Tanner and Hinckley buildings walking back to our car at the conclusion of the BYU Ballroom Concert in the Marriott Center.  While we were walking, my wife and I had been discussing the apparent line of the ecliptic on the celestial sphere as defined by the moon and Jupiter.  While thus engaged, I spotted a phenomenon 10 degrees north of and about the same altitude (on the celestial sphere) as the moon and pointing to it, asked my wife if she saw it too.  She answered in the affirmative.  We observed five rather subdued lights that appeared to be approaching us in a tight formation (angular separation of the formation was estimated at approximately 3-5 degrees) which in approximately 5 seconds moved across our line of sight to the north of us, then quickly disappeared off to the northeast, the whole sighting lasting no longer than 20 seconds.  The five lights maintained their tight formation throughout our observation though they changed their position relative to one another a couple of times while we observed them.  The lights were not at any time occulted by any terrestrial objects.  The individual lights appeared to be chevron shaped—definitely not point sources nor spheres.  The actual (not observational) altitude of the lights was impossible to estimate but our instincts suggested they were fairly close to the ground. 	We heard nothing. 	This is my first sighting of what some might describe as a UFO  •	Do I believe in UFOs?  I am skeptical but open-minded.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,40.27123156626506,-111.62400433734939

While sitting out on our back deck, looking for the perseid meteor shower, my fiance and I witnessed something very strange.  I am an amateur astronomer in my mid 40's.  I have been looking at meteor showers and planets through several telescopes since I was a young girl growing up in the farming hillsides of northern england with my father.  My fiance also - has been an amateur astronomer growing up in Montana.  We are both fairly expert at seeing meteors and know what we are looking at in the night sky on most clear evenings.   We had seen several good meteors over a period of about 30 minutes prior to the strange light sighting.  We were focused on the area around Perseus and Cassiopiea in the night sky.  Looking directly west from where Cassiopeia is located at this time in our section of the hemisphere, and directly above my home - we saw a sudden and brilliant light.  It was not a meteor. It didn't move from one point to another, there was no tailing off or t! rail.  It was almost like a camera flash. It started off looking like a regular star in the night sky and the suddenly - flashed really bright - like a camera flash going off - on a much larger scale.   We both exclaimed as we saw it.  My fiance explaimed ""whoa did you see that"" as I pointed directly up at it to show him. It flashed in a bright purple color.  The strangest thing was however that as soon as the flash ended, the object which had previously been there - like a star - disappeared.  It got stranger however when just a few seconds after disappearing, it flashed again but this time like an explosion - with this time a green light - and then also disappeared completely.  We watch the night sky almost every night.  The skies around the San Francisco bay area are crowded with planes.  I know all the flight paths having lived here in this location for 18 years.  And I know the many different colors and flashing signals emitted by planes.  This was not one of them - bei! ng just literally a finger length from the area we were focuse! d on for the meteors, this was a star or so it seemed.  I have not really ever paid attention to UFO stuff. But after telling my father about this strange light - he directed me to look at an online video of a UFO over Jerusalem which had descended to the temple hovered, and then flashed and took off. I wasn't going to write in to report this because I didn't think this was at all a showy or really eventful sighting and I have been thinking of all of the things it could have been.  A military plane perhaps, or a meteor coming coincidentally right towards us on an angle where we couldn't see the tail -- but after seeing the Jerusalem video just now - the flash that that object emitted was almost exactly like the one I saw over my house.  However the light disappeared after it flashed over my house - it didn't speed up into the sky as the one in the Jerusalem video did. I am a professional with a twenty year career in business as is my fiance.  We are not and have never been really people! who believe in things we cannot prove with facts and science.  Yet we both were really taken aback by what we saw and - having had years of studying the night sky - we have never seen anything like that and didn't feel like the flash disappearing then reappearing and the colors it emitted - were a natural occurrence.  It wasnt a meteor. It wasnt a plane.  I am not sure if this was a UFO but it defies explanation in my mind as to what could have behaved like that.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,37.925684000000004,-122.513884

My wife was sitting facing northwest and made a comment about something moving fast in the sky.   I turned to look, and what we first saw was a bright white light approaching from northwest to southeast.  As it got closer it appeared to get brighter.  I did not observe any flashing red or green lights, or white strobes, no engine or rotor noise, so I thought maybe a low orbit satellite.    As it flew more directly overhead, the light seemed to fade and then disappear, still traveling southeast.  As I was looking at that object, my wife and neighbor pointed out another object behind it traveling the same height and direction.  What made the second object different is, as it approached, one light turned to two.   Then three in a triangle shape.  Then, 4 lights, till it was overhead and you could see 6 lights arranged in ! a hexagon shape.  At this point I had grown into more disbelief because once again, no engine noise, no rotor sound, no strobes or red and green lights.  We have planes and helicopters that fly over regularly, and all of those aircraft are unmistakably what they appear.   These two objects were traveling too fast for that.   I noticed my neighbors across the street were sitting in their garage with a group of 4 or 5 other people and I had to point this out to them.  We all were watching as the six lights kept traveling together in a hexagon formation and eventually faded out as it continued traveling southeast.   Most airplanes as they pass over their strobes and lights are still visible for several miles.  These objects were not like that.  Probably more directed in front and straight down or maybe they just faded off as it went overhead and on.  I have never seen lights arranged in a hexagon formation on any aircraft I have ever seen and I used to work on aircraft years ago ! so I am familiar with how aircraft lighting is.  Whatever it w! as, it w as not civilian or commercial.  I will point out my neighbor police officer is also ex military and he was as perplexed as I was.

This occurrence happened just outside of Davenport, Wa. on the evening of Tuesday, October 22, 2013, at approximately 11:30 pm.   My husband could not sleep so he opened the blinds on the window to look at the stars outside.  After a few moments he noticed a round orange glowing object heading towards him from the northeast.  He was not sure of the speed but the object was getting bigger as it moved towards his location.  He decided to take a picture with his camera phone but each time he put the phone up he could not find it in his viewfinder.  He snapped one picture and a short video to see if he could bring them up later. He then decided to go outside to try and get a better picture.  He got dressed and went outside, the orange glowing light was now solid white blinking lights and the direction the object had been traveling had changed.  He thought maybe it had been an aircraft since it seemed to come from the direction of the Air Force base, but he still could not pick it up on his camera.  He took another video to see if anything would show up later.  The last picture he took was of the moon just to make sure the camera was working. We spoke about the object briefly the next day but did not look at the pictures or videos until Sunday, October 27, 2013.  The first picture was of course black and we could not find anything on it.  Then we looked at the short video, again there was no picture but the audio was what shocked us.  The audio was a short clip of my husband and son-in-law's conversation from previously in the evening, a conversation they had at about 7:30 pm. and no possible way for the phone to record their conversation.  The second video had the correct audio but we couldn't see anything captured in the video and the fourth picture of the moon you could clearly see the moon. The other item that shocked us about these images and videos were the times.  The first picture and video with the wrong audio that were taken inside, showed they were taken and 7:29 and 7:31 pm.  They would have been taken closer to 11:30 pm.  The second video and picture of the moon, which were taken outside showed a time of 11:33 and 11:35 pm which would have been taken closer to the correct time.  It was showing a four hour time difference between what was taken inside and what was taken outside. My husband says he does not remember any missing time for himself but at the time thought it was odd that the object had changed so fast from the few minutes it took him from seeing the initial object to going outside to get a better view.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,47.67499999999999,-118.19779999999999

I told him since we were in the middle of nowhere and it was so dark there was a good chance we might see a ufo so keep an eye out.   I had been staring at different stars for almost an hour when for whatever reason I fixated on what I believed was Venus because it was the brightest thing in the sky since dusk.  After I had been staring at it for about 5-10 minutes I saw a smaller light that seemed to come out of it or at least out from in front of it.  I blinked and squinted to make sure it wasn't just my eyes playing tricks on me and it was still there.  I blinked a few more times and before I could tell my friend to look it had completely disappeared.   Around that time my friend that was driving kept telling me he was seeing a pulsing white light over the horizon in the opposite direction.  I looked a few times when I he said he saw it but I missed it every t! ime.

I happen to be enjoying the light show from the storm when all sudden I saw something within a cloud that just had lite up with electrical activity. Inside this large cloud was a “HUGE” long rectangle object.   The top and bottom were very long and flat with the sides being very short in height.  There were 4 corners and on each corner where lights of yellowish/orange shining off the tips.  Inside the rectangle there seemed to be a soft whitish/silver glow throughout.  All the edges of the rectangle where very defined. I happen to see this as the cloud it was hiding in had lite up.  When the cloud went dark and lite up again the object was gone.  I had my son drive back down the same spot where I saw it off in the distance.  Unfortunately, the object was gone or at least had moved out of sight.  I would have to say that it was the largest thing I had ever seen in the sky.  It was “HUGE and AMAZING.”    I feel very fortunate to witness such an object.

Three of these sightings were the last three nights in a row.  I’m pretty certain I will see it again tomorrow.  I have managed to already show three other people, much to their surprise and to my sanity.  Everyone is completely stunned when it actually happens as I say it will. Here is the way it seems to go:  Just after Sunset, and before moon rise (it happens to be a waning full moon the last 3 nights) I can look North–Northwest and 7 to 10 burning orange fireball like lights will appear in the sky as if turning on and reaching maximum brightness.   Tonight I noticed it seemed to start with one ball that, very rapidly, split into the whole group.  From there it seems to change a bit from encounter to encounter. Some of the objects will remain completely horizontally stationary and usually begin a sequential pattern of blinking once or twice, from left to right.  Some of the other objects might line up exactly vertical and also fade in and out sequentially.  It’s not really a blink, but more like they start to “Slip,” as they pulse.  While this is happening, the stragglers seem to move around more randomly and either fade out alone or merge together before fading out.  This whole first “act” may last 10 – 15 seconds and then vanish. After 20 seconds to a few minutes, they reappear almost due north and seem to repeat the first act again.  I’m guessing there is roughly 10-20 miles in between locations, but I can’t get a good fix on distance and size of the objects. From there, it becomes more random with the dance, but always switching between the two spots. I haven’t been able to determine a pattern, if any, yet.  It seems to happen 3-4 more times in each location as the large group of separate fireballs. After that, the numbers seem to diminish and the time between appearances grows longer until just one “ball” appears every 10 min or so with a very short duration of just a second or so. The show seems to end with a crescendo of just one fireball burning very, very brightly for one second and then the event seems to end as quietly as it all started; just as the moon begins to rise over the hill behind me about 45 minutes from the start. I have been able to watch this show for the last 3 nights with such regularity, that I have risked looking totally nuts and invited friends to come witness this strangeness.  So far they have not let me down.  Everyone who has seen this is stunned and cannot believe what they are seeing with their own eyes.  It defies any explanation so far.  Everyone leaves stating, “Wow, people will think I’m nuts if I try to explain this!”  Luckily, I am 3 for 3 in the “not nuts,” department with those I have dragged out to witness this.  I will continue to invite others nightly, until it ceases to happen.  I figure that the more people I can show this too, the faster we can come up with a rational explanation of whatever this is. Yes, I have tried to take pictures, as have my friends, but for the last few nights we all just have our phones and they just don’t do it justice.  Plus it all is so exciting that as we fumble to his the record button and get it into view, you really don’t want to take your own eyes off of the scene as you struggle to make sense of it all.  It's quite spectacular and, unfortunately, it all happens pretty rapidly. Tomorrow morning I am headed to Phoenix to buy 2 good quality video cameras and tripods with the hope that I will get at least one more good night of this amazing show to record in a couple different ways.  I’m hoping that night vision might reveal some shape other than just orange orbs / “fireballs.”  I live in a very rural area, but I am 60 miles from Luke Air force base.  My sensible head says that this must be some sort of secretive military project being tested in a rather remote location.  That said, it is still directly overhead, and quite blatant to those looking up in a rather populated area.  If this testing were shifted 3 miles to the west, it would all happen in a desolate 60 square mile area, separated by mountains and populated with maybe 100 inhabitants.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,33.9105,-112.879925

On August 10, 2013, my wife and I were at the Shambhalah music festival near Salmo, BC. That fact alone discredits this story because it’s a very, very loud and bright festival with a lot of really drugged and crazy people doing crazy things, but I know what I saw and so does my wife, and so did the other four people who witnessed it. During the evening we went and found a dark corner of the festival to watch the meteor shower.  I am an avid sky watcher with a lifelong interest in astronomy and have spent most of my night life watching the sky through telescopes, binoculars and with my bare eyes, enjoying Auroras and having fun spotting satellites and aircraft and identifying  planets.   It was a pretty clear evening and the entire milky way appeared clearly and we were spotting meteorites at a rate of one or two every couple of minutes and had seen a half dozen satellites as well.  There was a light fog beginning to move in but the stars will still clear, it just made the stage lighting visible.   At approximately 11:45PM we simultaneously observed a light appear from the west, as though it had “just appeared” but neither of us were looking directly at that segment of the sky, rather noticed it in our peripherals. It was a steady, slightly off-white light which did not flicker, and had it been moving on a ballistic path I would have identified it as another satellite however it made a sudden turn to the north and decelerated.  We were stunned and both jumped up to our feet.   There were lighting effects from the music stages we had been watching, lasers and powerful stage lights, but those were clearly lighting effects and this was clearly an object.   Over the course of about 30 seconds it appeared to get bigger and brighter, as if coming closer.  It appeared to be about 1/10th the apparent size of the moon in the sky.  It tracked north during this time, slightly adjusting its path and varying in speed, eventually almost completely stopping.  It was definitely round from where we were but we could not distinguish any features.   There were no other lights.  The glow was soft and it did not cast a beam in any direction, as if it were above the fog. After a minute or two, I noticed a group of four people walking down the dark path towards where we’d been laying  and I ran over and interrupted them – “Do you want to see a UFO?”  They said “of course” and I pointed at it in the sky.  One of them used a flashlight to point at it and I said yes.  All four simultaneously said “oh… WHOA WHAT!?”  I was glad to have other witnesses who were as shocked as I was.  We all stood there for about another minute talking about its motion and trying to debunk it. Without a doubt in my mind, and the others agreed it was not a helicopter – its light, if it was a search light, would have been cast towards the ground, but did not cause the fog to glow at all, was omnidirectional and without glare and there were no red or green lights attached to it, but it was big enough that we could see the shape. The guy in the group with the flashlight told us that he had a buddy who could “call them down” using some kind of high powered light he has.  “They call it ‘Buzzing The Tower’” he told me.  “They come down to investigate.  He’s done it several times, and I’ve seen him do it too.  That’s pretty cool too man.”  We all laughed. Shortly after that someone said, “hey it’s leaving!” and in the matter of a few seconds it got smaller and fainter in a northwest direction.  Someone said “it looks like it flew off into space” and we all nodded and mumbled in disbelief. Someone else said “Did we just see that?  You saw that right?  That round light swerved around and hovered over Shambhalah and then blasted off into space?”   We all laughed nervously, shaken by the visitation.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,49.2,-117.28330000000001

On April 13th at as close as I can determine at 9:45 pm traveling on George Bush Fwy in the Garland city limits near the intersection of Garland Ave. I saw a line of lights traveling in a semi formation. There were 5 to 6 objects traveling together in a random line at different distances from each other. They were not traveling in a close organized formation but were all traveling together in the same direction coming across in front of my westerly driving direction moving in a line on a North by Northwesterly direction. I pulled the car over and attempted to get my Galaxy S3 out and trained on them to begin videoing. Unfortunately the last setting on my camera had the camera facing me. By the time I adjusted the camera to face away and set to video the objects they had turned a more Westerly direction and moving away from me. The caught my attention as unusual because they appeared to be orange and flickering as a constant light source. They did not have the red and white normal aircraft lights blinking at a consistent way. The light they emitted gave the appearance of a flickering flame. This is barely distinguishable in the video I did get but it is discernible if you know that's what I saw. Unfortunately also my lack of use of the video application on my phone also affected what I got, because it was on when I thought was off, and off when I thought it was on. I did not successfully capture any video on the first line of objects as they moved away. I had been sail racing the whole day so I was well aware the wind was still about 8 to 10 miles per hour coming from the South maybe slightly Southeasterly. The objects seemed to by flying similar to the height and speed of helicopters. So they were very low seeming for aircraft but higher than a typical traffic or police copter, and fairly fast similar to the speed of a fast moving helicopter such as care flight as it would pass over. As I watched the line move away over the city of Plano I turned to get in the car and amazingly another line of objects of the speed, height and constant orange flickering nature were heading directly in my direction. Again there were 5 to 6 or maybe more in the group. They were traveling Southwesterly. This is when I struggled to get my video going again and thought it was on when it was off and off when it was on. As one passed directly over me the underside of one of the objects appeared oval as if the light was refracted as a lens would do. The distinct sound of helicopters was not present as they are obviously very loud and discernible but again this is exactly the height and speed it seemed fast moving high flying helicopters would be moving. It is possible that they could have been larger and higher and just gave the feeling this is the altitude they were flying but I'm pretty certain of my perception. It did seem there was engine noise above the traffic noise but sub! tle and not so obvious. The video I did capture was by accident and you can see the orange flickering effect somewhat out of focus and a couple times focus in and appear white and turn two distinct dots. Visually they never appeared white to me but the video does. The other interesting thing about the colors is that two distinct separate flying objects change color in synchronization. Therefore the color change could be attributed to the low quality camera phone video..

So I took out my cell phone and started taking a series of pictures.

We were driving east on Hammond Road coming back from dinner in Traverse City, and if I remember correctly we were between 3 and 4 mile road, when my companion noticed a bright orange object (not a star!) out of the side passenger window.  She called my attention to it, so I turned right onto the nearest road, put the car in park and got out for a better look.  What we both observed was an unusually bright orange “object” (about the size of a star and approx. 2-3 times as bright as the planet Saturn has recently been), that seemed to be slowly drifting in a northerly direction towards Cherry Capital Airport.  However there were none of the blinking navigation lights that one would expect to see on an airplane, and as hard as I listened I could detect no motor noise, either jet, prop, or horizontally rotating.  The object was in full view for perhaps a minute or two in its northerly drift, suddenly it se! emed to flash red and then just disappear.  I looked for some kind of structure or fuselage where the “light” had been, but saw nothing.  Since neither one of us could figure out what this thing was we couldn’t estimate the height but we guessed maybe a mile up- at least it didn’t appear to be up higher in the sky, and except for the lack of noise, and navigation lights, it could have been an aircraft on approach to the airport had I only given it a passing glance.

I made still frames at various points in the video as explained below, and will release the video at the proper time.  The single object appears to be cylinder shaped, but also looks to be tumbling/or shape changing, but I think tumbling.  When looking at the stills and video, it must be remembered that it was shot at 32X slower than normal.  Due to the high frame rate, it will appear to be going at normal speed.  I refer to it as a “perceptual” speed, that is what the mind perceives it when viewing. Very important to remember that the video is 32 times SLOWER than normal. It is the small brown dot/cylinder in the sky moving through the lightning event. No other aircraft were visible during storm. It was a strong lightning storm, and aircraft avoid those.  There are trees in the lower foreground. Due to High speed capture, they move 32 slower than normal.  I'll give you a little info on the stills. They are numbered by frame.. The 1st frame is 11:02 (11 sec, 2 frames).. In the video it drops from the top of screen and makes a turn into the lightning, passes THRU lightning, (12:21 is inside plasma, you can see the faint dot) and exits to the left (17:09)  These photos you are getting are compressed for web transfer. The originals and video are better quality and more clear.  The video was shot in 960 frames a second, slow motion. Normal Video speed is 30 frames a second. I was shooting a lightning storm facing due north to see what lightning looked like in super slow motion. The Lightning event I captured took ½ second to happen. When the camera shot it, it captured at 960 frames a second, there by, the playback of the lightning is 16 seconds. When I played back the video, I saw the object. The object appears at the top of the screen dropping down and making a curve turn of approx. 85 degrees and heads to the west. I was shooting the video over the top of some trees, at about a 45-degree angle, to at least a mile in the sky.  The object takes 7 seconds to travel across the screen. If the video was in real time (perceptual speed) it would be going as fast or faster than a jumbo jet (380-600 mph) and is a mile away (due to the 5 second delay of thunder 1000 ft. sec x 5 = 1mile approx.). If perceptual speed is @ 500 mph, then real time is 16,000 mph. The camera shoots at 960 frames = 32 x slower. If the object was only 100 mph perceptual, then it would be 3200 mph. I observe passenger jets daily (airport close by) and they travel slower then this object if the object was traveling the same perceptual. (if I didn't shoot in slow mo. and the object moved the same in vid as if you were standing and observing)  The lightning event occurred in 1/2 sec real time, slowed down to 32 times slower, 16 seconds to play out the entire lightning event. the object takes @ 7 seconds to travel screen. That means the object traveled the distance in .223 of a second. That is fast. You would never ever see this with your naked eye. I have not calculated the distance traveled by the object yet, and am working on that.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,,

The craft had no navigation lights and had one bright light on one side of the craft that seemed to be intelligently rotating. What really gave us chills was when I flashed my bright lights on my car, the object seemed to rotate and the light was brighter than ever as if it had rotated and focused in our direction.  The craft had stopped Its forward motion when it seemed to become interested in our flashing lights.  We lost sight as we were driving westwards due to trees and turned around to see if we could observe the object longer.   We pulled into a coldesac and could still see the object travelling slowly north westwards and the bright light would randomly dim and become bright again as if it were rotating.   The object seemed directly linked with me flashing my bright lights and brake lights which I did several times.  Each time the object would turn around and focus the beam north eastwards torward our direction.  At one time an airplane passed a long ways away behind the object and as the airplane passed the object seemed to turn and track the airplane and then returned the light torwards our direction when I flashed my brights again.  At this point we decided to return home and attempt to view the craft with binoculars in my backyard. Once we made it to the backyard the object had moved further westwards and the light was not as easily visible.  At this point I pulled out a flashlight and flashed it torwards the craft which immediately turned and focused in our direction.  This was apparent due to being able to see the light intelligently rotate torwards us.  We watched for several minutes, about twenty minutes after we first observed it on the road, and suddenly it seemed to all but disappear.  I began to signal the craft by flashing my light three times.  We were shocked to see the light appeafr again and flashed on and off three separate times.  I then flashed the craft twice after it had blacked out again and the craft resoonded with two flashes.  And again I flashed the craft three times and the craft responded with three flashes and went dark. I was observing the craft through binoculars and could see a distinct round shape and bright light with a small red light within the craft.  The craft was no longer m! oving only hovering in place. I was so shocked I called my father to come observe it and by the time he got out there we thought it was all but gone.

The sound we heard from within our house while watching TV was not US military. The sound startled us because of the low persistent humming.

I was walking from my car to my first floor apartment.  While walking, tired from work and my thoughts strictly on getting home to catch the end of game 1 of the World Series, something else caught my attention.  While looking southwest (referenced by the interstate 40 West running parallel to the direction I was facing), I noticed a red light with a very unusual flashing pattern through the trees outlining the apartment complex.  As the light cleared the outline of the trees, ascending upwards and northeast towards where I was standing, the maneuvering alerted my attention.  The object was bouncing/sliding from left to right, while sometimes descending only to ascend again. I immediately called my girlfriend, who lives with me, to come outside and to bring her phone. I started recording a video on my iPhone 5 but still viewing the object visually, not through my phone.  The object was still continuing its unusual flight pattern while ascending and flying closer to my location, improving the visual of the object.  As my girlfriend was walking towards me, I notice the light starting to blur as to dissipate into the low-lying cloud cover.  As my girlfriend tries to locate the object, the objects light disappears, not fade like it would if flying into a cloud.  I immediately get frustrated due to my girlfriend's inability to locate the object, leaving me to be the only witness. After sleeping on the incident and replaying the video repeatedly on my phone, there are things that stand out to me personally that might validate the UFO title.   First, after my girlfriend could not locate the object and I get frustrated while still recording the video on my phone, she states she sees a plane.  I remember viewing the plane immediately and the object was in surprisingly close distance to the plane from the point the object vanished.   Second, while I'm a believer in the paranormal and I do watch the skies for anything unusual, I had already worked a lot of hours at work and my only focus was getting back into my apartment to finish watching the game.  My mind consciously wasn't looking for anything out of the ordinary.  The light just happened to catch my eye. Lastly, after the object vanished, I stood in the same spot for an additional 6-8 minutes looking for the object to clear out the other side of the cloud.  Judging from the angle and line of direction the ob! ject was traveling, it should have appeared out the end of the cloud if it was a plane. This never happened.  As I walked inside and discussed it with my girlfriend, it became clear that what I described was not ordinary.  The fact that a plane flew by at a relatively low level was a good reference point for me to also conclude this object wasn't any plane I've seen.   Living only an exit away from the Nashville airport, I've seen hundreds of planes at almost every hour of the day.  I've seen just about every light pattern that flashes from commercial planes and with my previous four year enlistment in the Air Force in Air Transportation, I have seen just about everything you can think when it comes to descriptions of planes and flight paths.  This doesn't fit anything I have ever encountered or seen.  I am hoping that someone else witnessed this so I have some kind of relevance to this event instead of a lonely encounter.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,36.1782,-86.6098

I immediately went over with my cameras and we talked about the sighting while still watching the sky and within 10 minutes another one appeared coming from the North on the horizon. (Note – we both witnessed these)  In total there were 7 passes overhead with the first one having two objects next to each other but all subsequent sightings had one object at a time all coming from the north circling down over our location then turning east. We captured 6 of those passes on video as best we could but had multiple trees in the way and they were constantly moving in a large circular pattern.  We spotted then while they were over the area of approximately over Mount Tom on the East slope in the valley. The followed the mountainside southerly toward us from the Holyoke Range south over the Chicopee River and then in two cases along the river east and out of sight. It might even be fair to say they followed the Connecticut River southward to the Chicopee River and turned East around that point. The rivers are only a rough guide, they did not stay exactly on the rivers but rather it appeared there paths were roughly along those lines. The average altitude is estimated to be 800 to1200 Feet overhead.  They maintained the same colors (shifting) and circular shape the entire time. The colors went from white to red and orange with the otter edge staying red while the center was what changed to white and orange and even into very dark red. We agreed the all looked like flares but were of course too large to be a flare and no flare could move in this type of controlled pattern time and time again. I did hit one with a laser and it appeared to stop momentarily but kept going.  We noticed after the first and second sightings they had a time interval, each sighting was about to 15 minutes in-between – roughly, we didn’t time them but it was approximate and the intervals were about equal. The loops they made kept moving southerly progressively moving coming nearer and nearer to us.

As it got closer and I could see it better it looked almost like a chain of 4-6 plastic bags with a candle inside.  (Our brains were trying to comprehend what we were seeing more than remembering exactly what it looked like.  Unfortunately no one thought to grab a camera until it had gotten too far away)  It moved slowly and horizontally and we could actually see energy lines that it was riding on.  They stayed in line but would bobble back and forth sometimes.  The edges and body of the orb seemed to be made out of plasma or something and I observed a soft yellow glow while others saw more red.  It passed within about 20 feet of us just a dozen feet above the roof.  Since then I've talked to 2 friends who also saw this from the tower district.

By nature I am a star- and sky-gazer and by profession  I am a physicist (specialty: plasma physics). 	That day me and my two young daughters (8 and 7.5 years old), we came to the beach near Crowne Plaza Hotel.  I was laying on my back and watching the dissipation of a small part of a cloud.  The sky was partly clouded. The girls were sitting near me and playing in the sand.  I was gazing intensively in the sky above me.  Then, all of sudden a very small bright spot of white color appeared almost above me in the blue sky near the cloud I was watching.  The sun was in the western part of the sky at an elevation of approx. 55 degrees from the horizon.  I could not tell the size of the object, but it was not just a point and was definitely above the clouds, in my estimation 2-3 km high. It started moving (or drifting) eastwards immediately after appearing. It was definitely not an airplane, because normally airplanes flying here westwards from Larnaca airport are seen clear from this spot and trajectory of their take-off is at approx. 30 degrees to the trajectory of these unidentified objects.  Then I thought that it may be a satellite(s), but I quickly dismissed the thought because it was a sunny day, and, surely, I could not see satellite in the sky lit blue by the bright sunrays. Nor could it be some weather-control balloon(s).  And that's because the phenomenon appeared suddenly under a scrupulous eye.  And, especially, because after one minute of observation… another one, same-shape object suddenly appeared out of nowhere at the same level about 10 degrees to the right (south) of the first one.  And now they both were floating eastwards at the same speed. 	Upon sighting of the first object I immediately called my daughters to watch it. They both saw it and were thrilled, since we were watching for a view day before the reports of UFO-sightings in the Internet. There were other people on the beach, but it seemed that nobody else saw the objects, because they were very small and moving among clouds. I think that this is sometimes the ""policy"" of the UFOs: to appear on a cloudy sky to use clouds as cover.  	 Naturally, I reached for my android Samsung mobile phone and tried to film the event, but the attempt failed, because my wife took the memory stick (with her photos) out of the device. We all were so disappointed. 	For a minute the two objects moved together at the same speed. Then the first one disappeared and the second one continued the flight alone for another 2-3 minutes till it disappeared behind a distant cloud in the east at approx. 50 degrees above the horizon. It seemed to me as if they were (or are) monitoring the area… in shifts. 	I had a good feelings (if one forgets about the filming fiasco) and was very happy to have seen the phenomenon during daytime, because I had 3 other UFO-sightings before and all of them were at night. 	Then I remembered what I understood to be my night-sighting of UFO in this area about 8-9 years ago. That was a star moving very fast eastwards in the exactly the same trajectory. The reason why I thought it was an UFO was the speed, for the object covered half of the night-sky in approx. 15 seconds, while satellites move at least 3 times slower.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,,

I did however notice what appear to be some type of military aircraft above the object flying steady with the lights (500+/- feet).

My spouse and I were staying at a small resort in Cedarville, CA on October 23 and 24th 2013.  The morning of the 24th, two of the staff members at separate times told me the past few nights some strange lights were seen in the sky and we should come out that evening to watch.  They told us the lights usually showed up around 7pm or later, after the sun was down, so we made sure that we were ready to watch by that time that evening. At 7pm, my spouse and I went out into the fields around the resort to where it was dark and we could see the sky and stars clearly.  It was a very clear night.  We waited a while watching the stars, and sure enough around 7:15 we noticed a red light appear suddenly, far out to the North.  The red light was almost a pinpoint, but still quite bright, and it hovered low over the valley.  We were very perplexed at how erratically it moved, unlike anything you would normally see moving in the sky.  This red light would hover stationary, move right and left, rise and fall, and abruptly change speed, direction, or come to a stop for a few moments before moving again.  It stayed well below the usual altitude of regular aircraft while we watched it, but eventually after about 5-10 minutes, it steadily rose until we lost sight of it. One of the staff members who had told me about the lights earlier that day met up with us in the field right as the red light was gone.   He had said it usually started with the red light and soon after orange orbs would appear in the sky.  So we waited with him a few more minutes and sure enough, off to the Northeast over Nevada (we were very close to the border), these brilliant glowing orange lights began appearing out of nowhere, fairly low in the sky, just over the mountains.  At first they looked like some kind of flare, but there was something different about their behavior.   They left no trails, made no noise, did not ascend or descend, and there were no other aircraft or vehicles in their area. These glowing orbs would randomly appear, mostly one at a time, but sometimes a few at a time, and would just hang there stationary for anywhere from a few seconds to 10 or 20 seconds.  They would also divide and multiply horizontally into twos and threes, each one shooting out of the one before, stopping at equal distance from each other and hanging there some more before suddenly disappearing.  These orbs would appear and multiply randomly, in the same general area, but at different spots each time.  There were also breaks between each sighting that lasted for several minutes each.  We saw about 25 lights total before they stopped appearing.  By 8pm they had pretty much disappeared altogether. The man who had been watching these lights the nights before said he saw up to 50-80 in one night, and the past few nights he had also heard a very low-frequency roar coming over the mountains from NV when the orbs appeared.  He said it would start low, crescendo over a few minutes then stop abruptly.  He heard it a few times, but we didn’t hear anything that night. There is absolutely nothing in the area in which we saw these lights, aside from Cedarville and empty desert and mountains on the NV/CA border.  No towns, no airports, no bases, no people, period.  What we saw was very unusual, the kind of event that makes your hair stand on end because of how wrong it was.  Either we saw some kind of extraterrestrial/supernatural occurrence, or our military has some very advanced technology they were testing because it was literally beyond comprehension!",2013-11-11T00:00:00,,

Altitude approximately 250 feet. Distance approximately 1/2 mile. Continued in a western path for five minutes until lights disappeared into low cloud ceiling. Witnesses 3.

If these objects were indeed chinese lanterns then someone had connected them with some sort of string, rope, or cordage, thus allowing a somewhat uniform appearance and movement.

I walked over to my door to close it as it was slightly open letting a draft into the house.  But, when I got to the doorway I decided to step out onto my balcony real quick and when I looked over the town and toward the pier, I noticed about 3 to 5 glowing orange orbs floating in the sky.  I immediately sensed something peculiar about the objects and quickly grabbed my cell phone to record the event for confirmation that I was actually seeing floating things in the sky. The objects floated very slowly, two of them moved down toward the pier and downtown area and one slowly rose into the sky.  They were small orange orbs, and moving very smooth and effortlessly.  No Sound.  As I watched the objects, I tried to talk about what was happening in the camera as the footage was very low light and actually quite terrible.  However, it does show the glowing orange orbs flickering in and out.  As I watched the one floating higher into the sky, the two lower orbs seemed to just disappear. Then, moments later, the one in the upper sky disappeared just as it was about to float over my head at about 300 feet above me. I almost felt like it was looking at me or knew I was there somehow...like the feeling you get when someone is staring at you from behind and when you turn around, there is someone looking right at you. It had that same feeling of connection.  After the incident I saw two neighbors and showed them the cell phone footage I captured. They said it looked like Chinese lanterns that float with a flame and heat and are made of paper...which made sense as I'd seen these items before but didn't think about them at the time I recognized the objects...so I wrote off the whole experience.  A couple weeks later (today), I was listening to a rerun of last nights Coast to Coast am program and the publisher of this website (ufocenter.com) said people around the country were spotting Chinese Candle like UFOs!!! I re-examined my footage on my cell phone and it looks like what he was explaining!! So here I am, writing to you about a similar experience that happened in one of California's smallest beach towns, approx 2,000 people....

We decided to go down to the water's edge for a better look, by the time we got there, they blinked out.  Then as we were leaving, they blinked on again.   They've been doing that for 4 hours.  Sometimes it's one rack,  then a second one, fainter,  for 15 minutes, then the faint one fades out, followed by the second more brilliant one, also fades out.  It was a mostly clear sky with some ribbon clouds at the horizon, but clear overhead.  Crescent moon was bright, as was I think Venus, or some star just off to the right of the moon.   One time the lights blinked out,  then when they blinked on they were in a different spot.  They don't move, it's like they are hovering stationary.  When they are illuminated, they appear to be pulsing, not a steady light.  Seems mostly a white light, very bright.  We thought at first it was a helicopter search team or something,  but helicopters would be moving not hangin stationary for 4 hours. My husband filmed it for a few minutes before it blinked out.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,44.5168,-80.0164

My eyes catching sight of something out the window were drawn to a greenish-blue colored light. I said to my boys , ""do you see that?"" As they responded, "" see what?"", the greenish- blue light sped away. It was only seconds, two to four seconds that it was amidst my gaze. The light was a large roundish shape. It was smaller than the moon but much larger than a star. From my position if I could estimate the size it appeared, it seemed relative to that of a large children's' bouncy ball.  Seemingly upward of 10 feet above my 30 -40 foot tree line is where the light appeared. As my eyes faced north, it sped away going north. Lying down in the position and facing North, (the direction in which I saw the greenish-blue colored light), the distance from where I caught sight of it and where I lost sight of it, was seemingly only six inches apart.  As it sped away the round shape seemed more like a pear or tear drop shape. It was almost like lightning speed, how it disappeared so quickly from view. Interestingly enough, I saw something similar a week or two ago. The light was also greenish- blue but it was traveling East. That time I was lying in my bed watching television. The time was somewhere between 9:00 - 11:30 p.m. E.S.T.  Just as before, my eyes caught site of a light in the sky.  Its distance covered the expanse of my backyard traveling east before disappearing from site.

It was probably between 2230 and 2300, and the skies were clear. I had my arms on top of the car and was thinking about what I needed to bring inside for the night when I noticed a bright white light reflecting off of my arms, the car, my friend’s back and the bushes in a 10-20 foot circle around the car.  The light was flashing, like a very rapid strobe light, and seemed to be directly above us. As I looked up, the flashing had stopped.  I saw a very bright light moving from our position to the east at a very high rate of speed. In just a second or two it seemed to be over the city of Minneapolis.  It stopped very suddenly, stayed in place for a second or two, then sped off at what appeared to be a right angle, now heading south at a high rate of speed toward the Minnesota-Iowa border.  The light disappeared as I tracked it southward. I had yelled to my friend to look up.  By the time she looked up, the light had disappeared, though later she said she did see a very bright flash of light in her peripheral vision as she was getting some things out of the car. Five to ten seconds after the first light disappeared, we both saw two other lights that moved more like meteors.  One was bright orange and appeared to arc from east to west.  After this one faded out, I looked slightly to the north and spotted a second whiter light arcing from west to east. Both of these lights left trails. Comparing our observations, it was clear that these second lights impressed both of us as being consistent with meteors.  The first light – with its brilliance, its burst of strobe-like flashing, lack of a trail, and its extreme speed, deceleration and sharp change of direction – was definitely something of a different nature.

I checked back a few days ago and was excited to see another person reported the same object, at the same time, in the same area!  What a relief!  I'm not paranoid after all!  This is actually the second time I have seen a UFO. I have been checking out your website and the reports within.  I don't know if it is of any use to you, but I saw a UFO when I was a senior in high school..way back when; and would have reported it then, if I knew of this forum.  I had a hard time getting people to believe what I had seen when it happened.  No one had ever heard of triangular UFO's and glowing fireballs at the time.  However, I see they are common now. Let me start off by giving a little disclaimer.  I have always been fascinated by the idea of UFO's and aliens, or actually anything paranormal.  I loved that show the X-Files and wrote a research paper on alien abduction when I was in eighth grade, but that is pretty much the extent of my involvement in anything like this.  I'm not fanatical, I just think it is interesting and entertaining. I think this report may be of help to you, because there are not many reports like mine from this time period, and as you will see; I witnessed a glowing ball and a craft.  Also, I have not been able to find a report where the shape of the object reported matches mine.  There probably is one, but I don't have time to research UFO's all day,  I'm a busy mom!   This happened in the early spring of 1998.  I just remember it was starting to warm up outside, but the fields hadn't been planted yet.  I was driving home from Toledo with two of my girlfriends.   We were headed west on Airport hwy. between Springfield township and Swanton, we were approximately one mile past Toledo Express Airport when I saw a bright light, similar to that of a helicopter out of the corner of my left eye (south).  The light shone bright and then faded into the size of a radio tower light.  I asked my friends if they, too, had seen it, and indeed, they had.  Apparently, I was the only one impressed enough to mention it.   Just then it lit up brightly and faded again.  At this point we all knew it was something strange, and decided to check it out. As we began to follow this light, it began to get stranger and stranger.  It was now changing shape continuously, and also began to change color.  It was changing from large to small and white to red and orange.  The object did not appear to be moving at all, but it was hard to tell because we were in a moving vehicle.  We turned left onto a country road, not sure witch one, because many of them intersect Airport Hwy, and also because I can't remember.  I believe it was somewhere between Swanton and Delta.  This would be around ten miles from where we originally saw the light.  I think this because the town we ended up outside of when we eventually stopped and pulled over would be located between these two towns further south on a map. We kept following this light after we turned.  It would almost disappear at times and then suddenly reappear even brighter than before.  The light got brighter as we got closer to it, until finally we were right beside it, about thirty miles from where we first saw it.  We were now out in the country and farm land of Henry county, about five miles north of Liberty Center, OH. Once we came within a mile of the light, it was no longer a light but a solid form aircraft.  We could only see it from the bottom and it was an equilateral triangle(as I remember, but it could have been isosceles), with a bright, round, white light in each corner.  I pulled off the to the side of the road on the left side.  We were out in the middle of the country and no other cars were out there. I got out of my car and could now see the entire craft.  It was hovering motionless and silent over the field.  Is was hard to tell how far away or up in the sky it was because it was so large, and it was nighttime. I could no longer see the bottom of it just the side.  The side was an acute triangle.  Again, the bottom and top were not visible at the same time.  The craft was covered in thousands of tiny white lights, all in lines, with one single red light right at the top point of the triangle.  In my mind I thought this must be where whoever is flying this thing is at.  If I had to guesstimate I would say it was the size of five or six football fields, just based on the number of lights on it, and maybe a mile up in the sky. My friends were totally freaked out and would not get out of the car, so they never got to see the craft like I did.  I had a camera in my backpack, and asked my friend to hand it to me, but she couldn't find it.   My friends were begging me to get in the car.  They were completely terrified, and thought they were going to get abducted by aliens (we were teenagers).I thought this has to be some sort of experimental aircraft.  There is an Airforce Reserve base in Toledo.  I had never heard of anything like this craft before, and the closest thing I had ever seen to compare it to was a Stealth. I got back in the car at my friends urging, and we drove off.  The craft now began to appear as a light again.  We turned around to head home, down another country road.  The light was now shining more orange and more larger than ever.  We saw a truck with some young guys pulled over on the side of the road and thought they must have seen it too.  We stopped to ask them, but they were just sitting there, drinking beer.  We pointed the light out to them and they didn't seem too impressed, but mentioned that they lived out here and had seen some strange looking lights on different occasions. We got back in the car and headed home again.  We were headed west again, and now it appeared as if the light was following us.  My friends got really scared and started to scare me.  My adrenaline was pumping and I was driving about ninety miles an hour because my friends were screaming and claiming the light was trying to get us.  I don't know how much of that is true, I didn't look back at this point because I was driving really fast and had to pay attention to the road. When we arrived in our town, Archbold about twenty miles from where the craft was we could still see the light, but it was only showing white, and I could tell it hadn't moved position at all.  We went to the gas station, to fuel up, and I could see the light from there.  At this point I was able to find my camera, and took a few pictures.  Unfortunately when they were developed they were all black and blank.  We saw some kids out playing basketball, it was now about 11:00 at night.  We asked them if they had seen anything , but they just thought we were pranking them. When we arrived at my friend's house, I decided to contact the authorities. This was before everyone had cell phones.  I called the Henry county sheriff's office,(Archbold is in Fulton County), and told the dispatcher what we had seen, that it was still out there, that this isn't a prank, and that everyone is really scared.  She told me that she was going to send a deputy to check it out, that nobody had reported anything that night, but not to be embarrassed because they do get a calls like this every so often. I got home around midnight and woke my mom up to tell her what had happened.  She thought I was just being crazy and told me to go to bed.  I also remember getting in a lot of trouble from my dad for driving the car so fast.  This was on a Friday or Saturday, and I remember drawing a picture of what I had seen and showing it to the Biology and Chemistry teachers at my school on Monday. I don't remember what they said, I just remember they didn't really seem to care at all.  My friends and I never really talked too much about the events of that night afterwards.  Why, I don't know, but they always made me feel isolated about it, because I wasn't afraid to talk about it, and I think they were.  We had a falling out a few years after high school (over a guy, of course), and I haven't seen them since. As the years passed, I began to think none of this had really even happened, and I had just let my imagination get the best of me.  Then,in 2005 or 2006, one night when I was watching random TV, there was a rerun on one of the cable channels about UFOs seen in  the Midwest in 2000 that were triangular shaped.  I'm sure you know what I am talking about.  It was totally legit and hosted by Peter Jennings,  or one of those ""real"" news anchor guys.  I felt so validated! I don't know what this object was, but it made such an impact on my mind I still remember all these details 15 years later!  I suppose it could be of this earth, the only thing that makes no sense is how it can emit such a bright, glowing, ball of light around it.  How can it be a light from far away, but a  dark craft up close?  I have read reports of either/or but not both together. I would be grateful if NUFORC could direct me to some. My personal theory, and trust me I'm no scientist, although I did have to take some Chemistry and Biology for nursing school, is that the glowing ball of light is actually some sort of exhaust from the craft that contains highly reflective particles, and it is reflecting it's own light from all those tiny lights on the ship. Either this, or the craft is made of material that is reflective from far away but not up close. Just like airplane exhaust can reflect the sun and make streaks in the sky, only different.  Or when a fog is rolling in, and you can see it from far away, but when you are standing in it, it doesn't seem foggy at all.  This would explain why we visually saw it as a ball of light from far away, but a craft up close.  I was actually standing in the exhaust so I couldn't see the light reflecting it. This is all I can come up with, because if the craft was emitting so much heat or light that it could be seen from 20 miles away, being that close to it would have blinded my eyes or burned my skin.  I don't know if anyone else has theorized this, but would be very interested to know if they have. Thank you for your time, I know this is a long and detailed report, It's just been so long ago I don't know what to leave in and out.  I hope this is helpful to your cause.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,,

As usual, I looked up at the sky to look for constellations.  I was out particularly longer today because I was so transfixed on Venus which was on the west horizon.  As any star watcher knows, the longer you look up at the sky, the more stars you can focus on.   So, I was able to make out many constellations. Eventually, I turned my attention to the eastern side of the sky as it moved north to south.  I spotted a satellite a little before 9 pm and tracked it as it moved across the sky.  I eventually lost it behind a building.  Hoping to see it again, I moved to a clearer area, but unfortunately, I couldn’t find it again.  I scanned the sky again and saw, at approximately 9pm, heading in a southern direction, a very bright light.  It was just as bright as Venus to the west.   However, I knew that there was no star that bright on the eastern part of the sky, so I gazed at it a little longer.  Because of a tree right under it, I was able! to notice that this ‘star’ was moving.  I was a little stunned, but then I told myself that it was probably a plane. So I watched it as it moved towards the south.  Eventually, the brightness faded and I saw that this bright light was made up of three smaller lights.  The more it moved to the south, the less bright it became and the more I could make out all three lights.  There were two in the front and then one a little, but not by much, dimmer light.  They formed a triangle, with the base being the front and the apex forming the tail.  I thought that maybe it was a plane, but I stared and stared and tried to make out any beacons, or blinking, lights, but never saw any.  If I know anything from watching the sky is that planes always have blinking lights.

There was one more mysterious thing in the sky just before they all disappeared.  This thing appeared abruptly from the area in the sky where the red lights were.  It was a simi transparent large square shape with rounded corners. It looked like a large lacy thing flying straight across the sky approximately 500 feet high.

However, I considered it may have been a stellar event such a Nova explosion. Then a minute passed and four consecutive, flashes followed.  At this point four solid lights illuminated, and they went in formation from NE to SW, to where they disappeared at a moderate speed. Several more flashes occurred through out the evening followed by a formation traveling at an extremely high altitude.  They were not aircraft nor satellites.  A period of non event took place until what seemed like a meteorite shot over my house at and altitude aprox. 1000 ft. I have seen lots of meteors and this just caught my sight.  Never have I ever seen anything move at this speed.  I then realized that what I saw, was a vehicle of the size of a moving van, with a flat bottom, smooth top akin to half an egg shell.  This sloping was gradual from top forward forming a cutting edge.  It sped by and I observed the vehicle warp and stretch length wise when it vanished.  This event astounded me!  It happened faster than I could blink. To follow up, today my wife and I witnessed five huge mother ships enter our airspace surrounded by and into massive cloud formations.

This is (possible abductions story and) UFO sightings. My background: I was born in Phoenix Arizona, went to a performing arts high school.  I did well there and graduated.  My family moved to Huntington Station, NY. Now we live in Huntington, NY.  I still live with my parents and I’m 21 going to college. I’ve lost track but I have been seeing weird lights in the sky at night (not every night) that move on their own will, and sometimes to my will, which sometimes flash with a sort of personality or speaking manner for a year and a half to two years now since after these experiences:  I thought I might have been in danger because I couldn’t sleep for three days in a row because I was shaking or my bed shook every time I was about to fall asleep and so I then went to the hospital.  The doctor told me I was hallucinating.  I sought psychiatric help and was put on anti-psychotics because they thought I had shizo-affective disorder.  I’ve been on medications for over a year and a half now and none of the medications I was put on or am on now helped in any way so that helps prove that I wasn’t hallucinating.  I have no family history of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder although I do have a family history of paranormal activity.  None of which were thought to be with aliens (tha! t I know of,) but a few times when I was younger I realized that I had scars on my skin that seemed to have been a healing from cut (which they mysteriously disappeared later on.) I even showed my mother them and I had no explanation for where they came from or how it happened. On this one day I was listening to my first iPod touch on shuffle.  The songs would very often come up relevant to what I was doing or thinking at that moment.  The same songs even began to play over and over again which is odd for a 1,500 song playlist (the device was not on repeat mode.)  Later at night I came home and started looking up the lyrics to the songs I was listening to at that moment because I thought I was being communicated to from a higher being.  After hours of listening and reading it seemed the lyrics were being changed on the websites.  I eventually felt changes and weird sensations going on in my head, and after about 6-10 hours of this, with occasional breaks, I was dyslexic and felt an emotional void of darkness (I was not on - or had been on - any drugs.)  Sometimes between the songs I would hear a weird clicking sound or noises that didn’t happen before.  In the morning I went downstairs and then threw up in the trash can because of how sick it made me.  The next song had written in the lyrics, “Wow really you threw up?”  A song or two later it told me to kill myself in which I was about to but didn’t.  I later looked up the same lyrics and none of the edits were there.  Just to clarify I didn’t have that episode of insomnia until maybe a month after this. Later that week I was up in my room when it sounded like cabinets downstairs were opening and closing. As I was going down the stairs it stopped.  Another day that week I was lying down and I heard this strange hovering-like sound. It sounded like it was right above my house.  On a different day I was in my room looking outside the window hoping to see this light I thought might be a UFO.  I saw it and then got bored.  Later I was not looking at my window and my room lit up with this passing green light.  After I went to the hospital I was sent to an inpatient hospital to be watched.  During the middle of my stay there I was looking out the window to see if the UFO was there.  It was and the whole time I was watching it it was getting closer and until it was just about to go over my head to where I couldn’t see it it kind of sparkled a whole bunch on the bottom of the craft with orange lights.  By that time I was hearing a cute girly voice that said, “what was that?” just as it flew! over my head displaying the lights. For a while after the “mind screw” I was very sensitive to sounds and my jaw started moving on its own in ways I’m incapable of doing (before I was on medications so it wasn’t a side-effect from them.)  Eventually the noises stopped, in which the noises where from my surroundings like tapping on the car window or tapping on my ceiling or crackling of which were in synchronicity with my thoughts, and I started to hear this voice which developed from what I thought it was.  I still hear the voice and there was no difference of it being on the medications since.  The voice definitely has a conscience of its own because it says words that I have never heard in my life or at least words that I might not have heard since I can remember.  I hear this voice most of the day shortly after waking up to when I go to bed.  Now the voice is loving and reassuring.  It started happening again lately that I sometimes shake when I’m about to fall asleep but now I eventually am able to fall asleep and I can still feel my bed moving sometimes (just in a more evasive fashion.)   Just to point out my friend saw the moving light in the sky once and acknowledged my claim.  I’ve been told it’s just a satellite but I can’t agree because sometimes I see more than one at a time and it’s too often.  Usually they’re orange and about the same size as a star, but stars don’t flicker rapidly, change color, and move. Almost done… I see these strange a light in my room (when the lights have been turned off which is usually blue or white) or lights in the “forestry” behind my house sometimes at night which are yellow or red and may move as if in a swiping manner, and sometimes I see white lights when I close my eyes which are like sparks that linger and then sort of “shut.” Although I see lights behind my eyelids it doesn’t mean I don’t see them externally as well. Seeing them behind my eyelids are only recent and they don’t move unlike the ones I think are UFOs or whatever it is that’s in the “forestry.” The last note is that I have seen a large black eyeball on the ceiling of my room in the last house for a split second after I had shut my eyes for a brief moment. It then vanished.  All of this is experience. I knew nothing of extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings before any of this happened to me but only of the sci-fi stuff you see on television. None of what I have experienced is from those shows or movies of which I have seen. I did do research afterwards and found some common traits people shared with alien contact. There are many songs I have now found that share some similarities to my experiences and makes me believe in them even more. I should mention that my dogs would hide and be frightened at times, whining and barking at things when there wasn't anything going on, not even a storm or noises that we could hear. I apologize if this is a waste of your time..",2013-10-14T00:00:00,40.8719,-73.4347

It wasn't something far away in the distance, but an up close visual display perhaps 100m from the middle of the river, but the lights were about 2 stories high, 10 metres in height, very large 'object' something like this [1] it was more rectangular than cubed, so it seemed like a vehicle of sorts. This varanasi picture [2] shows you the spatial dimensions, us up on one of the highest hotels overlooking the river, and the UFO/Object around where the boat is, but about 6 or 7 times as large. It was a set of about 50 individual points of light all moving and shifting and transforming into different geometric shapes like a hologram as it moved along faster than any man-made object could possibly move. At one stage they expanded out into a kind of circular peacock tail like this [3] and then contracted and transformed into a various geoemetric cubes all attached and moving and forming a larger overall shape. An hour earlier I had seen lights in the sky: It all began as I was set to walk back to my hotel for the 30 minutes trip when the power went out in a 10km radius in the city, the atmosphere became very 'wild' as if i had been transported a few hundred years into the medieval past into a lawless vibrantly alive place full of horses, dogs etc,  As I was walking I noticed a golden orb flash in the sky for micro-second, I thought it was odd and kept walking whereupon i came to the main market and saw a UFO hovering around like a conventional UFO sighting, flashing rapidly in various different points in the sky for around 20 seconds in the distance. I got back to my hotel and on top of the roof and went and stood on the balcony next to a korean man whom i had met a few weeks earlier. We both stood there looking at the river, i told him what i had just seen, and then he went on to tell me he had seen UFO's in Australia a year or so ago. As we were having this conversation I had turned my head to the side and all of a sudden he shouted 'LOOK' and pointed to a shape in the middle of the river and it was incredibly distinct, some kind of ghostship-like shape was materializing for 2 seconds and a few split seconds after we had noticed it become more clear and spread out into lots of individual points of light rapidly changing shapes as it moved along the river until it disappeared on the right side of our field of vision about 5km down the river in 5 or 6 seconds  Lots of Wows! and Whoa's! were had and then we both went back to our rooms, we had seen something incredible, but so surreal that it didn't really make much of a dent, i mean, the implications are enormous and yet it doesn't change every day life. The feeling was very supernatural, like every-day life had been punctured by some unknown force and humanity would reach some kind of singularity experience if this type of thing occurred more often than not, it was around december 10 last year, so the dec 21st 2012 hype was in the air and I didn't know what to make of it all, only that an alien contact with humanity seemed a possibility. I was extremely happy and life was a mythical type adventure at that current time so I feel that has something to do with the sighting, not the ""every day reality"" of suburban monotony I'm currently living in. Hasn't really changed me much, what are you meant to do with the experience? All I know was, what we experienced was really fucking bizarre, far more bizarre than a conventional UFO sighting, it was more like a 10 second holographic light display from some kind of ""interdimensional"" object and has added weight to the idea of a really bizarre quantum universe operating across all levels simultaneously. If anyone can recommend a good book regarding more hypothetical theorizing and experience stories of an intense type of contact with possible ""inter-dimensional objects"" and the primacy of consciousness and awareness, that would be ace.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,,

He called to me to come check it out and I did.  We went outside of my home and looked south (approximately 5-10 miles away from us) at this object.  This orb was orange ( about the size of an aspirin in a distance comparison) and also pulsating a faint white light while it stayed stationary about 10,000 to 15,000 feet in the sky.  It wasn't nearly as high as a passenger jet would fly, but higher than a helicopter or small airplane would fly.  It was definitely bigger than a helicopter or small plane. There was no sound at all from this craft and while it mainly stayed put, it would move towards the north, periodically.  As I watched this craft for approximately 3-4 mins, I noticed to the southwest of it was another orange orb that was pulsating.  No white light coming from it, but it was blinking and heading directly to the other craft.  It was smaller (about half or a quarter of the size of the 1st craft I saw) and as it came to the larger craft at a fast rate of speed, I thought it was going to crash right into the bigger craft.  It stopped abruptly and hovered near it, both crafts blinking and now the pattern of the light pulses changed.  Almost like they were communicating messages. After about 5 mins, the smaller craft moved more north of the stationary craft and then (almost in a reverse move) came back to the larger stationary craft.  Again, pulsating orange and white lights from the bigger craft and just orange pulsating lights from the 2nd smaller craft. Next thing I noticed was both crafts appeared to be heading north at a slow but steady speed.  All of a sudden, the smaller craft shot straight out to the west at a high rate of speed.  I could see it made a huge distance from the larger craft in just 3-5 seconds.  Nothing made on this planet could change directions that fast and then cover a huge distance.  Many, many miles of distance. I was able to see the smaller craft for awhile, as the entire west sky had no obstructions.  I watched as much of it as I could, periodically checking to see where the 1st larger craft was and shifted my vision back to the smaller craft (still heading due west).  It was only then the light faded out on the small craft, that I couldn't see it any longer and I immediately set my sights on the large craft.  It had moved to the north a bit more and wasn't going very fast.  Lights were still orange and white...still pulsating. Around 20 mins or so, I decided that I needed to head back indoors and that is the last time I saw this craft.  My son and I did not feel anything except for excitement and awe.  Only wished I had my camera working.  This isn't the first time I have experienced looking at an unidentified object near my area.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,42.58140054054054,-82.92209621621622

I’ve looked into how far my viewing distance was from my vantage point and It was roughly 50 miles. The 6 second fly over time would suggest an incredible speed.  From the cirrus clouds that sparsely skiffed the sky that night, I would speculate that the orb was at 60k feet or more when It passed over and it made no sound.  The light from the orb did light up the cirrus it passed over slightly but it appeared to be much higher than their level.

It is also very close to the flight path for Dubai’s International Airports but the aircrafts do not fly over the track.  As I was walking round my second lap, I noticed a heavy cloud above one of the mosques.  The rest of the sky was quite clear, even though it was dark.  Excited at the prospect of rain, I continued to watch the cloud.  There were other people using the track but no one was taking any notice.  The cloud had yellow, red and purple lights flashing inside it, one after the other, but in no sequence at all.  At first, I thought it was fire-works – I thought that a few families may have had some left over from our Eid Al Adha celebrations which passed last week.   I also thought it was a plane passing through or even a helicopter hovering…but there was no sound and absolutely nothing came out of the cloud.   I then thought that it may have been a d! rone but to be honest, I am not familiar with drone activity in Dubai.  The lights kept flashing, one after the other but, as stated earlier, in no particular sequence.  The strange thing was that the light remained contained in the cloud.  As I was watching, something like a lightning bolt flashed just to the right part of the cloud…but the shape was not a typical forked lightning, more of a slight spiral.  The lights were flashing for a good 5 or 10 minutes, but the bolt struck only once.  I was waiting to hear thunder to accompany it, but nothing came.  I also thought it may have come from the chimneys of a sewage plant nearby (they have lights on to warn aircraft of their height).  My training program requires me to start running after 1000 m, which I did – I ran 500 m, with the cloud on my right hand side, then turned around to come back to see it again.

The following incident occurred on August 13, 2013, at 2:00 AM, Pacific Coast Time.  The location was along the road going to Mount Charleston, in the vicinity of Las Vegas, Nevada. Two witnesses were parked along the road.  They were observing a recent meteor shower.  They were looking north, away from the city lights of Las Vegas.  Only a few meteors were spotted.  They came from the northeast direction.  Each meteor sighting lasted for about a second. However, a bright white light approached from the southeast.  It was in the shape of an orb.  Another object red orb shaped object appeared nearby.  Both objects moved towards the west over the Las Vegas skyline.  Both objects emitted an aura, or a haze, which was changing shape.  At various times, each object stopped and hovered still.  These events occurred until 2:30 AM. At 2:30 AM, the red orb shaped object disappeared.  It immediately reappeared about 25 miles to the southeast, about one second later.  It remained stationary for another half hour.  During this time period, the larger White shaped orb moved to the east.  It changed into a diamond shape.  Immediately thereafter, it changed into a triangular shape, with three bright lights in each corner.  This occurred for about 10 minutes, until it disappeared. Both witnesses returned to Las Vegas by 3:30 AM.  They were standing in a cul-de-sac observing the night sky.  At this time, the large white orb reappeared, coming from the northeast.  Two red orbs appeared nearby.  The large white orb changed into a boomerang shape.  It came closer to the neighborhood where the two witnesses were standing on the cul-de-sac.  The boomerang shaped object had bright white lights along each section or wing.  It approached even closer, and it remained stationary, hovering about 500 feet above the ground.  The two red orbs moved closer to this boomerang shaped object, hovering at about 600 feet above the ground.  By this time, the boomerang object emitted a beam of white light which was scanning from the left to right, and back again. However, the two red orbs each focused a red beam of light down into the cul-de-sac.  Following this, the red beams of light completely engulfed a house on the cul-de-sac.  The red beams of light created a red, green, yellow, and white spherical haze around the house.  The spherical haze had holographic properties, however it was difficult to ascertain definite shapes within the holographic properties.  This holographic type ball of light continued to change colors.  Then it stopped. Both witnesses continued to observe the three unidentified flying objects.  At 3:45 AM, witness number one decided to “ signal“ these three objects in the following manner:  Witness number one held his left  arm up and made three blinking motions with his left hand.  Then he paused for a second, held up his right arm, and made a single up and down motion, followed by a short pause, and continuing with four horizontal motions.  Continuing, the first witness walked in a circle.  The first witness did this to symbolize the number pi, as a universal mathematical constant, and to show its relationship to circles.  The first witness repeated this series of motions two more times, for a total of three times. Immediately thereafter each object transformed into disks.  The first object had three green lights on the underside.  These lights made a circular pattern, and rotated counter clockwise three times.  This was followed by a flash of bright white light. Continuing, four bright red lights appeared in a circular fashion.  They rotated clockwise, making four circular motions.  This entire pattern was repeated by the second object.  After this pattern was completed by the second object, the same exact and entire pattern was repeated by the third object.

Greetings,   My friend and I were scanned by a laser-like light at night by a high flying UFO 60 km east of Kenora, Ontario.  Our location was at Lat 49° 47.8’ and Long 93° 41.7’. My name is ((name #1 deleted)) and my friend’s name is ((name #2 deleted)).  We are in our 60’s.   ((#2) is retired public servant and I am semi-retired educator. ((#2)) and I have been avid wilderness canoeists for 42 years.  During the last 15 years, we have gravitated to our favourite camp site on the north eastern basin of Winnange Lake, Ontario.   On Tuesday evening, August 13, 2013, ((#2)) and I were scanning the skies for the last remnants of the Perseid meteor showers.  The half moon set at around 10:40 PM so the sky was black and rich with stars and the Milky Way which reflected off the lake.  The water was calm with not even a gentle breeze, so we easily saw and heard the jet planes flying at 40,000 ft.  We sited several fast moving meteorites. Suddenly, while scanning the skies at almost 11:20 PM ((#2)) excitedly exclaimed “((#1)), did you see that flash?!!”  I immediately directed my sight toward the western sky and witnessed a silent and high flying object whose dim light was continuous for about 15 seconds, then began alternately fading out and reappearing at about 5 second intervals.  After about one minute, the dim light seemed not to move at all, but began to grow hugely in size while changing like a kaleidoscope into many colors including yellow, orange, red, purple, green, and blue.   During the 7 seconds or so when the object grew in size and its colors started to change, I became increasingly ill in my stomach and chest area feeling nauseous as if my body was being violated and invaded.  I felt like I was going to vomit.  ((#2)) said later that he felt a sensation of fear and his body hairs stood on end.   The object abruptly and unexpectedly flashed directly at us brilliant white laser-like beams of light into our eyes, which lasted at least a second and almost blinded us.  We were unable to close our eyes or blink as would be the case when a bright flashlight hits one’s eyes in a dark room.   From my peripheral vision, I recalled that nothing else around us was lit up so no shadows appeared around us from the trees or our camping gear, indicating that the light flash was only directed at our eyes.  Our bodies were locked during the flash.  I felt that my soul had been scanned and I became angry from this violation of my being.  ((#2)) experienced a similar sensation.  Immediately, I asked him to check the time which was 11:20 PM, so I don’t believe that we lost time. After the UFO’s laser-like light beam attacked us, we watched it for another minute or so as it continued in the alternating fading and reappearing pattern it had previously exhibited, and then it totally faded from view.  The object was flying in a straight line direction of WNW at an angle of about 50 degrees above the western horizon.  We had been examining the eastern, southern and western sky for meteorites.  I believe that the object was silently flying at least 40,000 feet above the ground, while ((#2) felt that it was lower at about 10,000 ft.  The whole episode from the initial sighting to final extinction of its alternating glow lasted about 2 minutes. A few days later, I talked to friends who had been camping at Big Whiteshell Lake in Manitoba on the same evening, as they too were scouring the skies for meteors with a large telescope.  Our friends stated that from their location, they and others witnessed at the same moment the object which flashed ((#2)) and me.  As the crow flies, they were about 100 km northwest of our campsite.  Our friends stated that they saw no light beams eminate from the object.

Initially, I thought it was an aircraft on fire traveling due south at about 5000 feet AGL.   Approximately the size of my thumb nail it came to a hover directly over me and hovered for approximately 30 seconds.  It then backed up roughly 3 arc seconds, moved west by the same amount, and then moved south east by about 4 arc degrees.   The object then started ascending due east eventually climbing over the clouds which were in the eastern quadrant of the sky in approximately 20 seconds.   I snapped a picture with my IPhone as it was ascending and then called for a weather briefing.

Consequently, based on this weather report for 0339 Zulu for Billings, MT, I estimated the ! rate of climb from a hover (5000 AGl) to disappearing over the clouds at 12,500 giving it a rate of climb of approximately 22,500 fpm.   The object was circular, glowed brightly the color of a campfire, and made no noise.  The color of the object never changed during the 60 seconds of witnessing it.

During my last break the light was gone.  It was difficult to determine but I believe that I observed this same light south westerly over the Owyhee Mountains. Oct 26 2013 Approximately 20:15 hrs.  The same bright object has appeared once again.  With a slight variation of location, as observed through the same phone lines.  That night I found my Simmons 10 x50 binoculars and observed the object.  Through the binoculars the bright light appeared to be not round but radar receiver shape quite bright with a slight wobble.    Not sure of my observation because of the appearance of lines extending across the surface of the object.   The thought occurred to me that perhaps it was a space observation object.   I went in the house and referred to my Night Watch by Terence Dickinson Perhaps the light that I was observing was in fact a celestial object and I was NUTS. Today is the Oct 27, 2013.

The crafts must have been USA airplanes or from earth since both had a red light on top.  Odd thing is that they were totally silent even though 500 feet above ground and about the width of 2 city blocks away traveling fast.  Since they were heading toward me could explain that I could only see bright lights.  This could have been their head lights.  However, why would anyone trying to conceal their identity travel with all lights on and a red light on top ?  Also the next morning the beach coastline had fishermen and their SUVs all side by side in front of my house.  Fish run in August I thought even though some people have told me that the fish run in late October.  That night I saw a shooting star that headed in the direction of where those 2 UFOs came from.  So another ship may have joined them or was trying to hook up with them.  I read another report that someone else further down the Barrier Island where I saw this als! o saw a UFO 2 nights earlier.  I think someone should check Island Beach to see if any ships landed there.  Probably too difficult since it is all bush or brush and sand which the wind and ocean could easily cover the landing marks.  There is also many marsh areas to easily cover landing marks.  My hunch is that there crafts were from Earth,  However, the unanswered question is why them did the 2 crafts travel so fast so low and so silently ?

They paused for a second when I waved hello from my porch which was lite up.

Both UFOs were silent yet only were about 500 feet off the group and barely 1 full city block away over the ocean.  I thought they were fighter jets because of the red light at top.  However, I realized later they were UFOs since planes do not appear as light in the shape of a cross.  They appeared at first as flying stars.  When I put on my strongest glasses for fine reading I could see the light had a red light on top with a cross shape of white light.  The arms of the cross of light were the widest.  40 years ago my mom and I would watch these UFOs fly high up in the sky.  We have not see any UFOs in the area ever since.  This is the first time they have returned and the first time they fly so low.  A MIG flew by years ago when the President of the USA permitted a MIG to flew across the country.  So my home is a flight path for civilian and military craft.

On the night of Tuesday, August 13, 2013, two other adults and I visited the beach on Tybee Island, just off the coast of Savannah, Georgia.  We were standing near the pier when we witnessed several orange/red lights in the sky.   First one light appeared.  Seconds later two more appeared at about a distance of 3 or 4 times the width of the original light and to its right.  They remained absolutely still for several seconds.   Then the first light went out, followed shortly by the twin lights also going out.  Several seconds later, the twin lights reappeared as before, followed by the first light again coming on.  For a minute or so, the turning on and then off of these three lights continued.   There was no discernible pattern.  Sometimes the first light would come on; sometimes it would be the twin lights.  Whichever appeared first would be the first to disappear.  At no time was there any movement of these lights.  They remained steadfast in their positions,! appearing and then disappearing like fire in the sky. At the conclusion of the light show described above, there appeared yet a fourth light to the left of the original light’s position.  Then a second light moved to the left of this fourth light.  Then another light moved to the left of it, and another light to the left of that one.  As I recall, there were now four lights sitting in a row, perfectly still as though they were hanging from an invisible rod.   As one of my companions described it, it seemed as though the lights had been hiding behind one another, each taking a turn to move to the left and within our sight.  There they remained for several seconds and then they were gone.  We did not see them again, but we left the beach shortly after as there was a mighty storm approaching. Before the lights appeared, we had watched a distant fireworks show far up the beach to the north.  So it must have been between nine and ten o’clock.  The lights appeared about 65 degrees above the horizon.  They were straight ahead of us, out over the water.  We had earlier observed the lights of a distant barge, and the fireballs in the sky seemed to be closer to shore.  I remembered the lights as being triangular, but with rounded corners, more of an egg shape or oval.  One companion remembered them as being more circular, and my other companion said he saw “portholes” in each light. The lights we saw were beautiful.  They had an organic look, not like artificial light, but a warm glow like that of candle light in a pumpkin, but redder.  They emitted no beams, and were not reflected in the water below.

However, I then spotted a second red light just below it (about a ½ a hands width) and they were moving like they were sparing.  The two lights would occasionally change from blue to red and then back again.  Several times they would suddenly drop about one hand width (at arms length) then change color from red to blue and then go straight up one to two hand widths.  They continued this “dance” for several minutes.   My neighbor pulled up in his car and I yelled at him to come look at this.  He saw them also and didn’t know that they were.

While listening to coast to coast am I was informed that there have been numerous sightings of strange floating and streaking fireballs in the sky across the US, and was stunned by this fact, as my family and I witnessed these strange objects in the evening sky three times. 	The first event took place on June 13 at approx. 8:30 pm.  My family and I were driving to our house which is located on one of the very high mountain peaks of the region when my step-Father pointed out a strange floating orange object in the dark evening sky. We were all instantly awestruck as to what this object could have been.  We stopped the car dead on the road and continued to inspect the object in disbelief.  It looked to be anywhere from 1000 to 1500 ft. in the air, and slowly floating in the opposite direction of the wind and cloud movement. It closely resembled a hot air balloon that had caught on fire and had no basket attached to it.  The object was very large, entirely too big to be a Chinese lantern or any other ceremonial object.  The strangest thing about the event is that the object was floating straight across the sky not up or down and was far below cloud cover and this very large flaming ball simply disappeared right in front of our eyes.  That very same nigh! t and approx. 10:30 pm my wife and I were driving home from our parents’ house and once again witnessed this strange object in the jet black night sky.  This was not the last of the occurrences however, three days later on Sunday June 16th we yet again witnessed this event take place at approx. 9: 30 pm. 	Although I have spent countless hours researching what these fireballs could have been I am left with nothing but the fact that this has taken place all over the US and possibly the world.  I am a Veteran and had spent 4 years stationed on an airbase and have been in multiple combat zones and have never witnessed anything similar to this. My only conclusion is that it is supernatural or extraterrestrial.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,40.31809857142857,-78.90465428571429

I stepped out to my patio at 11:02 PM eastern time.  It's completely dark with no street lights within 700 + yards.  It is a completely clear and calm night and the stars are bright and easy to see. I live directly beneath jetway J8 or J6 at (30*07'26.27"" N) (82*38'18.90""W) and noticed 5 airliners in rout heading south west away from my back door like always approximately 35,000 feet give or take 5,000?  So I know at least 1 or 2 of these airliners should have seen this also. As I'm standing out back looking southwest watching the airliners fly over and I noticed to my left a really bright star only that star is moving then I noticed it somewhat began to dim to a dark blue then got bright as a landing light  Then dimmed to the color of a normal star then dark blue again where I all most lost it and Repeated this sequence 4 more time.  As all this is happening I'm trying to put together what am i seeing?  First I thought it was a plane then satellite and maybe it's the sun hitting it under the horizon and then it got to my 2 o'clock and just Instantaneously stopped and blended in with the surrounding stars!!!  I didn't take my eyes away from it for over 30 seconds and it was just sitting still then I started to question if I was still looking at the same thing doubting I really just saw what I saw so I started to scan the sky again to try and regain sight of it.  Then another light that looked like a landing light caught my eye at my 11 o'clock taking the exact same path only faster It seemed.  Now this is where it gets scary. When the second one gets to the point where I lost the first one that blended into the stars The one I lost brightened back up and instantly matched the second ones speed and directly fell in behind the second one and followed it out of sight and seemed to change directions to the north east?  The colors I noticed were star white. Dark blue and bright halogen bulb yellow like a landing light or reflection from the sun off something metallic.  They were the exact size of a normal star just looking up at night.  This all happened in under two minutes and guessing if it had been continuous it would have crossed the horizon well under a minute.  The airliners take 3 or 4 minutes from the time I can see them directly overhead.  I could hear the airliners overhead but not the lights I were seeing.  They had to be well over 70,000 feet if they were even in the atmosphere at all?   I've had a pilots license 20 years this November So i have a little knowledge of what I'm seeing when I look up and I've never seen anything like what I saw last night so if anyone could please explained to me what I might have seen please feel free to contact me I'd love to hear your theory's.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,38.1142,-82.6032

But soon after noticing it the light become larger and larger until it appeared to be twice the size of a full moon through partial cloud cover and then stopped growing.   At first I wasn't sure what to think of it so I ran inside and grabbed my significant other.  I pointed out what I was seeing and she told me that maybe it was the moon.  I told her there was no way the moon was that far northwest at the current time (11:30ish PM).  I proceeded to go back inside grab my phone to confirm using Google Sky Map the current location of the moon as it was cloudy outside and we couldn't see the moon.   We then got on the computer and looked up luner cycles to get further clarification on the moons current location.  I went back outside to take a photograph and it was gone.   I then ran back inside and told my significant other it was gone and we both stood outside in disbelief... I should have taken a picture as soon as I noticed it... I dont know what I was thinking.  My first confirmed sighting of something odd and I was more in shock and trying to disprove what I was seeing I guess.  I won't let that happen again and will be spending more time looking up.

When I soon get in on the picture the crafts all look round cylindrical with a metal color with a definite solid shape on all of them and what looks to be a sit atmosphere at the center of each of the ship much like the reported flying disc.

I told my son to run in the house and grab my cellphone and as soon as he brought it out I started filming with the phone's video camera.  Object was moving fairly fast and had a very shallow approach angle but seemed to slow down later.  I turned on the phone's video camera and caught some footage of the object.  The other thing that we all agreed on later that there was no sound (no prop or engine noise).

I had the impression that the object was quite close.  It appeared to be 30-50 feet in altitude and 100-200 yards away. It also seemed to be quite small.  Perhaps the size of a small cellphone held at arm’s length.  After a few seconds, the object stopped and hovered briefly then reversed course quickly back to the east and disappeared behind a row of homes in our subdivision. I went back in the house to the upstairs bedroom to see if I could spot the object but it was gone.   What I found interesting was the complete silence of the object and how smoothly it moved through air. Weather conditions were clear, no clouds or wind with an ambient temperature of! ~60 degrees. It was definitely not an aircraft.  A helicopter could have performed similar maneuvers but it was completely silent. The only thing that I can imagine it was would be some sort of remote control drone, but a completely silent one.

There was not a sound coming from it. I sent my dad in to get a pair of binoculars and we looked at the object carefully with them.  We discovered the lights were not blinking on and off as we thought but were dimming and then brightening.  When they were dim you could not see them with the naked eye.  The lights circled a disk shaped black mass that seemed to create a void space in the sky yet at times it seemed almost transparent.  It was saucer shaped with the lights on the perimeter. All of the lights appeared to be white there was one white light on the top as we were able to view it as it left.   After about ten to twelve minutes the object started to move directly north toward town.  It moved slowly with no sound. It looked like it just floated away. Since there was nothing to use as a reference I would guess it was between 50' and 100' in diameter.

At about 2 am on the morning of September 23, 2013, I was awakened by a very loud sound coming from outside.  It sounded like an electronic fax signal only much louder.   I went to the sliding door of my bedroom that opens to the outside.  I live on the edge of a 675 acre natural area.  There was nothing out there, no visible lights or vehicles.  The single long electronic signal was followed by a long sequence of signals that sounded like morse code, very crisp and loud and almost metallic.  The sound seemed to be coming from all around.  I could not see the sky over head because I was standing under a porch roof.  I was considering walking out into the yard so I could see what was over the building when the sound suddenly stopped.  It was then dead silent.  No sounds of any kind.   In a few seconds I heard the fax signal and then the morse code sound coming faintly from a distance in the northwest.  Then it was gone.  There was no visual phenomena associated with the sound. Again this morning on October 8, 2013, I was awakened at 1:57 am by the tail end of the fax-like signal, followed by the loud morse code like signals.  Again I went to my door and opened it.  There was nothing visible, just the sound enveloping me from all directions, very loud.  The sky that was visible to me from the porch looking north was clear and stars were visible.  I was afraid to go out into the yard.   At 2:04 am the signals stopped suddenly, followed by dead silence.  Then in a few seconds they were repeated coming very faintly but discernibly  from the northwest.  Again, there was nothing visual to associate with the sound.   I stood at the opened door and continued to listen.  Whatever was emitting the signals was travelling northwest and repeating them at intervals, because I heard another set coming even more faintly as if even farther away.  Then I could not hear anymore. I have lived here eight years and am very familiar with the local sounds.  This is totally unlike anything I have ever heard.  The quality of the sound is particularly unique as it seems to come from all directions  in the immediate vicinity.  I felt cocooned in the sound. I was wondering if this is reportable as a possible UFO. These are not sight experiences, but they are so odd I am wondering if you may have received similar reports of sound experiences of unknown origin.

So all seems fine and happy but there is an undercurrent going on that is not being reported and people secretly point out errors and false facts in the article, photos and other details.. Initial reports of it having been a real UFO have subsided with talk of people being pressured to change their stories or silenced with threats of loss of income, Benefits, job and home. Reports of 12 inch to 6 inch tall dolls or figures being moved in an ambulance have slowly gone quiet and hushed along with mentions of them having elongated heads.  One report which has not been substantiated is that one of the figures had a USA flag on the arm of its  clothing. People point out how there are financial cuts going on everywhere in the United Kingdom and no money exists in schools to stage such acts for the children, when jobs, staff and building cuts are taking place. Police officers in the United kingdom are not allowed by law to take part in uniformed in such staged events. A parent is claimed to have  built the UFO , staged the crash and pretended to be a forensic  officer all in double quick time just to help the children have a creative writing day. People comment of disinformation going on and posted online.  Some say the school angle was staged to cover what really landed elsewhere and during all the attention on the school the real event site was cleared. People point out that on a slow news day the reports made the local paper yet strangely regional TV and newspapers  were quiet. So just what really did happen what really did crash?  People now won't  talk or only tow the official line after all Jobs and homes are hard to come by in the United Kingdom right now.

((NUFORC Note:  We do not know who the source of the report, and I strongly doubt that I suggested that the individual's report was ""false.""  We rarely have any idea which reports are sincere and accurate, and which are bogus.  PD))  This recent incidence happened while I was traveling to play golf, on 79 north going over the Glenfied Bridge.  Already filed a report.  On my way to meet a buddy at Olde Stonewall.  That's near Zelionople.  I leave from near Pitt International. I know my aircraft.  Former Navy Analyst.  Was one of two suits in a sea of white and gold bars in the Pentagon. Was a constant at Wings Over Pittsburgh.  Pilots of 16s and 18s couldn't believe what I knew. I know my stuff. I can differentiate just the sound of mil power vs commercial or private. Just find someone to confirm what I saw.  It was at 12:30 as I traveled north on 79 to Zeli.  It was less than a minute.  I was going 75mph over a mile long bridge.  I saw this thing going straight over Pittsburgh.  Seven miles by air away. Please find a confirm  Or then  tell me I'm right or don't contact. Also something in Amsterdam, NY.  Me and a friend were outside late at night.  He was smoking and I was having a chew. This craft, very high altitude, came over.  But every time it ""glowed"" it accelerated like crazy.  Much faster than regular commercial craft. We both just looked at each other, and said to each other we'd never seen such a thing.  There is an old AF base near there.  So don't rule that out.  In fact the A12/SR71 used to to have service there after twelve hour trips. This wasn't that.  No 16.  No 15.  No 22.  And no Hornet, whatever it was defied explanation. No noise. No goofiness.  Just a couple guys watching the sky.  Actually we were using his iPhone app to identify constellations and stars. So after you telling me I filed a false report, find some submission somewhere to verify my report of the abnormal object I saw over Pittsburgh. If anything you can find is false, then go back to your bunker.  You pissed me off.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,40.443091945513764,-79.97424169381107

Location: San Francisco, CA  Date: October 2nd, 2013     UFO sighting report  On October 2nd, 201,3 at about 11:45 am, on a cloudless sunny Wednesday morning in San Francisco, I witnessed a round shaped (it could’ve been disc shaped) UFO flying at a very high altitude going from northwest to southeast direction.  The object was white but it could’ve been silver, it was very high in the sky, way higher than altitudes that regular passenger jets usually fly in this area.  It was flying at a slow speed from my perspective and it was not doing any erratic movements.  At one particular point, it sharply turned east positioning itself right above my head and then it stopped moving and just hovered there for a while, which clearly indicated that this thing was under intelligent control. The object stayed semi-stationary, doing side to side and up & down small movements (again from my perspective), and at one point I felt that the object intentionally wanted me to see it...  After about 10 minutes, the object started moving and after another minute or so I lost eye contact with it as it moved away to the southeast, it was very very high up in the sky.  The best part of this sighting was that I was able to capture a 1:36 s video of the object while it was above my head executing side to side up & down small maneuvers.  The white/silver object although small is pretty clear in the video if you know what you’re looking for.  I was filming it with my iphone camera which does not have a zoom feature (which sucks).  I was tempted to go grab my digital camera which has good zoom but I was afraid I was going to lose contact  with the object if I ran inside the house to retrieved the digital cam (which the batteries turned out to be dead I found out later, so it was the right decision). The convincing part of this sighting is that there were absolutely no clouds whatsoever in the clear skies that day and you can clearly see the round shaped object in the video.  Another interesting side of this experience was that, a few minutes before, I was contemplating the sky in a meditative state of mind sending out thoughts of harmony, joy, love and eagerness for knowledge, I made a request that if there were anybody out there intercepting my thoughts at that moment to please manifest itself somehow, then this object appeared out of nowhere flying from the northwest.  It almost looked like it turned off its cloak device to show itself to me. I was amazed, undoubtedly this sighting was real, it wasn’t an airplane (they don’t stop in mid-air), it wasn’t a weather balloon, and it wasn’t an optical illusion either.  This was a metalic/whitish colored structured flying pretty high in the sky under intelligent control.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

It seemed to come from the foothills north of Rte 54 and head toward the ocean, eventually hovering very low, maybe 200-500 ft over the ground near us. Then slowly, stopping to hover and slightly alter direction several times and going much higher, over a period of maybe 10 minutes from our vantage point, it disappeared over the foothills on the other side of Rte 101 and north of Rte 54.

On the morning of Sept.13,2013 approximately 2:18 a.m., I sighted a pulsating,dull pinpoint of light in the sky bearing 170 degrees, azimuth 75 degrees.  This light pulsated at around two Hz from a dull red to almost dark.  Altitude was impossible to determine, although it looked about right for airliner cruising altitude. Its heading was 080 degrees. Its apparent speed was again similar to that of an airliner.  The object appeared to maintain heading and speed for a duration of around 3 minutes.  After this period, I took my dogs back into the garage and immediately returned outside and looked to where I had last seen the object. Could not reacquire.  Throughout sighting, the atmospheric conditions were clear with no moon nor clouds.  Temp was around 60 degrees as of two hours previous, per my pickup truck thermometer. I apologize for the prosaic nature of this sighting.  What struck me as odd about it was the fact that I saw no other aircraft lighting associated with this object, such as the green starboard wing tip light.  It is possible that due to the apparent angle of my position to this object in relation to its travel path, such a starboard light may have been obscured by the body of this object.  Neither did I see a white strobe tail light or steady white landing gear light.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,40.572,-85.7691

After spending the day romping in La Verkin Creek in the backcountry of Zion National Park, my girlfriend and I noticed an extremely bright white light stationed about 10-15 degrees above the horizon on our walk back to our campsite.  The light was much wider in diameter than a typical star (perhaps 5 times as wide) and much brighter.  The light appeared to be somewhat far from us as it was way out on the horizon. After a few moments of staring at the light trying to figure out what it was, both my girlfriend and I started to feel a strange energy in the air (that of a presence), and everything felt exceptionally quiet and still.  Within a few minutes, we started to notice an aircraft flying directly toward the light.  The aircraft was sleeker than a commercial aircraft so it was my guess that it was a military aircraft.  That hypothesis was reinforced when the aircraft slowed down to almost a complete stop as it was approaching the light, something that I think would be atypical of a commercial aircraft.  After that airplane arrived, we noticed helicopters approaching in the distance.  I have to admit that the energy that we felt coupled with the approaching aircrafts made my girlfriend and I pretty uneasy as it felt like something big was about to happen. This whole time the light did not move in any direction, but it did have a slight pulse to it with a period of a few seconds.  During that time the light went from bright to slightly brighter and slightly larger and then back again. After about 5-10 minutes of very still, tense energy, the white light disappeared.  The way in which it disappeared is kind of difficult to explain.  It appeared to get smaller and fade in brightness until it completely vanished.  It was almost as if it flew into the distance at an extremely fast rate.  For this to have been the case, it would have been flying further toward the horizon and the opposite direction of where we were.  The disappearance of the light took approximately two seconds.  After that the energy subsided and the aircraft left the area.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,,

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD)) SIGHTING # 25 – August 14, - SECOND SIGHTINGS OF GLOWING ELONGATED/FOOTBALL SHAPPED UFOS WITH A DIRECT CORRELATION TO OUR NINTH SIGHTING OF “FIREBALL” UFOs AND “FLASHERS” I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:30 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  The weather was clear and calm, with some clouds well past the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico.  The moon was almost half full and high in the sky when I first arrived.  Based on my previous nights sightings and knowing that I could only see the glowing, white/gold UFOs through my binoculars, I had them trained toward the NNW, just off shore of uninhabited Cayo Costa Island, when at approximately 9:50 I got really lucky and saw two of the glowing UFOs appear to “pop” out of the Gulf of Mexico, perhaps 5 or 6 miles away from me.  I estimate the miles based on the horizon being at 7 miles over water, and these objects were just inside the horizon.  I say “lucky” because I only saw them briefly, maybe 15 seconds or so, before they “turned off,” slower than a light switch, but not as long as if on a dimmer switch.  I don’t think I would have seen them from where I was without binoculars.  These two were side by side, about 2 or maybe 3 UFO lengths apart.  I’ve estimated before that the UFOs were around 100 feet long -  at least not more than 150 feet long.  About 10 minutes later I caught a brighter goldish-white light with naked eyes, but when I got my binocs on it, I saw that there were already 2 of the objects there, one right on the water, and one just above it like before.  I couldn’t tell if they “popped” out of the water or not, but I suspect that they did.  As before, the UFO on the bottom started rising up to the one above, and they looked like they were about to merge and appeared to be touching each other, when the lights went out!  Then about another 10 or 15 minutes later, while looking through my binoculars, I saw one, then two, and then three of the same colored UFOs appear to come right out of the water again!  WOW!  Two of them were fairly close together – maybe 3 or 4 lengths apart - and the third was a litter further out to sea, maybe twice as far as the first two.  I counted 7 or 8 times that various numbers of these UFOs – up to 5 at one time – appeared and the quickly disappeared, after 5 to 15 seconds.  They always appeared to be coming out of the water, and sometimes drifting maybe 3 to 5 object heights above the water before disappearing.  I say that they appeared to come out of the water because just before they became brighter, it always seemed like there was a tiny little blob of water right at the surface before the light became full strength.  Well, maybe not “full strength, because that would be really bright, but bright enough to make out a shape.  During the time I was scanning the horizon it this area, whether there were UFOs or not, I would occasionally see a single white strobe-like flash close in the area – within view of other UFOs.  I never saw more than one flash at a time within a minute or so, but they were nonetheless consistent in the area.  Here’s where it got really interesting.  The oblong lights had not come on for a good 10 minutes or so, when I saw one of the amber “fireballs” I and others have been seeing, come on, right at the same exact location where I’d been seeing the other UFOs, but not more that 400 or 500 feet above the water.  I saw this single fireball come on through my binocs as if on a “fast” dimmer,” and continued to watch in that area for another 5 minutes or so as the light dimmed on and off.  Each time it came on it stayed on around 5 or 10 seconds, went off for a minute or so, came on for 5-10 seconds, etc. for a total of 6 times.  Each time it came on it was a few degrees higher on the horizon, going straight up.  The last time it came on it was perhaps 900 feet above the horizon, about 5 miles away from me.  After the last time it came on, nothing much happened for 20 minutes or so and I went home.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

As I was looking up (facing south) I noticed there were four stars in a trapezoid shape.  I thought it was strange because I’d never noticed that star constellation before, when all of a sudden the two “stars” on the right side of the trapezoid started to move upwards and westward, together. I called my fiancé out to look. They had a very fluid movement to them, they moved together but sort of drifted a little more together and a little more apart at times.  They moved fairly quickly for what tiny lights we could see.  They looked just like dim stars but the lights pulsated instead of twinkled the way stars do. The lights ended up stopping to the west aligned with a bright star.  A few seconds after the lights stopped, the biggest meteor I have ever seen streaked across the sky, and right as it happened, the craft or crafts adjusted themselves to face where the meteor had just been. We continued to stare at the lights for about 10 minutes, but they just hung there, very still in the sky.  We decided to go inside.  A half an hour went by and my curiosity got the best of me, and I looked out to see the “stars” were still there, just frozen still.

Ripsticks are similar to skateboards.  The weather was perfect all day and the sky was perfectly clear.  The sun was slowly setting but it was still light out.  I am a 32 year old male and the other witness was my 12 year old step daughter. We rode our ripsticks for roughly 15 minutes then decided to take a break in a quiet neighborhood a few streets away from our house.  She got off her ripstick and sat down in the grass off the road.  I stopped and got off the ripstick and stood in the road simply looking at how beautiful the sky was that evening.  My eyes were quickly drawn to a small dark spherical shaped object appear on the horizon where the tree line meets the sky, around 300 yards to the right of the road.  There was a wooded area, a break in the neighborhood where no houses were built, just power lines running along an open area with ! grown in shrubs and grass and small trees.  The area was about 40 feet wide with power lines right through the middle.  On both sides were bigger trees and denser woods. This object caught my eye as I happened to be looking in that direction of the sky where the sun was setting. By that time it was still somewhat light out, but dark enough for cars to start turning on head lights. Basically the sky was still light in that direction and the ground and street and neighborhood was getting darker. The object was traveling as fast as a helicopter would. I thought it was a helicopter at first, but there was absolutely no sound, no lights blinking, no lights at all. It seemed to be moving in a straight line as if it had a destination heading towards the coast out to the ocean. It was difficult to guess how high it was, I would estimate around 800-1200 feet off the ground. I am not sure how fast it was going, but similar to any airplane or helicopter. It never stopped never hovered, ! just kept going straight towards the coast. It first appeared ! as small dot on the horizon then got bigger as it approached our area overhead then as it headed off toward the coast it got smaller and smaller again. It lasted roughly about 1 minute from the horizon where the sky was brighter from the direction of the sun setting, to the coast where it was no longer visible. We both saw it and we both felt a very strange feeling in our gut about it. Something definitely was not right about it. No sound and no lights. It went right over us. I did notice it seemed to be going in the same direction as the power lines that came out of the wooded area. It was high enough to not be able to make out any details with our naked eyes. I wish I had binoculars at that moment, but unfortunately I didn’t. Still it was very unusual and we could sense it in our guts. Basically it was ball or spherical shape, all black or dark color, no lights, no sound, moving as fast as any aircraft would overhead. It was definitely not an airplane, not a jet, not a helicopter,! not a glider, not a satellite, not a hang glider because it was spherical, and it maintained the same altitude, not a person in a parachute, not a kite, not any bird or any flying animal, not anything that I could possibly think of. This thing had a solid round dark colored egg shaped or spherical shaped body to it. No wings, no tails or fins, just a solid spherical mass floating through the air as fast as a helicopter with no sound, and no lights. It was very creepy.

While driving home from San Luis Obispo, CA at approximately 2120 at night, on interstate 5 going North between the Little Panoche Road and Firebaugh CA Exits we saw an unidentified aircraft flying at approximately 100' off the ground.  The aircraft was only visible by the 3 large, round, bright white lights that were evenly spaced in a row horizontally.  The lights seemed to be about 4 times larger than a car headlight with no other visible lights and we could not make out the shape of the body. Just by looking at the lights and how they were spread out horizontally I would guess that the span of the aircraft would be that of the wing span of a 737 aircraft. We saw the aircraft fly very slowly directly ahead of and in front of us.  As the aircraft was on the passenger side of the car, I remarked to my wife to ""watch that aircraft, it looks like it is going to land, make an emergency landing"", I kept on saying, ""watch it, keep an eye on it....! keep on watching it"".  Then as it came around to the east side of our car and crossed the highway going from the east to the west it quietly flew past and flew around on the west side of the freeway.  We thought it was an aircraft that was coming in for an emergency landing, as it was flying at an incredibly slow speed and very low to the ground.  The aircraft was silent or at least very quiet because we heard no noise as it passed overhead in front of us.  The car windows were up and the radio was on, but something flying that low and slow would have made some noise and turbulence as it passed over, we noticed no noise or abnormal movement of our car from the passing craft.  The craft then flew around on the west side of the freeway, disappeared from view and then I saw it in my side and rear view mirrors, my wife also saw the craft as she turned around to look out the back windows.

The second one was actually kind of cluster with 5 other stars or lights but after I'd watched the second one move off I turned to look back at where it had first seemed positions and the other lights/stars it had been clustered near were gone as well, almost as if they had just faded slowly unnoticeably further out to space or just dimmed out.  Also, wanted to note again, the sky here was completely cloudless and clear with no storms passing near my position on any weather maps I'd checked from Accuweather and my WeatherChannel apps.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,40.3224898089172,-76.42962993630573

While watching this in amazement, the lights changed shape and became 5 lights in an elongated rectangular shape with a point on the end like a Star Destroyer.  This lasted for maybe 30 seconds and then all of a sudden the lights changed shape again and took on the 'classic' cylindrical “flying saucer” shape and started moving across the sky. After watching it slowly move to the east like this, the lights then changed into a 'star' shape, with at least 8 points; I'm not totally sure how many points, but there were at least eight of them.  This object then started moving north, while still in the star shape, moving slowly to the north.  All of a sudden it picked up speed and shot away in an instant still moving north.

Five of us were in a car driving around in the country late at night when the object was spotted.  At first we thought it was a helicopter until it started maneuvering unlike anything we had ever seen. The object was a light in the sky.  The light was an orange/red color.  I always thought the color looked like a window that had an oil lantern burning inside. It could fly very slow and even stop and hover.  It could take off at high speed and then stop immediately.  It could go straight up to very high altitude and then stop or make 90 degree turns at speed. It mostly just went very slow at low attitude like it was searching for something.  It would sometimes blink off and immediately back on somewhere far away.  We could see for miles and miles from where we were as we watched it. We had stopped on the country road and were just watching it for maybe an hour when it came to a stop down the road we were on.  The driver then said I am going to catch it and took off as fast as the car would go toward it. Then the light just blinked off and then back on right in front of us.  The light just filled up the windshield and car and surrounding area with its bright illumination and scared all of us greatly. The driver put the car in reverse well before we stopped and floored it to try and get away from it and we finally started going backward at high speed.  The light blinked off and back on in another location. We all decided that the device was just warning us off and we took the hint.  We watched a little longer than went home.  I need to mention that the device made no noise at all and of course could defy our laws of physics as it flew around the county side. We could not tell anyone about this for a couple of reasons.  People that reported UFO’s were nuts and made fun of back in those days. We looked in the newspaper the next day to see if anyone had reported anything but there was no news.   Later in the day, the Wichita Falls, TX, rRadio station reported on the news that a truck driver reported a UFO in the Red River area.  This was maybe 40 miles from us.

One night, very late, we were looking out the upstairs windows and we saw a bright disk of light rise up out of the forest in the valley below the mountain and zoom away into the sky and disappear.   The next day my boyfriend and his buddy got on their bikes and rode out to the forest.  They found a lot of old logging trails.  They followed them in the general direction of the light we had seen the night before.   They found a large circular clearing in the middle of the dense pine forest, over a hundred feet in diameter.  Around the edge were three large circular marks pushed into the ground about two feet deep, which they guessed were marks of some sort of landing gear.  In the center was another smaller circle about six to eight feet wide that was burned deep into the ground so that the blackened burned rocks were crumbling.   They got scared and got back on their bikes and came back to the college. They promised us they were not stoned, because of course we accused them of being high, which they hotly denied.  They got pretty mad about it, so I think that was because they were actually scared, but trying not to show it. I just saw my boyfriend again a year ago, and he still remembers it.  He swears they were straight and telling the truth.  He is an honest man and I believe him.   This was only a few years after the Barney Hill episode, which happened not too far from there.   I remember that they were excited and nervous when they got back.  That was in the late spring of 1968.  We are all 65 now.  We were 22 then.   I also remember that we suggested calling the Air Force, but they both said nobody would believe them, and besides that, they weren't sure they could find the place again because there were many logging trails criss-crossing each other.   They just seemed scared and reluctant to say anymore about it.  So we never have, until I found your site this evening.",,,

Maybe it was because a few days earlier we'd also seen something that caught our eye up in the sky. It was just before dusk, and the sky was beginning to darken.  Hovering over the corner of the campus was a glowing object, pale yellow.  It had a shallow convex bottom, and the top was an inverted teacup shape.  For some reason it seemed to be spinning clockwise, while there was a ring of green and red lights that made up a belt where the top and bottom of the object met.  This ring of lights moved in a counter clockwise direction. It just hovered there, maybe about the size of half dollar or dollar coin from our perspective.  I have no idea how high up in the sky it was. We sat in silence and watched this object as we drove past.  When the car turned left at the corner, we watched until it was out of sight.  We then turned to one another to confirm that we both just witnessed the same thing.  Raymond confirmed what he saw, and neither of us thought to mention it to my parents.

A plane passed by and these orbs did not seem to have any forward movement of travel.  We saw one hover in and out of our tree line with a scan of 3 white lights going around it.

Initially we thought it was ome sort of conventional aircraft located around 3/4 mile due North and over a calabasas residential community.  After 90 seconds of observation, it became evident by the two green lights and its unusual movement and lack of sound that it was neither a toy, blimp, airplane or helicoptor.  The object changed direction in 90 and 180 degree angles.  We couldn't tell if it was a very small object a few hundred yards North of us or a larger object several miles from us.  We only know that it was between us and the opposing mountain range which varies from 6 to 20 miles.  Except for noting that the object appear! ed to be South of the halfway line (I.e. nearer us) there's no way to determine its size or exact location. It eventually moved due West (down the valley) and just as it was moving ""out of sight"" being obscured by a wall on the edge of our property, it stopped ""on a dime"" and descended vertically like an elevator.  It covered that western movement in about 30 seconds.  However, where it descended was in the range on the other side.  So either as it moved horizontally due West, it did so with a slightly Northward direction, or it had been further away suggest it was quite large and moving far faster than the maximum allowed by the local Air Traffic Control of 250 mph.

This sighting occurred on Oct. 3, 2013, at 19:40 hours.   I was on my way traveling East on NE Prescott ave in Portland,Or.  I was on my way to a friend’s place on NE 104th. While I was driving I looked towards the east at about a 75 degree angle from Earth.  What I saw at first struck my curiosity due to the shape of these craft and how they seemed to hover slowly above with no sound. I spent 6 years in the US Navy.  I was trained in the field of Electronics Warfare.  In that field I had to be able to identify Air, Sea, Subsurface vessels by silhouette only.  So when I saw what looked like a string of lights hanging down from the sky but they appeared to float slowly over the sky.  What struck me as odd was first the lights how they went down vertical instead of aircraft lights going horizontal across the sky. I at first only saw one that was in front of my vehicle off in the horizon at like I said 75 degree angle from the earth’s surface.  Then to the SE I noticed two more floating about 5000 meters apart.  From my vantage point.  Then they began to move in a counterclockwise movement through the sky like they were surveying the surface because one of them came as low as the Hard deck of 2000 ft. Altitude.  Then I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed another in the West behind me.  Then off to the North was two more for a total of five making what seemed like a continuous motion still lights vertical.  In a counterclockwise movement, one I noticed began to hover over the Airport of Portland or near the I-205 bridge going into Washington state. The lights draped down vertical with first row of lights going down being white, then a second row was red, then a third row was white with a fourth row that was green. What made me question that they couldn’t be planes is how the lights that seemed to be to the front of the vessel.  Would in unison begin with the first row of lights going down then going up while the Red ones went up while the next row of white lights went up as the row of green lights went down as they illuminated.  I saw one as it seemed to begin a turn and the vessel was shaped on the front where the lights were with a sem-circle front that shaped downward with flat like sides. What really was odd about them was how they would move almost like floating then do a maneuver of 180 degree turnaround and head back the opposite direction.  So I called the Police they told me to call UFO Center and the Airport Air Traffic.  So I called the Center first.  Was asked if I had a camera to capture on video?  I had my Windows Phone with a great camera on it for a phone.   So I got off the phone and began taping the incident.  I was able to capture almost 5 minutes of video.  I did not think I was getting it but I did.  So later as I arrived home I called the FAA and they told me that the Police had Cesna 172’s up chasing bad guys.   So I looked them up to see the fuselage shape and lighting.  There is no way these were Cessna 172s.   I am sure after viewing my video coverage you will see what I mean.  Especially the one I caught overhead of my apartment how it moved across the night sky.  When I arrived home I noticed more further up in our atmosphere 10 more just stationary.   I hope this helps the center with their research into this incident.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I just witnessed a very peculiar event in the nighttime sky. At 21:23 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time) on Thursday, October 3, 2013, I was standing outside my home in Harrington, Washington, admiring the stars in a beautifully clear sky, and watching for satellites. Facing generally northeast, I was searching for the Andromeda galaxy, which was located just to the right of Cassiopeia, hoping to be able to discern it without binoculars.  As I was scanning that portion of the sky to the right of the Cassiopeia constellation, my peripheral vision suddenly “alerted” me to the fact that something was taking place above, and to the left of, Cassiopeia, and I quickly focused my attention to that area of the sky.  After shifting my attention, I estimate that I was looking at an azimuth of approximately 25 degrees (true), and approximately 75-80 degrees angle of elevation above the horizontal plane. I immediately noted two very bright lights, each about the size/magnitude of the star, Vega, (located just west of the Cygnus constellation), that were moving slowly from south to north, and were located just “above” the top-most stars of Cassiopeia. Given that I am generally familiar with that area of the sky, I immediately realized that the two objects were not normal celestial bodies.  Moreover, within a second or two of my first noticing the two lights, I quickly realized that the two lights, separated by approximately one half degree of arc (i.e. the diameter of a full moon), were moving slowly; that they were moving “in train”; and that their level of illumination was increasing noticeably, and rapidly. Within a second or two of my first noticing the two objects, the level of illumination of both of them began to diminish noticeably, suggesting to me that the objects might be Iridium satellites.  However, within 2-3 seconds, the illumination of both lights diminished to the degree that neither of them was visible, which was my first hint that the objects probably were not Iridium satellites.  My experience with viewing the “flares” caused by the reflective antenna panels on Iridium satellites is that an Iridium satellite can still be seen, even after its “flare” has diminished to a minimum. I immediately looked at the time on my cell telephone, and noted that it was 21:23 hours (Pacific Daylight Time).  (I later checked the time shown on the cell phone against computer time, and the times were within two seconds of one another.  Consequently, I suspect that the indicated time was accurate.)  Also, within an estimated two minutes of my sighting, I accessed the www.Heavens-Above.com website, in order to determine whether the two objects might have been Iridium satellites.  That website indicated that no Iridium “flares” would have been visible on the date, and at the time of, my sighting. I am baffled by what I have just witnessed.  My suspicion is that the objects were reflective satellites, but I cannot find any reference to visible satellites, in close proximity to one another, for the time and date of the sighting.  I am open to suggestions from anyone who reads this report. I will check with a local astronomy society, in attempt to determine whether any of their members may have been out viewing on this date, and may have been witness to the event.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,47.42069999999999,-118.3997

Slowly moved apart while one remained stationary. At roughly 0:12 on August 15th 2013 I was driving west down Counce Rd. toward Mississippi Hwy. 3, when I slowed down to see if I could pinpoint an odd sound coming from my truck. I rolled the window down to listen for the sound then sped up to see if acceleration had any effect on the noise.   About thirty to forty-five seconds of driving at about 20mph a coyote ran out in front of the truck crossing Counce Rd. headed north causing me to stop.  I watched the coyote run down the embankment and into a field.  He stopped directly next to a telephone pole.  As I was still stopped looking at the coyote I noticed a light that at first I believed was connected to the pole.  About 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon I saw three bright semi-pulsating lights in a triangular formation. My first thought was they were helicopters in a tight formation. Then I considered airplanes taking off from the Memphis airport.  I've lived in Memphis most of my life and am very familiar with the take off/landing patterns of planes as FedEx has their main hub there.  This time of night was about right for the first inbound flights of the night.  I leaned over to the passenger side window and looked back east and could see planes lined up for landing in the distance...their front main white and red blinking tail and wing lights small but clearly visible.  I looked back to the lights still hoovering in the same position and considered that perhaps it was a cellphone tower that was not too far away.  I looked east again and spotted the tower blinking red. At this point I started driving again 20-30mph only taking my eyes off the lights for a few seconds to keep the truck on the road.  This is the Delta, and farms are everywhere. There were no obstruction to my visibility and the lights were situated perfectly above one of the fields.  I was trying to figure out the distance when what I think was a helicopter passed between the two lower light in a downward angled path, thats when I realized they were either huge, or huge and farther away as the helicopter seemed like only a red blinking speck. By this time I had reached the intersection of Counce Rd. and MS HWY 3. My view was obstructed for a second or two as I turned right on to HWY.3.  I considered trying to take video but figured it would look like every other dark and blurry night shots I'd ever seen. Instead I called my friend...it was exactly 0:14.   Right when she answered the bottom right light shot quickly away to the east and stopped...pulsated different colors for a short time...three seconds at most then began to slowly move east until it completely disappeared. It reminded me of someone turning off a flashlight. The top and bottom left lights remained in position until I reached the intersection of HWY 3 and Old Mississippi 304/713 when the top light began to slowly pulsate as the first but did not accelerate, instead it appeared to move slowly north or northeast and disappeared as the first did. Only the bottom left light remained. It did not move. It remained stationary and pulsated as the other two then slowly dimmed and disappeared. I ended the conversation with my friend, and said Id be back shortly. Last night was perfectly clear and cool, odd for mid-August in Mississippi, so the humidity was low as was the haze. It almost felt like fall. Before I returned home I made a loop re-driving my route. At 0:42 I stopped the truck again on Counce Rd., but this time got out. There were still planes lined up for landing, but realized that where I had seen the lights were well southeast of the airport. They were perfectly framed by a horizon of trees, cropland, and stars above. ""I cant ((deleted)) believe this!"" was on continuous replay in my head, and apparently vocally as well.  As my friend related after I returned home, ""You kept repeating their formation, movements, and the pulsating white, blue, and green lights...and I cant ((deleted)) believe this.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

Now my wife and I have seen a number of these objects over the past 2 years so this was not new to us.  We observed this object for about 13 minutes and then it disappeared.

We also noticed that this object was not over land but over the sea so it could not be a cellphone tower or anything of the sort.

We observed one fireball and about 9:33pm that light started blinking again every 3 minutes.

I am 38 years old now and have been troubled for years over what I experienced at the age of 19.  My boyfriend and I parked at a rest area off at I-75 in Lansing, Michigan.  We stopped there to make out, talk, etc.   After being there for about 5 minutes, we suddenly noticed hundreds of iridescent free flying circular clear orbs that came closer and closer to our car.  They seemed to be observing us.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  They came as close as only 10 to 20 feet away from the car.  At that time, I became very afraid and we left the rest area.  As we drove off, we could see them flying back up into the sky as we got back on I-75.   This has been driving me crazy for years now, as I am a very logical and scientific person.  I haven't told very many people of this event because I know most people won't believe me, but still after all these years I think about it at least once a week.  I am glad to finally share my extremely bizarre event that ha! ppened to me.   To this day, I can't find anything on the internet that can relate to my happenings.  Over the years, I have wondered if this could have been a paranormal event rather than an alien experience.  If anyone out there had this happen, please let me know.  I feel so alone with this and will take it to my grave wondering.  I just want to know what this was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While on the return leg of a late evening bicycling trip on a WV state highway through Monongahelia National Forest, I glanced up into a clear blue, cloudless sky to see 5 objects traveling in formation out of the south-west. Shape:  Imagine a ball positioned in front in the direction of travel in super bright neon blue tapering to a point with a length equal to about 3 or 4 times the diameter of the leading ball. In addition, imagine this blue shape surrounded with a slightly larger identical shape in super bright neon green. Had I glanced up one second or two later, I would have missed the sighting due to the tree tops on each side of the road providing only a small section of sky view directly above the road. The objects made no noise and were similar in size, but not all the same traveling about 10 times faster than a jet at high altitude. The next week, a TV show called ""SIGHTINGS"" reported the same sighting out in the western part of the USA. The sighting date year could be 95 or 96. The time of year is correct.

This sighting involved a very bright white flashing lighted object, which displayed multiple colored light blasts before executing a ‘staggered’ clockwise three movement triangle before going into a spinning blur of elliptical clockwise continuing hoops of light and then finally shooting off into the Southeast.  This sequence of maneuvers took a matter of seconds before the UFO streaked off out of sight covering a distance of miles in only a second.   I knew in my heart of hearts right then, that this wasn’t any old weather balloon, Venus or reflections from birds but something much more extravagant and technologically sophisticated altogether. It was an incredible sight to take in and left me with no doubt that I had just observed a technologically advanced object that not only defied our laws of physics but was also most certainly under some form of intelligent control. This entire set of maneuvers took place very quickly and the entire sighting, from first noticing the UFO to its departure was over the period of no more than two minutes. After saying goodnight to my friend, I then began to head for home.  What I had just witnessed was truly, invigoratingly mind-blowing.  This was and could only be visual confirmation of proof of life.  As the clarity of this set in, I was still completely unprepared for what was still to come, only minutes later...for at 5am on my return home, I experienced a second closer range sighting. This second sighting was observed shortly afterwards while I was returning home.  I had been in a hurry to get back to tell my brother what had happened when I spotted another similar UFO which appeared to hovering stationary over the engineering plant very close by on Newlands Road.  The object itself was much closer than my just sighting prior to this and was only several hundred feet away and at a height of no more that 200 to 250ft.   Upon spotting it, I rushed down the street with the sole intention of reaching the house.  I panicked my brother when I burst the door open and yelled for everyone to get outside.  The UFO then began to display various bright light patterns for a moment or two before it grew a bright blinding light which surrounded the craft.  The light then seemed to implode and the UFO was no longer there anymore.  It had simply vanished.  It was a remarkable sight to take in and completely inexplicable.   Reeling after these events, I then telephoned two police stations to inquire if anyone had reported seeing these objects.  I did so out of curiosity in the hope that someone else may have also reported them and was informed that no one had reported anything to either station.   One hour later another UFO sighting was reported to have been observed on the West Coast of America.  The similarity in terms of the movement of this object compared with my sighting is blatantly obvious.

I have an entire armada of different type crafts appear in a short time and it is almost overwhelming!,Zwolle,LA,2002-12-18T17:30:00,other,21:00,"Occurred : 12/18/2002 17:30  (Entered as : 12/18'02 17:30) Reported: 12/18/2002 10:41:37 PM 22:41 Posted: 12/2/2013 Location: Zwolle, LA Shape: Other Duration:21:00",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26692.html,"I have an entire armada of different type crafts appear in a short time and it is almost overwhelming! Tonight has been a most unusual night, since the Geminid began there has been many strange objects of ""starlike"" shape, these star shapes are silver and gold with flashing lights of green, blue and red, for each silver object a gold one is positioned beside it at an equal distance, there are 40 or more of these and as said these have been in the sky since the evening of 12/13/02 and appeared to use ""meteor's"" to seed clouds which they then engulfed.   As of last evening they did not make or abosorb any more clouds, all have been stationary with the exception of 2 of which 1 chased an airplane a few nights ago and last night a gold one raced across the sky and became almost cigar shaped.   Tonight the skys are very cloudy with heavy winds, the waether where I live is strange as few rain storms ever come over because they break and split apart prior, the clouds look like they are pouring into a hole at a place a mile or so away{this is the origination of a strange sighting last Sept}, many funnel clouds have formed and made way to this place, being funnel clouds are very common due to the weather pattern they got noticed tonight for pointing downward when usually they just roll across the sky.  Where they form is to the S-SW and were formed as they usually do across the sky but when approaching the convergence of the Westerly& Southerly winds{cause of weather pattern} the funnels pointed downward, when they reached the converging point an oval light would jet down toward the ground, this happened several times so I began retracing from N-S and was amazed to see these ovals hiding themselves in the funnels near where most of them form, when a funnel appeared to be dispersing the oval would come to the end of the tube/funnel and wait for small dark clouds to get near and then would hide behind them, I saw at least 50 do this, they are about the size of a gymnasium maybe even larger. Once I got an idea of what is happening I began to notice the clouds they hide behind if losing their funnel had distinct shapes, ! I was al most unsure if I could stand it all, some clouds had the shape of a flying V and bigger than the ovals and others triangular and yet some were chevron shaped, I saw 20+ of these. When I began looking thru my binoculars I could see ver faint red/range blue and green dots covring the chevron shaped objects and last Sept. there were hundreds of the red/orange going into the sky, up then as if dancing then across the horizon with equal distance between, they appeared to be the same or similar dots, as well last Sept. the red dots appeared to be fighting with something to resemble a red dragon almost like a phoenix but not quite, the battle happened almost overhead but at once the stars seemingly exploded{may have been the ""starlike"" objects here now but I was'nt paying that much attention then} after a heavy fog covered most of the sky but left open the place from where they came from the ground, after 9/11/01 and this madness going on we contacted the Sheriffs Dept who responded with 4 deputies, most of the red balls were gone but 2 graciously appeared above a dead pine just as the deputies were writing me off as a ""Knut"", they had little to say about and I jokingly stated it probably to be ""Swamp Gas"" then they left, several nights later an octagonal craft came from the south going north{the UFO hole}, it had faint blacklights surrounding the edge but were on the underside, had 2 big lights across the face which resemble a ZZTop album cover and a rectangular set of red lights that would flash differently as if it were some type of communication, this craft is able to hover and move horizontal at great speeds, if I focused my binoculars a bit off te starlike objects could well be similar but the stars would have been made of several of these hex ones, I have several witnesses for each account !!! Back to tonights show, as well as the starlike, the red/orange dots, the chevron, triangular and Vshapes there were smaller ovals but they had a more oblong appearence. The small ovals did not use funnels but seemed to hold white clouds together and move from south to north as did the others, these would sometimes be in small groups of 4 or 5 in the same cloud, they moved on the clouds bottomside and disappeared as did the others. Where the sky breaks the incoming storms approximately 2 miles south I would see a flicker now and then but with all the excitement it took a while to give them much attention, once I focused on them I saw small green, blue and red semi-cigar shapes that would scramble behind the clouds anytime a clear spot appeared, there were too many small dot and semi-cigar shapes to try to count. As of now the event is still happening and while peering out my sliding glass doors a gigantic rounded hexagonal shape with a bulging circle in the center just came over using a dark cloud for concealment. I have an idea that I may be near a centralized location for some sort of being that is capable of technology beyond ours, that uses things from the atmosphere for an unknown purpose, is very diverse and that lives under ground as a large society of sorts as well as occasionally emerging and re-entering for the reason of stockpiling whatever it is they take from the atmosphere/clouds. Apparently they are peaceful enough because I have had nor heard of any encounters with them other than sightings. I also believe I may be in way over my head in trying to unvail any more information alone, where would one begin to look for help ??? I am going to close now and continue observing and will gladly inform you all of anymore findings !",2013-12-02T00:00:00,31.6422,-93.6173

I left work after finishing up on the 2nd shift and stopped to get gas in town.  I remember thinking the weather was pretty clear and comfortable that night.  Probably between 60 to 75 degrees fahrenheit.  I left the gas station and around 1 1/2 miles later I was at a series of sharp curves just prior to entering a wooded area on my road.  As I came around the bend I saw the triangular craft with solid orange orbs at the points and a blinking light in the middle hovering around 50 to 75 ft. over the tops of the trees.  I guess the object was around 100 to 200 ft. long and half as wide.  The appearance of it made me first freeze then my mind began to race.  I stopped my car as soon as possible and was able to prevent myself from being located directly below the object.  Looking up at the underneath of it I was a little afraid and definetly in shock.  What was to happen next as it quickly became clear to me that the technology my eyes were looking at was without a doubt capable of being fatal too me or anything around it.  I also had a slight feeling of lost time.  I was probably sitting in my car with it parked in the middle of the road staring at this craft for about 8 mins., desperately trying to wrap my mind around the dark colored objects underneath on the bottom of it along with the brightness of the orange orbs.  I tried but couldn't recognize any of the ships parts from other mechanical objects i recognize which just continued to startle but later amaze me.  At about the four mins. remaining mark I realized it hovered there and I'd heard entirely no sounds from the ship.  The object was so clearly differently composed from anything I had ever seen before I continued to realize. It wasn't making any noticeable sounds but how?  It should have been impossible for that to be true due to the size of the craft and how close I was located to it I should've heard it.  I then once again tried to recognize any of the objects on the outside underneath of the craft to help me understand how this object cou! ld float there so idly and seemingly effortlessly.  At this point I guess I had been looking at the craft in fear and amazement for about 12 mins. It then moved away and out of my eye sight maneuvering in a ""z"" like pattern incredibly fast and was gone without a trace.

It resembled a fire ball.  They would then have smaller ones that popped out of the first ones. They too would grow in size and resemble the same as the first.

On the morning of Monday, April 22nd I woke up at 2:04 AM to use the bathroom – and this is what I saw:  I live in the mountains just 10 mins from the town of Boulder Colorado.  My house sits on the east face of a mountain which goes down into a small valley and then up again – to a ridge that I see if I look directly east from my home.  This ridge is the first mountain (of the Rocky Mountains) and directly east of it is North Boulder.  I live on what is the second protruding mountain and my home sits across this small valley just a bit higher in altitude than the first ridge. I noticed out of the window a row of colored lights blinking different colors, 5 or 6 of them in a row, and it looked like they were on something that was rotating slowly in a circle.  It traveled slowly from the South East going directly North, up above the ridge of this mountain across the valley from me.   As I looked at it I thought it was a plane at first, or maybe a helicopter.  I became concerned at how close it was flying to the trees and houses, and then suddenly it stopped and just glided back the opposite way.  Then it stopped again and continued the way it was going and by this point it was directly across from my house above the ridge. I could almost make out the shape of it, and at this point I yelled to my husband, “Quick! Come in here! There’s a UFO!” My husband jumped up and ran into the bathroom and just before he arrived the craft went up and down and back and forth one more time but just as he looked out the window it dropped behind the ridge. I told him, “Oh, I can’t believe you missed it! Wait - maybe it will come back up.”  He had stepped into our shower (closer to the window) and was looking down into the valley and he said, “I see it! There are at least 2 of them!”  I stepped in beside him and looked down into the valley and saw that he was looking at 2 little (these are hard to describe) areas of light.  They weren’t orbs or balls of light, but the ground was being lit up – as if from a big flash light or spot light, but there were no beams of light projecting from anywhere, and they were moving faster than any spot light could possibly move.  They circled around a certain area, then a bigger area, it all seemed very random, and then they were gone. My husband never saw the blinking craft - but if not for him; I would have never seen the flashing lights. That’s it, we stared out the window for a while and then tried to go back to sleep.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

A few days after May 31, the release of the movie “After Earth”.  My friend, His Mother, and I were heading back from a local movie theater when we traveled down a back road, we hadn’t been on the road too long before we noticed something catching our eye off to the right of the vehicle, passing the object we paid no mind till breaking in the middle of the lane and reversing  (Please note we were the only ones in the lane or on that certain road)  The driver of the vehicle put it in park before exiting the driver’s side (My friend) His mother and I watch from the passenger seat and the back.  What we saw all of three of describe as;  a bright blinding chrome orb that was sitting stilly at tree top level before moving slowly to the right further across the sky leaving a trail behind it before dissipating into the night.  We had no clue what we had just seen but we all agreed it was not a normal aircraft or an aircraft at all.  We decided to call the local police department to report what we had seen earlier in the evening before feuding to keep it a secret. Over a various of months we had seen the orbs multiple more times it began to scare both my friend and I to the point we didn’t know what to do;  It would do what the first night did. It would move lightly leave a trail and vanish,  Still the same blinding chrome orb, but the freakiness had just began.  My friend and his mother have always lived in the woods, now he’s seen the orbs out there more than twice, but with added affects.  He knows what the sounds of the forest should sound like and look like.  When he steps out of his home late at night he begins to experience strange sounds unlike any he has heard before and has seen figures described as Humanoid, but not quite so.  I on the other hand have not had the “pleasure” of meeting or hearing such creatures, but I have, like him, seen the orbs on multiple occasions. We don’t personally know how to describe the next experience, but I’ll try to.  We don’t know whether to take this a ironic and unrelated dream, but my friend tents to stay with me in my home every now and again because I mostly live alone, one night whilst I was asleep,  He had said he woke up to the light from a street lamp we have in our front yard he moved my curtains to peer out into the yard seeing a sleek, slender, tall man standing motionlessly in the front yard by the lamp,  He said he closed the curtains before returning to peer again the creature closer than before,  He repeated the process till the creature was peering in back at him, he said he tried to wake me to no avail. Ironically he said it stared till day light which is when he “woke up”.  The creature’s facial features where described as boney thin very pale and solid black eyes. The most recent and most creepy and most disturbing one Friday, October 4, 2013 at 3:30am my friend had went outside by our pool to smoke before rushing back in calling my name and calling me outside I casually walk outside to seem him shaking almost dropping his cigarette and pale as a ghost he said he was looking to the stars before seeing a formation over the home that he had not noticed before he was shocked to see that he recognized the “stars” to be the orbs we’ve seen before but in a triangular formation and not emitting a trail as before.  He told me that it had hovered over the home for a few minutes before moving over our pond silently (At tree level) before disappearing and as this was happing he heard nothing it was completely silent till it disappeared.

Impressed by how vivid this fireball was, I shortly put it out of my mind. At around 20:00 I had stepped outside of my westside Albuquerque home to have a cigarette and load items into the car for a weekend trip to Canjilon, NM.  Catching motion out of the corner of my eye, I glanced at the western sky and observed numerous shimmering balls of light crossing rapidly from northwest to southeast.  I promptly ran inside and called for my fiancee to step out as well in order that she could verify what I was observing.  I also retrieved my 60 power spotting scope.  She stepped out with me and we watched in amazement as these objects continued to stream across the sky.  Using my spotting scope, I was able to track one of these objects and was surprised to discover that the scope did not magnify it nearly as much as I would have expected.  I take this to mean that the objects were further away than my initial estimate.  The object I observed with the scope was circular, and while it appeared a bluish white to the naked eye, it seemed to be like a disco ba! ll-shimmering in many different colors.  I put the scope down and continued to observe with the naked eye until all of them had passed.  There was little if any noise from these objects aside from a faint ""muttering"" rumble.  Their movement was erratic and uncoordinated, with some of them traveling faster, and taking wavering paths, but all generally to the southeast.    They traveled very quickly-seemingly three times as fast as I would expect an aircraft to move at the same distance.  They  passed in three groups, with the majority of the objects comprising the lead group-almost reminiscent of the way race cars move about on a track.  I considered taking photographs or video, but considering the apparent size of the objects, their velocity, and the state of darkness at that time of night, video would have been inconclusive and photographs would have been nearly impossible.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

I was looking at the Stars, as I do sometimes at Night. It was about 6AM early Saturday Morning. I was up, about to go to Sleep. I looked outside a North Window, looking NW. There was a Plane, with the Red & Green Markers heading towards Indy. And then, I noticed something strange:  Just further to the North, there was a Tiny, very dim object moving South. I was very faint, and I could just tell it was White to Light-Grey in Color. At first, I watched it, expecting it to have some Blinking-Lights as all Aircraft do. And yet, it never did flash even Once! I went over to a West Window, to keep it in view. It became even more faint, increasing in Altitude as it traveled further South. It suddenly vanished for a second, and the reappeared, possibly leaving the Atmosphere. And then something very astonishing happened: The object reappeared slightly for a fraction of a second, then disappeared entirely. At that point, a very faint streak of greenish-white light appeared ahead of where the object was moving toward. Sort of like how a Space Ship goes to light-speed in Science-Fiction shows. I continued to search for signs of the object further in the sky. I couldn't find anything. I was in shock of what I saw, not because it's impossible, but because I have never seen anything like it in the Skies. I shed a tear, and something came to mind as a Thought just appeared in my head. That they know what is happening to our Planet. I have been watching the Skies for years, and know allot about Astronomy. I have seen many Fireballs, which are basically Meteors on fire. I know the difference from a Star, and a moving object. I know that Aircraft have Lights, and that they Flash repeatedly. I have seen Helicopters, which appear not to flash until they pass a certain point in the Sky. What I saw not only didn't flash, but it wasn't lit-up at all. And it was much fainter than anything I've ever witnessed in the night skies. This could have been a Spacecraft launched from Earth [Manned], or a craft not from this world. Being that this came from far North of Indianapolis, there is no launch-site for manned rockets around Northern Indiana. Not even Michigan. Maybe Canada? Because I cannot Identify this as a Known Aircraft or Meteor/Fireball, I must report this as a UFO. And the very FIRST one I have seen in my entire life.  *I would like to add, that nobody was around at the time I witnessed this. There was no Traffic in my neighborhood, no one walking around outside. I seemed as if this would be the perfect time for such an object or craft to be high in the atmosphere. Perfect, so that it had the least chance of being caught. I realized this, and I knew I was the only one up. Early Saturday morning, after every business including Bars & Clubs are closed, would be the perfect time to have something like this in the sky. It was faint enough, that if someone was driving, they wouldn't see it. *Also - This Object did NOT leave a visible trail, but it DID leave a faint Streak after it vanished for a brief moment. This streak was only visible for a split-second, then disappeared.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,39.9831,-86.2876

Birmingham, AL area At around 19:45 central time I and my family were getting into our car preparing to go home after visiting my parents.  I looked up and noticed a dim light that seemed to just be a high flying plane traveling northbound; but the object suddenly changed directions southbound. It did not turn it just changed direction from north to south.  When I saw this I called my wife and parents over to see what I was seeing.  As they were coming to see I turned on the video camera on my phone and began recording. After the initial light several more appeared; up to 8 or 9 at one point. T hese lights were dim and looked like stars. They sped up and slowed down and made erratic course changes.  Many times they traveled in a circular course; then would shoot off in a strait line.  These objects would also in 2s or 3s travel toward a common point and when they reached the common point (all at the same time) they would all change direction away from each other. Several times while watching these objects a plane would fly through the area of the sky where these objects were performing their maneuvers.  When a plane would fly through the area the objects in front of the planes would quickly move away to the side and then change course and follow the plane.  This happened at least 10 times.  On one occasion I watched one object come up behind a plane for maybe 2 seconds, then moved beside the plane for maybe another 2 seconds and then speed around in front of the plane and quickly move off to the north. 	At around 20:10 my wife, daughter and I drove up the road to see if we could see the objects better from another location.  After arriving at a local Arbys and getting a few sodas we looked in the direction of the objects and were not able to see them.  We then returned to my parent’s home where we could once again see the objects. 	At 23:50 hours I reluctantly decided to return to my home so my wife and child could get some sleep. At this time there were still a few of the objects still flying around. I have to add that I have never seen anything like these objects nor had my wife or parents. I made 3 videos on my phone; they are not very good quality and are shaky, but they do show some of the lights and maybe they can be of some use.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,33.7061,-86.8238

Had been working at my computer until then. As I looked over the Alberni Inlet, I noticed a large, slow moving light in the Western sky, somewhat to the South.  Approximately opposite the APD mill.   It was too big and not bright enough to be a planet or star, too slow moving to be a normal aircraft.  It slowly moved towards the tree line, looked like it was just above the trees.  I realized it was exceptionally unusual and I should get my camera.  I ran in and grabbed my camera and came out and shot about half a dozen pictures.  None are that clear, but by zooming in on the computer I could see a perfectly round object with raised markings on the bottom:  ridges and indentations going in a circle………….almost like a “copyright” seal.

This was the third night in a row that I had been out because of what I had seen two nights ago.  The weather was totally overcast and dead calm, but there was sufficient moonlight to see the horizon of the entire Gulf of Mexico.   The moon was almost half full and high in the sky when I first arrived.  At approximately 9:45 a dim yellowish light appeared on the horizon just a little west/seaward of where I previously had seen the football shaped craft on previous nights.  I then got it in view with my binoculars and again saw two of the whitish-gold craft, side by side, right on the horizon at the water’s surface.  I think that they could have possibly come out of the water based on what I previously seen, except that these objects were fully formed – I did not see the little ‘blob” of light get bigger and turn into the craft like I’d previously seen.  I watched these objects for a short while as they pretty much stayed in place before disappearing.  At 10:13 p.m. I saw to the NNW of me, in the same area that the previous nights UFO’s appeared, a brilliant, “crystalline,” green-blue, flashing light, about the size of a pea at arms length.  It was no more than 4 or 5 miles away from me, well inside of the horizon.  It would come on for a short second, go off for a short second, etc. 5 to 7 times each time it came on.  It would stay off for perhaps a minute or two before coming back on.  After the first 4 or 5 times that it came on, it started slowly getting dimmer, and then I realized that it was moving way from me, just west of NNW, at an angle out to sea.  I watched this object for about 20 minutes before the !#@#%! Sand flies drove me off the beach.  I quickly went home across the street, soaked myself in OFF, and went back to my location.  By this time, 10:40, the light had turned mostly white with a bit of green in, and was barely visible with the naked eye.  It was still within the horizon though, close to 7 miles away.  I was watching it with my binoculars when the flashing became a consistent on and off, in a strange way.  It would take a long second to come on to the brightness that it would get, like on a slow dimmer switch, and then go off like a switch was thrown.  stay  I was somewhat, and the thought that came to mind was that it was “struggling, huffing and puffing,” getting to where it was just visible with my binocs.  Then, and this was scary, it brightened one last time and stayed on for a full second, and “shot” what looked like a short beam of light, or the light from some kind of a projectile, nearly straigh! t up in the air!  The section of “light beam” that I saw was maybe 60 to 80 feet long, perhaps even longer, as it was some distance away.  I guess it resembled the flash that comes out of the muzzle of a gun.  With 0 degrees being straight up, I would say that this short “beam flash” was at 10 degrees off of vertical, and toward the NW.  It seemed like the flash was going away from me and to the left a bit – it was very clearly defined.  I heard no sounds and it rather shocked and scared me when this happened.  I saw nothing else for about 10 minutes and I was glad to go home.  I’ve been lucky enough to see some really strange things out here, and even seeing a “normal” UFO seems like it would have been better that this.  I have absolutely no clue as to what it was that I was watching, especially considering that it changed colors and changed its rate of pulsations.  To think that it may have shot something up in the air just frightens me.  While writing this report, and after having thought about it for a while, the color of this light was greener than the blue-green light I had filed in “Sighting #9” for July 12, 2013.  FOOTNOTE:  I went back out the following night from 9:15 to 11:00 p.m. and saw nothing at all.  I got rained out the following two nights, and the next report, #27, brings my reporting up to date.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

I was sitting on our back deck with dinner party guests.  Home is located in Fauntleroy Woods.  Member of group said “What is that”?  All looked to the south over the tops of 100’ plus cedars in the neighborhood.  We saw what appeared to be a small object with red and green lights.  They were very bright and similar to LEDs based on past observations I have made of these types of light sources.  The lights appeared to be arranged in a tight square, two green and two red. Craft came up over the trees and hovered.  After approximately 5 seconds, it started accelerating to the NW until it was no longer viewable, due to the heights of nearby trees.  Our viewable horizon in that direction is approximately 60 degrees and above, essentially a circle of trees. It was clear to all viewing that this was not an airplane, satellite, or helicopter as there was no audible propulsion sound. Night was dead still with no wind.  We see air traffic daily as we are on the flight path for Boeing field (E to W, W to E) personal/private craft and are quite familiar with the sound and sights of such vehicles. The movement of the object definitely appeared to be “controlled” somehow.  Because of the low light it was impossible to judge size or distance but I would guess it was flying above Barton Ave, or the Fauntlee Hills neighborhood.  Holding one’s thumb out at arm’s length would have obscured it from view. Our guess was it was some sort of a remote controlled quad copter.  But it did have bright lights and was at a high altitude, 500’ at least.  I am aware that Li-ON power packs are able to illuminate LED light strips and have a friend who does so with radio controlled planes that he flies in North Bend, WA. We saw one satellite that night and it took the predictable E to W path in a straight line.  It definitely was not the same type of object. About one hour later we saw an extremely bright meteor.  It entered atmosphere directly above us and burned up in bright white light heading due south towards Burien/Tacoma.  It actually left a contrail which I have never seen before in person.  No sonic boom was heard.  That was amazing!  The hover, then transition to forward motion, colors, and absence of sound was what bothered everyone.

After exiting I-90 at Clague Rd in suburban Westlake and then turning south onto Clague, I noticed what appeared to be a pattern of perhaps a dozen or so white lights that I initially thought was 'strung out' (perhaps 100 - 200 feet high?) over the rear (eastward) portion of the Crown Water Filtration plant on Clague Rd. At first, I thought the lights were stationary and perhaps were somehow 'hung up' as part of some event on a Saturday night. While driving south on Clague, I kept looking to the left (east) above the water plant to see if I could locate the origin, on the ground, of the lights. Not seeing that origin on the ground as I expected when I reached the intersection of Detroit Rd (0.3 mile sound of I-90), my curiosity got the best of me and I turned left (east) onto Detroit Rd. and drove about 0.4 mile eastward on Detroit until I seemed to be pretty directly underneath the lights. I pulled over at Hamlet Lane (a ""Private Drive"" for, presumably, condominiums), got out of the car, and looked up directly over my head.  It was only a few seconds before that point that I realized the lights were not stationary or somehow 'anchored' to the ground, but were in fact, moving! They were traveling from a due-South to due-North direction out over Lake Erie (the southern edge of which is about 0.8 miles due-North of my position). And these lights kept appearing from the south (over the treetops) and flying directly over my head. It's obviously difficult to estimate their altitude, but my best guess would be in the range of perhaps 500 - 1000 ft over my head (although it certainly could have been upwards to 2000 feet in altitude?). At first, I wondered if it was just a whole bunch of helicopters flying in some sort of loose formation (like some sort of squadron), or perhaps small private planes, but they were completely silent! I mean, they did not make ANY sound whatsoever, at least, that I could hear.  I could not make out any actual aircraft, but saw only a white light encircling the presumed craft. Also, they were not traveling very fast, though speed too is difficult to estimate, but it appeared to be a fairly leisurely pace (possibly lees than 100 mph?). From the time I noticed a light in the south appear above the treetops travel north out over Lake Erie, was at least a full minute (or maybe closer to 2 minutes?). But as they flew (or more like, 'drifted') North of my position, there was a considerably larger break in the treetops enabling me to see a considerably larger portion of the sky.  Although I didn't actually count the number of lights I saw in the sky, over the course of this approximate 4-7(?) minute sighting, I saw what seemed to me like literally DOZENS of lights in the sky north of my position! Perhaps 3-4 dozen at a minimum, or maybe even more than that?!  Fearing that I might be blocking the ""private"" condo drive with my car when another car pulled in the drive, I got back in my car and drove a couple hundred feet or so west on Detroit, but not before hearing the occupant of the car that had pulled into Hamlet Lane make a brief comment about seeing the lights also and wondering what they were.  Next, I pulled over at the corner of Clubside Drive and Detroit, got out of the car again, and continued to watch as these lights kept appearing in the  southern sky over the treetops, and slowly fly due north. I then heard another car that was pulling into another driveway make a remark to another occupant in the same car, about seeing the lights and wondering what they might be. I replied to them that there were a whole slew of lights flying northward that were completely silent.  I got back in my car, drove west on Detroit, and pulled into the Detroit Rd entrance for the Crown Water Filtration plant observed the lights in the northern sky for another 30 - 60 seconds. Then turning back onto Detroit, I turned left (south) onto Clague to resume my drive home. After turning back onto Clague, I saw only 1 or 2 more lights out of my driver's window over the treetops in the east. Then they ceased. I kept looking for more out my window as I continued driving south on Clague back home, but din't see anymore.  A couple minutes later it dawned on me that I should have used the 2 megapixel camera on my phone to try to record what I saw (though there's no guarantee that my 3 year-old non-Smart phone would've been able to capture any images in true dark). Damn!  But for several minutes last night, I most definitely saw a few dozen, low-altitude lights flying silently in a loose formation in a south-to-north direction out over Lake Erie.  For the record, I was not intoxicated in any way (I'm on Methotrexate for arthritis and thus cannot drink at all), and I do not take any mood- or conscious-altering medications whatsoever. While not initially knowing what I was seeing, I did feel somewhat confused, bewildered, or disoriented at what I was seeing. But there's no mistaking - even remotely - that I did in fact, see a whole shitload of UFO's! And although I've once or twice in the distant past seen a solitary, very distant (star-like) light in the sky that might (???) have moved back-and-forth in an 'un-airplane-like fashion) - to which I could not swear - this was as obvious as getting hit in the face with a sledge hammer. I most definitely saw this - I was not hallucinating at all.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,41.4553,-81.9179

As soon I get outside, I noticed 5 lights total, 4 red/orange lights forming a triangle, hovering and silent.  The 5th light was a separate object and moving just next to the triangular craft.   My wife said 2 other objects flew off in the first few minutes before I got outside.  I think there were 4 craft total.  I would guess they were less than a mile away, to the southwest and approximately 500-2000 feet altitude.  If you held your hand up to the sky and made a V with your 2 fingers, that's about how big the triangular craft was.   What I noticed about the color of the lights is that technically they were not red/orange.  They were orange one second and red the next.  It would change between the 2 colors but I can see how people would just say reddish orange. My wife kept asking me over and over - ""Are these UFO's"" and after about 5 minutes, the 4 lights making up the triangular craft went into a bit a dance for about 2 seconds and formed into a single red and orange light now.

They asked that if anyone should see any of these to report them using your online reporting system.  I actually have two reports, but I am going to file them as one because they are related and may help to add a little new light to this subject.  My forts sighting was reported to mufon and they concluded it was a real sighting.  As in there were no natural explanation.  The second sighting (which is the most important) happened the following summer when I got to see an orange light up close.  So did he rest of my family. The first sighting It was Halloween 2011.  Almost exactly around midnight.  I was watching "" the ring"" while laying in my bed.  I had blue shades over my window.  Through the cracks in the shade I see an orange light shining through.  It registered in my mind as one the the neighbors outside night lights.  What we call pole lights.  About 5 seconds later it hit me like a smack to the face that I can't see the nieghbors pole light while lying in my bed.   Because of the angle.  That is also the best way I can describe the color.  The color of an orange pole light.  So.  Jump up on my bed and look through the shades and I see an orange light slowly going across the sky in an easterly direction. I jump off the bed and run through the hallway and stub my toe.  I trip and finally make it to the living room.  I try to open the door but I'm excited and I forget it is locked.  All this took maybe 5 to 10 more seconds. I finally get outside to watch this orange light fly off to the east. I reported it to mufon and took pics of my shade and my neighbors pole light shining through the shade and pics of where the UFO flew off to the east and marked its path with dots.   Now to move on to the more important one. The second sighting:  This occurred the following summer in 2012, I don't remember the exact day or time.  I didn't report it to mufon but I sent an email about it to a friend who works for mufon.  It was a little after the edge of dark.  Off to the east in exactly the same place the first light flew off into I see three light .  Two white lights and one orange light in the middle.  It was almost literally scraping the hill tops.  I don't want to say it flew...  It was more like floating.  It was well below radar and it was huge. I can not stress that enough. Huge!!.  It was flying so slow that I realized I had enough time to get the rest of my family outside to see it.  So I run upstairs and get my aunt and my cousin outside to see it. As it flew over it was 8 white lights in a rectangular formation kind of like a giant wing.  It had one bright orange light in the center of these 8 white lights.  As it flew over it never made a sound.  It was really close.  It occurred to me that the orange light was the se color and brightness of the one I had seen the previous Halloween.  I'm sure it's not to much trouble to turn off the 8 white ones and you have an Amber UFO. As it passed over top of us and out house two smaller Cessna type planes actually flew over top to this UFO at a much higher altitude.  I could hear the faint sound of the cars as way off. It was amazing that here this was flying over us and there they were flying over it. I must stress these points.  It was huge.  It was almost literally scraping the hill tops, it was flying below radar, it never made a sound, it flew extremely slow, I believe it to be one craft and related to the amber and orange lights, and if it was a plane then it was flying illegally with none of the right beacon lights it should have had. My uncle and his friend were on there way home from playing music and they saw it fly over top of their car. It flew right down the road in a westerly direction.  The number of witnesses to this are 5 that I know of.  I think this is important to the orange lights and I wonder if anyone has seen anything similar to what I saw.  I'm sorry I can't remember the exact date it happened a do should have reported it right then.  But I was one of afraid to. I will next time ..  If their is a next time.  I haven't seen then since.  My first sighting was a little dull but that only words I can find to describe the second is ........ Awesome.",2013-12-02T00:00:00,,

In the Eastern sky over Lathrop CA and headed toward Manteca CA the next city over, there were about 8-10 red lights in formation floating in the sky.

I was standing out siding on our balcony by myself smoking a cigarette.  To my amazement, (as I actually said ""whoa"" out loud), two glowing red-orange orbs of light shot across the sky.  Our place is facing South, so, these objects flew in from the Southwest due North. These two objects flew in a perfectly horizontal path.  They flew in a staggered formation with one appearing to be above the other, but slightly in front.  These objects left no trail like a meteor would.  The light was a constant self emitted warm orange glow with sharp edges.  The objects raced across the sky with incredible speed.  It took probably no more than 3 seconds to cover the extent of my view in the horizon before they flew behind our home and out of site.  These were no meteors.  They appeared to be intelligently controlled.  The best way to describe the size of the objects in the sky would be to say if you held a lit cigarette as far from your face as possible in the dark against the sky, that little orange glow is about the size of the two objects seen racing across the sky.

It travelled  in a  south-westerly direction at a steady speed and trajectory.  It did not look like a plane or helicopter.   I couldn't work out what it was, so I opened my car window to check for sound.  I could not detect any sound.  The object passed directly across the base of a cloud that was backlit by the moon.   I searched closely to see whether there was some outline to the object apart from the light, but no other shape was observable apart from the round glowing light which was distinct and had a sort of substance to it.  I was trying to figure out how large it was, and looking around for a comparable object I saw a planet  showing large in a clear patch of sky a little behind me.   The object I observed was relatively at least 2 times larger, probably mo! re.  Later calculations estimated the size of the object to be approx. 2m diameter (2min arc).   The object travelled in one direction with no alterations to trajectory.  Visible for about 20 seconds before disappearing in a cloud ahead and to the right of me.

Dogs were barking like usual suddenly they stopped it was dead quiet and we heard a noise outside not like a plane or helicopter sound very hard to describe the sound.  We got up and tried to look out our window we couldn't see anything so we went out back and looked at the sky.. We didn't see anything right up above even though the sound sounded like it was above or very close to the house.  We looked to our left and down the street.  We saw the UFO hovering near the next street over near the street light.  It was very bright.  The light coming from it was white.   It hovered there for a good 2 minutes.  We had it on video but the phone it was on was stolen sadly. The weirdest thing was how fast it disappeared.  It went faster than the speed of light it was gone within a blink of an eye.  I have never seen or heard a sound like that ever before.   After I watched the video and the way it hovered was like nothing I know of that the USA or anyone has invented.

Hello I stumbled across your website through google.  I wanted to report a strange “star” that for the past 2 months has been appearing in the night sky of Dallas. Its Coordinates is 215 DEGREES southwest of the southeast Dallas sky.  It is easily seen as it is commonly brighter than the North star. This strange light sometimes becomes dim like most stars, but for the most part it is unusually brighter than most of them. It just recently appeared as I said above about 2 months ago. It is sometimes seen higher in the sky or lower by a few degrees even after the upward or downward shift it sits stationary, and certain nights its always near the same area of coordinates given above.  It is currently 11/29/2013 19:52hrs and it disappeared but the times it does vanish varies, it normally appears everyday around 17:30-19:30hrs approximately. I don’t know what it could be, I assumed at first that it was one of our planets, as was reported that during this year we would see Venus, but later dismissed that assumption after finding out Venus would only be visible for a few nights. This “star” as I call it, it sometimes glows an orange tint kind of like Mars would when looking at it with the naked eye.  When looking at this “star” with the naked eye in its brightest stage it begins to look as if it glows a little. I'm sure this might just be due to the human eye and how it works, but I have a feeling it is something else.  I do believe it is a UFO as I cannot identify it, but I also do not have a telescope to see this marvelous site. This is all the info I can give if you have any further information on this incredible ""star""  please contact me at ((e-address deleted)).com  Thank you, and have a good night!

He positioned the binoculars on the railing of the porch and took a look.  The lights were rotating around, the object was spinning.  Then a small light began to drip (Like melting wax on a candle) a singular droplet of light started to descend to the tree line. It moved so very slowly.  Slow like 1/10 the speed of a feather falling  When it reached the level of about half the height of the trees trunks height it zoomed to the west.  Still visible the light flickered as it passed between the trees.  Then another began to fall from the ship, as slow and steady as the last. They looked like white glowing orbs.   The size of baseballs to me.  Then the lights shot through the trees in many directions, before returning back to! being beneath the big rotating lights, which had been steadily moving North (the size of 2 basketballs).  This continued until I had visually counted 6, my husband watching along side me. Then just as they had descended, like rewind but very very slowly the lights ascended back to the bright rotating lights. When the last white glowing orb was absorbed the entire thing vanished. This lasted over 20 minutes. We called a friend to see if he could see it or come to watch from our house because the view was so astonishing. We were on the phone with him almost the entire time. Then about 30 minutes later we stepped back out to see if it was back, and we watched what we thought was possibly a satellite move slowly over the house, but just as my husband was explaining why he thought this was a satellite it swerved very quickly and vanished.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,44.6012,-123.892

Some were the white slowly blinking lights, others were tiny ones off in the distance moving at a rapid speed, and others were flashing red, purple, blue, and white lights, and moving slowly.  I’m talking 10, 20 UFO’s in the sky ALL AT ONCE. I kept thinking, at first, that they were planes, but it’s impossible that so many planes were in the sky all at once, and each plane having different light patterns. The most intriguing ones were the red, purple, blue, and white lights because they were flashing horizontally and the lights were flashing one after the other, so it wasn’t just one big flash.  This was going on everywhere! Everywhere in the sky I then noticed what looked like military aircraft in the sky.  My theory is that if these were in fact alien aircraft the military were trying to divert them and basically “shoo” them away.  OR they were trying to disguise the UFO so that people wouldn’t panic.  This was surreal. I can’t believe what I and so many people in the city of Manassas witnessed. The only reason I am afraid is because I feel that maybe if it was Alien aircraft they were trying to warn us or tell us something OR they were planning an attack.  Either or, Idk, these are just all the thoughts running through my head. I think telling others around would be a bad idea, because they panic so I’ve decided that I would not.  But reporting it here is best, in case someone is trying to investigate. At one point, one aircraft was right on top of the other.

They use a type of L.E.D. spotlight which illuminates the clouds causing an illusion that the light is coming from behind the clouds.  They also put off very little, if any beam.  L.E.D. lights have a very long range, so they can appear to be moving several miles very quickly.  These particular lights can be seen on most Friday and Saturday nights when it is cloudy.  They are visable anywhere from Brooklyn to almost the South Bronx. Sorry!  I was quite perplexed myself at first.  I was a little Bummed when I found out.

It was a clear, cloudless, starry night perfect for observing the night sky.   We went out front to the driveway which is facing south, and began looking at the stars when my husband noticed a small bluish-white star-like light moving slowly and noiselessly SE.  He alerted me to it and my mind automatically thought “it’s a plane,” but also that it was strange that it was flying so low, close to the dark outline of treetops behind the neighbor’s field.   It moved behind a tall tree and we couldn’t see it anymore, so we moved a small distance west up the street to try and see it but still was not able, so we walked east back down the street.  It slowly came out to a clearing to the west of the tall tree making short, jumpy movements, like stop, go, stop, go, heading towards another outline of clustered trees.   It, still moving west, went behind those trees where we could not see, so again, we moved west trying to follow and a few seconds later, it flashed a bluish-white light through the trees at us and started moving back eastward past the trees and over the clearing (by this time we were running back east to follow it) toward the tall tree again, still making short, jumpy movements.   It went behind the tall tree again (we are now facing the tall tree) and that’s when I saw it flash its bluish-white light even brighter (almost flashlight-like) right through the tree at us!  It moved east of the tree slowly, staying really low to the treetops of the line of trees next to it.  It stopped suddenly and hovered for a few seconds right over the treetops.  Then, all of a sudden I see it drop straight downward below the treetops where I could not see.  It disappeared for what seemed like a few minuets but every once in a while, I could see the bluish-white light peeking up around and through the treetops almost as if it was trying to play “peek-a-boo” with my husband and I, moving left a! nd right , up to the treetops and back down again, in a slow fashion.  As it was doing this, I also noticed a small red light on the object’s left/east side that would sporadically blink, not in any fashion similar to our commercial aircraft.  It then rose straight up over the treetops and began to change shape and colors changing from its original bluish-white light to blue to red and back to bluish-white light, its little left/east side red light flashing, it moved up, down, east, west in such unpredictable movements, going back westward toward the tall tree.  It went behind the tall tree still changing color and shape and came out to the west of it into the clearing, and right next to the west of the tree made a diamond-like shape pattern going east, down, west, up, and back to its eastern starting point slowly turning into a big yellow-golden glowing triangular shaped star-like light object that slowly moved into the middle of the clearing growing bigger and brighter, hovering there right in front of us.  While hovering, we got to better observe the object.  Overall, it had a yellow-gold light.  The shape of the object was triangular (point up) with a glowing golden light in the center.  There were three golden triangular shaped lights shining from the two sides and bottom of the object.  On the left/east side of the object, right underneath the glowing light, was the erratically flashing red light I saw from earlier. But its shape and size changed also.  This time I saw that it had a big red light and right underneath that light was a smaller red light.  Hovering there in the clearing, it glowed big and bright and constantly flashed its red lights at us.  We were directly in front of it.   After hovering in the clearing for what seemed like minutes upon minuets, the object slightly turned facing its red lights right at us, and started moving westward again at a leisurely pace toward a large tree that it disappeared behind.   My husband and I ran westward back up! the street to see if we could see it again, but it was gone.  It was 1 0:05pm (22:05) when the object left, making the duration of our experience around 15 minuets total. The whole time my husband and I were exclaiming things like “Whoa!?!”, “What?!?”, “Wow!?!”, “Oh my gosh!?!” when it was star-like and making unpredictable movements and changing colors and speeds.   After it changed its shape and color to a triangular golden light object we still were exclaiming as described above, but then I heard my husband say (almost in a trance-like but still fully aware state) “It’s so beautiful!” to which I responded in a similar fashion “It’s angelic”.  But when I heard my husband say that and after I responded to him, a feeling of emptiness and despair came over me.  I felt like the object was something malicious trying to trick our minds.  My husband seemed to experience a bodily reaction at the time of the sighting.  He started shaking and breathing heavily and exclaiming.  I was in such bewilderment and shock at what I was seeing (trying to keep myself together), but it was most definitely like NOTHING I have EVER seen in the sky before and it was UNMISTAKABLY, UNDOUBTEDLY, something that is not of this world.

On the night of October 4, 2013 around 9:50pm, my wife and I decided to go look at the stars. We were in front of my parents house in Salem, Oregon facing south.  The sky was very clear that night and, after a minute or two I spotted something that at first I thought might have been a far off plane.  It came out from behind a group of trees that was SW of us flying at a very low altitude (the object was parallel with the tops of the trees), and heading East at a very slow pace.  I was confused because it was low flying, slow and noiseless, so I alerted my wife to it and she immediately noticed it also.  We were observing what appeared to be a small bluish-white light with the occasional blink of red light that seemed to be too off tempo to be a planes.  After a minute or so, it finally went behind a larger tree that is taller than the others around it.  Interestingly, I noticed that before it reached the tree it changed direction  going slightly up.  Then, as it wa! s behind the tree, it changed course completely and was now going West with jumpy, erratic movements.  Almost like it was caught on a fishing line and was getting reeled in, at first fast then slow, then almost motionless all the while with an occasional blink of red. This startled me and I exclaimed out loud to my wife and myself.  Ending up behind the same group of trees that I originally first saw it fly out of, it then changed course again coming back out of the trees going east.  At that moment, it was Very bright and shone through the trees whitish light.  Coming into the clearing, it was clearly visible with a star-like shining white-blue light that was glinting off of a dark shape.  The light was brightest on the right side and on the left is where the red blinking light was located.  Finally, with the same unpredictable skip-like movements, it flew behind the tall tree and at that time shone a very bright white light right through the tree at us that illuminated the area.  This made us booth exclaim aloud and as we watched it, it smoothly came out of the other side of the tree, hovering east parallel to the smaller treetops.   It slowly moved east then seemed to stop and descend behind the trees where we lost sight of it for a minute. We knew it was there and shortly later we caught sight of it moving just below the tree tops, kind of going up and down. It was like it was playing hide and seek with us and it made awkward movements right above the trees, going side to side and up and down. Ascending slowly into the sky, it made all sorts of movements, going in all directions. At this time it was clearly visible and I tried desperately to make out what it looked like. It was like a blue-white arrowhead shaped light that was very radiant and star-like. The light it produce seemed to be bouncing off of its own shape on all sides, especially on the right which was clearly arch-like, and the bottom. Now it started slowly moving west, growing in brightness and gaining a clearly defined central triangular light. Going b! ehind the tall tree, it moved in an unexplainable pattern and then slowed dramatically. At this point, I was very shaken up and when I saw it moving around I was like a frightened animal shaking in fear. It was just beyond the tall tree and what amazed me is that it changed from the white light I was seeing to an incredible golden radiance. It stood almost motionless and seemed to be growing much more radiant than before. The shape looked exactly like an angel. Continually moving west, it seemed to turn slightly and stop. That is when we saw something extraordinary. It now had a translucent golden arrow-head shape encompassing the central light and two constant red lights on its left side, one atop the other. The central light was brilliant golden with the same arrowhead shape and light coming from all sides. Then moving west at a quicker pace, I noticed that the central light could have been three lights grouping together in a triad formation right before it disappeared be! hind a large group of trees and we lost sight of it for good. 	I watched this object the entire time it was in view, never taking my eyes from it. In the beginning of the encounter, I had thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me but as I continued to watch, I knew my eyes were fine and I was witnessing something incredible. I was amazed and astounded at what I had seen and exclaimed a lot during the event. Its magnificent star-like radiance left me awestruck. By the time it was leaving, it was large, bright and obvious in the sky, and the golden triangle that surrounded it was very clearly defined. The way this object moved is absolutely unexplainable and confirmed to me that it was definitely not one of our typical aircraft. The event lasted about 15 minutes.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,44.9412471106758,-123.00423516160626

All were the same size, amber in color and steady – no blinking or flashing. 	The lowest was about 20&#730; above the horizon and appeared to be moving toward us and descending like a plane approaching for landing.  Above it and about 2&#730; to the left and at approximately 50&#730; above the horizon was the second orb.  It was completely motionless.  Directly above it was the third orb at approximately 65&#730; over the horizon.  It was also motionless. 	After watching them for about three minutes, the highest orb made a steep and rapid ascent away from us and quickly went out of sight.  Immediately the second orb did exactly the same thing and disappeared at the same point. 	The lowest orb that appeared to be moving toward us in a descent like a landing aircraft instantly headed the opposite direction away from us.  It made a steep and rapid ascent using the same path as the previous two orbs.  However, on its ascent it appeared to make a few corkscrew or wiggling movements on its otherwise straight ascent.  It disappeared at the same point as the others. 	It was a mostly clear and moonlit night with some areas of haze.  I don’t know if they flew out of sight or if they became obscured in a patch of haze. 	Their size and form are difficult to describe.  They were about twice as large as Venus (although not nearly as bright) on a near pass.  However, they were too small to be able to discern any form other than spherical.  The amber lights did not shimmer, blink, flash nor gain or lose intensity.  They weren’t brilliant or faint – they were about a medium intensity.

Same as many other UFO video and sightings. Have pictures. At approx. 9:15 P.M., I was on the phone with my mother and from behind the tall oak trees, I saw 3 very large fire ball looking objects in the sky.  They were flying relatively low, juxtaposed to the typical air traffic I see here. The balls were in a V formation, but were floating and flying at the same time... kind of swerving back and forth, but staying in somewhat of a V formation.  I could barely tell my mother I'd call her back.  Tried to hang up and get my phone camera set up. By the time I focused and clicked, all but one was gone.  Unfortunately, my camera picked up a dot.  They just ""went out.""  They didn't fly away.  The sky was very clear and they definitely did not fly away.  They just disappeared. Called mom back in a freaked out state and was on the phone with her...  Maybe 3-5 minutes and saw another one coming from the same direction.  This time I didn't take time to say goodbye.  Got the phone working and when I aimed to take the picture, there were 4 lights on my screen and only 1 in the sky.  I kept snapping pictures, despite my disbelief. There were 4 on the screen and 1 in the sky. It too, just disappeared. All of them would sort of ""blink out.""  Again, unfortunately my phone camera stinks, but I did get the fireball and when I expand the photos, the lights look round but the more they expand, they look almost like crescent moons, a fuzzy backwards ""C.""   Upon further inspection, I realized that the 2 lights on the bottom of the screen, were house lights.  You can distinguish the other two, as they are much higher in the sky and have the exact same crescent shape upon expanding the photo.  I do not know if the second one appeared whilst I was focused on the other one. I searched and found a video of another sighting here in Pittsburgh from this past Aug. 2013. found on YouTube.  It's exactly what I saw.  Also found many videos from around the globe, with the exact thing I saw. I did not report it for fear of looking nuts and no one else (apparently) saw them or reported seeing anything.  I am a stay at home mother of 5 children and am the fourth generation on my mother's side, to live in our old farm house located on the outskirts of the City of Pittsburgh.  We have lots of land here, despite still being in the city. I know that what I saw was not normal.  We have regular air traffic flying overhead, as the airport is relatively close by.  I saw airplanes, shortly after these sightings.  These were not airplanes.  When I saw the exact same things, littered all over UFO sighting websites and YouTube, my heart sank further.  This scared me enough to be up all night researching and to now be reporting this. For some reason, I can't check the information below.  I would definitely like to be contacted.  I also have a story about my sister and I when we were kids.  Hesitant to share it online.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,40.443091945513764,-79.97424169381107

A coworker and I were chatting as usual, on our break.  When, at 0:06, on October 28th 2013, we looked up and seen a fire orange colored glowing sphere come over the store, heading due north.  It was moving at twice the speed, if not more, than the typical aircraft seen in that area.  The size of the glowing sphere, to the naked eye, was about if you were looking at a dime you were holding up in your hand with your arm fully extended.  The first sphere was visible for roughly 20-30 seconds, before it moved far enough to be out of sight. Almost at exactly the moment when the first sphere was out of sight, a second sphere appeared from the exact location as the first. It looked exactly like the first sphere, moving at the same speed, and following the same flight path.  I watched as it moved through the sky, and when it got nearly out of sight, I looked at the point in where it came from to see if there would be any others.  To my amazement, a third fire colored glowing sphere appeared from the exact location as the two before it.  Yet again, it was exactly identical in looks, traveling speed, and flight pattern as the previous two. My coworker and I stood there baffled as to what they could be.  Another coworker, who was out collecting carts, came and asked us if we had seen them too.  He had told us that he had noticed one of them hovering in one place, just minutes before we had come out for our break.  Though, he may be a bit of a strange fellow, he is an honest one, and I have no doubts that if he said he witnessed one hovering, then that is what he saw.  I have thought and thought of possible explanations as to what the spheres could of been, but there is nothing that seems logical.  The movements of the spheres were that of military precision.

All of us are very conservative and are extreme skeptics.   We were on vacation in the area.  Most of the dwellings in the area are occupied only during peak vacation season.  The area was sparsely occupied on the weekend in question.    Our watercraft was the only watercraft on the lake at the time.  The man-made lake is beautiful and contains several small artificially constructed islands, on which multi-million dollar homes are situated.   As we traversed the lake the three of us sitting at the rear of the boat observed a slow-moving glowing object in the sky.  The object was red in color and looked like a large fireball.  It was hovering at a height of approximately 75 feet, above one of the islands, not 400 yards from us.  It appeared to be moving at a very slow smooth speed.   As soon as we saw the object we each commented on it, none of us able to comprehend what we had just seen.  The operator of our boat did not see the object and he continued driving in the direction in which we had been traveling. We excitedly notified him of what we had seen and he slowed the boat.   We were now on the opposite side of the island from where we had seen the object.  The trees on the island precluded us from observing the object.  The driver maneuvered the boat further from the island, to a point were we should have been able to see the object over the trees.  It was gone.   The entire time that had elapsed between when we lost sight of the fireball and when we should have been able to see it again was less than one minute.  Other than the trees on the island there were no other objects which could have blocked our view of any area on the lake.  There was partial cloud-cover, but several stars were visible in the night.   We traveled back to the other side of the island in an attempt to locate the object, but it was gone.

It all started last Friday night (16th).  I was coming home around 10 pm and spotted a bright white object moving across the sky about a half mile in front of me.  I thought, Ok, that's creepy.  After it disappeared, I continued on home. For the next few nights myself and neighbors observed two bright lights.  The lights would stay put for a while, then slowly move, then become stationary.  At first I thought one was the ‘evening star’. On wednesday night, we noticed a pulsing red/green object accompaning the lights. The really big show was thursday night. Using binoculars, we counted 11 pulsing red/green lights.  They were stationary and held their position about 15 miles apart from each other.  About 4:30 am, I noticed one moving off to the southwest.  As the suns glow in the east began to brighten, they disappeared. The evening of the 23rd, I stayed inside and didn't look out.  I woke up the next morning at 6 and couldn't resist looking outside.  I saw two of the objects.  They appeared to be about 5 miles distant.  I looked again at 6:20, and they had disappeared. In the evening of the 24th, I was watching the sky at dusk to try to determine when and how they show up.  The ‘evening star’ was already at its station as the sun was setting.  Later, at 8:30 pm, I was talking with a neighbor on my cell phone.  We were talking about how there were six bright lights, and an orange ball over his house.  I noticed the ‘evening star’ light backing into the distance.  About 4 minutes later, an Air Force AWACS, accompanied by a fighter aircraft flew by at about a mile from me at about 2,000 to 3,000 feet altitude. I’m just guessing, but it seems someone at the pentagon is very interested in this concentration of UFO’s over Kendall County.  This is about 50 miles north of San Antonio. I feel unsettled about this large number of UFO’s remaining over a relatively small area for such a long time. I've been sitting outside on the patio every night for three years, just stargazing.  So, this is a whole new experience.  The other night I got on the internet to see if others had seen something like this.  I discovered people around the world have seen the red/green object.

We were northbound on Telegraph Road through Monroe County in Michigan.   At approximately 10:15 PM my husband, seated in the passenger front seat, suddenly pointed out the front side window and said something like, “Look at those lights over there!”  He pointed to the eastern sky, which was dark but clear of cloud cover.  We were somewhere between Albain and Dunbar Roads, in an area that has fields, low buildings and some trees.   I looked out my back seat window in the direction to which my husband was pointing and I saw 2 reddish-orange lights in the sky, not too far above the level of the low buildings & trees.  They were some distance from our vehicle, possibly a mile or more.  The precise distance is hard to determine, but we did not have the sense that they were close to us or upon us in any way. The 2 lights were positioned one above the other with some amount of space between them.  They both seemed to be moving upward rather slowly.  My husband and I agreed that the lights did not appear to be planes or helicopters because they did not have any obvious navigation lights on them and they were ascending into the sky, not flying in a straight line as a plane or a helicopter would do at the altitude at which they appeared to be located.  They were brighter than ordinary stars.  They were brighter than the planet Venus which we have observed many times in the evening sky in our area.  They were not white.  Their color was a reddish-orange and they glowed like stars, but did not “twinkle” or shimmer. Because we were fascinated with the lights, we kept watching them as we continued northbound. Suddenly we saw a number of other lights appear beneath the 2 original topmost lights.  There were now about 6 or 7 lights in total.  They all looked exactly the same in color and size and they all appeared to be ascending into the sky in a fairly (yet not quite exactly) straight line.  We exclaimed to each other something like, “Where did those new lights just come from?!”   We should have told our son to pull over and stop the vehicle, but we did not.  He kept driving, and we were still able to see the lights as the entire line kept ascending higher into the sky.  Then, more lights appeared!  The newly visible lights were clustered at the bottom of the original line of lights.  They also were in lines, but in lines of their own, like the leaves growing up from the base of the stem of a flower.  My husband counted at least 17 lights in totality in the entire formation.  All had the ! exact same color and luminosity.  We agreed that we had never seen anything like this before in our lives.  We are each 58 years old.  We are retired school teachers.  Our son, a college student home on summer break, also saw the lights but could only glance over his shoulder as he drove, so his account is more limited than ours.  He did say, however, that he saw many orange lights and they appeared to him to be assembled into some sort of a geometric (box-like) formation.  His perspective from the drivers’ seat was, of course, slightly different from ours in the front and back passenger seats. When we got past 7th Street in Monroe, our view became more obstructed from buildings and street lamps, etc.  We asked our son to drive to Veterans Park in Monroe, which is adjacent to Telegraph Rd., just to its west.  He did so, and we parked there to continue to watch the lights.  Only 2 lights were then visible.  We watched as they both disappeared.  They did not appear to “fly away” but seemed to “go out” light a light being switched off.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,41.931,-83.4554

We don't smoke in the house. My boyfriend pointed to an orange/amber moving light in the sky out over Lake Ontario to the south of us.  When he first pointed it out, he said he had thought it was an amber streetlight through the trees. Then he noticed it was moving and that it was much larger and further away than he had first assumed. We all stared as the orange light, in absolute silence, steadily moved across the southern sky. Unfortunately, our vision was at times obscured by foliage from the many old and lush trees in our neighbourhood. As I saw it:  He pointed to an orange light through the leaves just above the rear-neighbour's rooftop.  There was a glowing light which appeared to be: larger than a plane; a non-symmetrical, triangular shape; amber yet orange, yet also reddish... like a flame; moving horizontally, west to east, then to the northeast... then when we lost it, it appeared to be moving east again; an even radiance, not pulsing or flashing; moving indirectly, unlike the usual planes and helicopters we see. As he described it:  There was only one difference between what he saw and I saw.  At one point, he saw the one light become 3 separate lights still in a triangular position, and then merge back into the one united shape. The other two moved about the porch to maintain a better view and the two of them kept saying, ""It's a UFO... That's a UFO!""  Meanwhile, I stood dumbfounded... simply agreeing with them, saying, ""I know... It is.""  He went to get the camera. She went through the house and out onto our street to get a less-obstructed view.  I stayed out back not wanting to lose sight of it. When my boyfriend came out with the camera we were already losing it behind the treeline and rooftops.  His mom came back out on the porch just after it had disappeared.

We stepped out after the Brewers baseball game and were just talking on the porch about things.  It was defiantly afternoon. 	My dad first spotted it and the first thing we noticed was it didn’t have wings or a tale.  The “craft” looked like a fuselage of a smaller airplane, maybe a Concord.  There were no windows.  It was flying east to west.  We couldn’t say for sure if it was silent because there was a normal airplane flying high in the sky, and we could hear that engine.  I have witnessed small aircraft take off and land and there is usually a engine whine with it.  Even when they are in the air there is a distinct engine noise.  There was possibly a whisper noise from it but we cannot be 100% on that.  The craft was white in color and you could see a shadow on the bottom, indicating that it was tube shaped. 	The craft moved at a somewhat slow pace.  It is hard to estimate air speed, especially by an amateur, but I feel it was flying slower than a normal small engine plane. 	There was considerable cloudiness this day.  We were able to see the craft go into the clouds and see other more solid clouds behind it.  This, in my opinion, means that it was flying very low. 	From what we say the flight path stayed straight.  The craft didn’t turn or go higher or lower, from our point of view. 	Porterfield, WI is located in Marinette County and is about 50 miles north of Green Bay, WI.  My dad’s land is in a very unpopulated area and I am not aware of any military base close.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,,

I was about to tell my kids to watch and see if they could spot it come back out of the clouds when the object stopped short of entering the cloud.  Knowing this was not possible for anything I know is currently being flown, I immediately asked my kids to look in the direction I was pointing and asked if they saw the black object in front of the cloud.  Two of my 3 kids acknowledged seeing the black object.  As the traffic light changed I made a left turn and immediately pulled into a service drive to again be facing east.  I still had the object in my sight as did my 13 year old daughter and 8 year old son. The object then began descending straight downward slowly and then disappeared. We stayed for a few minutes to see if it would reapp! ear but it did not. I have watched aircraft my whole life and am good at judging distance. I would say this object was miles away judging by the size and distance of the clouds. Again the object appeared to be a plane because of the smooth straight line of travel it was taking but I could not see any distinguishing shape or trait other than it being black and shaped somewhat similar to an aircraft fuselage.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,42.09027441860465,-87.98593459302325

At first I thought it was a planet that was much brighter than usual, such as Mars but it wasn't red, it was a very bright blue-ish-white, similar to Xenon headlights color.  At one point I had looked over to my wife to tell her to look at th bright light and she had asked about what it was.  When I looked back to see it, it had moved south and was slightly dimmer. At this point, I no longer thought it was a planet and started to think it was a plane or helicopter and shortly after we could see the shape go from a round shape that had a tint of blue, to a triangle shape that was more what and looked to have an obvious set of points.  Then I thought it had to be the mast light on top of a yacht or something and was thinking to myself, ""It's gotta be closer than you think!  Is gotta!""   I started to get my iPhone from my pocket but kept getting distracted by moving object that it took me a little bit to get it out and started taking pictures and video. I took a few photos that don't imply anything special and look like a star or something.  I took a short video of just around 2 minutes and the craft is clearly visible as the light I described.  It's hard to see the object moving because I was moving the camera. As my wife and I started to walk back the way we came (heading south, back towards the Hyatt hotel) and a ways away we came upon two women, in their 20's and I asked them if they could see that light and they started talking about how they had been watching it move and thought it was a planet or a plane too.  So we started thinking about what it could be but as we came up with possibilities, we could de-characterize the behavior of the object with common knowledge of planes and helicopters.  Most moving aircraft will have at least alternating flashing lights on each wing or the top/bottom of the craft. They also don't move in sharp, zig-zag patterns and erratic flight bahavior we saw.  Then the one of the girls said the same thing I thought about it being the light at the top of a yachts mast and that it could be closer than we think but we could see 3 yachts a couple hundred yards off shore very close to us that didn't have lights nearly as bright on top and they were not ! moving like the craft in the sky. We all watched it move out over towards the direction of Lahaina. My wife and I said a few things about the event with the 2 girls and headed back towards our hotel and didn't see the flying craft again.  The craft was obvious to us for about 20-30 minutes from when we first noticed the bright light to the point where we couldnt really see well any longer and headed back to the north side of Ka'anapali where our hotel, the Sheraton, is. We talked about what we saw and how cool it be to have finally seen a UFO. My wife asked if I was going to tell anybody about it and I said, ""I really want to! I don't know who to tell though!""  I asked her the same thing and she said ""Hell no! I don't want everyone to think I'm crazy!  Nobody would take it seriously anyway."" I said ""that's true but we know what we saw!  That was awesome!""  When we got back to our home on Oahu, we told our roommate and he started making jokes about it. ""Did it abduct someone? Could you see little green men flying it? Did you sing the melody (notes from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind')?"" and stuff of that nature were among the few jokes he said and even when my wife backed up my story, however reluctant, our roommate continued with his ""witty banter"". I showed him the video I took and he still made fun of our encounter. I would think it to be very ignorant and nieve of us to think we are alone in the realm of all space and given that time is infinite in past and present, why wouldn't others have found us by now? It would be equally ignorant and nieve to think our government has flying craft, capable of amazing maneuvers etc.  I cannot explain what I saw as a common aircraft or ship and I know it happened and there were others there to share in this experience. I'm glad and greatful to have had the experience.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,20.905862790697675,-156.62671627906977

I was watching the basketball game in the kitchen when I got a call that I wanted to take privately, so I stepped out of the side door of the house.  As I was in a heated debate on the phone, I looked up and noticed something in the distance above the treeline. I stared at it, and as I did so, short bursts of flame began to come from the bottom of the object.  The flame would switch from left to right as the object wobbled a bit; as if it was trying to maintain balance.  That's when I yelled to my girlfriend to ""go get my camera"". She did, but it took at LEAST 40 seconds for her to do so. As I continued to stare at the object, waiting for my camera,  I noticed that the flame at the bottom of the object began to lose it's intensity.  As the flame went from a full flame to just a red glow, I noticed that the object was slowly losing altitude, and drifting slowly south east, toward Lake Michigan.   As it dropped below the treeline, I began to run out of the ! yard and down the street so I can see around that particular treeline. I could, and again, I could see the object. The red glow at the bottom of the object was barely noticeable at this point, and the object began to descend more straight down than southeast and down as it was before.  It began to lose altitude faster, until it went below the treeline at that location, which was approximately half a city block to the south of where I was when I first began to record.  I waited at this location for about 30 minutes for the object to ascend or reapear, but it never did. While I was recording, I was not looking at the viewfinder; I was just pointing the lens in the direction of the object, so I had no idea if I actually had what I was seeing on the camcorder.  But after a discussion with neighbors and others who were present, I went inside, connected the camcorder to the television, and began to view the footage. I've been from that point on, compelled to find out what I saw is.  I contacted the local police, military, FAA, News Stations, etc., trying to find out if they had anything on the radar at that time and area of that day, but.....nothing; even though I expressed to them all that I had this thing on video!!  This incident has not only caused me a great deal of concern, it has changed my life, and challenges many things I believe. I have always been open to the possibility of the existence of such things, but never saw anything that came anywhere near actually convincing me that they are real. All that has changed now though. That thing had no sound whatsoever, it had no wings, and it had no tail end. It looked almost like a giant church bell with a flame at the bottom. Had I not recorded what I was seeing, I would have long since just assumed it was something normal, that can be explained. But after viewing this thing in slow motion on zoom, I am convinced that it is not, and can not. I will be attaching a copy of my video with this report (If it will upload). My animus is to have an expert opinion of what it is! that is on my video. it was certainly intelligently operated, and it was definitely a mechanical craft of some sort, and not a balloon or anything like that. I for some reason had a feeling of desperation as this thing was descending. It is the same desperate feeling I felt that made me look in that direction and up in the first place when I first noticed the object. I'm left feeling as though whatever it was, it was losing power, running out of fuel, or something to that effect, because it seemed to be struggling to maintain it's altitude. It was a struggle that It evidently lost. The object was moving slowly in the direction of the Lake; which leads me to believe that it was attempting to get out over open water. In  fact, it seemed to be trying very diligently to do so. I have no idea if it landed in the water or over land. All I know is it landed or crashed somewhere slightly south east of where I was, and never came back up. After you review my video, please get back ! to me and let me know what you think. Thank you; verily.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,43.051744026104416,-87.95998544176706

At approx. 21:00 on the night of Sun. June 16th, a friend and I decided to take a night hike of one mile up the paved tram road in Sabino Canyon just on the northeastern edge of Tucson, Az.  The night was totally cloudless and there was enough of a moon to illuminate the nearby mountains and distinguish the mountains from the sky above.  We walked to a turn in the road to a stunning view of the canyon towards the west.  As we proceeded just a few yards farther, I noticed a bright light directly on top of one of the flatter mountain mesas to the southwest.  I was wondering why someone was way up in an almost inaccessible location with a flashlight at that hour of the evening. The light proceeded to move at a walker's pace exactly on the top of the ridge line from left to right.  It then began to move faster than a walker's pace but still appeared to be flashlight size and right on the ridge line.  At times it would disappear and then suddenly reappear farther to the left on a consistent basis. The next time we looked towards that location, there was an object in the sky at 1/2 mile distance away just above the ridge line but very clearly in the sky and not on the ridge itself.  I could see it as more of a straight line than an object such as a saucer or anything definitive other than a faint, thin line in the sky.  I would have to estimate the length of this line as approx. 60 feet with a very faint red light on its end to the left and a very bright light on its right end.  It remained stationary for the rest of the event.  The red light stayed consistently very faint and clearly was not blinking in any fashion.  The white light however was laser precise and did not have the ""cheap"" star pattern glare of, say, a car headlight. The white light pulsed in an inconsistent way and changed randomly in its sizes.  This part of the event only lasted at the most half a minute.  My friend and I were excited but were also talking about what we had heard about ET experiences.  Many people have related that some alleged ETs are from the star system Zeta Reticula. I was just telling my friend that and precisely when I said the words, ""Zeta Reticula the light abruptly went out and in a split second made a big flash that my friend later said should have illuminated the mountain side due to its brightness.   The light after this went to the relative size it had been earlier. I don't recall how this ""object"" left but in the back of my mind I think it went more to the earlier flashlight sized light and then went out.  This object and lights made no sound whatsoever  and the canyon is a very, very quiet place.  From the beginning of the event to the end the object traversed at most 200 yards of ridge line.  We did not see anything else appear for the rest of our walk up and back. I'm 63 and work in retail.  My friend is in his 50's and is a professional therapist.  Both of us were wearing glasses but our vision is better than 20/20.  The night sky in this canyon is crystal, crystal clear.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

It had no propulsion system that I could see, no wings, no windows.  However, the object was omitting a vapor all the way around it sort of like the vapor that you see coming off an asphalt road when it's 110 degrees out.  So I am watching this in disbelief shaking my head wiping my eyes with my shirt and I swear, as God is my witness, this ""thing"" disappears in front of my eyes one section at a time.... front, then the middle, then the rear of the object.....

The brightness of the light was between my observations of the ISS and Venus.  There was no sound or any additional lights one would expect from a passing aircraft. As I was taking video of this object with my IPhone, a friend who was also observing this lighted object said toward the eastern horizon there were four more moving in the same direction and the same speed.  They also came across the sky at the same elevation as the first and the final two were closer together, only 3-5 degrees apart.  I also recorded these objects on my IPhone. The brightness of the objects maintained their intensity as they passed by but slowly became dimmer as they continued to the West until they could no longer be viewed.  It was almost as if they were satellites reflecting the light of the sun, but that would have required a significant altitude based on the sun setting nearly 2 1/2 hours before the sighting. I flew in the Air Force for 21 years and with a commercial carrier for 15 years and can say I've never seen anything similar to this observation of these objects.  I consulted with a member of the FAA TRACON in the area and after pulling the radar history for the period of observation, he could find no activity to resemble the IPhone video he viewed..

As I was waiting outside for them to come out, I noticed several red-orange spherical lights in the sky to the south (they appeared to be in the city of Chandler, just south of Tempe).  They were traveling in sort of an arc, heading first west and then toward the north and finally north-east, at which point they just disappeared.  They moved in a single file line in almost perfect formation.  There was a helicopter traveling along with them.  I watched this for about 3 to 5 minutes before my clients came out.  When the first one came out I pointed it out and we just watched them come up on the horizon, travel in the arc motion and then disappear. By this time we could no longer see the helicopter.  The second client came out after about two minutes and we continued to watch for about 2 minutes as the last lights came and disappeared.  I took three pictures, which are very poor quality, but photographic evidence nevertheless.  We then departed the apartment complex and continued to talk about our experience for about 10 minutes until we arrived at our destination.  We thought that maybe they were Chinese lanterns and that maybe there was a wedding or some type of festival or something.  But the question of why there would be a helicopter travelling with them kept coming up and didn't make sense to any of us.

I live on the outskirts of a large residential area laid out around the base of Barrett Hill in Northern California.  At the top of Barrett Hill is the Jr. high School that I attended over 25 years ago.  The top of Barrett Hill offers a near 360 degree view of the night sky and is often my favorite spot to watch the Perseid Meteor Showers.  My sighting occurred around 11:30 pm as I stopped to have a smoke on my way home from a grocery run.  I had parked my car in the middle school parking lot and stepped out to have a cigarette.  As I was leaning against my car and gazing up at the night sky I became aware of motion and blinking lights about 3/4 of the way up from the horizon. I observed 8 to 10 alternating red/white blinking lights in a 'V' formation moving at a slow but steady pace across almost 3/4 of my viewing angle of the night sky.  I have witnessed many aircraft lights as they travel at nearly 37,000 feet and also satellites as they travel above 160km as a reference.  This 'V' formation seemed to be flying MUCH higher than a commercial jet and must have been utterly massive.  I'm ended up walking from my car about 200 feet to the back of the school following the giant 'V' formation until it travelled silently out of my view.  The total sighting lasted about 2:45 seconds.  Being an avid Coast to Coast listener my first guess as to the identity of the craft or crafts might be a fleet of autonomous high altitude lighter than air vehicles or black triangles.  I hope this account serves as one of many pieces of the puzzle that will eventually lead to 'Full Disclosure'.",2013-12-02T00:00:00,38.626068115942026,-121.32485072463768

It was about 7 to 7:30pm.  My Wife, my three sons had left our home in Lake Elsinore and were heading to camp Pendleton to go camping with family for the weekend.  We were heading south on the I-15 approaching exit to HWY 74 and I was on speaker phone with my brother asking for directions when I noticed a line of lights in the eastern sky approaching from a distance.  Just as I began to mention them to my wife, the freeway came to almost a complete stop adjacent to the outlets mall.  People were pulling over on the sides of the freeway and as we crawled forward I could then see that the lights I saw were part of stream of lights crossing over the freeway.   I pulled over on the side of the freeway, and stepped just out of my vehicle, directly under the stream of lights.  The lights flashed but to me they seemed almost holographic.  Bluish-white sphere shaped approx. four to six feet in diameter (seemed to vary in size and distance)  The nearest ones to us were about 100 above us at their lowest point.   As they moved they seemed to flutter around almost like a group of butterflies, but in a deliberate direction; west.  When they flashed I could almost make out a silhouette of something inside the light orb.   As I was looking up, describing the scene to my brother on the phone, my wife yelled, ""Oh my God, there are hundreds!""   I turned towards the west and saw a huge swarm of them over Lake Elsinore that the stream seemed to be dumping into.  I hung up with my brother and called my neighbors, who went out to see the lights.  I then called my best friend, who went out and saw the lights as well.   Then I got back in my vehicle.  I wanted to take HWY 74 and follow the objects, but at this time my wife and children became very afraid.   So we decided to continue south, the long way so as to avoid the lights.   My wife has some phone footage as well as my neighbors.

It was a clear sunny afternoon on Sunday, Nov. 10. around 4:30-5:00 and the sun was setting.  I often take pix of the sunset and was taking some of this one.   After the 5th picture I had taken, I glanced at my phone to see if the last one came out clearly and saw a red ball shaped object on it.  I went into my picture file to check it and the previous 4 pix and saw this same red ball on all five of the pictures but in different positions and when you zoom in on them you can see a dark line in the middle of the ball.  I thought at first maybe some type of reflection on the window since I was taking a picture of the sun which was directly to the west.  It was a bit chilly with a few cirrus clouds and the window was up.  When I looked at the last picture it showed a very definitive football shaped pinkish haze around the red ball.  If it weren't for this last picture I would chalk it up to something on the window, except possibly the different positions the ball is in on each photo.  They're actually quite good and not just a speck in the sky. I want to send the pix in but don't know how to send them from my phone to your website or how to get them onto my computer from my phone.  I'm a bit of a imbecile when it comes to stuff like that.

The following is a TRUE account based on an unusual phenomenon that was seen by myself and my wife!   On October 4th 2013 at 11:15PM in Gresham, Oregon, my wife and I witnessed something that we have never seen before… something that is not of this world as we know it!   After seeing a movie at our local theater, we headed back toward home on 242nd Avenue in Gresham, Oregon.  As we slowed down to stop at an intersection by Grace Community Church, my wife saw something frightening in the night sky. The following is our personal account:  K - “I looked up as we approached the stop sign to see an orange object in the sky that appeared to have a flame or light flickering underneath it.  My mind tried to make it a plane…but I couldn’t.  I said to my husband ‘What is that!’  And again, I repeated louder, ‘What is that that I’m looking at?’  I kept repeating it over and over until my husband pulled over to take a look. I said to my husband, ‘shouldn’t we be calling somebody?  This is scary!’  I thought, ‘I‘II call my Mom and Dad because it was about 11:15PM and I  knew they would be watching the news.  Surely there would be something about this!  But, No… they knew nothing about it and nothing was said about it on the news. Immediately after I talked to my mother, I looked over through the passenger window and noticed an airplane descending toward the airport in the distance.  These orbs were higher and yet not much smaller than the plane.   I was scared and knew that this wasn’t good…MORE were coming!” “The first sighting was just (1)…then two more came and they continued to come in either sets of two or one…completely silent, no wind, hovering above us and then they suddenly would vanish, one by one right before our eyes, as though they were never there!”  M – “When my wife began to frantically ask me “What is that?  I looked up only to see (3) orange objects in the sky.  They were flying southbound and so we began to follow them until I could pull over and get out of the car to view them.  When I got out of the car I thought that maybe they were Chinese Lanterns but then quickly realized that they were much larger and they seemed to be moving in a very definite and defined manner.  I asked my wife if we had our good phone in order to take a picture but she told me we only had our old phone. So, I was not able to document this event. Although these objects appeared to be “aflame” they had a defined orb-like shape and they didn’t make a sound.  It was hard to gain perspective of exactly how big and how high they were but it appeared that they were going about 30 miles an hour as they were hovering above us… and what’s more, they kept coming!  It didn’t stop at three!  By the time the last one passed above us we estimate that we witnessed 16 to 20 of these unidentified flying objects.  And then, one by one, they disappeared as if the lights went out on these objects and then the night sky went back to its normal celestial condition…Moon, Stars and the glow of city lights!”  This experience left my wife frightened and me (the skeptic) wondering what this could have been?  We spent the following two days trying to come to grips with what we witnessed.  Something that we’ve only seen in Sci-Fi movies was now a reality…a reality we will live with the rest of our lives!  With that said, my wife and I are intelligent and respected people who wonder why we were there to witness this phenomenon?  But as we have learned to trust God in ALL things, we know that He will show us the truth of what we experienced!",2013-10-14T00:00:00,45.49032888888889,-122.40389111111111
