On July 20th, 1980, I was an employee working security at the St. Lucie Nuclear power plant.  At that time they had remote outpost from the plant and not within the confines of the nuclear plant itself.  Afterwards, I became a Florida State Trooper. I was alone, and at approx 1300 hours, I was looking at a clear night sky, looking for falling stars and just gazing at the night sky, it was a very well moonlight type of night. All of a sudden overhead at approx 2,000 feet, I began to see an object coming from the West heading to the east towards the Ocean.  The craft was dark and all I could see at first was a nose cone type shape.  As the object passed directly overhead, I realize the enormous size of this triangular ship with NO sound.  It had to be aircraft carrier size and it was just floating by slowly.  I was in just awe of this thing and scared out of my wits. I could distinctly see port hole type windows on this perfectly triangle craft and I estimate that the thickness of its sides to be maybe 3 stories high.  As it passed I could also see 3 distinct circular huge propulshion systems with no sound and emitting a unbelievable white glow where we would normally see jet engines. I watched this craft go out over the Atlantic Ocean heading East until it disappeared from my sight. By this time I expected the entire plant to be going crazy and the radios going crazy, BUT there was not one single radio transmission or alarm and nothing was said. At the end of my shift, I expected someone to also say something about what I observed, but no one did?  The only person I told this too was my mother and for the past 34 years, I never told anyone else about this incident. At the time I couldn't imagine a flying craft in the shape of a triangle, until I saw the ""Phoenix Lights.""  Until then I thought maybe I was hallucinating or dreaming.  But I think of this incident often and can clearly see it in my memory as if it was yesterday. When I saw what happened in Phoenix, Arizona, it gave me more credence as to what I observed 34 years ago.",2014-02-21T00:00:00,27.285686301369864,-80.36344363992173

Stopped and then  sped off at lightning speed. This happened over twenty years ago.   After finishing milking chores on the farm and walking from the barn to the house the oldest daughter 13 and her 14 year old brother were walking to the house when they observed a double sphere orange glowing object quietly floating in from the South.  Another son 15 at the time was coming back from taking a spin on an ATV three wheeler.   The object came in and then stopped and hovered probably less than 200 yards from the farmhouse.  I had just entered the house minutes before and had sat down on the sofa when a younger daughter came up from downstairs and was looking east out of the picture window.  She was spellbound and commented to me. OMG dad look at this.   As I got up there was a bang and the whole outdoors lit up as if it was daylight and by the time I opened the door the object was gone in a flash traveling to the NE. Sparks were flying off the power line about 100 yards from where the object had hovered.   I am to this day not sure if the object bumped the power line or if just the pressure from the speed at which the object left caused the wires to hit each other.   Both sons and daughter who were still outside saw the object and were no doubt rattled by what they had just seen happen.  This thing went from a dead stop to disappearing in not much more than a second. My daughter went to school and mentioned what she had witnessed and although her science teacher supported her and said she believed the account, it is needless to say her classmates made jokes of it and she pretty much never mentioned it again. A neighbor also saw the object cross the road behind their car as they were heading to town that night and there was a report in the Aberdeen, SD, paper that they had sent out a plane that night after several reports from the Mobridge and Glenham, SD, area that witnesses had thought they saw a plane coming down or crashing.  Nothing was found.  All this the same night about seventy five miles away from what we witnessed happened.   Again the object was a lighted double sphere that made no noise until it sped off..

Around 17:30hrs (+/- a few minutes or so), sitting in the living room of my brothers home, my brother and I more or less faced the north-facing window.  All the sudden a bright white flash occurred.  The flash seemed from our perspective, to move from our right, to our left, at a extremely high rate of speed.  The line of sight from where we were looking from, to the general area of the flash in the sky, seems to be somewhere between 25' to 35' degrees up, illuminating through the trees that stood between the flash and where we were sitting at the time.  Trees vary between coniferous and deciduous, with intermittent uninterrupted lines of sight periodically.  We both agreed that the flash originated beyond the aforementioned trees at an unknown distance. We suspected most likely, it was a meteor flash.  But, it did seem slightly odd even for a meteor flash, so I feel this should at least be archived.  We both agree that we saw the exact same event, in exactly the same details upon comparison, to the best of my knowledge.  We monitored the local news for anything related to what we witnessed, which amounted to nothing by the next following morning. More likely, may have been a meteor flash.

We didn't know what was causing the sudden congestion, until we noticed many drivers were slowing down to look at something in the sky.

I was in a parking lot at 36.074638, -80.057982.  The objects were steady red lights, similar in appearance to lights on a distant radio tower.  In the course of about 60 seconds they moved at relatively constant speed from about 45 degrees on the horizon almost due South (when I first observed them) to about 30 degrees on the horizon almost due North, passing directly overhead.   When I first observed them to the south, they had some initial horizontal movement that brought them very close together a couple of times, and then they separated by about a degree or two, and remained roughly parallel for about 40 seconds as they passed overhead and towards the North, and one was a couple of degrees in front of the second.   I thought it was strange to see only single red lights from individual aircraft.  But I also thought that they were likely helicopters when I first observed the horizontal movements they initially made.  I fully expected that as they grew close! r, I would hear some form of engine or rotor noise.  But as they passed overhead, there was nothing but silence.   If they had been aircraft, I would have estimated their altitude to have been a couple thousand feet.  When they got to the 30 degree angle in the north sky, one red light veered off to the right at about a 45 degree angle and I lost sight of it, and about 5 seconds later, the second light disappeared, obscured by low level clouds and city lights from the horizon. I am a licensed professional civil engineer, and I happened to be in my church parking lot at the time of the observation.

Last night, between 8:45 and 9:00 p.m., my husband and I went out to our hot tub in our back yard.  We live in Spanish Springs, in Sparks, NV.  It was crystal clear out, and we were star-gazing, as is our habit while hot-tubbing, when I happened to look toward the west-southwest. A bright blue, lit ball was descending in the western sky.  The blue was a ""true"" blue.  From the horizon line, it caught my eye when it was at about 30 to 45 degrees up, and heading down from right to left at that angle range. When I say it was big, from where I stood--because the sight of it brought me up from a sitting position to my feet--it's challenging to describe, because of its distance.  But I'll do so in terms relative to the house behind which I lost sight of it.  The neighbor's house is about 700 to 1,000 feet away, separated by open horse property between us. The bright, blue ball was roughly the size and shape of a ""doubled"" basketball.  In other words, it like an extra-large basketball compared to the house. It moved slower than a shooting star, remaining bright blue for the two to three seconds that I watched it until the house blocked its view. I don't know if there were any sounds accompanying its descent, because the hot tub jets were fully on and noisy, but there was no impact noise or boom or anything. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was a third to a half the size of a full moon.  The night was nice and dark, making for good contrasts.   --((witness name deleted))   P.S. I know last night you said you thought the helicopter we saw a few minutes afterward was unrelated to the bright blue ball, but I tend to think it was looking for it.  I have no way to prove this, however.  ((END ADDENDUM))",2013-12-23T00:00:00,39.57104725274725,-119.67573992673994

I noticed on my left, right at the top of the treeline at the power lines was this really big ""thing"".   It made no sound, & resembled a house or something with a bunch of windows on it.  I say windows because there was light being emitted from these windows that put out a sun ray type appearance.  It reminded me of a 2 story house that had every light on in every window.  It made no sound at all and was very low. Below all of the ""windows"" with white rays coming out, there were sporadic, blinking, red and yellowish/orange lights.  It was JUST SITTING THERE!  If I had to estimate the size, I held up my Samsung Galaxy S4 at arms length, and the ""thing"" was maybe 1/2 it's size.  But there was no movement, nothing. I had slowed to maybe 5 mph, if that, and was describing it to my friend who I was still on the phone with.  I had stopped in the middle of the road and was fumbling with my phone, in the dark, to try to get it to camera mode to take a photo, but 3 cars came up behind me and I had to start driving again. I got to my house, still on phone, and was on my deck just outside my back door, and I could see the ""craft"" above the treetops slowly gliding ESE towards Rte. 6A in Dennis by the beaches.   This thing seems to glow almost orange from within, and the white rays along with the blinking yellow and red lights continued.  If I dime at arm's length, this would have been the size of the craft as I watched it from my deck. It made no noise, and was very slowly gliding away.

As I spotted it my first thought was maybe it is a police helicopter using infared to track any criminal activity. But I did not not hear any blades rotating, there was no noise at all. Suddenly there were 2 more lights with it.  I can best describe these lights as round, reddish-orange balls of light.  They did not change color or pulsate and they seem to be flying in a tight formation.  They seem to move very slow as we tried to figure out what we were seeing.  I grabbed her phone to try and get video of these lights but I could not see them through the lens.  We were both shaken up a bit as we were seeing this and all I could do is watch to see what they might do next.  This is where I was most shocked.  I had my eyes locked on these 3 objects and like that...they were gone!  It was like someone hit a switch and tu! rned the lights off.  They never got out of formation , nor did they move left or right, up or down.  They just disappeared all together.  My girlfriend and I have investigated the paranormal on the side for awhile now and I will tell you that I have seen alot of strange things, but nothing like this.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure this out and there is no explanation that I can come up with.  In my research I have found that many people have reported seeing these same lights and what is really strange is that I came across a report stating that someone saw something very similar on the same night, around the same time, somewhere in Sweden!  I will definetly be watching the skies more often now as I hope to see them again and hopefully get some footage this time.

I considered that perhaps it was a signal light on top of a cell phone tower or similar but I was not aware of any such construction in the area. As I got closer and it came clearly into view, it appeared to be triangular in shape and the size of a large plane.  It seemed to hover and didn’t have any speed like an airplane or jet would.  There was also no audible sound coming from it.  Although I did not lower the windows on my vehicle, I feel sure that had it been a plane of that size I would have heard the roar of the engines. The other thing that struck me as unusual was that it appeared to have search lights on it.  They were very big and round and they faced down, towards the ground, not like the head lights of an airplane.  It did also have a red and green light on it which I understand is used to signal port and starboard on aircraft. I am not sure how many of these search lights were on this triangle as I did not count them, but I would guess at perhaps 6 or 8. I was unable to stop on the freeway, or to take picture whilst I was driving so I took the off ramp and drove around to where I normally park, hoping I would still be able to see it, however by the time I got around the building, I could no longer see the craft.

This Aircraft, being one of my favorite, was less than 1000 feet away from my vehicle . Looking through my window I said ""  That would make a nice picture "". At this point in time, I pulled out my brand new Canon 50 D DSLR and attached my Canon 70-200mm f2.8 I S lens to the camera, swung it out the window and started to take the images , into the third or fourth frame, I observed the very bright lights flying from right to left at a high altitude even with the tail fin of the aircraft.  These I thought might have been the F-16s in a pattern waiting to land, moving very fast and then disappearing as quickly as they arrived . I finished shooting and continued to park my vehicle on the closed hard stand outside some of the hangars.  This was a mere 3 minutes from taking the images, when I noticed that all the F-16s were already on display on the active flight line.  Now I scanned the sky for 5 minutes and never saw any additional aircraft land at the base at all. When I returned home, I immediately edited the images, and posted them to a closed Facebook - Aviation Photography of Miami aircraft spotters page.

At approximately 1 PM on March 22, 2014 my wife and I were leaving the Mount Vernon, Washington post office.  We had not left the lot when we saw an odd object seemingly hanging motionless in the sky, more or less north of our position. At first we thought it was a helicopter, but on closer examination it appeared to be irregularly shaped, and a solid black.  Although the sun was shining through light haze we saw no reflections off the surface.   We stopped the car and parked again, facing the object, and watched it from both inside and outside the car for about 10 minutes.  During this time the object very slowly moved toward us and a little to the west.  When we left to do other errands it was still there. There was little wind, but it did not move like a balloon, bobbing with air currents, but directionally, for want of a better word.  It continually changed shape, although it never took on any regular shape and always appeared as an irregular polygon.  It could have been rotating but it was hard to tell because of the fully black appearance.  It did appear to be more changing shape than rotating from a subjective perception.  It's hard to imagine a rigid solid shape that could rotate and be all those different appearances. While we watched it I noticed that another smaller irregular black object was nearby and this object would move toward the main one and seem to disappear, and then move away from it again. I pointed this out to my wife and she did see this second object.  After a while I noticed that there was a sort of grey halo of light around the object, perfectly circular, and when I mentioned this to her, she exclaimed, ""I thought I was seeing things! I see it too!"" or something to that effect.   I went outside the car and could see the halo from that position as well, although the glare from haze made it harder. It was impossible to tell how far away it was, but it did seem to be a smaller object that was closer rather than a large object farther away.   My wife did a search on youtube for ""amorphous black ufo"" and found a number of videos that were pretty similar to what we had seen except they didn't have a smaller object that came and went.",2014-03-27T00:00:00,48.40760578034681,-122.27763815028902

On the night of Monday, April 14, 2014, my partner and I were outside on our deck at our home in Burlington,WA, hoping to watch the eclipse that was suppose to be happening soon.  Shortly after 23:00 hours we noticed off in the distance at about tree level, 3 objects that appeared to be slightly floating in a triangular formation.  They appeared to us at that 1st distance to resemble large mylar balloons perhaps.  They had a football or oval shape to them, and they glided in perfect formation, in what looked like a triangle at equal distances from each-other.   As the moonlight hit the objects we could tell they were certainly not balloons, and instead had a metallic surface on each of them.  The light reflected off of them similar to how sunlight/moonlight would off of a chrome bumper on a car or other metal object. After they looked like they were hovering for about 10 to 15 seconds, they began a slow rise for another few seconds and then immediately began flying, without any sound at all, at a very quick pace towards us, still up at the top of the trees around our area.  It took them less than 10 seconds to get directly overhead, as they passed us the oval on the left side of the triangle rotated underneath the center oval, and the right side oval rotated over the top so that both the outside objects switched sides within seconds.  The entire time there was still no noise, and once the objects switched sides all three began to climb rapidly up and move away from us to the EAST and then they simply disappeared from our vision.  We looked for several more minutes all around our area in the sky but couldn’t relocate these objects at all.  From the 1st second we spotted the triangle formation until we lost sight of them due to them either flying too fast for us or them simply disappearing, it was roughly 45 seconds to about a minute. As for my partner and me, we both work in the retail management world in the Burlington area, we live quiet lives for the most part and just enjoy looking out at the stars, and spending evenings on our deck during the spring and summer months.  We thought it would be fun to catch the Eclipse last night, and instead it appears we caught something a bit more than that.  Exactly what it was, we are unsure but it certainly wasn’t like anything we’ve witnessed before.",2014-04-18T00:00:00,48.5323,-122.3184

There was a lighted object seeming to float across the pasture when I witnessed another appear from the woods to the east.  This one was larger.  They both changed colors independantly & colors varied to every end of the spectrum!   There are trees, fence, powerlines etc in the area & I could see these obstructions when the objects passed beyond them.  They travelled at different speeds and at times appeared to interact with each other. The manner in which they moved showwed they were not random and they even followed the trails without striking trees, fences etc.  At times up to perhaps a dozen were visable. Sizes ranged from id reckon a basketball to the size of a car!  No detectable sound was heard.  At times one or two would travel off making astonishing high speed turns then dissapear & at times others would appear from an easterly direction. I took MANY pictures with my phone & shot plenty of video. Of paricular interest is the fact that I've shot a lot of video with my phone & never had any audio issues.  In the videos I shot during this event the audio is essentially static.  I've not had this problem before or after.

I have a difficult time saying I believe in a god.  I think the vast majority of sightings are a hoax, or a case of someone wanting to see something that it's clearly not.  I would have classified UFO's with bigfoot in a list of fairy tales, if I didn't experience the story I'm about to write you.  Last year I was traveling down an old country road with a friend of mine.  It was a normal night, and I certainly didn't have anything like UFO's on my mind.  When we were about half way down the road, I notice a bright bluish/white light over the woods.  I instantly thought it was a police helicopter hunting for marijuana plants in the area.   After a few seconds, I noticed something seemed off.  I instructed my friend to stop and shut his car off, and we proceeded to roll down the windows.  The events that happen next occur extremely quickly.  I point out to my friend that the object was completely stationary, making no sound.   During this time, he remains completely silent.  I can only guess he is as puzzled as I am by whatever we were watching.  The distance from the road to the woods is about a football field.  During this time, there were no crops obstructing the view of the woods.  The object appeared to be hovering directly over the middle of the wooded area.  I can only estimate it was hovering about 25yards above the tree line.   I'd like to take second to note that these distances might not be completely accurate.  To be honest, I was a bit shocked about the whole event.  Even now, my friend refuses to speak too much about it.  Continuing the story, within a few seconds of us both sitting in silence, transfixed on this unknown flying object. The light went completely dim and we witness it dash off, horizontally, at an indescribable speed. The lights went dim before it actually took off, yet it left behind a colorless trail o! f some sort, and I could even see it's silhouette for a fracti! on of a second before it completely went out of sight. I apologize for not being able to provide any type of image. I just needed to tell this story to someone.  I can say with absolute certainty that I will never experience another event like this in my life. I can only re-live the moment as a memory. I felt as if I had to tell this to someone, since it was beyond spectacular.",2014-02-27T00:00:00,41.3606,-84.3701

We counted over fifty in the sky at a time. Each was small in size and not connected to any others but traveling at the same speed and staying mostly within a formation.  The lights were singular, moving in the same direction and at the same speed with some minor movements and adjustments detectable, some singles, some doubles and some triples, but each appearing to move individually. It took over two minutes to reach from where each light first came into view from the south before it left our line of site to the north.  All told, we watched for more than five minutes, first stopping on the Interstate and then driving ahead to the nearest exit and stopping again in a safer location. The altitude appeared to be greater than 2000 feet but less than 3500 feet, based solely upon our experiences living in close proximity to a small regional airport for many years and witnessing many small plane take-offs and landings as well as fly arounds. There was no sound recognizable emanating from the white lights as could be detected over the sound of the vehicles on the highway.

I’m being moved to share my encounter of the Craft to include The National U.F.O. Reporting Center People and you who are reading this report. I was driving my 1987 Rose Mist colored Mercury Cougar XR7 8 cylinder while listening to the stereo on highway 495, heading in a Southbound direction in the vicinity of Andover, Ma., sometime around the year 1999.  I cannot yet recall the weather conditions in detail but visibility was clear as far as my eyes could see.  My vision at that period was accurate enough to the point of not needing any corrective wear such as eyeglasses, contacts, other. It was in the early morning hours and nobody else was present on the highway except for a few truckers, and I noticed a few breakdowns in the breakdown lane, (passenger cars).  There seemed to me to be more breakdowns than usual by the way of the passenger cars.  A Raytheon Plant was somewhere nearby, but not in my physical sight.  I was driving toward my then favorite meditation/recreation spot.  An immense Craft (1), charcoal to jet black was approaching in the opposite direction of my direction and I saw it coming. The Craft was cruising directly overhead of my vehicle heading Northbound along Highway 495 at a straight forward angle, at a distance of around 50 to 100 feet.  I lowered the stereo to see if I could hear any sound and I perceived/felt a very steady energy and a feeling of a decrease of gravity and a decrease in the torque of my motion as well.  I asked myself if it belonged to the U.S. Government and answered myself that it probably did not.  I then sighted the Craft for size/shape and it was wider than a football field for sure, but I can’t say exactly how long because it carefully blended in with the night sky.  I can honestly say it was very long.  The speed at which it was moving was not extremely fast at all but very steady.   The only way that I can estimate the speed is to compare the speed of this craft with a car, if a car was moving in the same direction as the Craft (opposite of my direction), and I can say that it was moving less than the speed limit of the high! way at the time, (65-75 m.p.h.). I noticed the Craft had a thick density sort of like an aircraft carriers and looked to be made of some very solid material.  I don’t remember there being many lights, but there may have been a few.  As it passed over my vehicle the radio went to static.  I craned my neck upward, forward (windshield area) and said something in sheer awe and excitement as it passed overhead.  I wasn’t afraid at all and I’m still not fearful, I was just amazed and highly energized in a calm manner.  That’s the closest words that I can come up with to describe my emotion/energy for it.  My encounter cannot be expressed to you in words but they are all I have for this report.  I craned my neck back to my right backward, (bucket seats) to see if I could see it behind me, (the rear window on the 1987 Mercury Cougar XR7 is narrow and long), and the Craft blended out following its same course. I felt a polarity shift and a definite charge of energy and looked around to see if anybody else was showing signs of it.  All I remember seeing was people on the side of the road, (breakdown lane) on the highway. I wasn’t close enough to the people to see what their states were.  I got the impression they were experiencing something different from usual whether they were aware of it or not. I stopped at a nearby Dunkin’ Donuts just off Highway 495 South.  The waitress appeared casually normal in a business as usual manner. I did not come across any other people there. I proceeded driving to my meditation spot close by, noticing very few cars on the highway.  When I arrived at my spot there were a few people around and they appeared sleepy/tired and nobody was talking or moving as usual. They all appeared to be sleepy/tired and stayed in their cars to themselves. I drank my coffee and reviewed my encounter with the Craft. I felt very calm yet very energized and different with a much higher awareness and enlightenment than I had prior to my sighting of the Craft.  I was then faced with who do I tell about it?  I didn’t let it bother me and I went home with a feeling beyond words. Within approx. a one month period after the encounter, I parked my same Mercury Cougar at a friends house, went in for coffee, heard sirens outside, saw swirling red lights, and my local Fire Dept. were in the Apt. Building parking lot putting a fire out that had broken out in my car.  It was the electrical system for sure because in hindsight I smelled something not quite right in the car, but did not have it checked. I took the odor as possibly being from my cigarettes that I smoked and I didn’t want to a). incur expensive diagnostic expenses, b). I was wary about being forthright with information and my experience of the Craft to a car mechanic, or anyone else for that matter.  I said nothing about the encounter or the correlation to the fire of the car and honestly thanked the Law. Fire Dept. for extinguishing the fire. There were a few witnesses present and there was no damage to other people’s property and/or personal injury. I wanted to report this encounter a few times in the past but something/someone told me to wait.  I’ve waited long enough and this is my encounter in total truth and honesty.  I could probably remember more details if I was in the proper hands of a skilled Hypnotist.  It would have to be handled honestly, truthfully, and scientifically for me to do it.  The documentation would have to also be handled honestly, truthfully and proper for it’s kind.  I’m skeptical yet open in pursuing it with the proper People as long as the stated criteria are met. The facts being what they are in that; the Craft was in a position where there were not alot of People, the vicinity of Raytheon in relationship to the Craft, its’ size, speed in relation to its’ size, altitude, energy, and the number of increased car breakdowns, as well as the effects of the energy on Myself, along with the car radio going to static, the frying of the electrical system on my Mercury Cougar XR7, the very positive after effects it had on me, all make me know for sure that it was not a U.S. Government or any other earthly Government aircraft. It would not be safe to assume that any anxiety I had prior to my sighting of the Craft was increased.  As a matter of fact the anxiety I had decreased as a result of my sighting of it.  The other  positive effects on me are too numerous to mention in this report. I sincerely thank the great People at The Nation U.F.O. Reporting Center for allowing me to report my encounter. I thank Peter Davenport, whom I heard speaking on Coast to Coast Radio and I perceive he is a truthful, dedicated, and great man. I’ll continue with my discretion regarding my encounter and any other encounters and thanks to all the great People who benefit from this report.  We’ll be better for it for sure.",2014-02-21T00:00:00,42.64952091503268,-71.16363725490196

So my wife and I were heading home approx. midnight on july 1, 2011, when my wife noticed a glowing ball above an antenna.  She pointed it out, it was circling the antenna.   I was driving and when I tried to see what she saw, I barely caught a glimpse of it before it was completely gone.   Our corner to turn was basically at the sighting location.  As I turned, it came directly at our car.  I actually ducted ((sic.  Ducked)) in the car, because I was sure it was going to hit us.  But it didn't and once again gone.   Less then 30 seconds from this, we were in the driveway and my wife already had her cell out with the camera on.  No sooner from getting out of the car, it came again, towards our house, and then gone like it was in perhaps the same direction it came.  The speed was amazingly fast and no sound.  I took afew pictures not even sure if I got anything, and waited incase it returned.  It did.  About 1 min later it shot towards us again, and returned from the same direction.  Again I took more pictures in hopes of catching something.  This thing came towards us faster then a jet can plummet to the ground.  It came to a dead stop right in front of us, and in a blink gone.   No more were seen that evening and from a non-believer I now believed and so did my wife.  As for the pictures I took, they did catch a few good pictures I can't explain.  We only saw this glowing ball at hyper speed.  In one picture you can see the ball glowing with outer rings not visible by the naked eye.  These outer rings are seen in the pictures, touching the pavement in front of our house.  The very first picture I took was the most impressive, as we only saw a glowing ball, this picture showed windows with shadows of something in them.  The windows were around the object which looked like a disc type object. we couldn't stop thinking about it. I took up watching the skies as if it was my midnight job. about 2 weeks later.  It happened again, but this time different. I was on the back porch and ! it was fairly dark, you could see the stars. one in particular! stuck o ut to me. it was like this star was puking lil stars, just an amazing thing I had never seen.  I called for my wife to come out and check it out. she came and when I pointed it out, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something just approaching our roof top, it was a good 75 feet above us.  I ran for the camera and the wife was trying to figure its shape as we could only see a little of the object.  As I was running back out the patio door with my camera, my wife yells it just took my picture...the flash was so bright it could be seen inside our house. by the time I saw this flash and actually got through the door and looked up, I asked in panic, where the hell is it, she was scared and said its right over the house now, but it was gone. just a dot in the sky. still to this day, I cant stop lookin to the skies, everytime I go outside..something that will question my wife and myself the rest of my life I think…",2014-02-21T00:00:00,43.983178571428574,-80.75782857142858

The helicopter immediately followed the solid light about five miles into the distance.  The white light was not visible after the helicopter traveled 3 or so miles alongside away from my ground position.  Then the helicopter returned and left. The white light was easily distinguishable from the helicopter and hovered closely.  This caught my eye being there were no running or hazard lights on the vehicle the helicopter was running aside and appeared to be persuing.  It largely appeared the helicopter was present for another reason and happened to come across this vehicle.  It appeared to either be a police or traffic monitoring helicopter and then changed its course once the light appeared.

The time of my sighting began at approximately 14:15 on April 4, 2014.  The location is Jefferson, Maine, about 20 miles east of Augusta.   I am a frequent watcher of the sky, and as I gazed up at this time toward the north, I saw very high up (several miles) at maybe a 70 degree angle from ground level to directly overhead  two white objects that caught my attention.  They were drifting, rather than flying in a linear manner as any airplane would normally do.  The motion seemed to be analogous to a hawk or eagle looking for prey far below, or perhaps a hang glider.  However, these objects were apparently around the height of normal jet plane, way too high for birds.  They were not drifting with a wind current as they were constantly changing direction. I watched for a few minutes and then went in to get binoculars. Upon locating them in the binoculars, I noticed color--orange, yellow, and green from from front to back respectively. I continued to watch for awhile then was about to put away the binoculars inside the house when I went out again and saw many more.  I was able to count 16 in all.  Every one was identical in size, shape and color.   After watching some more, I called a friend who also has a keen interest in UFO sightings.  She lives about a mile from me, also in Jefferson.  When she went out she could only see two, but only in white.   While she reported what she was seeing, I was inside on my land line phone with her.  Eventually, they disappeared into the haze of the thin clouds and we lost sight of them after about one half hour, seeming to be moving to the east from north. What struck me was their apparent random motion with respect to each other and also in rather looping circular motion individually, again, much as one might see with hawks or eagles.  The shape was like a small fixed wing airplane.  No sound was heard nor anything resembling a jet contrail.   I am a senior citizen in complete control of my mental capacity.  My friend is likely a bit younger, but over 50. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed quite serious and sober-minded to us.

We finished our cigarettes and went back into the house, only to hear the noise growing louder and louder.  We went back into the porch, and even our cats seemed to be upset over the noise.  The sound was very loud and overpowering, it sounded similar to a strong violent windstorm with the following sounds coming from inside it: large vacuum cleaner, heavy rotating machinery, electrical humming or buzzing.  The sound was all around us but coming from above, our first instinct was to look towards the sky, but the sky was clear.  Then we tried to make sense of it, the loudness of it should have caused vibrations in the ground but there were none, we felt like we should take cover from the wind but it was calm and still.  It lasted for about an hour and a half, give or take, and then suddenly came to an immediate stop.   During the time the sound was active, the sound would fade in and out.  We were surprised once it ended that our neighbors were not woken by the noise and outside wondering the same things we were.  This was not the first time this has happened, we experienced the same exact thing a few months ago.  The first experience was not as loud and disruptive as the second.  The day after the first experience, I logged into my Facebook to check my Facebook feed and catch up with friends, when I noticed a post that my cousin in Ohio had made.  She had complained about a “loud giant vacuum like noise” that had kept her up most of the night.   Her post was made about an hour or so after we heard the noise at our house.

When nearly overhead at its zenith, just south of straight overhead, I saw a hazy oval shape that nearly blended with the dawn sky color of maybe dark slate gray, except there were 4 blurry light sources on bottom of the shape, fore and aft, left and right.  There was no sound.    At arm’s length, this lozenge-shaped object was about the size of the 1st joint on the thumb.

Finding a place to pull over and stop the car, I watched as this elongated object moved slowly from general west.  It moved to slow to be an airplane and there was no sound emitted as jets and planes make (even when they are not visible).  In fact, during this time I neither heard nor saw any known air crafts.  Also, there was not a cloud in the sky. I watched for perhaps three to four minutes as it moved in a lazy fashion across the sky for at least six hand widths at arms length. I had time to notice that it did not taper to a near point at either end (as planes and helicopters do) but instead was rounded.  Not a ""hard"" semi-circle round, but a softer ""hill"" type round.  It also appeared to be long, (like a stretched blimp maybe), as well as narrow, (like a used up, shortened pencil). I continued watching it travel eastward and in the blink of an eye, below this object and to the left, another object appeared suddenly.  It too was elongated and white in color. Only the ends of the second object appeared to be flat and it moved from east to west.  It too moved slowly. They both appeared to be large and a good distance away.

At approximately 9:00 pm on the night of March 10, 2014, I stepped outside of my driveway to take my dog for his nightly walk.  I immediately noticed a large, bright red-orange light in the southeastern sky, well above the treeline on the opposite side of the open hay field that is across the road from my driveway.  It was definitely unusual and bright and caught my attention right away.   At first I thought it must be an airplane (small craft judging by the size, brightness, and proximity to the tree line), but the light did not blink or flash, nor move in any direction.  It just sat there.  I was checking it out for about 30 seconds, trying to figure out what it could be, when all of a sudden, it disappeared, sort of blinked off.  I thought it must be a plane banking and taking a turn and that the light just became temporarily undiscernible.   Within seconds of it disappearing, a second large, bright red-orange light suddenly appeared in the southeastern sky! , but way more north of the original light.  I was checking out that second light just “hanging” there for a few seconds before the first light reappeared in the direction I had originally seen it in.  So I was watching both of those lights when a third large, bright red-orange light appeared in close proximity to the first light, but appeared to be a little more westerly (i.e. more my direction) than the first two lights.  Now there were three large, bright, red-orange lights hanging, unmoving, not blinking or flashing, in the sky all at the same time.  I watched them for approximately 15 seconds or so before all three of them disappeared all at once at the same time.  Even from the first moment I saw the first light in the sky, I wanted to go get my boyfriend, who was in the house, so that he could see what I was seeing.  But I didn’t want to miss anything.  After the lights disappeared, I continued searching that part of the sky, but no lights reappeared, so I continued ! on my way with walking my dog.  During the entire walk (about ! 15-20 mi nutes), I kept my eye on that part of the sky where I saw the lights because I was so fascinated by what I had just seen!  After walking about 10 minutes, I was heading back to my house when I saw the lights reappear in that same part of the southeastern sky.  This time, however, I saw only two of them, but they were side by side, and appeared to be either attached to the same craft, or flying in formation.  I saw them for only about 3-5 seconds that time, they disappeared, and then I never saw them again.  To clarify:  The lights were very large (about the size of a dime? from my vantage point, guess I could say more of an orb or sphere than simply a point of light); appeared above the treeline, but apparently further distant than the treeline; were a clear, bright red-orange color; did not blink, flash, or change position other than to disappear and then reappear over moments of time; and were silent (i.e. I heard no aircraft at anytime during the entire time I was outside! that night).",2014-03-18T00:00:00,47.8584,-92.8633

At first I began to think that the unknown objects were part of a firework display exhibited by the local residents.  Then upon focusing into the night sky, I quickly realized this was no firework display at all. The object began to fade in the sky about 45 degrees from the horizon from a tiny spectacle to a round, dark orange/amber glowing shape which magnified about three times its original size.  Once this object achieved its optimal size, it then flew south for approximately 15 seconds at an incredible speed and then decelerated.  The next segment is what caught my attention the most.  Once the object stopped from its propulsion like movement, it stood stationary glowing brighter and brighter in the sky with a strong hue of orange dominating its presence.   After standing still for about a minute, it then (in my best description) shed some droplets of light descending directly beneath from the original object at a distance not measurable with the naked eye.  This image reminded me of heating a metal to its melting point and then observing its free falling behavior as it was poured out of a ladle.  The object would then fade away into the darkened universe as if it traveled out of! our galaxy and onto the next.   This particular occasion occurred several times over the next 35 minutes and at one moment in time, there were as much as three “UFOs” in the sky simultaneously.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,48.0656,-123.0613

We were all sitting in the back yard when there was a very bright reddish amber colored light that immediately drew our attention just over the tree line.  This even was at about 11:57pm and we watched it just until the ball dropped.  We all went inside to watch the ball drop and celebrate.   We then grabbed the small firecrackers we bought for the kids to see and went out front to the roadway to set them off.  At this point the light was gone.  We were all very confused as to what it was being that it moved in multiple directions then hovered just before we went inside.  After lighting the firecrackers and rounding up the kids to go back inside we saw the light appear much further off in the distance in the complete opposite direction.  Myself and one of the other adults stopped and watched it as it moved east, then north, then hover and disappear again.  About 20 seconds later it reappeared much further away, much too fast for any craft I as a civilian know of.  It then hovered once again for about 20 seconds, flew north west, hovered again for about 10 seconds, then continued northwest.  Slightly after it hovered the last time, another appeared and began to fly towards the original.  As the second sighting got closer to the first, the first completely vanished.  The second hovered and sure enough a third began its ascent towards the second.  The second flew to about where the first vanished and hovered as the third started to move closer.  At this time a fourth came into sight flying towards them both.  The second sighting vanished and a fifth and final appeared and performed a very similar routine until all 5 vanished at roughly the same location in the sky.  We watched for a good 20 minutes afterwards to see if perhaps they would return, they never did.  All 5 sightings were very bright, reddish amber colored, moved in random speeds and direction, made no sound whatsoever, and all vanished at about the same location in the sky.

We watched as these 4 lights moved up and down several hundred feet at a time. 2 of the lights would be moving while the other two held still.  After watching for a minute I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look at what we were seeing.   What I saw still is difficult for me to describe.  This craft seemed to have more than one level, at least 2. It was pulsating and there's was so much going on with the lights inside this large object.  The object was orange/Amber in color.  One object appeared to have a globe shape on the top.  I handed the binoculars to my friend and asked her what she saw.  She couldn't speak for bit. She too couldn't believe what she was seeing, and was having difficulty explaining it.  After seeing the first two thru the binoculars, I went to look at the other two lights and they were gone.

There was one on either side.  The odd thing was that it definitely seemed to be moving because it was in different positions yet I never really saw the movement nor was there any sound.   When I arrived at my friend's house I asked her if she had noticed  anything on her way home just a short while before me and she said she had.  She described it just as I did and said she too thought it had to be huge!  I took her back the way that I had just traveled to get her truck and bthe object was still there.  I could still see it when I arrived back at my house from my front yard.,2014-04-11T00:00:00,,

I went outside our home to check on our animals at 8:45 PM.  It was dark at this time and I could hear jet engines just to the south of town, which is somewhat unusual in this very rural region of the country.  When I looked upward toward the engine noise I saw a reddish-orange object that at first glance appeared to be a normal aircraft.  It was flying toward the southwest in a straight line at an estimated altitude of about 20,000 feet.  There is a 10,000-foot mountain range in the same direction(immediately west of town) that allowed me to roughly gauge the altitude.   However, what was unusual about this craft, in my opinion, is that it was not blinking at all; there was no evidence of flashing navigation beacons.  The light was a steady reddish-orange color, but too distant to make out any other detail.  The other unusual aspect of this sighting is that the reddish-orange craft was being followed (perhaps escorted or pursued???) by three jet aircraft that wer! e equipped with normal bright blinking white navigation beacons.  The pursuit craft were approximately one mile behind the reddish-orange craft and appeared to maintain that separation distance until all craft eventually disappeared over the mountain range to the west (Chiricahua Mountains).   I am puzzled by the lack of blinking nav lights on the reddish-orange craft.  I am under the impression that blinking nav lights are required by the FAA on all aircraft, especially at night.",2014-04-11T00:00:00,,

There was no sound, and it was an extremely quiet night, so if there had been any sound, it would have been easy to hear it.   I watched them as they traveled towards the northwest and faded out of my sight.  As they traveled to the northwest, I was watching them from behind the second light, but could still see the light that was pointed in the direction they were traveling – until they got too far for me to see them.   All of this took place in about 15 seconds (maximum of 30 seconds) – from the moment I first saw the lights overhead to the point that they faded from my sight.",2014-03-27T00:00:00,38.4506,-109.60269999999998

I was traveling south.   One block south of me and traveling north toward me, a dark grey and black saucer-shaped craft topped the hill.  It was as wide as the three lanes of traffic and had two red triangular lights on either side in a similar position to where the parking lights are on an automobile but on the bottom edge.  However, no light from these reflected onto the ground and they were not bright like headlights, but they were large rectangles and most definitely red.   The largest part of the craft was very dark gray and the top “bubble” part was black.  This craft was only a few inches off the roadway.  My light changed and as I proceeded toward it, it was as if something came between us and it was no longer visible.  As there was nothing there to actually come between us, I feel as if it “cloaked! ” itself, but it was gone.  This area is very well lit as there are street lights on either side and there are businesses on both sides of the road so my visibility was excellent.  At this time of morning, there was no one else on the road except for it and me.  This road runs directly behind my house and this happened 1/2 block north from my backyard.  I went home and immediately called my friend who I had just dropped off and told her about it.  However, over a period of 20 minutes, we were only able to maintain a phone connection for about 5 minutes, as our call would get dropped and I would get the message “Call Failed” which never comes through when a call is dropped but rather when it doesn’t go through to begin with.  I would try to call her back and it would do absolutely nothing.  Just like dead air.   She left me a voicemail message but my phone had not rang.  She would call me and get the same nothing.  One time, I called her and as the phone was ringing, it soun! ded as if there was a third party on the line and I could hear! some sc ratching like claws on a piece of wood but just when the call should have gone to voicemail, it just disconnected and I got the “Call Failed” message.  She said when we finally were able to talk that she had never experienced anything like that ever before with a cell phone.  I hadn’t either.  I was unable to go to sleep until about 6:00 a.m.  The next day she told me that she had checked the Arlington Police Dept. active police “blotter” after we hung up and that from 3:00 a.m. until 3:30 a.m. there had been 9 calls to 911 that were only classified as “disturbances” within a 1-mile radius of where this occurred and my house.  She tried to take a screen shot of this information, but it would not work.  I can get a copy of that night’s activity from the police department, but cannot do so for 30 days.

I was looking up at the closing stages of the lunar eclipse with two companions who were speaking and not paying attention when I suddenly noticed two faint but distinct bluish-white lights streaking across the sky just a few degrees below the moon. From my vantage point in the Hollywood area the eclipse was taking place in the sky south from us at a high, approximately 75 or so degree angle.  We stood next to the base of a one story building, which took up two-thirds of the view of the southern sky.  The eclipse took place a few degrees above the tiles of the roof, and just a few degrees below a cable tv wire.  The objects streaked through this view within these narrow sky boundaries.  They moved in a 10:00 o'clock to 4 o'clock path at a rate of speed fast enough to span this space in just a few seconds. I began tracking the one on the left, which seemed slightly brighter while it also trailed one that I only barely perceived that was almost immediately below the line of sight due to the roof. I was able to view it for only 3 seconds before it too was blocked by the roof.  It took place as the haze of the marine cloud layer was passing over the city, and the haze was backlit somewhat by the moon making the observation attempts by my friends very challenging in the brief moment they had to respond to me. I immediately tried to understand what the two lights were since they were not flying in a straight line despite having a velocity similar to shooting stars.  The precise movement of the lead one on the right couldn't be observed but I clearly saw the one on the left have subtle shifts and wobble-like movements as it rapidly traversed my line of sight and miles of the sky in those short moments.

I believe the moon had just been fully eclipsed only a minute or so when I noticed a strange moving object in the sky. The first thought I had was, “why is that plane flying with out any lights on?”  Then, I immediately noticed it wasn’t a plane. It looked to me like a cylinder perhaps 30 feet in length and maybe 8 feet in diameter.  This dimensional estimate is based on a guess I have made after reflecting on what altitude I believed the object to be flying at. It appeared to me to be flying at the cloud level which I estimated to be perhaps 5000 feet higher than the private planes I observed flying over the city in the southern sky. Those planes were at a typical 5000 foot level.  So I am estimating the objects altitude at between 8000 and 10000 feet.  The city lights are the only thing that illuminated the object. In the dim illumination the surface of the object looked off white in color.  It was flying in a direction perpendicular to the length of the cylinder shape. I also noticed that it was traveling at a rate of speed many times faster than any man made aircraft can fly.  It was traveling in a North West direction, approximately 3 degrees lower than the angle of the moon in the sky. It disappeared from view within about 8 seconds.

I looked out the small window in our kitchen and saw the trees swaying and just assumed it was the wind picking up and echoing in the mountains.   The 3rd time we hear it, I go out on the porch. It sounded like it was right above us but I saw nothing.  The sound was a deep rumbling and I couldn't tell what direction it was coming from.  The sound changed from a deep rumble to a higher pitch rumble.  Then I saw the craft come over our house, at what seemed to be the same altitude as a normal aircraft.  This craft however, was wingless and a dark grayish color.  Also, it was sort of egg shaped.  Not exactly like an egg, but it wasn't round either.  This thing moved f! ast like a jet but left no jet stream.  Right when I saw it, I yelled out for my family to come see. In a matter of seconds it was already almost out of sight.

The discs made a diamond altogether, one on top, on on the bottom, and two in the middle and slightly to the left and right.  I was standing outside, so all thoughts of this being a mere ""reflection"" are wrong.  There is also no way this is another building, I've been in Baltimore more than enough times to know there is no building that tall out there, and based on the picture it would be impossible. It would be in the middle of the water.  I was looking through pictures on my computer and four three of these pictures.  Two are very clear and the other it actually seems to be moving.  It is in a different location somewhat to the left and a bit unclear.

I remember the first encounter taking place sometime in early spring 2013. I was driving in my jeep around 7:45 P.M (occasion 1) and in my review (sic.

Video two happened about 7 year ago in the same spot in las vegas.  I was driving home around dusk and i fixed on an object and it stood still for about 7 seconds started moving and then disappeared.  I will attach the two videos.  The videos are ""exactly what i saw"". I had a physicist look at the videos and he believes them to be hoaxes.  That is a easy perspective to have from a computer.  I believe these videos deserve a second look. I will attach his E-Mail as well.  Just wanted to share.  Thanks for the great site!

On the short one from China I can’t help much – I don’t see anything in the images that gives me a clue as to what is happening.  It does appear that the shape of the object is constant throughout the video – at least to within the resolution of the video.  However, I would really like to know why the videographer called it UFO with digital FX – makes me wonder what the effects are. On the other (lights in the Vegas night sky), I do have a few comments.  First, the entire clip is being taken with a video-capable camera on a pretty solid tripod, so it isn’t a case of someone pulling out their cell phone to video what they are seeing. Another thing that seems pretty clear is that there are a bunch of objects at a higher angle above ground, and a second, smaller bunch of objects closer to the horizon.  A third thing to note is that the top of the hotel at the right of the image is out of focus.  There is so little difference between focusing at infinity and focusing at, say, 300 feet that if the camera is recording sharp lights, they are probably rather close to the camera, rather than at a large to very large distance.   Finally, if you look closely where the various objects fade out on the left and the right, you can trace out a cone of light in the image. You can’t see the light, but it seems pretty clear that the objects are moving in and out of a cone of l! ight such as might be produced by a flashlight pointing straight up from the ground.  I don’t know just what the objects are (at first I thought clusters of balloons, but they would have to be pretty small to be consistent with the hotel being out of focus. However, I don’t have any hesitation calling this one a fake. Hope these comments help out. I have to say that I enjoyed the lights on the China video.

I was astounded and stood gaped faced while trying to figure out what I was experiencing.  They were cylindrical in shape and although extremely bright, the light they emitted seemed to be not glowing, but just...there?   They really looked like glow-sticks suspended in the air.  They were large and looked the size of a mini-mall.  One bright pink and the other blue.  Like giant horizontal day-glo tubes in the night sky, and they made no sound at all.

This sighting occurred while at the Turpin High School vs Anderson High School football game at Turpin, Anderson Township / Cincinnati, Ohio.  I was happy to discover that another group of eyewitnesses from the Cincinnati area submitted a video account of this occurrence on the NUFORC site. At some time around 8PM, sitting in the stands at Turpin's football field, facing west, I noticed what appeared as one bright single orange light/ball of fire, that seemed to hang in the sky for a few minutes before breaking into two, then three glowing orange balls of light.  People around me were witnessing it as well.  A few kids were pointing and laughing say, ""Ohhh, look at the UFOs.""  I was amazed as these balls of light would slowly drop downward, and at first I wondered if they were some kind of night time military exercise, or maybe skydivers, or luminary sky lanterns. The lights appeared to me to be nearby Lunken Airport (which is due west from Turpin, about 4 miles away), which led me to believe it was possibly a night time parachute jump with the parachutists wearing flares.  But I ruled that out as these glowing balls of fire seemed to hang in the sky far too long to be parachutes.  So I wondered if maybe they were hot air balloons, as they would float downward, but them rise back up in the sky.  But I counted that out as the glowing lights would fade in and out of view--and this was on a perfectly clear night.  They appeared to be maybe 2-3 miles in distance from us. As I was about to conclude they were parachutists on a night jump, suddenly they moved upward at least a thousand feet and orbited around each other a bit, then appeared to be floating in a triangle shape, then appeared to go back into one ball of fire.  Very strange.  At one point when they first broke off from one ball of light to two, it appeared that two of them were linked by a long shaft of light...honestly it appeared to me by the color of it that they were connected by a rope of fire. If you watch the video:    [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4ouLci9bNN_dzJIY2NPQnlSLVE/edit?usp=drive_web]  just after the two minute mark, a streak of light appearing much like a shooting star, shoots off to the right from these balls of light (watch from the lower part of your screen.  I witnessed this as well. I was pretty freaked out, and had pointed it out to a few of my family members after watching it for a good 3-5 minutes, saying, ""Please tell me what we are looking at?""  Finally they faded into darkness--just totally disappeared.  Naturally, I would glance around the sky from time to time the rest of the night, wondering what we had just witnessed. After they faded out of view, one lady nearby was quite unnerved and started exclaiming, ""Did anyone just see that??""  A lot of people did, but I thought it was odd that most everyone just glanced at it, then shrugged it off and kept watching the game, which by the way was boring and untypically quiet for a Friday night football game.  The reason I bring this up, I was listening for aircraft engines, but it was very quiet. This is where it gets weirder.  By this time, it was half time, and naturally, I was glancing around in the night sky to see if there was going to be any more of this phenomena.  I turned around and behind me, facing an easterly direction, appears a ball of light, in what I estimate to be 1,500 - 2,000 feet in the air.  It's bright, moving slowly toward me, and so I'm wondering if my mind is playing tricks on me and if I'm just being paranoid.  So I rationalized, surely it's a plane in a landing pattern heading towards CVG airport.  However, it looked like an orange ball of light, not a landing light.  Also, I was looking for the flashing wing tip lights as it appeared to be getting closer.  Never saw them. A man I had never seen before was standing directly behind me.  I asked him, ""Do you see what I'm seeing?  Is that an aircraft, or what the heck is that light behind us?""   This guy NEVER looked back behind us to see what I was pointing at but instead looked me dead in the eye and said, ""You're not supposed to see that.""  WHAT THE FREAK!!  I said to him, ""Do you even know what I'm talking about?""  So he casually glanced back and said something like, ""Yeah, have you ever heard of Area 51?  You're not supposed to see this.  Just pretend it never happened.""  Now, THAT was weird.  VERY. WEIRD. I grabbed my wife, who was busy chatting away with someone, wanting someone to tell me I wasn't crazy and said, ""LOOK!  Tell me what you see.  Is that an airplane?""   Suddenly the orange ball of light which was slowly moving toward us seemed to break off into TWO BALLS of glowing orange light.  It was as if the second ball of orange light came out from behind the first ball.  But they were heading right towards us, at this point it seemed less than 1/2 mile away.  I wondered if they were going to pass right over us hoping I could get a good look at what they were, but suddenly they faded out.  It was as if a passing cloud blocked them out, but then they were gone. Were they planes in a landing pattern line up, or was this the same lights we saw some 30 minutes before?  The mystery guy?  I never had seen him before, and I never saw him after I pointed it out to my wife.  He may have simply been a dad of one of the students attending the game but his response was very strange. And where did he go?  I think it was interesting to observe how most everyone just chose to ignore these strange lights as something they just didn't recognize and went about business as usual, watching the game.  Only the two kids initially pointing, laughing and acting silly and scared about seeing UFOs, and then the one lady who was vocal about what she had witnessed, besides myself asking her what she thought they were.  Everyone else just shrugged, and I think were afraid to admit they had just seen something they couldn't explain. This morning while surfing the web, I came upon this site and looked up the date of the game, wondering if anyone had reported the sighting.  I was glad to find a confirming video of it.",2014-02-21T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

Peter, Upon hearing your comments on C2C with George the other night I have decided to share what I observed with you.  I am 57 years old and not a believer in UFO's.   Around 7:00 p.m I was bringing in firewood from my backyard to my house.  It was completely dark.  As I was walking up my driveway, I saw two lights approaching me from due south above my neighbor's roof line.   At first, I thought they were helicopters with their search lights on. This seemed odd because you always hear a helicopter before you see one.  The lights appeared to be about 500 feet, but ORANGE in color.  There was NO sound!  They were parallel in flight as they approached me.   Suddenly, the light on the right moved diagonally and fell in behind the other light.

About four and a half minutes into waiting, they broke from behind the tree line, and flew by the house.   They were blacked-out, say for the red lights on the noses of the aircraft.  As I stood to go back inside, my attention was drawn to huge white lights coming from behind the trees on the opposite side of my field of view.  I watched the lights emerge, and saw what I thought was a low-flying plane taking off from our local airport.  The craft moved quite slowly, and had three very bright white lights forming a perfect triangle.  The lights were very large to boot, almost touching one another.  I was able to make out another smaller white light in the centre of the three, as well as a slowly bli! nking red light on the plane opposite of the craft’s direction of movement (i.e. a taillight).  I was able to see a black body around the lights.  The craft disappeared behind tree cover, and never attained significant elevation.   Both the choppers and the unidentified craft headed in the same direction; east, towards downtown Cary.  It was only later that I realised that both the choppers and the craft came from the west of us, nowhere near the airport, which is north and east by a long shot.  The craft originated from the vicinity of Jordan Lake.  The next day, my boss said that he too heard choppers near his house in Wake Forest, sometime around 23:15.

As I lookup up I saw a fairly bright yellow-orange light with a reddish halo around it moving silently from the NE to the SW.   My wife also saw it.  We could not determine how high up it was as the sky was clear and there was no frame of reference.  It did not seem to be a plane or helicopter as the light did not blink and there was no sound.  It moved moderately fast covering perhaps a 45 degree arc of sky in about a minute.  As we watched, a second light came into view over our roofline from the same direction and on the same route as the first.  It was about 45 seconds behind the first.  Watching the first light, it dimmed as it got further from us, then was not seen.  Changing to watch the second, a third light appeared, same time interval, same path.  This occurred six time; six lights.  Several of them seemed to change their course slightly to the south as they moved away.  Because of our roofline, I was not able to observe where any of them originated. I thought perhaps the lights were some kind of flares suspended from balloons - but they moved too identically for that in my opinion.  Another thought was some type of crafts watching the firework displays for New Years.  However, there were very few fireworks seen; our deck has a good view over the city.  The only other thing I could think of was some kind of night maneuver with our local national guard unit - but I don't think our small unit has six helicopters.

It looked like the UFOs were blowing up when they were hit, but their shields protected them.  I saw one Gray eject from his spacecraft after several direct hits, but he parachuted into another craft then took off back into deep space.  The worst part was getting abducted.  A UFO landed in my driveway and the pilot got out and asked for several wooden boxes of uranium.

Neighbors were setting off fireworks in celebration of New Years so my wife and I went to the front porch to watch.  We noticed this green/red light in the sky to the east. It looked to be two green lights side by side with a red light that pulsated slowly.  I set up an 8MP camera on a tripod and started recording.  Sometimes it appeared that the green lights were on top with the red at the bottom and sometimes this orientation changed - but the changes were very slow and difficult to notice with the naked eye.  Occasionally, the light would slowly drift to the south and then back to the north, returning approximately to its previous position.  After 8 minutes of recording, the green light turned off leaving only what appeared to be a pair of red lights and the light appeared to slowly descend until it was obscured by the tree line and out of sight.   20 – 30 seconds later, my wife noticed a red light of similar intensity moving north, but it was obscured by trees and other houses so we could only see little bits until it was out of sight completely. The recording is blurry – as they always are – it’s difficult to focus at an object in the night sky through such a tiny viewfinder.  The object appeared too steady to be a helicopter or any toy I’m familiar with.  There was a light breeze, so I think that would have caused a balloon to move.  No sounds from the object were detectable by me or my wife. I checked today – there are no towers or tall buildings in that direction, just 4 miles of residential neighborhoods and then wilderness for a hundred or so miles after that.   Just a really fun thing to see on New Years! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))",2014-01-10T00:00:00,32.9878,-80.0057

My porch faces due south and the residence is at the far southeastern end of the Spokane Valley, about 10 miles from the Idaho border and 4 miles west of the small community of Liberty Lake.   My home is located in a small cluster of houses elevated about 400 ft. above the valley floor and this cluster of houses is the last inhabited property with paved streets and street lamps.  All the land to the south is tree-covered, sparsely inhabited hills.   It was 32 degrees out and it had rained in the morning so there was a high, light fog/haze in the night sky where if I looked towards the horizon, the haze looked whiter and thicker than when I looked up, but even though the sky was much blacker straight overhead, no stars were visible.  	Some fireworks were still going off but there were no nearby Roman candles or star-bursts showing up above the treetops. Then as I stood there looking around, a bright, solid red light came into view from behind a hilltop coming from the South, horizontal to the ground, just under the fog level.  At first I thought it was an incoming airliner, as under certain weather conditions, airliners often approach the Spokane International Airport by making a low circle around this end of the valley to make their approach.  And, the craft was traveling about the same speed as an incoming jetliner and at the same altitude.   But, as the craft came nearer, I realized the red light was too big and bright to be on a jetliner and there was no green light on the other side of the ""plane"" nor any white lights on.  The size and brightness of the red light would have to have been the equivalent of every light on the bottom of a jetliner being changed to red lights all on at the same time, creating the impression of one large light.   I could not see any shape to the craft and the size of the light seemed to encompass the entire bottom of the craft as I could not see any bigger extension of the ship outside the circumference of the light.  What I was seeing definitely was not a ""fireball"" or other ""natural"" phenomenon - it was a huge red light on the underside of a flying craft. 	Just as I was trying to figure out what kind of craft it was as it got closer, another identical red light appeared from behind the hill right behind the first light, and then a third red light approached at the same interval as the second one was to the first one.   Now all three bright red lights were strung out just under the fog, equidistant apart, flying at a relatively slow, steady speed and coming straight towards me.  By now I knew these were not regular airliners and also, there was no engine sounds.  Then another two red lights appeared together, much closer to each other and behind the first three. 	By the time the pair of red lights appeared, the first craft seemed to stop right at the edge of the forested property, as if he didn't want to venture into the illuminated populated part of the valley.  The point at which the craft stopped was about 3/4's mile from where I stood.  This first craft started fading from view into the haze right above where he had stopped his approach.   From what I saw, he had flown in under the fog horizontal to the ground, reached a certain point beyond which he was not going to travel and instantly switched to rising straight up into the sky, at a 90 degrees angle from where he previously had been traveling.   Then the second craft did the same thing at the same exact location, and then the third craft, too, as if they had reached an invisible wall.  I got brief glimpses of the red lights as they faded into the fog, so it wasn't as though the craft just disappeared. 	As the first three ships ascended into the fog, more identical craft were appearing at the same altitude and speed from behind the hill in the same close-knit but random fashion until I counted 21 craft in all.  And, as each reached the ""invisible wall"", it rose into the fog the same way the first craft had done.   After the last ship of this group faded upward into the fog, I waited a few minutes more to see if something else was going to appear.  When nothing more happened, I ventured down the front sidewalk towards the street to get a better view of the night sky and saw a single identical ""red light"" craft due West a couple of miles away but still at the same altitude.  I watched it for a few minutes, but I could't tell if he was moving at all, or if towards me or away from me.   No other craft appeared around him and I couldn't tell if he was one of the original 21 ships I had seen or if he was ship # 22.  The whole episode lasted about 10 minutes and since I was getting quite cold, I went indoors even though the craft in the West was still visible.   This was my very first UFO sighting and until I saw your word choices for ""Shape of Craft"", the word that came to my mind was a ""squadron"" of craft. 	I am in my mid-60's, retired from a lifetime of being self-employed in small business with my husband, married for 42 years and a college graduate.   I was halfway through typing up this report to you when I turned on Wednesday's Coast to Coast and heard your January 1st report to George Noory about all the red lights and fireballs people were reporting.  I have listened to Coast to Coast for over 25 years, and still remember Art Bell's first broadcast of ""Mel's Hole"".   Thanks for the work you and Coast to Coast do to monitor and let us know what is really going on in our world.   My hat's off to you.   Happy New Year!",2014-01-10T00:00:00,,

I looked down to see what my dog was getting herself into and retrained my eyes on the laser pointer.  When I looked up I noticed a very bright light directly next to the laser pointer.  I immediately shut the pointer off thinking it was a plane.  The bright light started to strobe extremly slowly and out of any rhythm.  I've seen before.  The light was just at cloud level and moving much too slow to be a aircraft.   Each time the light got brighter it seemed to become more intense.  The light had gotten so bright it started to feel like it was burning my skin.   After going inside my home I noticed my skin was slightly orange.

My husband and I were driving home along Lakeshore Road in Port Hope, Ontario, (from Cobourg).  We live in a new subdivision built by Mason Homes; the subdivision is now called Lakeside Village (Phase 2 of Penryn Village).  Before we were to turn left onto Strachan Street which leads to our street, I happened to look at the sky.  I saw a few stars, but then noticed one large, brightly lit object – which at first I thought must be a star or planet.  But I quickly realized that it was far too large and long and bright for it to be that kind of object.  Next, I assumed it must be a plane.  I pointed it out to my husband, who was driving.  Then I said, ‘Is that thing moving at all?  It seems to be staying in the same place.’  My husband wasn’t sure, either. Just to clarify: We aren’t SURE of the shape of the object.  If we were seeing a side view of it, we would say it was cigar-shaped. We stopped the car for less than a minute just to see if we could tell whether or not the object was moving.  It didn’t appear to be – but of course we told ourselves that planes often don’t seem to be moving IF they are flying AWAY from you.  We both commented on how big the item was – far larger than ANY plane we’d ever seen near Port Hope.  Port Hope is about 60 miles ENE from Toronto – and the only big planes we ever see are jets that are very high up and, therefore, don’t appear large.  This particular object was very bright, as I mentioned – a lot more well lit than any plane I have ever seen in the sky. It was either a huge thing or very close and low. 	We began driving again, turning left onto Strachan Street.  Then, when we got to our new road, Maple Boulevard, we decided to stop once more.  We really wanted to find out IF the object was moving, as it seemed to stay in the exact spot we’d first seen it in – getting neither larger nor smaller.  I also wanted to open the window to find out if I could HEAR anything; we hadn’t heard any sound at this point. 	When we stopped the car for the second time, I began to press the button to lower the window – and suddenly my husband said (just as I looked up to see the object), ‘It’s gone!’  We couldn’t believe it. It had disappeared in the SPLIT second that I took to reach for the window button. We looked and looked, and drove around our housing development site to see if we could find the object somewhere else.  We never saw it again. 	Cathy Carlyle 	(Patrick Gray – my husband PS The lights looked yellow to me, but my husband felt they were yellowy-white.  In either case, they were extremely bright.  It was the stationery aspect of the object that caught my attention first, after I’d seen the object in front of me. We couldn’t tell if the thing was our over Lake Ontario or just over the land.  Our development is just off the shores of Lake Ontario, and the land swoops out a bit.  It was night and we couldn’t see precisely where this object was.  NOW we are at our cottage; when we go home next Thursday the 17th, we will drive along and look in an attempt to ascertain where the object was situated – if we can figure that out!",2014-04-11T00:00:00,44.01477575757576,-78.39648484848486

We had all the lights off in my room so it was pitch black.   As I’m looking at the stars I notice this one light almost jumping up and down in the distance.  I say to my friend, “Do you see that moving over there?  What is that?”   Initially she goes it’s a plane but I pointed out the way it was moving up and down so quickly there’s no way it could have been a plane.  It was still moving up and down from the left of our field of view to the right.  We both stared at it for another 20 seconds trying to determine what it was.  Soon I notice it is getting closer to us as it’s moving to the right.   I mention this to my friend and she agrees it’s coming closer to us.   I ask her to shut the window but she insists on not doing so yet.  In silence we both stare the object coming closer to my house through the sky.  I can now fully make out the object which is in a shape which is almost similar to that of a peppermint..  It has black rectangular windows evenly spaced around it and the object is rotating counterclockwise as it is moving through the sky closer to my house.  There are small slights spaced around the top and bottom of the circular craft.   We can both also see that there is another craft to the left of it.  The shape we could not determine could only see it was large and possible flat with lights spaced around the perimeter moving downward next to the other craft.   Nether of the crafts made any sound.  As this point we both panic and shut the windows.   My friend sees the second craft go over my house and loses the original one.   We go inside and hide in my closet.

Very clear skies, saw UFO standing still, making no sound in the northern sky.  UFO  had very bright red and green lights  that were  pulsating.  UFO stayed motionless for at least 5 minutes, gradually moved down to the horizon till building (2 story High School) blocked our view.  Lost sight of UFO until it rose above the building , once again it stood still in the sky.While it was in the sky a plane from the west came close to the object.  The Philadelphia international airport is only about 6 miles to the west of our location.  I assume the plane may have been a commercial plane.   Suddenly UFO moved quickly across the sky heading southeast ,came to a stop then slowly moved back till once again it dropped out of view behind High School across the street.   All of us could not believe what we just saw. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I reported a sighting on the night of the 16th to your website.  The next day I started to review videos that were taken using iPhones.  On two of the videos taken, one 9 second long and another that was 48 sec. long, it appears to be another object moving about the UFO I reported.  I did not notice till I watched the videos,that there was another craft.  During the video the craft moves around the reported UFO, which at one point the UFO brightens as the smaller craft seemed to be right next to it.  As this was going on a commercial plane was coming from the west, as it neared the UFO's vicinity,the small craft swooped towards the plane and looks like it almost touches the plane The plane probably just took off from the Philadelphia airport.

At first it was sitting in the same spot but after a few minutes it started moving in our direction which would have been north.  It moved very slow and as we watched the lights started flashing.  We watched to see if it was an airplane but it did not look like an airplane as there were no red lights and the lights that were on it had started flashing and seemed to be moving around the object.  The object was nearly over us and it slanted as it turned and the top of the object had what I can only describe as a dome.  It then began moving faster and as it went over us we could see the lights that were orange and moved around the outside of the object.

I looked into the sky toward the north - this is a habit because I work at an airport that is located in that direction.  I witnessed a orange-red orb that appeared to have flames coming from the top and the area nearest me.  These flames did not flicker and they were slim pointed conic-shaped.   I expected to see the object falling to earth because these flames appeared to be a something that would trail a burning object.  It did not reduce altitude, but continued on a steady plane toward the southwest.  I made video of it with my cell phone and followed it by walking on the sidewalk toward the west.  I recorded it until my phone battery died (late in the day).  I continue to observe it in the SW sky until large trees on the next street obstructed my view.  I decided to cross the street to get a better view - a car was coming so I trotted across to the next corner and allow the car to pass.  I looked up into the SW sky but could not see it because of a large house on the SW corner of the street.  I walked into the roadway to see if I could get a view of it between the house and the large trees.  I spotted it in the sky where I had last seen it.  It appeared stationary.  I looked down the roadway toward the west and saw another object similar to the first. It appear to be hovering over the ocean at about the same altitude as the first.  I am about 5 city blocks from the beach.  I looked at the second object for about 4-5 seconds and it appeared to dim until I could not see it any longer.  I turned my attention to the first object; it was still in the same location.  It then dimmed like the second object and disappeared.  Neither made any sound, if fact, it was very quiet in the neighborhood except for two cars that drove by--not a soul on the streets, which is unusual due to the mild weather and clear sky on a Friday night. I work at an airport in the area and I'm very familiar with the type of aircraft in the skies in and around the area. I know the flight paths and can judge the altitude. These objects appeared to be tracking above the ground the same distance as the traffic pattern for the local flight schools - 1400 ft msl. The color of the objects did not change, nor where there any blinking lights. Strangely, the flames did not illuminate the area around the objects or shine as beams. The bright red-orange color stayed within the shape of the object. Never have I seen anything like this - highly unlikely that these where planes, helicopters, blimps, UAV's, flares, balloons, or any craft that I have ever seen.",2014-02-27T00:00:00,33.994295145631064,-118.46369223300971

My house is on a ridge that looks down into the neighborhoods below and I have a direct view of the Mesa on the west of the city.  I don’t know how far away the top of the Mesa is from my house but I cannot tell if people are standing on the Mesa, they would be too small.  I can see very small Joshua trees that grow on the edge of the Mesa buy they are extremely small. On this night I walked into my bedroom, the lights were not on.  I looked toward the large windows on the west end of my bedroom and noticed a narrow ring of lights surrounding a very large gray circle.  It was as if something was blocking the lighted object behind the gray circle.  It seemed like the object was hanging in the sky just in front of the top of the Mesa.   As I walked toward the window I thought it was the moon, but realized it was much too big to be the moon and in a position in the sky the moon is never in.  Then the object began to light up.  It was a very large white sphere, bigger than a hot air balloon and perfectly round.  It was now hovering above the Mesa.  On each side of the sphere there seemed to be spotlights shining up on the sphere.  The sphere was made of a material that reflected light and made the sphere look shiny and smooth.  There was also light illuminating from the bottom of the sphere down onto the mesa this lighting was not as bright as ! the spotlight type lights.  There seemed to be black appendages attached to the bottom of the sphere.  The bottom of the sphere was very brightly lit but I could clearly see the top of the sphere though it was not as lit up.  I began to question what I was seeing in my mind.  I thought maybe it was four wheelers but realized their lights would not be bright enough to light up this object or for me to see from my house.  The top of the Mesa is only accessible by all terrain vehicles such as four wheelers and motorcycles.  There is not a power source in this area of the Mesa to provide power to a spotlight.  I could not figure out what I was seeing and as I kept watching it, the lights went out.  Now I could only see the gray white sphere but it seemed to be getting smaller.  It was not lit up at all only by the moon.  As I watched it, I realized it was getting smaller and very fast.  I ran into the living room and told my husband to get up and see this object.  He did not kn! ow where I was looking or what I was looking at and couldn’t s! ee it. Besides, by that time, the only thing left was the dome of the top of the sphere and it appeared to quickly sink into the ground with the rest of the sphere. As this event was taking place,  I looked down into the neighborhood below to see if cars were stopping to see this strange phenomenon but I didn’t see any cars traveling the roads or stopping to view this sight.  I then thought perhaps the casino, Casa Blanca, had an event but there had never been any advertising about this and there was no one around to watch it.  I checked the newspapers for the next few days to see if anything had been reported or if indeed the Casa had sponsored an event.  There was never a word mentioned about what I had seen.  I also asked many people around town and none of them had seen anything.  I asked my friend whose husband works for the power company if Nellis Air Force Base had asked them to shut down any power grids for maneuvers they may be performing, but nothing like that had occurred.  I also had her ask her teenage son if he knew if any of the kids had been up on the Mesa and were responsible for what I had seen.  They claimed no respon! sibility.  Another friend asked her Sunday school class if they knew anything about it but they said it was probably the super moon.  I checked that out too and the moon was a crescent during this time not a sphere.  I even looked in Las Vegas online papers to see if it had been reported there but no luck. I am a retired teacher with a masters degree and national board certification in education.  I taught school for 15 years and trained and taught student teachers at the university level.  I do not drink or take drugs of any kind.  I am so puzzled by this.  It has been on my mind continually since it happened so I am reporting it hoping I can forget it. I know this sounds very bizarre.  I did not get a picture but I did draw what I had seen so i wouldn't forget details. i just want to know I am not going crazy!",2014-02-21T00:00:00,36.79222,-114.12791999999999

I thought maybe it was normal up until a several weeks ago.	   	On the night of the incident I woke up at around 2am.  I was working that day and had planned on waking up at 3:40 am.  I woke up to the sound of my dog barking who was in a cage next to my bed.  Let it be noted that when I woke up I was wide awake, absolutely no groggy or sleepiness but a completely aware state.  This is very uncommon for me.  I was also feeling kind of hot and damp from sweat.   I walked my dog downstairs and out of my apartment to a grassy patch.  I looked up towards the side of my apartment I saw a very tall pale figure. 	This figure appeared to be male and nude.  He was tall pale with thick red hair.  He walked away from me and stepped over my apartment's 5 to 6 foot high fence in one slow careful stride.  He quickly disappeared from sight.	 	  	At that point I should note that I was not scared or startled but fixated on the figure.  It wasnt until the following day that I could comprehend what I saw. 	Note that I live near and work at a military base.

The light was super bright, and white or yellowish in color.  The craft appeared to be brown or grayish in color.  We both took turns watching it for over 2 hours, during which the sun came up over the horizon.  The craft did not move from the one spot except very slightly coming closer to us and then going back to its original position.  I tried to film it on my cell phone, but my camera on my phone was not able to zoom in enough to get a clear image.   We both watched the craft change shapes before our eyes into some sort of leaf-like shape, and then it ever so slowly, moved directly up into the sky until it was a small bright light too high up to identify anymore.  The most amazing part of this is that we have now seen it every morning for 7 days in a row.  With only very slight differences in exact position in the sky, and we have now captured video on two different video cameras.   We both know that this was not a star or planet because we clearly watched the stars move right past the craft which remained stationary.  We also observed several planes come within range of the craft and fly right past it, the difference in size of the planes versus the craft we were watching was immense.  The craft appeared to be 50 times the size of the planes.

They both were travelling from west to east about 80 mph fast, straight and horizontal about 300 feet up.  They were travelling parallel to Katella Ave from about Beach Blvd. vicinity when I first noticed.   I ran and got my binoculars and watched as they passed in front of me.

When I turned in my street to my house the light was in front of me and when I got to my house it looked stationary above my neighbors house and to the left a little.   I grabbed my phone and started to video tape it.  It did not seem to be moving and I would notice like a second light flickering occasionally.   I taped for a good while and decided to go get my binoculars and I headed to my back yard.  Throughout the taping you can see the sun rising and birds flying and traffic passing me by.  With the binoculars I could see what looked to be a very brilliant triangular shaped aluminum looking object and could see another object behind it connected by something.   The objects would seem to change shapes like from a triangular to cylinder or flat and shimmering.  Neither object had the same shape.   I video tapped until almost I think 9 am and stayed outside still observing this brilliant light in the sky.  Using my binoculars the object seemed to be going further away because it was getting smaller.  It did not go sideways st all just stayed what seemed to be stationary and only seemed to travel upwards in a very slow time.  Can be seen from my video.   I did take two pictures of the light after daylight came and I was almost finished taping cause my phone was dying.  Can send pictures but video is way too long to upload but very good details of bright light throughout the video.   We live close to refineries and this is nothing to do with them in any way.

It was a bright sunny, not a cloud in the sky, windy day in South Florida; and I was doing my daily jog by the beach in the afternoon.   While heading back jogging south along the beach I looked up into the sky and noticed a strange silver object reflecting sunlight.  At first I figured it was a plane, but then the more I watched it the more intrigued I became and I had to stop and look closer.  It wasn't on the normal flight path that all the other planes come in at towards the PBI Airport and it was flying particularly slow.  The craft was also much higher in altitude than any of the planes and was heading directly west, then it suddenly vanished.  Afterwards I kept walking and a minute later I looked back in that direction only to see the craft again almost in the same location but now was heading directly south and picking up speed then vanished again. I then started walking at slow pace while still staring where the craft disappeared and between a minute or two minutes later it appeared again suddenly, a little further south of where I originally saw it the first two times and was moving very slowly west again and then quickly vanished once more.  Each time I saw the object it remained within sight for approximately five to ten seconds before vanishing.  And was it was difficult trying to see the shape of it as the light was reflecting off of it so strongly and it was at such a high altitude in the sky, but from what I could see it would have been in a more triangular shape. Twenty minutes after the sighting I saw three other regular airline planes heading on the normal flight path to the PBI Airport within five to ten minutes of each other, this helped me solidify what I saw with the craft and helped me make a better comparison as to how high the craft was in comparison to the planes.  I noticed however after all the descending planes going to the PBI Airport there was a fourth plane flying at a much higher altitude (not as high as the craft was) that was not descending but was flying west, and I wondered if it was following the craft or not.",2014-03-18T00:00:00,26.940044657534244,-80.13581534246576

It was New Year’s Eve and we listened to people in the area setting off fireworks, but none were visible from my street.  We were watching the antics with the police and tow truck for a while. At about 12:15 AM, my friend pointed out a bright orb that had just appeared in the sky to the west.  The light cast off of the object was far more intense than any airplanes or helicopters we've ever seen in the skies, so we caught it all on our phones' video cameras. The light from the object had a much deeper amber-red hue to it, which really caught our attention. It traveled a long, curved path and passed overhead.  The object then ascended vertically at a higher speed, until it was it was out of sight completely. About 5 minutes later I spotted a second object (matching the description of the first) suddenly appear in the sky, as if it materialized out of thin air.  It eventually flew straight up into the sky like the first, until it could no longer be seen.  A few minutes later a third one had appeared, hovered, ascended, and went out of sight.  All three objects were slow moving, until they changed courses up to the sky and sped up significantly.  We didn't know what to make of the whole scene in the sky, and we would have filed a report sooner if we had the first clue how to go about doing so.  At least we got some videos of them!

On the night of April 10, 2014, between 2 & 4 am I exited my house by the back door and saw a flash of bright light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a large meteor that had entered the atmosphere.   I ran back into the house to call my roommate to see the large entail it had left in the sky.  When we went back into the back yard less than 30 seconds later, there were two bright red flashing objects flying from the point at which we could see the assumed meteor had hit.  One went to the right of us and behind a tree and the other flew to the left.  They both left white streaks in the sky originating from the exact place where the meteor trail hit the sky line. 	We watched the object on the left as it flew across the sky and at first thought it must be a plane but there are no airports in that direction and it was moving extremely fast.  There was a solitary red blinking light and it left a perfectly straight white line in the sky.  When we stood on the bench in the back yard to get a better view of the lines in the sky we realized that the large object that had come down came from a point in the western sky.  The two red blinking objects left trails from exactly where the meteor would have hit and shot out of the impact site directly back to the exact same point in the sky that the larger object had come from. 	We continued to look to the sky for the next 30 minutes without seeing anything further than the trails.  We tried to take pictures of the phenomenon but the ambient light was too bright to register anything on our phone cameras.  The trail from the large object continued to enlarge for another 30-40 minutes before dispersing. Upon writing this, I can still see faint white lines in the sky from the two objects that flew out of the area we thought the meteor hit.",2014-04-11T00:00:00,31.869177391304348,-102.36950956521738

I am a US Army soldier, with overseas experience.  I have not seen everything, but I have seen a lot.  Over the last few weeks, tonight included, I've seen more. Leaving my girlfriends house here in Springfield, MA, about two weeks ago, I noticed something odd in the sky traveling south in my direction.  It was low, fast, big and soundless.   Looking straight toward it, it was one bright white light.  As it passed it seemed ""domed disk"" in shape.  The white light was in the front and along the edge between, seemingly, the disk and the dome were four different color blinking lights.  Red, blue, amber and teal.  It soon banked south west then quickly south again and then south east.   I was trying to follow it there and lost sight.  That's when it doubled back and went almost directly over head.  I'm not telling you I know what I saw, but I will tell you I know what I didn't see.   I could draw this thing if you asked me to.  Underneath were four circles.  The two in the front were a little smaller than the two in the back.  In each of the circles were the same four colored lights.  The body of the ship connected to them in a curved pattern almos! t like webbed feet and was dark.  The nose flew lower than the tail as well.   It ended up quickly changing direction west toward the CT river.  There it paused for a while.   By this time I made it home and ran in to get a rifle scope for a clearer view.  It left in my attempt.  The night was clear and I tilt my head back in aggravation.  That's when I noticed, spread out, about 9 or 10 very large bright stars.   Using the scope I began to look at them.  They were all blinking.  Tonight, at the same time as the first sighting, 11:30 pm, I left her house again.  I noticed a massive bright light hovering a distance away where I saw the last one advance from.   After a few seconds it began to slowly trek in the same pattern as the first time.  I grabbed my phone for a pic, but the battery was to low.   I put it on the charger and began to follow it again.  It in the blink of an eye sped up.  It banked in the same direction as the last time but never doubled back.   Just as my disappointment  set in from not getting a pic, a second one(have photo) came toward ! me from the left.  I quickly grabbed my phone and got off one shot before it sped away.   The night is very cloudy(3-25-14) as snow is expected to fall.  This photo is NOT the moon.  You can see barely how low it it is and the image was bigger and closer than my cheap camera phone makes it appear.  None the less, you can see it.   I text a buddy in CT as they were headed in his direction.  He is fairly well learned on popular aircraft so he got in his car to see if he could spot them.   Skeptical at first, his attitude quickly changed.  I cannot word for word give you his testament, but we would gladly meet with you to discuss what we saw.   He got a very good view that left him slightly spooked.   Know this, I have never had a drop of alcohol in my life, nor do I smoke, use drugs, or am I on medication.  What I saw, I saw.  I have never been a skeptic, but at the same time, never thought I'd get to see it for myself.

Then, the four or possibly five lights, split off from formation, appearing to go upward, then disappeared.  I hate to make this comparison, but they looked very much like the preliminary aircraft first shown in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, kind of streaking off in different directions. I opened my moonroof, hoping to hear the sound of jet engines or something that might help identify the lights, but there was only silence.

The first object was a bright orange/red orb that stayed a consistent brightness and did not have any of the FAA required strobe lights or any perceived shape other than being a bright orb of light. The second object i could identify and was an F/A-18 Hornet.  Living in the flight path of Los Alamitos Air Force base, I know exactly what an F/A-18 sounds like, as well as where its strobes are located as opposed to the similar sounding F-16 which hardly ever uses this Los Alamitos Air Force base which is in their direction of travel, which I'd estimate being 4 miles away.  But due to the speed of travel and how they were not on a flight path I've ever seen used, I'm guessing that the F/A-18 was either chasing the UFO or they were traveling together to a location further inland. I'd also like to add that the ufo was FAR brighter than the strobes on the jet, like comparing a candle to a mag-light.

Ok, here goes... I was driving north on 31 not quite half way between Peru and Rochester...  Not too sure exactly where but it was about 10.03 pm  Yes I looked at my clock as it flew over me).  I just looked over to the west and spotted want I thought was a really bright star and to be honest, didn’t think anything of it.  I just kept driving. I looked over again and it seemed to be much bigger and brighter.  As I watched it (as well as try to keep my eyes on the road, it started to get closer.  It was very low to the ground and seemed to be no more than a couple of hundred feet up. The bright light suddenly split into two lights (it probably was 2 lights all the time but as it was in the distance, looked like one).  I tried to see if I could make out any of the normal colored lights that all aircraft have on them but could not see any.  As it got closer, I realized it was big.. I could see smaller white light down the sides of it.  As I started to make out a shape (now take into account it was dark so as we know, eyes play tricks in the dark), I knew this was not a normal aircraft.. It was shaped like a boomerang with the two lights on the front end of it. I know that aircraft fitted with large landing lights have them on the wings just out from the main fuselage but it was not like this.  I couldn’t make out a nose cone or any kind of body behind the wing shape.  Ok, there are aircraft similar to this and I have seen them.  I grew up by a military aircraft manufacturing plant and have seen many many planes.  Regular design, alpha wing, reverse wing, old and new but this was not like any that I remember. As it got closer I realized that it was going to go almost right over the top of me and it did... well maybe just a little ahead because I watched it through my windscreen.  It was huge and like I say seemed to be really low to the ground... a couple of hundred feet at most.  When I say huge, I have seen and been really close and on a 747 and also a concord and it seemed to be bigger than this.  It was way too low to be just flying around and why have your landing lights on if you’re not landing because there is no airfield close enough for something that big to land around there except for Grissom and that is way south.  As it flew over me I was expecting a lot of noise but nothing... I tried to follow its path but as I took my eyes off it and pulled back my sun visor to the sun roof and be able to see it and then out of my side window..  It was gone..  I scanned around and nothing...  No lights, no shape, nothing. There were no other vehicles around, nothing in front except for one way of in the distance but I could not see anything behind me.  Crap... why is it always that way. I have no idea what it was.  Was it a plane that either I could not make out because it was dark but if so, why no coloured lights on it…  Or a strange design that I have not seen before...  Maybe it was Stealth tech because they are an odd shape.  A Vulcan bomber, they have the delta wing shape, or something else.  No I did not get abducted,  ((Passage deleted))  I have not had any strange antenna popping out of it.  What did I see, no idea so by definition it was a UFO.",2014-04-18T00:00:00,40.8223,-86.1155

It moved from the east (from the furthest possible point I could see) to west, then hovered in the western sky.   I looked at it though binoculars, but could see no definition or shape; the lights were clearer.  I ran inside to wake my wife.  She came out and was unimpressed, until it turned a much brighter red (the white lights either turned off or were overshadowed by the red lights) and quickly descended, swaying downward.   Due to trees blocking my vision, I'm not sure what happened after.",2014-04-18T00:00:00,28.006814358108112,-82.47646101351351

The witnesses included myself, a neighbor and his son.  My neighbor had already been witnessing the event for fifteen minutes when I joined them.  We observed several red lights, moving unusually fast from the Southeast direction at a diagonal towards the Northwest. For an estimated 40 minutes total, they kept coming, 60 seconds to 3 minutes apart, following the same diagonal trajectory; initially in pairs, then one after another. Immediately, we noticed that this was not any aircraft, airplane or helicopter, as the red light was disembodied, and pulsing/ flickering irregularly (like a candle) as opposed to uniform regular flashing as with a helicopter.  The red lights also seemed to have a red halo.  They also seemed to be close enough (at helicopter height) that we should have been able to make out the body had it been a man-made aircraft. The movement was unusual: it would zoom from the horizon in a quick burst, then stop and remain stationary for a minute or two, before shooting straight up into the atmosphere and disappearing at an incredible speed.  Sometimes, after coming to a stop, they would slowly turn in meandering half circles, before shooting up. At one point, one of these red lights shot up close to passing airplane (we live close enough to the airport to see several passing planes at various heights) and we were able to observe that it began below the plane and shot up above it as it made its ascent at tremendous speed.

At approximately 7:50 PM EST / 19:50 Echo / 0:50 UTC - ZULU time, I was having a cigarette and star gazing.  I was staring at my neighbor's back yard across the way from mine towards the east north east - when I turned my head up, and towards the south east (ESE) of my position I suddenly noticed two bright, white, stationary objects side by side - somewhat resembling bright planets or stars ((sic)),such as Jupiter, Uranus, or Venus would naturally appear from a normal ground viewing vantage point).  The object on the right side being about 30 degrees lower in the sky than the other object on the left. The objects were a little brighter than Venus - and both actually somewhat resembled how Venus looks to a naked eye observer.  The objects were an unremarkable white color.  They reminded me of how two close binary stars would appear if they were close enough to our solar system to be that bright in the night sky.  They were brighter than Venus - and about as bright as an aircraft at night with it's fog beams / spot lights on. When I first saw them - I knew that they were not there a few moments earlier - and I also reasoned to myself that they could not be stars because they were simply too bright - and they were not planets because only Venus approaches that magnitude of brightness - and there is only one Venus.  My exact knee jerk first thought was "" Those can't be planets - and there isn't a constellation that looks like that!"". The higher object after a few seconds appeared to begin to very slowly and subtly move (or rather ""float"" or ""drift"") upward - curving a little to the right, but the motion was again, very subtle and gradual. After a few minutes - maybe about three minutes - both objects then faded out completely, metaphorically as if under the influence of a ""dimmer switch"" - until they were visually un-trackable. I was stunned - and started to run back into the house when I decided to take a quick look around to see if maybe more were up there - and I glanced four, maybe five other objects at an extremely high altitude to the north east (NNE) ""swimming"" around each other - before finally separating and heading in a northerly direction (a few appeared to travel ENE, while at least two others looked to be headed due North).  These objects were dimmer and less perceivable than the objects that I had just witnessed a few seconds earlier - due again - to their greater altitude, but all were basically points of light.  One object appeared to have a more pinkish color hue than the others - and appeared to be either a tad bit brighter, or possibly larger - this object was one of I believe two that drifted away in a more Northward direction. The entire incident lasted from about 7:50PM EST (0:50 ZULU), to 8:05PM (1:00 ZULU). It is my desire to remain anonymous.

At first my mother and I were trying to rationalize it, but in our hearts we knew exactly what it was because we have witnessed them before on New Years Eve 12/31/13 twice in one night at separate times.  The only difference between this sighting and our last sighting is that there was only one single fireball this time.  They usually show up in groups of 5 or more.    We know this because of our previous sightings from New Years Eve.  The sighting we witnessed tonight was just one fireball.  It had the same characteristics as our previous sighting. It was not high up in the sky and it appeared to be rising.  It was gradually floating up further and further into the sky while it simultaneously pulsated.  It was red and had a orange tint, but more red than orange.  It was a lot larger than any star we had seen in the sky, about 3 times the size.  It was the only object that was that low in the sky.  It would appear larger every time it pulsated.  We watched it for about 2 minutes or so making sure that it is a fireball before we e went ahead and reported it.

I was shoveling snow from my deck at the back of the house after shoveling snow from my driveway in the front of my house.  The front of the house faces almost due east.  I would periodically stop about once every five minutes or so to drink a sip of water and to catch “my breath”.  I looked up (in a north north westerly direction) to admire the clear blue skies when I noticed two “birds” flying very high and moving slowly in a westerly direction. It struck me as being odd that they we as high as they appeared, not knowing what kind of “white” birds these were or how large they were.  One was about twice as small and appeared to be higher than the other.  Then they began to move in a manner which didn’t fit the movement of birds at all.  I then noticed that didn’t have wings and were white spherical objects, the largest about the size and color of the period on a computer keyboard. The higher one stopped and the lower one continued in the same westerly direction I first noticed them, it then reversed (180 degrees) direction and moved rapidly about 3 degrees in that opposite direction for about one second, it reversed direction again, then again a third time and then it stopped.  While this was happening the second object climbed straight up while they both stopped moving at about the same time.   The second object, at the higher altitude (again about one half the size as the other object) would appear then disappear while they both were stopped.  They both remained stopped for about three seconds then they both spiraled upwards and disappeared in less than two seconds.  Unfortunately, I didn’t record the event because:  1) it happened as fast as it did, 2) it took me a moment to realize this was not a couple of birds, 3) I thought I had left my cell phone in another jacket, turns out I did have it, I had put it in my back pocket when I took the jacket off.   About 5 minutes after these two spherical objects disappeared a high flying jet with one vapor trail passed over flying to the same location as the two objects were.  This jet appeared (best estimate) to be above 45,000 feet, no sound and appearing all white as it flew over such that I could only see the underside of the plane.  The jet appeared to be less than one forth inch long at arm’s length.",2014-02-21T00:00:00,38.834675195822456,-76.77255691906005

Dark grey in color with dull green lights at the points. I go out running almost every night.  On this particular night, I was so hungry, I had a pretty decent sized sandwich a short while before going out.  This wasn't the best decision I've ever made, but it lead to the sighting of this massive UFO.   During one portion of my run, my stomach cramps became too much.  I stopped at a bus stop bench to take some deep breaths.  After a few moments of sitting there, the street light beside the bench unexpectedly went out.  Jokingly, I saw this as a sign that I should continue walking.  I was near the University of Florida campus, walking right in front of the Law School Library, which is usually open 24 hours and always lit.  This building too was completely dark.  Finding this strange, I continued walking. As I walked forward along the sidewalk, a fairly small plane flew over head, but very close.  Closer than any plane I'd seen flying before.   Again, I found this strange and as I continued walking I realized that I had seen numerous planes in the sky that night and had thought it weird.  Up until this point, I wasn't thinking anything supernatural, just that strange occurrences continued to happen. To my left after the Law Library, is where the University has it's tennis courts.  All of the lights for the tennis court were on.  As I passed by they turned off at the same time, and at this point I started getting a little freaked out.  I began jogging again despite the pain in my stomach.  As I continued forward along the road, there was a gap in the trees as I noticed something out of the corner of my eyes that I found strange. It could have been the wings of a plane, but they were diagonal in the sky, something you never see with planes, and it was much too large.  Intrigued, I stopped and looked at it straight on. It was a massive rectangle structure that looked as if it were completely thin. It was a dark gray color that made it hard to see it against the dark blue back drop of the sky. Around it's edges it was a darker black. On the points of the object, there were dull glowing green lights (which had added to my initial thought that it could have been airplane wings).  This thing was pretty low - lower than any aircraft (but not as low as the previous airplane I'd seen that night), and it was diagonal against the sky. When I stopped to pay attention to it, it seemed as though it were moving toward me but when I made eye contact with the thing, it just stopped and hovered. Silently. I heard all the regular noises around me, but nothing came from this massive object.  As I watched it, it moved in such a strange motion, it's hard to describe with words. It didn't seem to have any dimension, but it moved as if it did. It kind of turned in on itself and turned toward another area of the sky and quite easily began to make it's way forward. In relation to the University of Florida campus, it was near the stadium.  It flew in the sky with the ease you would see a river flowing. It was so natural. There were some tree coverage so as it moved toward where I wouldn't be able to see it, I sprinted. I ran to another portion of the sidewalk with a clear view of the sky. But when I was finally able to see, the thing was gone.  It had flown with a speed that I have never seen. With no noise. And it was an object that made no sense to be up in the sky like that. It could only have been an alien space craft or government weapon. Who knows.",2014-03-18T00:00:00,29.646086792452827,-82.38107610062893

Last night, I observed a bunch of UFO's over my house.  I'm really glad that I decided to write down what I saw last night as it was happening...  I couldn't get good pics or video & wanted to make sure I was actually seeing what I saw...  So, I just kind of started writing out what I was seeing & doing just to know I would remember this night!   Later, I tried talking myself out of what I saw throughout the night, & next morning, but I'm sure what I saw was real & when I read my description from last night, I realized that I can't talk myself out of it anymore...   So I'm submitting my notes from last night that describe the entire event.  It's mostly chronological so it's how it was unfolding.  I left it all in, even a few of my personal feelings about some of the things going on. I started writing about 5 minutes after I first saw the UFO's in the sky.  At about 12:15pm, yesterday on Friday night, March 14, 2014:  - Seeing a fleet of UFO's fly over my house right now!  Omg!  They look like seeing tiny stars or satellites.  Like when watching a satellite from space go thru the sky, except not blinking or twinkling, just solid.  There are WAY too many to be a satellite or even a group of satellites...even if somehow all these satellites could be up there at once.  But I've never seen anything like this before!  I was looking up at the sky tonight while walking my dog.  I walk my dog every night & I like to ""sky watch"" while I walk.  I was staring at what I think was Jupiter because I was thinking how big & red the ""Star"" looked, & when I realized it wasn't twinkling I figured it must be a planet...  Then I noticed that some of the stars were moving!  I had to do a double take & then said those are really moving!!  All white in color like a ""white star"" looks & they are all the same exact size of a small star & about as bright.  At first I saw about 5-7 & then more.  Then I'd see only a few, then 10-20 or so more staggered thru...  A lot of them are flying exactly parallel with another one (craft/light).  But not all of them do.  They are flying kind of slowly & are staying around the same pace, but not all in one group.  They are all over this section of sky near the moon, but not in other areas of the sky... I can see them through the clouds & above/below them as well.  I can also see them when there are no cloud in the sky bear the moon.  They are all flying across the sky near the moon going from what I think to be East - West but it looks like they are going towards the PDX airport which is South of Vancouver.  I will have to confirm the directions I am looking. They are going very slowly across the sky still.  They are flying with no trails of light, contrails or any other obvious features.  Since I couldn't get my husband to come & look (he was sleeping) I am desperate to have somebody witness what I am seeing!  First, I just called my mom to see if she could see what I was seeing, but she said she couldn't see anything, which I kind of figured because she's across town.  Then I decided to call 911... I felt kind of stupid after I started telling him about what I'm seeing!  Like I said ""sorry!  I'm not sure what I thought you could do for me!""  Lol... At that point I asked, but he hadn't gotten any other calls about anything strange in the sky, but he did give me the State UFO hotline phone #, which was really nice of him & that made me feel better, lol... So I called & I left a message with the hotline he gave me & I also called MUFON... I didn't get anyone live, but it was 1am!  I don't really expect anyone waiting by the phone!  I guess I just really want to tell someone what I'm seeing!  It's frustrating to be seeing this alone!!  I've tried to take pictures & video but I can't see anything on the screens!  I think they are too small to see with my crappy camera...  I'll have to check later on my computer if any came out, but I only have my phone & an older camcorder that was dead, so I got an extension cord & drug it out the front window towards the front yard/driveway where I have been standing all night, so I could plug the camera in & try to film something.  I couldn't zoom in on anything because the lights were very tiny like stars & the moon was pretty full & bright & that's all my camera would focus on...  Argh!  This sucks!!  It's now 1:15am.  Been seeing them from around midnight till now, at least over an hour so far. Reminds me of the videos you see on Youtube that show little fleets of tiny crafts flying & zipping around the atmosphere, except these ones I see are much slower...  Kind of a cautious pace.  Not sure if each ""dot"" is singular or just visible lights on a larger ship that isn't completely visible....?  They keep coming pretty steadily...  By the end of this night I think there could be 50+ ships at the very least... I'm sure I can't even see them all.  Can't seem to get them on camera but have to check the pics/vid later to be sure... Can't get bobby to help me verify this... It really pisses me off!  How can you not want to come & look if your wife tells you they see weird lights in the sky that you think could be UFO's?!  He said I must be seeing stars!  Yeah... ok Copernicus!  Stars don't move like that!  These are definitely not stars.  Not like I've ever seen in my 31 years!  He's not really much into science or astronomy... things like that, but jeez! I love the night sky & I watch it nightly... I am familiar with normal activity, but this wasn't normal at all...!  Tomorrow I will take pics of my area during the day in case anyone is wondering.  This is pretty much the biggest thing that's ever happened as far as something like this goes & I really can't believe what I'm seeing...even though it's right in front of me!  I've always thought there was other life out there...  But seeing this is life changing! I've been out here for about 2 hours watching the sky... I can't imagine I'd stare @ the sky for 3 hours for no reason...  It's cold out here too! I'm chilled to the bone!  And I'm 10 feet from my house!  Duh!  Go inside, lol!!  Just now about 1:30am now, while watching the sky I see an extra bright one paired with the reg. ""dimmer"" version that I have seen the whole time with it...  Haven't seen one this bright...! Then the 2 seemed to stop. A plane was flying nearby with only reddish blinking lights & a small dissipating contrail.  It flew ""by"" (not sure of actual distance) the stopped ""star crafts"" & they didn't move...  At the same moment I started watching 3 others little reg. star crafts come in rather faster than normal.  One was even trying to catch up... then they seemed to stop as well...  Thats when the plane that kept flying by before, with the red lights, went by them just after they too had stopped - I thought maybe the crafts try & disguise themselves as stars? They were directly over head... 1:41am. So now I don't know what I'm seeing... It is really weird! None of them had stopped before.  I tried staring at the 3 that stopped for a long time to see if they would ""move"" so I could believe that my eyes were just messing with me...  But they didn't budge.  I know what I saw. I even saw the last of the 3 trying to catch up with the other 2 before they stopped.  Same with the bright one & the reg. one that I saw just before. I clearly saw them move from out in the distance & then stop.  But when I see them still there it's hard to say it was them, but maybe that's why they do it?

Weather: rain/overcast/not windy   As I was driving home from work south along SW 38th Ave(along side of I-75) I noticed off to the right through the windshield (approx 2 o”clock position) along the top of the tree line, two bright reddish orange lights separated by what I would guess a few hundred feet in the sky below the cloud layer (it had just began to sprinkle rain again) of probably a 200-300ft ceiling.  My impression was that they were no more than a mile or less away from me.  At first I couldn't tell if they were moving. As I proceeded I did perceive they were moving slowly, not in tandem but the same general direction.  They didn't seem to be joined.  They move towards the southwest, almost paralleling my route.  NO other lights or “navigational lights” were seen.  After about 2 minutes the light farthest west of me disappeared.  Followed by the second one at approximately the same point in the sky a minute later.  I could not determine if they just turned off the lights or flew above the cloud layer or just disappeared. VERY weird. As I continued driving I couldn't stop thinking about what I had just seen.  A minute or so later I had the urge to look at the same spot where I had first seen them to see if there would be more and much to my shock there were EIGHT more strung out over I would guess a distance between a half to one mile long.  There was no type of ""formation"" to them, just scattered across the sky.  All exactly the same color and intensity as the prior two.  They followed the same movement as the first two.  Again they didn't seem to be joined together in any way. I watched them as I continued driving for the next 2-3 min.  I finally got so frustrated that I had pay attention to driving I simply stopped the car in the road got out in the light rain to watch them unimpeded.  I watched for another 2-3 min.  Again my impression, based on the low cloud cover, was they couldn't have been more that a mile away from me.  Probably placing the one closest to me no more that a half a mile maybe less.  I could hear NO sound coming from them.  I even cupped my hands behind my ears for at least a minute to try and determine if they were engine driven. NO sound.  They then began to “disappear” one at a time just as the prior two had.  WIERD. At this point I was exhilarated and could wait to get home and tell my wife. I was very disappointed that I was so close to home but could make it there to rouse my wife to see them in time.  Well one more time as I turned down my street I looked back to the same spot and once again I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, there in the sky were two more.  Same as the last 10. I raced inside to get my wife up to see them.  She WASN'T happy.  Until she looked out the bedroom window to see them.  We watched them for a couple of minutes till they followed the others to the southwest and finally “disappeared”.  Made no sense to her either.  Now she can't say I'm crazy.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,29.153170016207454,-82.11931701782821

It seemed to appear out of nowhere. The sky was clear. At first we thought it was some kind of flaring firework because people had been setting off fireworks in the area as the New Year began 45 minutes prior.  We were baffled that this “firework” was suspended motionless in the air as we were driving past it.  It was more baffling that, upon further observation, the light appeared to be an illuminated, orange ball hovering in the sky.  It did not appear perfectly round like a sphere; but, rather, it looked more ecliptic or egg shaped.  The object was to the right, or east, of us by a perceived 200 or 300 meters away.  After looking at it for about 15 or 20 seconds as we were driving by, the object suddenly started moving!  It travelled northward.  Neither my daughter nor I heard any noise emanating from it. With my curiosity peaked, I proceeded to “chase” the object and turned eastbound as it continued northbound, east of us.  The object appeared to start accelerating and gaining altitude as I drove under its path of flight.  At this point, I got my phone camera rolling. I turned northbound at the next street.  However, the object was now going too fast to catch up while driving down residential roads.  I stopped my car and continued filming for a few more seconds until it was too far and faint for the camera to pick up anymore.  However, I could still see it with my eyes as it changed its heading from north to northeast.  I could tell that it changed course by using a street light as a reference point. As the object was moving, its illumination had a slow, subtle pulse to it in about 2 or 3 second intervals, from bright to dim then bright again, repeatedly.  The pulsing was very subtle and not immediately obvious. This was NO Chinese lantern!  It had started moving from its initial stationary position much too quickly. It was not windy; 5 mph at the most.  This also had too much range and speed to be a remote controlled helicopter.  If it was a drone or UAV, why would it be illuminated orange as a whole?

We went outside onto our porch as this seemed strange as aircrafts do not follow that closely and suprisingly there were no sounds as a low flying aircraft would make.

That is what was in the sky that day.  It look like a fly planet!",2014-03-21T00:00:00,40.8176,-74.0022

March 15, 2009, between 21:30 and 22:30 I-10 South of Phoenix, East of South Mountain.   I was driving back to my job in Tucson on Sunday night, (03/15/2009) from visiting my wife in Ontario, California.  I was driving on I-10 just south of Phoenix, east of South Mountain.   I saw the stars being blacked out by something huge (UFO) moving in the air.  A big rig truck a lane or two to the right slowed down and the driver leans forward to look up through his windshield.  Other drivers also slow down and look up.   I take my foot off of the accelerator to look up through the large front windshield of my 1983 Toyota Supra and see something big, black, slow and silent, couldn’t hear anything but the road noise of the cars and trucks on the freeway.  This “UFO” was moving from behind me (North) in a South-East direction.   I then noticed a small flare, bottle rocket or meteorite come from above the huge UFO and hit the leading edge of the left wing and break up into many small pieces.  It really looked like a lit meteorite hitting the leading edge of the left “wing” and then brea! king into many lit pieces.  I thought this was very strange that a meteorite would just happen to fall to hit this very unusual object as it glided over, a strange coincident indeed.   I was driving about 70-75 mph in that stretch of the freeway and the object was moving slightly faster over me in a Southeast direction.  I then thought the object which hit the UFO could have been a bottle rocked but I thought again about this because when it hit, it sounded like a pebble hitting something made of metal because it made a slight ringing sound.  I remained uncertain as to what I had observed as I completed my drive home to Tucson. The next day the incident was all over the papers but I still didn’t make the connection to what I saw because when I saw the UFO I didn’t see any Lights other than the “meteorite” which broke up when it hit the left “wing” and shatter into lit pieces.  The UFO was totally black, blocking out the stars as it passed but seemed to be slightly illuminated by the city lights below. Years later, I read people accounts stating that they felt no fear.  I recall that I also did not feel fear but more curiosity and confusion, like, ""What Is That???"" I’ve seen large planes up close before, B-52, B-747, C-5, Hughes Aircraft Co.’s Spruce Goose, and the Space Shuttle, etc.  None can compare.",2014-03-21T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

(The sensors react to the reflections of the water and so on) any way, that was what I was doing in the back of my villa. Mindless tinkering. After I had finished I went back inside and checked over all the pictures because it wasn't a bad shot and I wanted to keep it.  That's when I discovered this anomaly on one of my pictures. I've observed it as much as I can and it looks as if it was in the background, behind the tree's in the sky. Not a bug of any kind that I've seen as most are solid black or bright yellow.  Also, out of all the other shots I had taken, this was the only one with something different in it. Unfortunately I didn't see it with my own eyes, I only noticed it once the picture was taken. Didn't even see it on the view finder. (1080p screen at that).   There are plenty of examples in the picture to gauge a size, I'm no professional but it looks pretty big but It's most defiantly in the sky.   The coloration of the object and the fact one of the leaves is covering the left UFO in the picture.  Same with the exit UFO on the right. I was located at the time on a very secluded island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. I have another picture in of the same shot, different time to compare against. The island itself is a quiet one and I have been there three times for the past three years. This last time was the quietest of all.

I stopped to call my wife and tell her to come out and look but as soon as i dialed and looked back up it was gone.  I waited outside for 15mins never to see it again.  VERY STRANGE.

I happened to look out our front window--and saw a very bright light shining like a flashlight in the sky but seemingly not moving in the southeastern quadrant.  Much too bright for a star.  Apparently not one of those cargo planes that land at a nearby AF base.  I looked through my 15x70 astronomical binoculars--and what I saw was a plus-sign shaped arrangement of bright lights covering the center of the binocular's field of vision--perhaps a half dozen or so each way with streams of light coming from the four ends. Sort of like a cross of headlights.  Steady, not flashing, yellow-white.  My wife watched it too--she told me not to go outside!  I watched it on and off for over an hour until it disappeared with daybreak.  As I kept watching it appeared to move very slowly westward--as if it was stationary in the sky, but changing its apparent position with the Earth's rotation as the stars do.  That would mean it was very high up above the reach of our gravity and therefore given its appearance in the binocs, very large.  Perhaps an object reflecting the rising Sun?  But the Sun was well below the horizon, the lights were facing my direction, and they hardly looked like reflections. Anyway, what kind of object could it be?  Space station?  Doesn't look like that.  Satellite?  No way. ""Craft""?  Well, it was evidently not a natural phenomenon. Of course, I e-mailed the relevant authorities and media, and of course they will ignore it.

Lone orb 5 min later Myself and 6 other people were on a 9th floor rooftop in Washington D.C.'s Dupont Circle neighborhood at roughly 10:30 PM.  Something directly above me caught my eye.  I looked up to see 8 orbs of light flying silently in formation about 2000 yards up.  The orbs looked to resemble what we know as a plane.  Four orbs in a straight line with two orbs going out to each side and angled toward the back of the formation at the midway point of the 4 in-line orbs.  It was immediately evident that this was not a plane however as the clouds that were in the back ground (much higher in the sky) were clearly visible in the space between the orbs.  The orbs of light traveled in this formation for roughly 15 seconds going south to north.  At the 15 second mark the formation went through a synchronized “deformation scramble” into an amorphous unidentifiable jumble (still retaining their individual properties just no longer in a geometric formation of any kind).  The mass of unorga! nized orbs accelerated not over the horizon but directly following our horizontal site line.  The lights then vanished completely at a height I can only describe as three fingers above the horizon (holding my hand out a foot in front of my face) and roughly 5 miles away. Five minutes later someone facing the south (I was facing north) said, “Look another one.”  I again looked immediately up to see a single orb of light, flying at the same altitude and in the same direction as the previous 8 orbs.  This one had a more defined haze of light surrounding it and was lighter/whiter in color.  At around the same distance as the deformation described in the previous paragraph, the single orb began to move laterally; from my view point no more than a 10-15 degree divergence from its northern flight path on either side.  Essentially it began to wiggle back and forth for 5 seconds as it continued its northern progression in the same direction as the previous 8.  The orb then disappeared in roughly the same spot as the ones prior.",2014-02-27T00:00:00,38.907575087012276,-77.02499886426087

As we began moving past them on the bypass we noticed that they were not stationary, and in fact were moving east or northeast.  It also became clear that this was not normal due to the close proximity of the lights to one another.  It seemed as if they were moving in almost a V-shaped pattern although it was not clear. Another piece of information that helped prove that we were not just seeing things was the fact that on the eastbound lane of the bypass there were a few cars stopped and with people out with their phones capturing the same thing we had just passed.

When I first spotted them they seemed to be stationary, but as I changed direction on the road on my way home I realized they were actually moving towards the north.  My original perspective was north of them, so they appeared to not be moving for the few moments I was at that perspective. 2.	  They were only one color, orange/amber.  I have 16/20 vision and I didn't see any other colors.  I can always see the red flashing lights on airplanes whether on approach or very high in the sky. 3.	These objects were definitely within our atmosphere.  I could see stars behind them and they appeared, as usual, far away.  These appeared to be no more than 10,000 feet in the air. 4.	I assumed they weren't military craft because they weren't flying in formation.  There was a lack of night time lights, like commercial craft, and there was a definite lack of a jet engine sound. All of the objects were basically in a straight line from the northern perspective.  I've attempted to create a diagram below using numbers 1-5 to represent each object from left to right.  In case the diagram doesn't copy well.  Objects 1, 2 and 5 were basically in a straight line, although 5 seemed to be a degree or two  higher than 1 and 2.  Object 3 was directly below 2, and object 4 was slightly lower than 2 and 5 (think Orion's belt). -1-                                                    -2-                                                                                                  -5- 								-4-   			              -3-	   When my perspective changed to a westerly direction, they were all moving to the north (right).  Please remember I was the passenger in a moving vehicle on a ""S"" curve.  So my westerly perspective changed to a curving southern direction after about 5 seconds of moving west.  It was obviously difficult to properly assess the speed of all objects simultaneously due to their distance from each other.  I was concentrating mostly on objects 1-3, since object 5 was already almost out of site to the north.  Objects 4 and 5 appeared to be moving at the same speed.  Object 2 was accelerating faster than 4 and 5, 3 was barely moving and 1 was moving slowly or had just started to accelerate.  I would say object 2 was moving the fastest, but it's really difficult to compare it anything.  Was it moving faster than a plane at that altitude?  I can't say because there was no point of reference but the stars and one other plane on approach to FLL. And because of the plane I can definitely say it wasn't a commercial plane.  The color of the objects appeared to be the same color as HID street lamps.  That orange glow you get from High Pressure Sodium bulbs. If this sighting sounds like something worth investigating; I would be willing to draw a diagram.  The event is clear in mind and I doubt will diminish for quite some time.  It was definitely out of the ordinary and unexplainable from my experiences to-date.",2014-03-18T00:00:00,26.0629,-80.2331

I was on my balcony looking west from Rancho Bernardo California, toward the hills above the neighborhood called Westwood, separating North County East from North County West and the Coast. Something caught my eye as flying toward me below the horizon of the hill. Being after dark, I first thought it was an unusually large bird with white tipped wings, but they began to glide north and moved above the horizon, one object began moving ahead and bit faster than the other. With the light of the horizon I began to get my depth of field and could see the two objects were moving north at an extremely fast rate of speed. They continued to remain between my location and the hills, so their distance was less than two miles away.  Their altitude continued to be much lower than the ceiling for the airplanes in the area. I have never seen a UFO before and there was no possible way these were airplanes or anything of earthly origin. They were not very large, but they were! not extremely small like the orbs occasionally described either. They were moving extremely smoothly and at a rate of speed even as they began to increase altitude, as if there was no resistance and the moved far faster than any aircraft we have and making no sound at all. Being so close, there should have been some sound. The movement was much more like gliding, only at an extremely high rate of speed. Just after the forward craft began to distance its self slightly from the craft in the rear, they both accelerated and disappeared heading north.  The light omitted from these craft was constant and white with no blinking or other coloration.  The craft themselves was dark or shadowy, and impossible to make out.  The lights were dimmer than I would have guessed from descriptions that I have heard of UFO sightings in the past and even compared to other aircraft in the area that were much higher and further away.  Due to the flight path of planes moving south from Los Angeles, th! ere were several airplanes in the area, although none in the direct pa th north, south or west of the craft.

I just happened to look up at the sky (there were no stars this night) and saw two orange-red lights slowly moving through the sky side by side.  I thought it was a plane at first.  The two lights then separated from each other and slowly moved apart and then stopped completely and just hovered in the air.  Then, two more orange-red lights appeared right in the area of the original two.  There were now four orange-red lights hovering in the air, not moving at all and all were approximately the same size but, one of the original two lights was the biggest of all four.  Three of the four lights began disappearing and reappearing in roughly the same spot over the next 5 to 10 minutes.  During this time I used my compass on my IPhone and found that the objects were in the southeast sky (I also got some of the lights on video b! ut, it is a bit grainy).  The entire time these objects were disappearing and reappearing, one of the lights, the biggest one of the four, remained illuminated and appeared to slowly grow in size.  Then the large steady orange-red light began dropping smaller orangish balls of light from it.  It dropped about three smaller orange colored lights, which would travel straight down and then disappear after 2 or 3 seconds.  After this occurred, all four of the lights illuminated and moved slowly north, with three of them disappearing again.  The large steady orange-red light traveled out of direction with the other three and headed almost exactly in the direction I was standing at in front of my house.

I walked onto the Common from the NW corner and immediately saw a bright orange light in the sky. At  first, through the trees, I thought it might be a planet and marked its position so I could check on it again when I got to open space. When I did, it had moved and was closer. Being near Logan Airport, I first thought plan or helicopter but there were no blinking lights and it receded to the South South East. At this time I was out on open ground and the first light was out of sight, I saw another single orange light approach from the SW (from my perspective, approaching from the left side of the Hancock tower). It approached at speed, hovered for a minute or two, and then receded to the SSE. At this point there were other people walking through the Common and also looking up, seeing the bright orange light and remarking at it. After the second light was out of sight a third fo! llowed the exact same trajectory in, hovered and receded to the SSE. I decided to go inside, proceeded to tell my wife about the lights and looked out the window to see if there was another out there and there was. I grabbed my binoculars and what I thought I could see was the bright orange light and 2/3rds of whitish eggish shape to the bottom.  This light, like the others, receded to the SSE. I periodically checked out the window the remainder of the evening and saw no other lights.  A couple of other notes: While I was out on the Common, I saw 2 large jetliners take off from Logan and come relatively close to these lights. One of those two times, I thought it was dangerously close,  but it allowed to give a guess at the altitude of the lights, which I would say was between 1,000-2,000 feet.  Also, while I could clearly hear the sound that the jets taking off we're making, and a helicopter to the North, these lights made no sound that I could hear. While I am aware of Chinese Lanterns, these lights each approached at what I would call ""aircraft speeds"", hovered and receded at 90 degree angle from origin at a similar speed.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,42.3416629506008,-71.06563371161549

I was finishing a cigarette before exiting the car, when I looked out my window--driver's side--I saw an airplane at what seemed like a great altitude, and trailing behind it at a short distance was an oval-shaped object.  When I scaled it down to a drawing--since I missed the photo/video opportunity--they were about 1 inch or 1 & 1/2 inches apart.  I'm not sure how far apart that would mean they were actually in the sky.   They were traveling at the same speed.  The oval object was most definitely shiny and silver metallic.  I could tell that the airplane was a solid-white, white-body aircraft.   I saw no logos or other coloration that could indicate what airline this plane was.  Being that I live in NJ which has a few major airports nearby,  I see planes taking off and landing and flying at all kinds of various altitudes.  Often times when they are low enough (probably mid-descent) I can look up and see what airline it is based off the colors or any logos I'm able to see.  Anyway, the airplane flew with the unidentified oval object for about 20 seconds, until they both disappeared behind the same tiny cloud.   It was a mostly clear day with only a few tiny clouds in the sky surrounding the area in which I saw this occur.  I had actually during this time seen them go behind a cloud together and was able to watch them come out the other side...Until they disappeared behind one of them, so I got out of my car and looked around to try and relocate the objects, which I think given the lack of any serious cloud cover, i should have been able to do.   My only explanation for this is that when they went behind the cloud they maybe might have made a hard turn to their right and away from me (they were traveling horizontally across my view from right to left.  I wrote down the latitude and longitude and the degrees north & north/northwest that I began to view the object and when I lost it.   If anyone else has seen! this I will be willing to release that information to them in order to coordinate  and create a clearer picture and maybe figure out what it was.  I was very, very shaken by what I saw; especially in the midst of the Flight 370 drama.   I did not sleep that night and therefore was unable to go to my classes the next day.  In the research I've done since this occurred, other than it being an extraterrestrial, I have eliminated aeromagnetic surveying as what it was through images and descriptions (and the fact that it's done with smaller aircraft and the object that does the surveying is actually physically attached to the plane... and not an oval.   The only earthly explanation I can come up with is that this was an unmanned stealth drone in the skies above a very densely populated, urban area.  Frankly, this idea terrifies me much more than aliens.  In my heart, I kind of doubt this. because the edges seemed rather clear to me, that it was an oval about the same girth as the airplane it followed.",2014-03-21T00:00:00,40.550250322580645,-74.46203032258065

Approx. 4:15 with Non commercial planes following within 30 min. I live approximately 60 miles from the coast and 90 miles south of Los Angeles.  I see aircraft that take off from San Diego and Orange County and head east.  They reach an altitude over my house about 15-20k ft. I also see a lot of government planes that fly over heading east that are roughly about 30-50k ft with chemtrails.   This particular object was east of my location and moving in all directions for about 10 minutes.  Then it stayed stationary for about 15 minutes.  It appeared to be at the height of somewhere around 30-60k ft in the air.   Then the object appeared to move west and all of a sudden I saw what appeared to be a smoke cloud.  It then started to move east and when I heard a jet coming over me and it disappeared.   The jet seemed to be about 40-50k ft in the air with a chemtrail.  I know this because all flights heading east from airports around me cannot get to this altitude in such a short distance.   Then for another 30 minutes I saw 3 jets fly over in the area I last saw the object flying higher than a commercial jet.   Flights coming from Hawaii typically land in LA or Orange County.  A jet flying over me east at that altitude has to be on a continual path from west which doesn't make sense, since the hubs are LA or SD.

They looked like massive birds in the sky but could tell they were some distance away and you would not see a bird that big from that distance, it was dark but they were shining white in the sky, and you could see the 3 of them flying vertically together just above 3 story buildings.  The moon was big at the time before it rose in they.  They were about 20x bigger than the stars in the sky and about an 8th smaller than the moon.

I went out my back door for a cigarette..  From the back door I can see to the east and northeast.  I was on the phone while smoking and something caught my eye and I seen, a perfect strip of large green balls, about 20 of them in a straight line.  It was low, like maybe 1/4 mile high, about a quarter mile out and straight up, about 1/4 mile long.. extending from southwest to northeast.  They turned on like a light switch steady on, bright green, and then all blinked faster and faster until it was like a fast strobe then went out all together at the same time, and this whole thing happened in about 4 seconds. It was so low and close..  I came in and explained to who I was on the phone with what I seen, and said I had to get off the phone to call 911.  I called 911 and explained to them what I seen, the dispatch woman just listened then asked if I could be put on hold.. while I was on hold I seen about 4 bright white close to the ground flashes far out on the horizon in the northeast..  dispatch returned and before she said anything I told her now I'm seeing bright flashes to the northeast.. she then said I needed to contact the akron canton regional airport.. and I asked if she had a number, which she couldn't supply me.. so I didnt bother calling because I doubt id get anything but a help desk.   I called who I was talking to before calling 911, they live north east from me, and they seen the flashes also.  I checked online with aep (american electric power) they have an outage map, and here in stark county 501-2000 were without power in this county.. and the ufo was about 7 minutes before transformers blew out north east from here.  And I believe the ufo was the cause of the power outage.   It was mostly clear out, and I could see the stars.. hardly any wind.  The string of green orbs didnt move, they were still.. its like they appeared, then went off.. it was way too close to the ground and it couldnt be anything explainable.   No sound, no booms, just there, then gone.  I dont know if it was 15 to 20 different objects or one solid object, i seen no outline, but it was perfect execution of them all on at the same time, all start strobing at the same time, and all out at the same time.   And im in a residential area.. and I dont think I was the only one to see it.   What i wonder is if there is an explainable reason for the power outage part, but it seems too much of a coincidence to me.  It wasnt neat seeing this.. it was scary, if I could take it back I would.  It was too close to my house and too low.   I have proof on my phone when I called 911, I have nothing else. . but like I said about the power outage must be a part of it. I left a voice mail on the hotline number.. I would be happy to talk to someone. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Massillon secondary report 20 green lights and power outage. Follow up on my report, I contacted the massillon independent and the American Electric Power Company (AEP) I spoke to a woman in the news department.  I dont remember her name, she said no one has reported anything and it was the first she heard.  She said she wrote the info down and will hold onto it if anyone else calls.  She also said maybe it was a plane... so whats the point in talking to her, she isnt going to make any mention of it in the newspaper. I called AEP, and didnt say I seen anything, just requested information on the outage.  She said it happened about 9:30 pm which is in line when I was on the phone with police and seen flashes after the ufo. She said it doesn't say in her system the cause of the event (ie: a squirrel) she said maybe something ""hit"" the line.  An insulator blew out and some other part with it I don't remember what its called.  At 3am when I went to bed aeps website stated the power was still out..  That's 5 and 1/2 hours later, I dont know when it was restored, but thats a long time. If it matters, searching google a mufon report comes up from feb 3, 2014.  20 lights in the sky moving of a different color in massillon ohio.  Mufon case number listed as 53907. Sounds similar, except the color and the fact that it was moving at high speed. I did my job reporting this, contacting the police, news paper, and power company..  I'm not an investigator, and I dont care to be known to any newspaper because nothing good will come  of doing so.  I let it be known something was here, and someone seen it. It was from outer space without a question, and I'm unnerved why it was even here and what made them decide to flash lights and knock out power.  Didn't seem welcoming, it was a small attack.

I walked out onto the balcony and saw the two objects she described.  They were constantly flashing different colors, some bright, some very dim.  The two objects looked as if to be playing with each other.  They would speed up, slow down to a hover, go vertical and do zigzags.  They were very far away to the North of Fair Oaks so I could not see the shape of the objects. I have never seen any aircraft that could move in this way, not even the new F-35.  At first I speculated it could be USAF doing tactical maneuvers in a way not seen before.  My girlfriend then told me that she, my aunt and cousin were seeing at least 5 of these lights maneuvering around.  I do not believe the military would practice in this way- many aircraft doing random maneuvers at night, nor do I believe any known aircraft can move at the velocities and trajectories I observed.  Girlfriend mentioned she watched some ! of them rise up vertically and then suddenly drop a long way before going back to a hover.  She also described seeing them multiply as if duplicating themselves.  There were no sounds.  After the objects disappeared, an airplane flew to the area and seemed to be investigating the air zone that the objects were in.  I could see that this was an airplane due to the type of flashing lights it had, as well as it's forward facing ''headlights''.  After a few minutes investigating the area it flew back South East with the typical sound you would expect to hear from an airplane.

The object was really low, though, and right as I was about to look away, I saw it jerk to the West suddenly.  My initial reaction was “what the hell?”  I thought then that it might be a meteor that was splitting up, and that it was so low it might hit nearby. My view was partially obscured by the bare branches of a tree in front of me, so I moved out away from the tree to see if I could verify it was just an aircraft or meteor.  I kept my eye on the thing as I walked out away from the building I live at, and it continued to jerk side to side as it headed North. When I got a good view of it without any obstructions, I could tell it wasn't a plane.  There were no flashing lights.  It wasn't making any sound at all, and it was moving significantly faster than any aircraft that pass by here.   As I watched, I noticed it was gaining altitude.  It wasn't heading straight up, but it definitely arced upwards and kept on its path North.  After a few seconds, the jerking motions stopped and the center of the object actually blacked out while I still had a clear, unobstructed view, so the thing became this dim red halo of light against the night sky. I watched it a few more seconds, thinking it was going to disappear, because it was definitely headed up, but it actually picked up speed and just kept going North.  Last I saw, it was speeding off.

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, It looked half the size of the full moon in the night sky.  Kind of a hazed orange/yellow glow.  Since it was night I could not truly tell how high it was in the air.  Seemed to be between 100 and 200 feet and rising slightly I know for sure it was not an airplane or helicopter and lasted too long to be a flair.  It also moved in a linear path and seemed to be rising slightly as it went south to north from east Elk Grove toward Sacramento.

I had stopped atop a hill and was looking towards the west, when I spotted a large group of lights (just one object) that appeared straight across.  They were flickering and I seen red, what appeared to be green, and white.   At first, I thought it was a large aircraft in the distance coming towards me but after observing this for approximately 5 or more minutes it was not moving.  It appeared to be hovering around an area we call top of the world, a small community 15 miles west of Globe, Az, in the mountains, very secluded area.  I judged the lights to be approx 15 to 20 miles away from where I was.   It was a clear night with many stars visible.  I contacted our main gate dispatch center at 12:06 am and told our on duty dispatcher what I was observing.  She kinda laughed and told me earlier that night at approximately 08:30 pm she was texting with her daughter and her daughter (13 years old) said mom I see a ufo.  She told her daughter yea right but she said her daughter told her she was being serious.   Now getting back to what I seen.  After the call to my dispatch (I was inside of my vehicle when I made the call), I went back out and was still observing this object still not moving lights flickering and contacted my partner at 12:09 and told him what I was observing.  He was approximately 5 miles away and told me he could see the lights also.  He said he was going to drive about 3 miles west of my location to try get a better view.   At approximately 12:11am, I noticed what appeared to be 3 helicopters on flying below, on above and one in front fly by the area of the first spotting and continued to fly south east towards the Pinal Mountains with the two in the rear flying a lot slower.   I got back in my vehicle to make another phone call to my partner and advised him if he seen the helicopters and he reported yes he did.   When I exited my vehicle at approximately 12:15am, I noticed to object was gone, but when I looked off towards the north, northeast I noticed it again.   At approximately 12:20 am my partner got to his location and said he did not have a visual on the object.  I was at a higher elevation from my vantage point and did have a visual on the object.  The 3 what appeared to be helicopters went off over the Pinals and out of site.  At approximately 12:27am, what appeared to be a forth helicopter was flying in the area of the first sighting but then I noticed the object to the northeast was gone.  It was very interesting to me that after this object was spotted a group of aircraft (I believe was helicopters due to how they were moving) were spotted in the area looking for ""something"".   I have been in the fire service for 25 years, and have a pretty good head on my shoulders and I know what I saw that night.   My phone was at dispatch center charging and my company phone cannot take pictures due to the confidentiality of areas I work in.",2014-03-21T00:00:00,,

Statement 1st person: On March 20, 2014, at approximately 8:00 pm, I saw a UFO in Jordan, Minnesota.  I saw it with my mom and dad.  My mom and dad were watching TV, when my mom spotted something in the sky.  She called me over and we looked.  The UFO was towards the East, and it was a little lower than a normal plane would fly.  It was a circular disk with three green lights and three red lights in a row.  It was about the size of 1/3 of the moon. The lights were three times the size of an airplane’s lights.  It hovered up, down, back and forth in a strange routine.  It stayed there for about 20 seconds, hovering in different positions.  When it left, it looked as if it was diving.  It was lowering away slowly, but then dashed away very quickly before it disappeared from our point of view.  It looked like it lowered behind the house across the street, yet I felt it was miles away. Statement 2nd person: I live in Jordan, MN. On March 20, 2014, approximately 8:00 pm, my wife and I were in our family room watching TV.  I had just gotten up from the couch and was walking to the kitchen when my wife yelled, ""Look at this!""  I turned and noticed she was looking out our windows toward the East.  I looked immediately out our dining room patio door also towards the East.  What I saw was three very bright green lights and next to that three red lights.  All were very intense, and the object seemed to be suspended.  The object was approx. 20 degrees above my plane of vision and appeared to be very close, like it was in the neighboring development just above the house that is across the pond in our backyard.   But it wasn’t close, I would say the object was 1/3 the size of a full moon from my perspective. As I watched it, it tilted slightly, then dipped only to come back to the same level it had been at.  This happened a few times, all the while those 3 green and 3 red lights were extremely bright, I would say 3 to 4 times the size of a landing light on a plane, and by the way, I am a private pilot, licensed since 1996, so I am familiar with airplanes and what they look like in the sky, this was no airplane.  One of the times it tilted and dipped, I saw what appeared as a circular gray shadow underneath the lights, also there was a red flashing light underneath.  This whole thing lasted maybe 20 seconds. The last thing I saw was the lights fell away to the right and continued until they were out of sight, blocked by the house behind ours.  The rate at which it descended was smooth and very quick.  Our house is approx 30 miles South West of MSP airport, and we always have airplane traffic visible to the East on a SW heading, again, I am use to seeing the rate at which they pass by our house while they are climbing to altitude.  The object moved down and away at a rate at least 5 times that speed. Statement 3rd person:  I live in Jordan, Minnesota; approximately 35 miles Southwest from Minneapolis. I often look out our Living Room windows facing East to watch the planes from the MSP airport fly past our home.  Tonight, March 20th, 2014, at dusk, I looked out the window and about 200 yards away, above our neighbor’s house I saw an object hovering in the air with extremely bright lights.  The long, horizontal shape had a top layer of three greenish-blue lights and a bottom layer of three red lights.  My husband, also curious about these lights, opened the patio door to listen for sound.  I thought as close as this thing looked to our neighbor’s house, we should be able to hear it; but it was quiet. To help you gauge the size; If you hold your arm out straight and flex your hand, (palm away), the size of each light was comparable to a pinky fingernail.  Then, your arm still stretched, tuck your thumb and pinky finger into the palm of your hand and the width of this object in the sky would be comparable to your three middle fingers held tight together. The object would move a little to the left/downward and then be steady, it moved like this a few times.  The next movement convinced me these lights were not a standard item you see in the sky.  If you can imagine the shape of a banana, the lights tilted and dipped in an arch shape movement and then hovered again at a lower level in the sky. This movement was extremely abrupt, then steady.  The object then glided swiftly at an angle (downward) and we lost sight of it behind the neighbors house.  We saw these lights in the sky for about 20-25 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with two of the three witnesses, and they sounded to us to be exceptiongally eloquent and sober-minded.

I then held my hand out so see this light light my hands and that's when I looked up.  It was a sphere and it had low humming sound.  At that time I was not afraid so kept watching it then made a different sound and started to lower just above my grand mother home and a yellow light came on under it and started to move close to me that scared so I ran under the branches of the tree in our front yard.

This is my story. On Halloween night, October 29, 2011 in Williamsport, Pa, my wife and I were driving wb on US Hwy 220 near the junction of US Hwy 15 we observed several orange lights (counted 15 of them) come down out of the distant western sky and were traveling toward us in an easterly direction.  They appeared to be flying in formation.  The lights appeared to be following the Susquehanna River using it as a flight path of some sort.   We pulled over onto the shoulder and watched and photographed the lights. The night was raining with fog.  The time was approximately 20:00 to 21:00 hours, it was dark.  The area is very well lighted with many businesses, road lights, lighted traffic signs, moderate traffic flow and yet only two other vehicles stopped near us. When the lights were first noticed, I was traveling at approximately 55mph.  I pulled over seconds later and began watching them.  Initially I thought they were like some kind of bag light or something to commemorate a party of some sort, Halloween, wedding or something like that.  I got out of the vehicle and watched the lights and tried to video record them.  I could not get them focused and eventually in like a panic I took photographs to document this.  The lights seemed to take several minutes to get to my location and as they passed directly to the south of me, less than a quarter of a mile in direct line of sight they quickly dropped down and entered the fog over the river and disappeared. Their dissent  coming from the west seemed to be gradual, but then as they were within a half a mile they went from a height of at least a couple hundred feet, (they were higher than the power lines that cross over the river in that area) to where they dropped down quickly, lower than the bridge going over to South Williamsport and entered into a thick fog bank with all the lights following the ones in the lead staying in formation the entire time. Later the next year in July while we were at some friends, I met a young man and he and I shared our interest of UFO’s and space travel.  As we were talking about this, we both turned and were looking toward the western sky and in the day light both at the same time saw another orange light in the sky and both were very excited and brought it to the attention of at least 10 other people there who all looked, but were not nearly as excited as he and I were.  Pretty cool. I would swear to this report in any setting.  I am a former Highway Patrolman from a state other than PA.",2014-02-14T00:00:00,41.381240094339624,-76.82344056603773

It was flying Extremely fast! I've never seen anything fly that fast through the air.  It flew straight ahead of me, then veered up toward the left (northwest), and suddenly disappeared as if it were erased from the sky.  Just gone, just like that.  There was no sound, nor any debris or smoke in the air.  The sphere shape was more like a hamburger, tilted at 45 degrees, with a white light on the upper left side, a black line through the center, and a dark teal colored light on the bottom right side.  The lights were solid and were not blinking.  When it disappeared, I got a feeling that I wasn't supposed to see what I saw.  I searched the whole sky for any more sign of it, but there was nothing.  This is the first time I've seen a UFO.  We do live close to an airport, so initially I thought it was a plane but it was flying so much faster than any jet that I've ever seen and it disappeared completely.  The closest thing that I can compare it to would be a shooting star, because of the extremely fast speed and the way it disappeared, except that it was very low in the sky, traveling horizontally, veering up and away before it disappeared.

I was standing in front of my neighbors house, waiting for my 2 dogs to do their business, and I was just looking around.  I noticed a very strange looking whispy cloud that was a shallow u shape elongated west to east.  With the tops of the u being in each direction.  While studying the cloud I noticed some kind of movement.  As I tried to look at what was moving it was very hard to make out.  I had to look slightly off to one side, or the other of the object to make it out better.  It was a v shape.  It was moving from east going west across the sky.  Moving from where the cloud was, away from it.  It almost appeared to have a series of either lights, or reflections going the whole width and length of the v. the v seemed to be skinny almost just like the letter v.  except the v would be flatted,  At a shallow angle.  It appeared slightly grey in color, although this could have been due to the very dim lights, or reflections coming from it.  As it moved from me I noticed two airplanes flying quite close.  One looked like it would almost intersect with it. Although the plane was at a higher elevation.  The craft seemed to be very big and move just slightly faster than an airplane. Its hard to say what elevation it was at. But it was maybe just a little higher than a lot of smaller personal aircraft fly.  As it flew I didn’t hear any noise from the craft/object.  As it moved father from me it got harder to see.  As if you could only really see it from a certain angle.  After it went behind a telephone or electrical cable, I lost it. It was very hard to see in the first place, and after my view got obstructed from the object I couldn’t find it again.  At that time though it was getting farther away and almost disappeared anyway.  It seemed the best way to view the object would have been from directly beneath it.  The object flew south of my viewing location by quite a few miles.  It may have been direc! tly over the town of Knapp creek ny.  Or somewhere else on rocky city hill.  And it would have been flying toward a path that would have taken it over top of Limestone, NY.  It could have been closer than this.  I can't really say, but if it was closer than it wasn't any closer to me than maybe 2 1/2- 3 miles.   That is my account as best as I can describe it.  I would like to add that I had a feeling the craft/object was most likely a governmental craft, and not something other worldly.  I would also say it being an other dimensional craft would feel right to me as well.   If you have any other questions for me, please do not hesitate to call.",2014-02-27T00:00:00,42.1033,-78.4042

I was bringing my son's friend home from the movies and was headed south on Elmore Road to Abbott Road.  I noticed 2 orange lights in the same vicinity just above the treeline and west of the road through the front windshield.  The orange lights were similar in color to the street lamps common to Anchorage;  however, the orange lights were at a higher elevation than street level.  At first, I thought they might be lights atop radio or cellular towers, but as I focused, towers never manifested themselves and I wasn't aware of any towers in the residential neighborhood I was near.  That was my initial judgement as to elevation.  It was dark and the UFO's never manifested shape or elevation - only orange light.  The lights also appeared stationary.  There were small aircraft operating that night with the customary white lights or blinking lights.  As I turned west onto Abbott Road and then north again into a neighborhodd on Cathedral Way.  The lights appeared d! irectly overhead and visible through my sunroof.  I opened the sunroof to get a better look.  At this time, only one orange light was visible to me.  It appeared stationary but then began to move in a southwesterly direction.  No engine noise heard.  The orange light was round/oval and flickered slightly before the orange light dimmed completely.  At that point, the object resembled and appeared to have altitude similar to a satellite moving in orbit.  I followed the object until I could no longer see it.  So, not sure if I was catching sun off a large satellite moving in polar orbit (i've seen plenty of satellites orbit and never one display an orange light like this one) or if I was catching a drone moving in the area or something else.",2014-02-27T00:00:00,61.18196014109348,-149.84252680776015

On Monday 2-17-14 at approximately 1 in the afternoon on a warm day with clear blue skys, my wife and I were outside working in our yard.  We are located very close to Keaton Beach Fl. In a heavily wooded area.  As I walked up to look at the shrubs my wife was planting our attention was drawn to the sky by a loud sound of rushing wind.  I expected to see some sort of glider or other aircraft speeding by with the motor off.  I say this because the best description I have for the sound is that it sounded like air rushing very quickly over an object or an object moving very quickly through the air, and this happened with absolutely no motor noise present.  To our amazement what we saw was nothing that we recognized.  Streaking overhead from our right to our left was something approximately the size of a basketball but shaped more oval, or similar to a football shape.  The object was a flat black color and resembled a large football flying sideways.  My wife got a be! tter look at it than I did, and she described it as looking like a black football with a little round thing on each point, and it was traveling sideways as related to how a football travels.  She also described the sound as air being blown thru a turbo charger, but with no motor noise.  The object passed over our heads at just over treetop level, and was moving very fast.  As it passed over us it was also making a hard right hand turn at approximately 90 degrees.  The most amazing thing was that we saw and heard this thing fly over our heads and it had no motor noise and no wings.  As it quickly flew out of site we looked at each other and both said did you see that!  My first thought afterwards was that we had just witnessed some sort of military drone, however if it was, then it utilized a propulsion system and means of lift and flight that we have not been given knowledge of yet.  I feel fortunate and very excited to have been able to witness this with my wife, however now that! I know that things like this are really real; I have a lot mo! re quest ions.  I am also a little angry because now I’m sure that there is much more advanced technology out there, and we don’t have access to it.",2014-02-21T00:00:00,,

I also am not usually a star gazer.  However, after seeing two orange, glowing, floating, very close by, orb-like lights; I am convinced that SOMETHING is not right in the Alabama night sky!  I don't understand how people are dismissing ALMOST ALL of the many reports of these strange lights as Chinese lanterns, planes, jets, etc. What I seen that first night, about four months ago has led me to pay alot more attention to the sky at night especially.  What I have seen EVERY SINGLE NIGHT with the exception of four or five nights (too cloudy to see anything in the sky) has me quite frankly terrified.  I believe there is a huge problem with this rash of strange lights, and why are so many people seeing this stuff, and it's not in the media, it's like all being dismissed to the point I wonder about government cover up, but then again, maybe most really believe the dismisal explanations are true. What I have seen EVERY NIGHT, and you can come to Decatur Alabama as well, any night, and see also, cannot possibly be lanterns, you cannot convince me that peoples' lanterns are going in unison type lines together, flashing colors at each other (most the time it's orange fire looking colored, but also suddenly flashing to red, white, green, or blue) it often looks as if whatever they are the lights are trying to communicate...  But you also can't convince me that they are planes, seeing how what I am seeing tends to NOT travel much, or else it travels so fast you will miss it if you blink.  These lights seem to me to be in almost the same general areas of the sky every night.  They seem to me to also be ""trying"" to blend in with star formations like the dippers, and even blending with rooftops and trees as someone else said on the NUFORC pages. I am not the only one at my home who has seen the lights above Decatur, my adult nephew has seen them, and like me, he can't figure out what the lights are.   My niece and I both seen multiple of these glowing orb like lights land behind the backyard fence, in our neighbor's out back yard, late one night, some were not completely landed, as they were simply floating around fence level, some were just above the roofs of houses close by out back.   Another house, that same night, had what apeared to be a huge, floating fireball just barely above their roof.  My niece and I came inside as things got too weird watching the lights outside, so we went upstairs, leaving the house lights off, and watched out the window for several minutes, as the fireball looking one floated in one spot, and the orange orb ones on the ground in the neighbor's yard outback, moved ever so slow, then sudden, then slow,  and as the other orange orb looking ones that were floating at what looked like fence! level just sort of would rise and sink, rise and sink....  Trust me I know how this all sounds, I wouldn't be posting this if I didn't feel very strongly that these lights are BAD NEWS, if they were nothing of concern why wouldn't or couldn't we all just know what is going on, why wouldn't these lights (which are showing up literally all over the world) be on the news, or something. The lights that stay in the sky at night, the ones that seem to ""try"" to blend in with the trees and rooftop areas, they are the ones that flash different colors.  Sometimes they seem to stay orange, other times they flash red, blue, white, and I am pretty sure they every now and then flash green.  These lights seem as if they communicate.   Once again, I was never a star gazer, and I don't want to post on a website exactly what: however, I did something I should not have done, and have been scared to go outside and smoke a cigarette at night since.   Again, I know how this must sound, I am the last person who I would have expected to now be questioning UFO exisistance, but since NOBODY definatively knows or will say what these lights are for sure, then that factually makes them UNIDENTIFIED, flying lights and or objects.",2014-02-21T00:00:00,34.57360702702702,-86.94210270270271

August 7, 2013    My daughter (age 23) and I were moving to Reno, NV.  We had driven from Seattle, down I-5, then took CA 89, then CA 139 towards Susanville, Ca. It was about 2 in the morning.  The road we were on was a two lane, winding this way and that, curving, going up and down in the mountains, speed limit 55.  On each side of the road, there was the area that is cleared out of brush and trees.  Up ahead of us I would catch the lights of what looked like the flashing lights of a slow moving semi truck.  It was a ways ahead of us and we would see it, then it would disappear as the road wound a certain way, or trees  got in the way, then reappear again a few minutes later.  We really were not paying much attention to it.  It was a pretty night and a quiet road with very little traffic.  We had a deadline to meet in Reno, NV., and were not about to stop to sleep.  As I always seem to do while driving dark roads, I was picking out places and signs along the road. We were slowly catching up to the flashing lights of the slow moving semi. We were several curves away from those lights and I was wondering why the semi was going so slow, the road was neither steep nor dangerous.  We went around a couple more curves and suddenly was behind those lights.  It was not a semi truck. In each of the two lanes of traffic there was a triangle of three orange lights.  Each triangle of lights was higher than my car.  Going into the ditch and area cleared of trees and brush on each side of the road, was two lights in a row, and flashing red, like emergency flashers on any vehicle.  So it was, two flashing lights in a horizontal row on the right side ditch, a triangle of three lights in my lane of the road, a triangle of three lights in the left lane of the road, and two flashing lights in a row over the ditch on the left.   Above the triangles of lights, was the distinct outline of a bridge, some kind of an overpass.  In a straight line above each of the triangles of lights there were two more lights in a horizontal row, equaling four more lights, a white-ish color. These lights were above the top of the outline of the bridge, a good ten feet higher.  Then there were three more white-ish lights in a horizontal row over the very top.  This thing was huge. When we came around that last curve and saw this thing, I immediately pulled over to the side of the road. And then, this thing suddenly began moving towards us. Fear hit, I did a u-turn and made the car move.  I speed up to almost 80, that thing was staying right behind us.  I started seeing the places go by that I had mentally picked out earlier, and prayed that we didn't hit any animal.  About 10 miles down the road, I saw another vehicle coming towards us.  We didn't slow down, went flying by him.  I looked in my rear view to see what was happening.  Those lights lifted up off the highway, the truck went underneath the lights, then the lights came back down onto the road.  We were back on I-5 when we realized we couldn't see the lights anymore, but it took several more miles before the fear began to subside. My dauhters dog was with us in the car, and not once did he bark or growl. We went on to Hallelujah junction, slept maybe an hour, then continued on to Reno, arriving late afternoon on Aug.8th.   We found the place where we were headed to, right next to BLM land. Somewhere around 2 or 3 am, I am slowly waking up, I was in a conversation with someone.  I remember being asked something about my body, and I said to go ask a scientist.  I was asked why I didn't know the answer, and said there was no excitement for me in that area. As I am now fully awake, I am hearing this voice ask me questions in my head, telepathically.  I turned my head to look out the window, but the shade was down, and remember very clearly the sound of the voice, a bit mechanical, tingy, ask me one more question...”Why are you so afraid of us?”  Right then my daughter's dog began growling and barking and acting like it was chasing something around the living room through the kitchen and back towards the bedrooms.

The time and date are easy to recall, as I was listening to my radio on this historic date, in my tent in the back yard by the garden.  I glanced out the doorway to see if my cat was still sitting there, while waiting for my cell phone alarm to go off to remind me it was time to give my dog his meds and let my dog boarding clients out to potty for the night.  A bright light through the trees to the West caught my eye, and I wondered if it could be a helicopter search light looking for an escaped patient, as the regional treatment center for the mentally ill is about 5 miles away, and not an uncommon event.  A cargo plane headlight also came to mind, but there was no noise, so I ruled both out.  Suddenly a well defined circular object streaked by moving to the East.  It was a very bright glowing orange, like a pumpkin.  It left behind a wide light trail, almost as wide as it was.  It appeared to me, to be about the size of 5 bright planets (such as Venus) in ! the sky put together.  It was too quick to determine any dimension.  Unfortunately, my tent blocked any further viewing from my position, but I did get out to look around in the sky and farm fields in the area, seeing nothing.  It was not a Chinese lantern, as I have seen several of those launched by friends.  It also was not a typical shooting star, as I have known.  While surprised at this incident, I was not shocked, as I saw a group of 3 bright  glowing round objects about 5 years ago, while down at the barn late evening...during the summer.  They were very low in the sky, lined up next to each other, silent, and appeared maybe a mile or two away.  They hovered for about 5 minutes and then jetted off to the North very quickly and out of sight.  This scared me after a short while, so I ran up to the house....as after staring at them I felt like they had some odd hold on me.  Several neighbor men saw a craft over the lake just down the road to the north of us about a half mile, about a year ago.  It was typical saucer shaped with windows and lights.  So I guess I am not the only one in the area who has seen unusual things in the sky.",2014-02-14T00:00:00,44.3341,-94.06170000000002

First off, I'm a lifetime skeptic in every sense.  I've never seen a UFO or anything that I couldn't think of a plausible explanation for.  I don't believe in ghosts, bigfoot, chupacabra, or alien-abductions.  I'm a college-educated guy who has always had an interest in science and technology.  I wasn't on drugs or drinking.  I have no history of mental illness.  My assumption is that last night I caught a rare, brief glimpse of some kind of stealth aircraft of some sort.  That assumption doesn't make the vivid memory of it less discombobulating to me. Last night was clear and starry.  So clear and nice that I had gone outside to watch the International Space Station do a pass-over just after sunset.  Later in the evening I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  The sky seemed even more deeply dark and starry at that point.   I was smoking and gazing up at the constellation Orion, wondering what the name of the bright orange star in the constellation was (it's Betelgeuse.)  Because i'm so curious, I pulled out my iPhone and launched an astronomy map that identifies stars.  It uses the phone's accelerometer to label stars and planets as you point the phone around the night sky.   After satisfying my curiosity, I put the phone back in my pocket and returned my gaze to Orion when suddenly a fast-moving triangular set of solid reddish lights caught my eye moving from zenith down towards the Orion's belt.  The direction was from NE at zenith to SW when it disappeared after a solid, enthralling three seconds.  Absolutely no sound whatsoever!   The diameter of the perfect triangle was the width of about 2 of my thumbnails held at arm's length. It disappeared right about parallel to Orion's belt to its right.   I felt speechless, like I had seen a ghost for the first time.  What was so striking was that it seemed to be massive, supersonic, and flying at a high altitude.  What implied massive and high altitude, to me, was the fact that at no time during those three seconds did the individual lights in the triangular formation seem to change position in relation to one another.  If the object were lower, the fixed lights would have appeared to come together as it continued on its straight course to the SW.   It was also disturbing to not hear any noise.   I'm unsure how to accurately describe its speed, but the speed seemed tremendous when including the lack of perspective distortion of the lights.  The lights were orange or red and of similar brightness to a constellation like Orion.  But this thing was booking it.  It instantly seemed unnatural and part of some type of technology because of its perfect symmetry and straight-line path.   I'm still kind of in shock. I'm still looking for some kind of explanation.  I've thought of every angle to debunk my own vivid memory of it and can't think of anything.  Some kind of meteor which had its light perfectly refracted into a triad by the atmosphere?  I'm not an astro-physicist but I wish Neil Degrasse Tyson had been with me to witness what I saw.   I have been looking up at the sky all my life.  I have seen meteors, comets, satellites, aircraft, weird weather….I have never seen anything like what I saw last night.",2014-02-27T00:00:00,37.7436,-76.3523

They appeared individually within fractions of a second of one other coming from the north and heading south.  It appeared as if they all paused for a fraction of a second until all three were directly over the interstate approximately half a mile ahead of me in the horizon.

From the distance they were from me (approx. half a mile head; unsure of altitude but definitely lower than 500ft) they were about soccer ball size in scale. My first thought before really processing the info was fireworks but the angle they appeared over the trees along with the pause, direction change and speed made this very unlikely.  They flew in exacting lines, no arching and there was the obvious pause and go as if they were waiting on their wingman to catch up.  Additionally, the speed at which they appeared and then flashed across the sky from the distance they were from me was too fast for fireworks or even a low flying aircraft.

Here comes the crazy part.  As i start pointing my laser at this object i notice that it is moving and not moving in a single direction as you would see with a satellite.  this thing starts moving left, right, side to side almost trying get out of my beam as i point at it, i do this for about 2 mins until i start feeling like i should tell some one but know one at my home was home and nor where any of my neighbors in their backyards . So what do i do ? well, i thought since i am seeing this and i cant tell know one nor video tape it i get the idea to start circling the object as to attract people to looking at it instead of me pointing a laser directly on it.  i want to add that this idea came because i live along side the 710 fwy and i know for a fact people can see my beam from far so i new i can maybe get some people in traffic to see it and i hopefully was successful with that cause what happen next gave me the chills up and down my spine and i still have the chills as i write this. also i want to add that this isn't the first time i seen something i cant identify, but it is the first time i ever interacted with one . As i start circling the object it get more aggressive to moving away from the light as if knowing i am circling it and in doing so giving up its position , i continue to do so and it keeps trying get out of the circle i put it in, i then notice that when ever the beam would be in front of its direction it will quickly move away from it as if it was scared of crossing it as weird as it sounds.  i know this wasn't a satellite nor a plan cause planes cant move that fast nor in the aggressive manner this object moved.  I then start to notice that this object is positioning itself over my house , pretty much right over me so at this point i am pointing straight up with my neck looking straight up to the point my neck hurts . i got kinda freaked out at that point even more and start thinking about all abduction movies and thinking maybe this thing is position itself over me to know my location, i don't know but it really freaked me out . now my laser starts dying which emits a le! ss visible beam that can bee seen , at this same time i notice the object starts to also fade but still remains over what looks to me like its directly over me but just in the heavens with the stars pretty much hanging out flying around. my laser then dies and honestly i felt alone at that moment cause i was in complete darkness and it hit me that what i was seeing was real and was interacting with me and my laser beam . i stare at it for a couple mins more , noticing that its not really moving anymore but staying directly above me where it positioned itself in the heavens.  my lasers off,i am in darkness, i start getting more freaked out thinking that maybe its gonna get me , beam me up , i just start thinking of all the movies i seen with people interacting with ufo's which never end well. i wont lie i start feeling fear in me and something telling me go inside the house and recharge my laser. i do so , and decide to report for the first time an experience i have with a ufo that to me is the scariest encounter i have ever had the privilege of seeing . since a kid i have star gazed, i am 29. i have seen many weird things in the skies i cant explain to this day which i am sure allot of people have seen things many times also if they star gaze frequently thru their life . what i saw was real and i really cant explain any more into detail about it but what i explained . i haven't gone back outside my house yet and do plan to after i finish this sighting description . honestly i am kinda scared to go back out and look at the sky and or see if its s! till in the same spot but i am only because of my curiosity and faith that nothing bad will happen to me .  it looked exactly like a dim star or satellite that moves in a single continues lane that many people i am sure have seen . it didn't make any different colors it just stayed white like the stars , it moved quick, it moved away from my laser as if it were scared of it or didn't want to be seen or pointed out. i don't know what it was but know it wasn't a plane . i really wish i had someone over tonight to be my witness . i actually bought the laser because i would frequently see things through out my life in the skies, that i just wanted to finally point them out when star gazing and hopefully show other people . sadly i was alone and still am , my report is done and i hope who ever reads this maybe gets the same idea with the laser pointer and or someone saw a green beam pointing along the 710 fwy at an object moving away from my beam in the skies high above the heavens , at 9:00 pm . this is is not a hoax. hopefully some one has seen something similar or interacted with a ! ufo as i have with a high output green laser beam .",2014-01-10T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

They could have been between Oakland and Hayward, perhaps just east of Oakland Airport. My sister and I observed these lights from a porch in the North Berkeley hills from which we have a good view of the San Francisco Bay due west and to the south though trees block some of the vista. The bottom light was a few degrees above the landscape.  Above it was a larger and brighter light.  Then a third light west of that one forming a right sided triangle formation. We watched the lights pulsate for a few minutes and grow in intensity till they were perhaps twice as bright as the Oakland dockyard lights.  We then descended to the street as my sister was leaving.  From the sidewalk, I observed a white shooting star directly overhead moving northwest towards the North Bay. I returned back up to the porch and saw the light formation, which had dimmed. The third, westernmost light moved off.  With binoculars, I was able to make out additional details of the bigger of the two remaining lights.  The main amber light was central, below it was a small red light and on the upper right was a small green light.  All lights were constant with no pulsing.  There was no visible structure behind the lights viewed through the binoculars I set up a Canon 5d2 on a tripod.  I shot RAW stills and video for 2 hrs. with an 85mm and a 200mm lens.  The first pictures were taken around 23:10 pm and the last images around 00:45 am.  My mother observed the lights as well.  The lights were never as luminous during this period as when first spotted. There were a number of helicopters and airplanes moving about.  The lights generally hovered over the Oakland area but several times moved west over the San Francisco Bay, just south of the Oakland Bay Bridge.  It seemed as if the lights would move out over the bay when helicopter activity stepped up.  After perhaps a quarter of an hour they moved back. At this point, there was usually just one light.  The second would occasionally reappear, then either move off or fade away. One of the lights, when moving back towards Oakland continued east over the Oakland hills and disappeared from view.  The lights usually moved at a leisurely pace, but occasionally very quickly, relative to the planes and helicopters. At times, the lights would fade out and then fade up while over Oakland.  They would also periodically move vertically down, then back up again.  They always returned to the same approximate area around Oakland, at slightly different altitudes. Upon inspection of the RAW images, I have one object over the Bay with more discernible structure but I’m not sure if it is one of the lights or an airplane. You can make out a solid red light on the lower left end, perhaps a thin structure in the middle and a smaller green light at the upper right end. In the video, this light seems to flicker, appears as a tandem light and isn’t as bright as the Oakland lights so it might be a plane.  It seemed to me that the airplanes had a red light on one wing and a green light on the other. The problem was, the ‘UFO’ lights would occasionally move behind a tree in the foreground. Planes from SFO would also come from behind the trees, though on different trajectories and I would occasionally end up tracking those.  However, these made jet engine noise, had visible structures, etc. as they got closer. The vehicle in the RAW stills is moving northeast, then on the next clip, a video, it reverses and heads southwest.  Then a faster moving solid bright light from the north swoops past it and heads back to the Oakland area.  The vehicle in the RAW still continues south with blinking lights. The Oakland light moved off west again around 00:45am and disappeared behind a tree.  It did not seem to drift over the Bay again south of the Bay Bridge.  I packed up the gear and went inside. I observed the Oakland lights again the following day, Friday, 01/03/14 at approximately 18:30 along with a friend of mine as we were leaving. I saw it again at 22:00. I did not videotape this time.  They may have appeared on one more night. While driving south on the I5 freeway on Friday, 01/10/14, around 18:30, between Patterson and Newman, I observed another white shooting star moving southwest.  A piece of debris separated from the main body and trailed off before it dissipated. I have always had an interest in UFOs but have never observed anything unusual in the sky before.",2014-02-14T00:00:00,37.877171078976644,-122.26792135706341

At dusk, on February 18, 2014, at 19:16, local time, while out for my evening walk, I spotted 3 orange orbs, approximately 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon, to the west, south west of my position, roughly 6 miles south of Picture Rocks, AZ. These lighted orange orbs were near my winter home, west of Tucson, AZ, and this was not my first sighting. The 3 orange orbs first appeared by blinking on; first just one, then two, and then three, total.  All 3 briefly became visible at the same time.  First one would blink on, then another, and so on, then one would blink off then back on in random sequence etc.  All three were totally silent, and left no visible smoke, plasma trail or contrail etc. While visible, they appeared to have a very low ground speed, however, with no range or size information, I could not determine their exact speed, altitude or location.  They were arranged in an approximate north/south line from my vantage point, looking west southwest toward the fading sunset, and they did not dart or zoom back and forth. They were only in view for a few seconds, and I pulled out my cell phone to photograph them, but it was too dark.  All three then blinked out within 30 seconds or so, and I noted the time as 19:16, on my cell phone. Having occasionally seen these groups of reddish orange orbs at this location before, I attempted to take a photograph this time, because the sightings appear to be occurring more and more frequently, during the three years I have been wintering over here. There is a lot of regular air traffic in this area, from SWA B-737's, AAL MD-80's, to CRJ 50 and 700 series commuter jets, plus a lot of G/A traffic going into TUS, and Ryan Airfield, located 10nm South and Marana Airport, about 11nm north. I also spot numerous military aircraft over flying this area daily, including KC-135's, C-130's, F-16's, A-10's, Blackhawks and Cobra helicopters etc., mostly operating out of DM AFB or TUS. Additionally, both my neighbor and I operate Hot Air balloons, (mine is a Balloon Works AX-8-B,  90,000 cubic feet) so I am quite familiar with the local traffic patterns, and most types of aircraft in this area. I am also familiar with the difference in color spectrum between tungsten, XENON, HALOGEN, and LED landing lights, and or position/strobe lights, which these orange orbs were not. Just prior to this sighting, there was a flight of two A-10 Warthogs, departing Davis Monthan AFB, on their routine evening patrol.   I see them often, and can recognize them by their two distinctive white flashing strobes. The A-10's were climbing away from my position, westbound, in loose formation, about 250 to 300 knots, at approximately 10,000 feet.  As they disappeared to the west, the orbs appeared behind them, a few minutes later. Shortly after the orbs briefly appeared, and then blinked out, I noticed a small single engine aircraft, southbound, approximately 5 to 10 miles west of my position, around 5 to 7 thousand feet.  I could hear its single engine, and see its steady red position light, as well as its red anti-collision light flashing.  Its ground speed appeared to be 80 to 110 kts but it was too dark to determine the specific type. This aircraft may be the reason for the orbs blinking out, because it appeared to fly through the same area, shortly after the orbs disappeared.  I continued watching for them to reappear, as I walked about two miles back home (approximately 15 min's)  By then it was completely dark, and the objects did not reappear. Over the past 3 years, I have seen these objects around half a dozen times, usually in groups of two to five objects, to the west of my home, mostly in the evening, or early morning hours, and generally low on the west southwest horizon, as opposed to overhead. These internally lit, orange orbs were not parachute flares, balloons, helicopters, fixed wing jets or reciprocating G/A aircraft. They were also not candle powered toy hot air balloons, which my neighbors launch in the evening, from time to time. Having watched the Apollo-17 night launch in person, (DEC 1972), two shuttle launches, and one night shuttle reentry over the South Pacific, (Eileen Collins, Commander), plus a couple of Vandenburg, AFB night missile launches, I am certain these orbs were not chemical powered rockets, either lifting off or on reentry, or the space station. Also they are not the Moon or Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Sirius etc. (wrong color, wrong location)  I can reasonably eliminate all the objects, planets, aircraft and vehicles that I have listed in this report, but I cannot identify what these orbs are. After waiting a little over one hour, I called the hotline and made a verbal report to Peter Davenport around 20:42 local time. I have not previously made a formal report, due to my position in professional aviation. I have seen these orange orbs often enough to confirm they are not my imagination, and feel that my report should be made now, because the sightings appear to be happening more and more frequently. If I were here full time, and had the time to spend looking, I feel that I could probably spot them fairly often in this area.  (just my speculation)  Because I am actively employed in a professional flying position, I must remain anonymous, however, I am more than willing to speak with an investigator.

Me, dad and my sister were stargazing one Saturday night on a clear evening.  We witnessed about 10 satellites, 10 shooting stars and something even more amazing…  After about a half hr up on the rock, I noticed a huge ball of fire about 100 metres to the left of us, which was about 100 metres over the top of the tree line.   I started to scream and we were all in awe at what we were witnessing.  It was a round fire ball about 40 feet wide with a tail of fire following it.  It was travelling about 20 kms an hour and crossed Muldrew Lake within about a minute or so.   As it reached the opposite side of the lake it disappeared behind the tree line and headed towards Loon/Turtle Lakes.  We yelled at mom to come up and see it, but she had no idea what we were yelling about as she was watching tv downstairs... I was so intrigued to know what this was as it was obviously under control and I thought it might be a satellite of some sort that caught on fire as it entered the atmosphere, and then somehow headed in its bizarre trajectory.  Mom and dad listened to the radio that night and had heard that it might be a Russian rocket, so we left it at that.. I also recall vividly a week later that mom had called our friend who was on the next lake over to see if she had seen it as well.  Sure enough she had.  She was in the park in Gravenhurst with a bunch of people for a concert and she was the one to yell out, ""What is that?""  She described the exact same thing we saw…a round ball of fire with a fire tail flowing from it.   I would love to know if this was a satellite or not.

The first experience happened around 1955 in Miami, Oklahoma.  My grandmother and I lived in a house with a large grassy lot between us and the corner of our street.  I awoke one morning and went outside to play.  As I usually did.  A large circle, open in the middle, appeared to be burned into the grass.  There were three evenly spaced indentations around the circle.  Shortly thereafter, several men in military uniforms came and took pictures, measurements, and soil samples.  My sister, who is 13 years older than I, also remembers this incident. In 1987, in route from Harrison, Arkansas to Springfield, Missouri, at dusk, my daughter and I saw a beam of light come from the bottom of a large dark unknown type of aircraft.  The light swung from left to right over the ground..  Although we were not close to another vehicle, there was other traffic on the highway and we all slowed down presumably to observe this odd thing coming toward the highway about 50-75 feet above the ground.  It crossed the highway maybe 100 feet ahead of us. It circled and started back toward us.  It passed directly overhead and I leaned out of the passenger window to see if I could see what it was.  There were designs or writing on the bottom but I could not tell what they were. It flew silently overhead and we continued on our way. In approximately March of 1988, my daughter and I were driving south from Harrison, Arkansas to Jasper, Arkansas.  It was night and the sky was black.  No stars were visible.  We had experiences that night that I hesitate to mention because it is so hard to believe.  If we had not had the experiences we had, I, myself, would not have believed it. On July 4, 2005 I was sitting with my friend in her front yard watching the fireworks display.  To our left, about 40 orange glowing craft silently floated by about 50 feet off the ground. We all stopped and watched until they disappeared.  About two minutes later a huge orange glowing craft came by.  There was no sound.  They definitely were not fireworks.  A few minutes after the large craft passed, we heard chopper blades and helicopters so black we could hardly see them came from the direction from which the crafts had come and went in the direction they had gone.

We started video taping it and watching around the sky we then noticed that there seemed to be many other dimmer smaller lights around 10-15 around it that looked like stars but all of they were moving around in similar movements like the big one.   Then we seen a object that looked like a tube shoot across the sky leaving a sort of redish trail and then looked like it burst into flames and disappeared.

I didn't get a very good look at it except for the back which was big and triangle shaped and had three big red lights in a triangle on the back.

Shortly thereafter, approximately 2-3 weeks later and during a storm that was mostly thunder and some lightning, a strange light came through the house.  We were sleeping in opposite bedrooms as my young son was not feeling well.   This light was observed by both my wife and I and it came through the house slowly and in a streak that was about 2-3 feet off the ground.  The light them came before both of us as the same time even though we were in separate bedrooms and it then popped before our eyes.  My wife yelled out ""did you see that"" and I said yes.  It was almost like a polaroid light bulb flash had occurred.  But I actually saw the light come through my bedroom opened door area turn towards me and flash pop in my face.  For many years I have thought this was lightning, but everywhere I research I cannot find lightning that acts this way.  I am after several years thinking this was some type of photograph taken of my family and there is a strong coincidence of the encounter with the UFO's.  I can't believe we were the only ones to see these two space crafts of such magnitude with flying technology that is not from our universe.

The object was tumbling with the sun reflecting and this was why it appeared to be changing shape.  I came to the conclusion that it must be a bunch of balloons as the tumbling seemed to be effortless.   As I was breathing heavy from yard work it was hard to get a very stable look with the binocular.  I looked around to find something stable my shaking.

Next nite other moving lights in sky same area. Follow up to the reported UFO crash in Brazil.   Town of Lavras,  state of Minas Gerais,  Brazil.  Time of encounter:  Feb. 7, 2014.  9:15 pm  EST.   (3 hrs difference, 12:15 am local time FEB 8, 2014)   Please keep in mind the following:  This is NOT A HOAX.  However, the people in Lavras, Br. live in fear of such encounters.  Due to possible military action, knocking on their doors etc.  Or others (CIA?)  Not certain.  But over the years, some not so great things have happened to people concerning this topic.  Including the mysterious death of 3 UFOLOGISTS January 2014 in Brazil.  Don`t know any details concerning this. We are in Northern Ontario, Canada.  (we were not there!)  This is relayed as a third party, after my wife`s version from her friend and through some translation from Portuguese.  My wife has a friend from an online UFO site.   This friend lives in Lavras, BR.  Fifteen (15) people were outside socializing when they saw the folllowing:  * A light and dark purple craft with flashing lights,  hovering and moving across the sky.  Not certain of the distance, but was lead to believe a distance of 1 or 2 kms.  This is a hilly semi-mountainous region.  The craft was spitting large light particles,  behind apartment buildings, next to a hill on the edge of town.   Then an explosion.  They instantly assumed the craft crashed.  This was relayed to my wife online, within 10 minutes of the incident. UFO CRASH!   UFO CRASH!!  Was the heading and message.    And us,  being 8,000 miles away,  obviously cannot be certain what happened.   I personally put this on 3 UFO sites of which i am a member, within minutes. Then the excitement started as you can imagine.  But something came down.    I asked about photos, the girls name and phone no.  etc...but got little cooperation.  They are very fearful of getting involved, which is most unfortunate.  I kept asking questions but received no additional information. However, the next day we resumed contact with this girl.  Or my wife did.   The Brazilian lady continued to believe a UFO crashed.  Others in her group verbalized that they thought that maybe it was some sort of probe that fell off the craft and exploded. Something exploded!  That is certain.   No one ventured to the site!!   LIke i personally would have done.  Even the night of this incident.   I have little fear.  But this is not the case with these people. *Also very important to note:   The following night, some of these people, as reported by the same woman,   (online through the UFO site)  saw several lights in the sky moving very close to this incident.   ET friends checking out the area?  I think so.   SOMETHING  DEFINITELY CAME DOWN.   Some have said this area is full of similar things, and that ET`s live inside the hills or mountains.  Odd that there were no photos.  Perhaps it happened quickly,  it was dark,  perhaps their cell phones were inside the house or building at the time?   Or perhaps this area does not have many people with cell phones.   Brazil in many areas are not US or Canada, where everyone has the latest technology in their back pocket.   I don`t know why no photos, we can only speculate.  But i feel 95% certain something came down and exploded. That is about it.   Wish there were photos and a first hand description for you.   Not possible at this time.   *My wife wants no involvement.   (as a permanent landed immigrant in Canada recently, wants nothing to do with it)  So there you go.

Two I-Phone Camera Shots Reveal Three Partially De-cloaked Disks; Possible cloaked Mother-Ship.,Pie Town,NM,2014-02-07T11:32:00,disk,2-3 minutes,"Occurred : 2/7/2014 11:32  (Entered as : 7 Feb 2014 11:32) Reported: 2/9/2014 8:02:14 PM 20:02 Posted: 2/14/2014 Location: Pie Town, NM Shape: Disk Duration:2-3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107049.html,"Two I-Phone Camera Shots Reveal Three Partailly De-cloaked Disks; Possible cloaked Mother-Ship Two photographs of a snowfall were taken with an I-Phone camera in a car with two males headed southbound towards Pie Town, NM, on 7 Feb 2014 in daylight at 11:34 hours. Neither of the people in the car noticed the objects; later revealed to them only by analysis of the two photos. One Photos shows what looks like on disk with a twin rotating (DNA like) Vortex tail following the disk.  The disk has an eerie (Newton's Rings-Like) Diffracted-light aura that appears to be a partially effective cloaking device using perhaps meta-material-like alterations to the surrounding air by induction of alternate layers of air negative refractive index with layers of air with normal positive refractive index.  The vortex tail also shows some evidence of cloaking effects near the disk. The second photo contains what appears to be a partially cloaked Mother-Ship in the process of simultaneously ejecting two disks in a ""Center of Gravity-Matter Shepparding Twin Vortex with both ejected ships directed downward before separating tangentially and flying away from each other at 180 degree angles mutually orthogonal to the downward ejection spiral. A twin spiral trail also follows both ejected disks and quite possibly directs their orderly ejection from the Mother-Ship and orderly separation from each other. The secondary dual spiral beams are shown both trailing and leading (or even Guiding) one of the two ejected disks, and perhaps are guiding both disks initially in the ejection phase. I believe the atmospheric conditions were just right with low temperatures at 7600 FT altitude combined with high dew points than allowed these two photographs to detect subtle differences in air density, causing unusually large changes in atmospheric opacity near the dew point. These slight changes may well have been more apparent at near infrared frequencies and thus the I-Phone camera may have thus partially de-cloaked these events which went unnoticed by four human naked eyes, and two human brains. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the party who submitted the report, and requested of him that he have the actual eyewitnesses submit a written report, as well.  He said he would forward the photos, as well.  PD))",2014-02-14T00:00:00,,

Today's:  Glowing yellow light coming from the South West Didn't seem to be heading toward me at first, but began to do so. From afar appeared yellow, with small green light glowing behind it. Seemed to move upward first, before approaching. As it approached it sounded like a quiet plane, and it became more apparent. Flew directly overhead, very slowly.  Looked to be only a few hundred feet up. Couldn't quite make out a shape, but it appeared to be oval.  From directly below it, it had three bright yellow lights in a triangular form, but clearly separate lights.  There were also green and red lights on either side, one or two on each side. As it was closer by, it sounded as though it emitted more of a whooping sound, with sort of a droning low tone, as though it was hovering. Considered it to be a plane, but there aren't any prominent airports south west of here (that I know of)  Even had their been, there would be no reason for a plane to be low-down in this area.

It was still there when I decided to go inside. This my fourth sighting of this same phenomena.  They date back to the summer of 2009. The sightings are always in the same spot in the sky (from my vantage point), and on at least one other occasion, there were several of these same orbs, floating together--the most I’ve ever seen were four orbs at a time.  During two of these sightings, the orbs disappeared and reappeared in unison. At a glance, this orb could easily pass for a very bright star, but if observed for more than five seconds, it is plain to see that it is definitely not a star.

This is a first for me, so not sure where or who to report it to and it may be nothing.  I live in a suburb on the outskirts of Tulsa, OK.  This last Wednesday at about 3:00pm, (I know as my son's bus came during the event) we started hearing the strangest noise we've ever heard over my home.   We ran outside as did many others, when it did not stop like a normal aircraft passing would.  The cloud cover was immense, but we could tell something was overhead.  Not just loud, but you could feel the pressure change.   A bunch of people went outside as this went on several minutes, and felt like it lasted forever.  I wish I could accurately describe the sound and the way it felt.  My dogs did not bark like they normally would, they went and hid.  Cars were stopping and everyone was trying to see what it was.   The only thing I saw, was after this noise had passed from overhead, I saw 2 fighter jets fly by at a very low altitude right over my house, through a small cloud break.  This noise kept going and going.  If it was some aircraft, it would have to be circling around and around for the entire length of time.   Even stranger, after, the news here reported at least 12 power transformers spontaneously erupted in fire causing over 1000 people to lose power.  Maybe a coincidence, but weird.   Nothing was mentioned anywhere about the air event, except on Facebook conversations.  My sister in law heard it at her house about 12 miles south, and this was right over my house going in a northeast direction, so it was that loud.  They went out to see what it was there, and couldn't see anything either.   My other sister in law lives close to my neighborhood, and said she was afraid it was the end of the world and was thinking only about her son at school.  At the grocery store yesterday, I overheard two people talking and one mentioned they thought it could be ""haarp"" related.  I had to look that up to see exactly what it was.  Whatever it was, it was bizarre and even stranger that the transformers blew up and that nothing was mentioned about it from our news sources.    I just wanted to report it somewhere.  Even if it was military maneuvers, it's worth reporting.  Obviously the military was involved somehow as the 2 jets that were following it could be seen.

It was a clear night with very few clouds, and the stars were easily visible and very distinct. As I looked up I saw a formation of four faint white round objects that were about the size of a small star, but not quite as bright.  They were traveling from east to west at an approximate speed of a conventional aircraft.  I first thought they were the wing tip lights found on military jets.  There were no anti collision lights operating and they were in a formation of two groups of two that with about five times as much distance between each group of two.  Each pair of lights was about a distance apart equal to the width of my index finger with my arm outstretched.  What made me believe they were military craft was the fact that they were so close to each other.  What was strange was there was no noise and I could not make out the outline of a fuselage.  What occurred to me later, upon reflecting on what I had seen was that they were each a separate object.  I realize the human mind must rationalize everything, so my mind had to rationalize them as being wing lights on a con! ventional aircraft. I first saw the lights above me and slightly to my right.  A few moments later out of the corner of my right eye I noticed another brighter object.  It was traveling toward the smaller lights from the East North East at a much faster speed.  This object was extremely bright compared to the other objects. It was about the size of a quarter inch ball bearing held at arms length.  The object was almost white in the center with a reddish cast at the outer edges.  It over took the other objects in a matter of a few seconds and came close to the group of lights on the right.  As it arrived at the group of lights on the right it made an incredible left turn that was almost a right angle.  When it negotiated the change in direction it intensified in brightness and it became a deeper color red, it also increased in speed at an astounding pace. The larger object went south at an incredible speed and was out of my field of vision in about a second.  I must also explain that the southern horizon was not visible to me because it was obscured by my house and the other houses around me.  I therefore could not observe the object as it traversed the sky to the southern horizon.  The four objects proceeded west till they no longer visible to me; their speed remained the same through out the event.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,40.0237,-79.8839

I have been to dozens of airshows so it was an unusual formation to see late at night.  It was a tight triangle formation of aircraft. NOTE: Going to air shows does not make me an expert.  However, it was unusual enough for me to notice that they were in a tight formation at night with absolutely no blinker lights.  In the daytime, a tight triangle formation is dangerous.  I have to believe that the danger level would be elevated 100x at night. So, I went outside to see what type of airplane was flying overhead, but I did not hear a sound.  The clouds were low, no stars were present, and the wind was blowing in a NE direction about 10 mph (gusts up to 22 according to my cell phone.)  I sat and watched the triangle formation of lights flatten out and become a string when the first light began to fade out.  My first guess is that this object went behind a cloud.  At least, that is what my mind told me.  However, the next two lights also began to fade out but at different spots in the sky. So I thought ""that was weird!"" and was about to head back into the house when I looked back to the east, I saw more of these red dots in the sky.  They were always in clusters of three but I saw more clusters now.  Not just a single cluster of 3 red/orange lights. They all were traveling East to Northwest.  Given that these objects were going against the prevailing wind, I am confident in saying that they were not Chinese Lanterns.  Furthermore, on average, it would take about 2 minutes for these lights to go from the horizon to overhead to out of sight.  So they were not wasting any time. I was actually able to go into the house in order to grab my camera, tri-pod and my binoculars.  However, in my excitement, the pictures that I took are not the best. When I viewed the objects thru my binoculars, they appeared to be red rings.  When the event was over, I counted at least 24 objects in the sky (Or 8 clusters of 3).  All of which were completely quite.  This viewing lasted about 20 minutes.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,40.2839,-84.1648

I stepped outside to have a cigarette; as soon as I opened the door I saw bright white lights almost directly above me.  The craft was traveling East at about 400-500 feet and moving at around 40 miles an hour.  The strange thing I immediately noticed was there was no sound coming from the craft.  No Doppler effect from Jet engines, no prop sounds. The craft had several white lights on steady and one slow flashing light on the back.  I could not see any on the front. Most of the air craft I see are high fly jets, moving North to South or further to the East from South to North.  This craft was heading East. We do have fighter jets that every once and awhile heading to Smyth Mountain Lake Damn on (from what we have heard) bomber training.  The shake the house and you can hear them for miles after. Last night I stepped outside again at 9:30 and the craft was there again. This time further away but heading East and at the same altitude.  I watched until it was at the horizon through the trees, then it headed South. I didn’t put it together at the time, but the first I saw the craft I cam back inside and told my wife. She has had some health issues lately but, nothing to bad, but it keeps me on edge. About one half hour after telling her, she sat forward in her chair and held her head. I asked her if she was OK.  She told me she felt light headed and her stomach felt queezy.  As she was telling me, my head started feeling light and my stomach felt like I was on a roller coaster.  The symptoms went away with 10 minutes. Last night as the lights faded away I was getting ready to go back inside and my lips started to tingle, my head felt a little light and my stomach felt a little strange.  I am not a believer in UFO’s from other planets, I do believe in government black ops. The hardest thing I have a hard time with is that there was no sound at all.  I know it wasn’t a blimp as I’ve heard those before.  It wasn’t a plane or jet. I could make out any shape, besides what looked like a tail of a plane.  The white light had a strange appearance, almost a glow more that light. It didn’t spin or make any strange movments.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,36.62852387096774,-79.49231483870967

We have lived at this address for seven years, and have had our hot tub almost as long, and have spend many hours looking up at the night sky here – we know what we’re looking at in the sky here. At first I thought it was an airplane, as I only glimpsed them through branches of a tree on our property.  We live on a flight path to SFO, so we get periodic commercial aviation traffic overhead – near enough to distinguish each wing, and the lights on them.  This was entirely different. Two of the lights were moving rapidly in together, with a third one behind them.  Distance between them was approximately 3-4full moons. They were heading south, toward the edge of the trees on our property, by leaning over the south edge of our hot tub we could see them emerge from behind the trees.  As they did, they joined up with another constellation of 7-10 similar objects that appeared to be stationary, at 280deg W.  These objects were oriented in a backwards capital letter “L” pattern, with approximately 3 objects oriented horizontally, sloping upward to the south, and a vertical line of 3-4 more going up.  They occupied a about 3 full moon’s worth of sky vertically, and maybe 2 horizontally.  They appeared to me to be quite uniform in size and color, and were twinkling (or perhaps flashing rapidly). At first I thought I was looking at an unusually bright (and severely compacted) version of the constellation Orion – that was the only thing I could think of that looks even remotely like this. As my wife and I watched and tried to figure out what we were seeing, the group of objects slowly began to change shape and appeared to move toward the south, where they eventually dimmed – probably fading into the clouds.  They still persisted dimly for some time – maybe another minute or two. We debated whether to go inside and grab a cell phone to take a picture, but this would not have been feasible in the low light conditions.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,37.99526143250689,-122.52110826446282

This will sound silly to most, however, try waving wildly at one of them (as if they are your friend and you're very happy to see them) and see what you get in return.  I've asked several people including one person on the phone who did so as I waited for them.  The results will shock or intrigue you; perhaps both.  The result will be that they flash faster and brighter as if to answer you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw a  triangle-shaped orange spark move out of the fireworks and continue to go up in to the sky without exploding or fading out.  It continued to move at a slow and steady pace up and northwest in the sky until it was directly over my head after maybe a minute or so of  watching it perplexed about how in the hell this thing was able to keep going.  The distance above us is uncertain, but it seemed small and very distant.  If I was to give it a size from my perspective on the ground I would say about the size of a grain of rice. I would have been able to assume it to be just about anything else if it did not suddenly increase at an unnaturally fast speed and continued northwest until it was out of view in a matter of seconds or maybe less.  I looked at my friend who had just watched the same thing and had the same reaction, ""What the f*ck was that?""

I would describe it as a rather large triangle with a number of orange lights on the  entire perimeter and a larger more intense red light directly in the middle.   The middle red light appeared to be pulsing somewhat as it faded slowly in and out- the orange perimiter lights remained constant.   The speed of this craft was impressive and covered the entire expanse of my northern view from the west hemisphere all the way to the visible east hemisphere.  It moved in a rather erratic manner and changed elevation several times as it moved.   I would say that the height of the craft was lower than an Air Force Jet would fly- yet higher than a smaller personal aircraft (such as a two to four seater).  There were very clear conditions this morning- and I could clearly see the stars and planets.   The craft was illuminated brightly and would have been hard for anyone to miss!  My rural home is approx 15 miles north of Madison WI.  There is an Air Force base at Truax Field in Madison.   I noticed a number of Air Force jets patrolling this area within 5 to 10 minutes of my sighting!

Unexplained sightings of objects in the night sky, that have been witnessed by members of my family as well as friends and neighbors.  Let me say that in my almost 50 years, I have never seen these objects before in my life and neither has anyone else who witnessed them. The first such occurrence happened on the night of February 5, 2011, at around 9 p.m., I was alone and out walking our dog when I looked up and saw a bright orange object heading north from the ocean to about the center of the city.  From my vantage point, the object looked to be about 20 feet in diameter and was at an altitude of only 1000-1500 feet.  It was completely round and transparent like an orb and as if it were made of gas but also had an electrical component as the inside of it appeared to have a charge of some sort like lightning bolts within it.  The orange plasma ball moved very slowly at perhaps 20 m.p.h. across the sky for about two minutes total and then made a 90 degree angle and headed straight up slowly to a very high altitude until it could no longer be seen.  All the while it made no noise whatsoever.  I found this very curious as I have never seen anything such as this before. It wasn’t a plane, balloon, drone or natural object and seemed to move  as if by! intelligent design. These sightings have occurred at least 12 times in the past three years of which I have personally witnessed 8 of them.  My family and friends told me about the others.  The latest event witnessed was on January 5, 2014.  The glowing balls show up every 2-4 months or so and perhaps more often if they are not seen by someone each time.  These orange balls of light have always appeared solely as one and not a cluster as some have witnessed in other areas.  They are always orange in color, appear in the evenings between 8p.m. and 11 p.m. and can travel from different directions (east to west, north to south, ect..), make turns and even hover over a spot.  My wife says she saw one stop and hover right above her for a minute as if it were watching her and then slowly went onward. I do not normally make a report on every small thing that I may see but the number and frequency of these objects compels me to report these sightings as they have become almost commonplace in our area and I hope it helps to find an explanation as to what these objects in our night sky are.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,33.68843322932917,-118.00499422776912

I looked west in the sky and saw that a few others had always gone past the house on the same path and were going out of view.  Four additional balls of light came into view.

I looked up from my bed through a window and was immediately alerted that this is not a normal light.  It was much larger than any other lights in the sky.  I live near a small airport and there were many small aircraft in the sky, and I assume, some circling to land.  So the contrast was quite large between the planes with small normal colors lights and this much larger brilliant orange light.  My first impression was that it was a jet, perhaps on fire.  The reason I thought it was on fire was that this orange shiny object has an orange contrail coming out of the rear and streaming back behind it for some distance.  This contrail was also orange and it had a particular quality about it.  It was clearly visible against the night sky and it looked metallic and as it got closer it looked like the sparkle one would see from fireworks, although the contrail was not cascading like fireworks as it had a consistent stream coming out of the rear of the object.   Its speed was very slow, about the speed of a small aircraft as it approaches a landing.  It gave me a few minutes to watch it.  When my view started to become blocked from the roof line, I ran to our balcony to continue watching.  As it continued across the sky still moving from left to right, north to south, it gradually and smoothly turned to the east and moved away from me.

When my wife came outside which was only about 30 seconds the ball of fire began to diminish in size and began an ascension and then vanished. The ball traveled very slowly and  left a smokey trail behind it which was visible due to the very bright nature of the object.   Its direction was fairly unidirectional with a slight course change near the end.  I had observed what appeared to be a commercial flight alter course to avoid the object.   The total amount of time this took to transpire was about 3 to 5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The Frontage/Clear is in the range of 2,000 feet and beyond that is the tree line, which is mostly forest to the Canadian Border (40 miles).  The cloud deck was very low (700-900 feet) I estimate.   Suddenly, as I just happened to be looking to the NNW, a very bright aqua blue light in the shape of a cone turned on facing directly South!  and then Scanned right below the cloud deck about 20 degrees to the West and just as abruptly as it turned on it shut off (No Fading) of the light.
