Three were in line with each other but the lead was clearly ahead of the others. My guess is that they were 30,000 feet or more in altitude, all 4 leaving contrails, and were spaced about 3000 feet apart. Everything was normal and I signaled to my friend, ""Hey, look at those planes""  He said, ""Yeh, gotta be the military flying in that kind of formation.""  They were absolutely identifiable as jets. Then he noticed the lead aircraft had a shiney sphere under it and said ""can you see that under the lead plane?""  I said ""Wow! That's amazing. I never could say I saw one until today!"" It was about half the size of the lead jet aircraft. He ended by saying they are probably heading to Eglin AFB, FL.  What really proved it to me is that the sphere was definately shiney, made no contrail (like the jets did) and was separate and aside the lead plane.

The reason my dad and I noticed this was because compared to all the other stars, it was unbelievably bright. It was so bright that it was quite hard to look at. If it were a plane, it would've been moving and less bright. This 'thing' however, didnt move at all for about 3 hours... It just floated there. Occasionally you would be able to see a red light moving towards it from different directions. One time the red light came up from the bottom right hand corner of the light. As it neared the light, it faded away. A few minutes later, i saw with my binoculars, the red light moving in from the top left hand corner of the light. I zoomed in on the light with my binoculars and i saw that the light was made up of two round lights. One right above the other and slightly to the right. the top one was red-ish orange and the bottom was a very light green-ish white light. these two together shone like the brightest light in the sky. It was amazing. Every once in a while i'd see the red light again. and the bright (two) lights would just float there and not move an inch. When i looked at it through binoculars i thought i just saw two lights.. the most 'shape' i saw out of it would have to be a circle... if i had better binoculars, i may have been able to see more. I wonder if it was a UFO because it didnt move.. i watched it for a while and it seemed to be getting lighter and lighter as the time passed. eventually i stopped looking at it and only glanced at it every few minutes. it got lighter and lighter.. one minute it wuz still a pretty bright light compared to the others.. and then next second it had disappeared... The way it shone.. i cant forget. it was like the middle of it shone the brightest and around it it shone like crazy too. it was soo bright around and the light itself. nothing could've been shining like that.. nothing normal anyway..

It was still there as I cleared the next block and didn't disappear until I reached the next viewable location to the East.

We were traveling home from Winston-Salem N.C. to Hamptonville N.C. from a doctor's appointment when my wife and 8 year old daughter saw a strange spherical, silvery object in the sky; as I was driving the vehicle, I was not able to see the object from my perspective, but did observe that the sky seemed most clear and did not see aircraft visible during their siting. The description of the object is theirs: the object produced no vapor trail or other visible changing characteristic, and seemed almost stationary in the sky, but was shiny, and reflected the sunlight at times very strongly. The view of the object persisted for about 5 minutes during the drive until the object was obscured by low, tree lined hills. When our vehicle entered another area on the same highway, no object or aircraft was visible. Our direction on the highway, would have probably been toward the West or Northwest, as I could see the sun out my driver window, but not in my front window; the object would have been hovering or moving over a wooded area with only secondary roads, between any large towns or cities. I saw no sundogs or persistant natural aerial phenomena to explain this siting.

Looking much like a streetlight at perhaps a mile or more distance, it was too big and much too bright to be a star though in colour and size we could have been persuaded that it was Mars at its brightest.  We continued to watch it and when it appeared to move in a retrograde, west to east direction then move higher in the sky, we decided to view it through binoculars. These had just been found and before I could train them on the light, the light suddenly went out.  Through the binoculars, where the object had just been, the sky was clear and the stars, which were bright that night, could be seen.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,,

Okanagan Triangular UFO's Fly in Formation,Kelowna,BC,1982-07-15T21:00:00,formation,1 hour,"Occurred : 7/15/1982 21:00  (Entered as : 07/15/1982 21:00) Reported: 2/8/2004 12:31:49 AM 00:31 Posted: 2/12/2004 Location: Kelowna (Canada), BC Shape: Formation Duration:1 hour",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34912.html,"Okanagan Triangular UFO's Fly in Formation I've only told this story of my experience to a few individuals. After visiting your site I thought it might be a good opportunity to share it with others who have had experiences with UFO's.  It was during the summer of 1982. My highschool buddy (we were both 17 at the time) and I were just arriving at his father's home. It was getting pretty late (just after 9:00 pm), but there still was some sunlight in the sky. His father lived in the west side, upper floor of a fourplex. The unit was quite high and you had to take the stairs up to the second level.  While walking up the stairs my friend pointed west and said ""Look, a ufo!"" I looked in that direction and could not see anything. There was a large tree next to the home and between us and the ufo. he pointed at the object again and I still could not see it. I asked him to describe the object. He told me it was a large glowing redish/orange ball and it was moving up, then across the sky.  Note that Kelowna is located in a valley which holds a large lake. The main city center is on the east side of the lake. The area that we were located was near the downtown core or only a kilometer east of the lake. My friend indicated that the glowing ball appeared to be over the lake, or at least 1 1/2 km from where we were.  The object disappeared and I remember being so disappointed I didn't get a look at it. Especially because my friend said he had seen it so clearly. From there, we both climbed onto the high roof and began to watch the sky as it darkened.  We layed on the roof which faced West for quite awhile (approx - 1/2 - 45 minutes)seeing nothing. Just before we were to head into the house I saw something that I could barely believe.  High in the sky, there was a formation of faint triangular shaped objects flying across the sky. (There was very light cloud cover, however they were definitely above the clouds.) They gave off a faint white light and were moving from South West to North East. They weren't moving very fast at all however all of a sudden you'd see one of the objects leave the formation at an incredible speed and sweep away. It would take angles at such a high speeds that flying aircraft that I have seen could  never make. (not even fighter jets.)  For the next 15 minutes triangular shaped objects joined or left the formation. I was simple astonished by the ease the objects moved at such speeds. When they rejoined the formation they would swoop in and stop in perfect position.  I regularily asked my friend what he was seeing and he repeated exactly what I had just saw. Once I got up and contacted a local radio station to see if anyone else was witnessing what we were seeing.  Soon the formation moved out of sight. We stayed around for another 1/2 or so. We saw a few more triangular objects moving back and forth through the sky. (Some in formation with each other, say two to four objects.)  After it was all over my friend and I just sat and talked about this experience. We have never seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have his friend submit a report, as well.  Very interesting report, we believe.  PD))",2004-02-12T00:00:00,49.928621739130435,-119.4277732173913

Well this is a story that happened a while back I am now 33 and was 14 when this happened,I have never told this story due to the ridicule I would have recieved.  I was walking with my dog as we did this every morning at about 7:00 AM,we always walked around the edge of the field because we did not want to get wet from the dew in the field that early in the morning,...well it just so happened that on the way back,my dog Whiskers, ran a little forward with his ears perked up, I had seen him do this lots of times before whenever he saw or smelled something, then I heard it too.  It was a vibrating whistling sound not very loud but loud enough that you could hear it at about 20 yards or so, so trying to see where this noise was coming from I headed in the direction of the sound and there to my amazement was a blue see-through sphere about a foot in diameter and I remember thinking how beautiful this light was, (if this would have happened in the dark I could only imagine how much of the area it would have lit up as its brightness was astounding)it was about 6 inches below the top of the wheat field,looking like it was going crazy flying in an amazing pattern seeming like it was doing something with reason, it took all of about 3 minutes, I couldn't tell what it was doing.  Then after what was about the most bizarre flying I have ever seen it went up to a level of about ten to fifteen feet in the air and just hovered there for what seemed about 10 to 15 minutes, it then flew along the top of the field in a northern direction not very fast until it was about 200 yards away then with amazing speed it went straight up until you could not see it any more.  Whiskers and I and ran over to the spot where this blue sphere had been and I was totally surprized at what I seen and smelled, it was two perfectly round circles joined together at the sides, the wierd thing was that the wheat around us was totally soaking wet and the wheat inside the circles was completely dry,not warm or anything but still ! none the less completely dry,and to top that off there was this sour tingy smell that even when Whiskers was smelling he would jerk his head backwards as if the smell had burnt his nose. I went and got my Father and told him my story and I think he thought I was crazy until I took him to the sight where it actually happened, I think he was more amazed than I was,he said he had heard of it before but never believed it either..... then he had to get away from the circles though because he said the smell was choking him I remember him telling me to measure them out with his tape measure which I did and found each to be 26 feet in circumfrence right on the nose. I was told not to talk about this incident because dad didn't want people thinking we were crazy..I have never seen this again until I had recently seen this t.v show about crop circles so there you have it I really don't care what people think because I know what I saw and so does my father and my dog Whiskers , so thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy.",2004-02-12T00:00:00,,

A country road through logging lands, just north of the bottom of the Suwannee River at the Gulf of Mexico. Children in the back seat of my car, noticed a ""shadow"" moving paralel to our vehicle on the left and just ahead. I looked out and up from driverside window and saw a triangular shaped (dark) image moving at approximately same speed as our vehicle. It didn't seem to be more that a couple hundred feet high. On this deserted road, I stopped the vehicle and turned off the lights to try to get a better look at what it was. The object stopped, pivoted, and began slowly coming in our direction. There was no sound that could be heard coming from it. The mother in the passenger front seat became very scared and demanded I get in and ""get us out of here"". Somewhat unnerved myself, I complied. I continued to observe this object pace us all the way back to Cross City. The children were slightly scared, and being calmed by their mother. Once in Cross City, I chose not to go directly home not wanting ""it"" to see us pull into the driveway. I watched as the object slowly took a southerly route away from our location. All movement was very slow and some of it's turns where at almost a complete stop and in pivotal fashion. In the star lit country sky, we watched this triangular shaped object cover stars and then see the stars reappear behind it as it moved. It had no lights on, and didn't seem to have any paticular direction to go, sort of as though it were just moving about merely to observe....The next day, I reluctanly approached a freind with the expirience because I was concerned with being thought badly about, since at the time I was in law enforcement. As it turned out several other people had seen this UFO as well. I am divorced from the m! other me ntioned above now, the children were hers from a former marriage.

I have had 3 sightings to date Peter this is my first one.Sorry it took so long though please know I have shared my sightings with other groups. In 1990 I was co-managing a hotel in Garden grove ,Cal. It was a gloomy day in southern Cal. with low clouds and drizzle when in the mid afternoon I heard strange sounding thunder and lighting. I went outside amd thats when I saw ""it""! I can't be exactly sure on the amount because it happened over 10 years ago but I believe there were ""9"" ,I saw nine glowing balls of light in the clouds. They were all in a gemomectric pattern equally spaced apart from each other. When a type of thunder sounded off these objects would begin to grow and get brighter. They also produced this strange loud electrical  sound like a buzzing that would keep getting louder untill one ball kind of exploded. When this happened the ball that exploded sent a lazer like line of electricity at one of the other nine,that one would then do the same with perhaps one opposite it .This continued in a pin ball like fashion as all balls got hit with this lazer thing. Everytime one would recieve it's hit it grew in size and brightness.The balls fired the lazers so fast back and forth at each other it was hard to follow. When the thunder stopped or slowed so did light showthough it would start the next series of ""zaps"" 30 seconds or more later. They seemed to generate their own energy after the initial kick start from the clouds. These balls never moved and them being in the clouds I never saw any more then bright glowing round lights in the low clouds. I went inside our hotel and got my co-worker who was Chinese to see this for him self. On seeing the balls in the sky he ran back inside and tried to pull me in to. ""this is very bad you must get in"" I thought maybe he saw something like this in China so I asked him what it was but of course he had no idea. I have researched many UFO books and have well surfed the internet and have found only two sighting that were a bit similar though not the same.This was very hard to put on paper ,you must have been there to understand how strange yet powerfull it all seemed.

Hi there,  A week before the first article came out in the Airdrie Echo newspaper about sightings, I came home from work about 11:20 pm, and I let the dogs out side and I was also watching a few northern lights off my deck , I live on the east side of  Airdrie, the (deleted by HBCC UFO) are right behind my house. So we have a hill behind my place with a walk way on that goes towards the highway, and I looked over to my left toward the west, and I know what I saw, and it was big circle of lights twirling around and hovering on the walk way and then it just went down, not up. I grabbed my dogs and headed into the house. The next week, I read the article in the paper.  HBCC UFO Report after talking with the witness.  The first thing the witness said was, ""I know what I saw"" and it was really bizarre. The lady let the dogs out onto the deck of her home and then followed them out, stood there and looked to her left and just above a walk way she spotted the lights hovering. The walk way runs a good distance and eventually runs across the highway. The witness said it could not have been children twirling lights as for one thing the circle of lights was very large in size, plus she could not see anyone in the area. She also compared the size to a 10 or 12 foot old C-Band satellite dish. She explained that it looked to her as if it was a ring shaped object with a lot of white lights running all around the outside of it. She also said it appeared that there was not just one set of lights, but layers of them. As she stood and watched this strange display of lights, they started to move down over the hill which would have crossed over Highway #2 until she finally lost sight of the lights. She mentioned that it was approx: a half block away from her location and very bright. Also the lights were moving quickly, but there was no distortion, or the lights appearing to be one long string. She was able to view the individual lights and she told me there was many of them. No sound was heard and the dogs did not react in anyway to the strange lights. The witness said she wasn't frightened at what she saw, but her senses told her it was time to head back into her home. It was visible for approx: 30 seconds before it vanished. I asked if she was able to see anything in the center of the object, she said no, just a ring of lights.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

PD)) This report is in response to the following sighting as it appears on the NUFORC website.  It is a 'comment' report on a follow-up investigation done by a Michigan MUFON Field Investigator.  Occurred : 9/20/2003 18:00 (Entered as : 09/20/2003 18:00) Reported: 9/21/2003 6:45:44 PM 18:45 Posted: 9/24/2003 Location: Fraser, MI Shape: Light Duration:25-30 minutes star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky  My Brother was out in the yard and called to us to hurry and come look at ""this"". In the sky directly above us were what we at first thought were hot air balloons that ascended so high they appeared to look like stars in the clear blue sky. There were 3 in a formation of a perfect triangle to the left and 4 to the right in the shape of a diamond. Then they began to dance in the sky with each other returning to their positions. Coming very close to each other but never colliding. There were 3 sets of these formations. One had a stream of light coming from it leading me to believe it was a hot air balloon but when it ascended up and disappeared I dismissed that idea.  Nearing the 20 minutes of watching these star-like objects dancing in the sky others started to appear as dim stars and became brighter up to 50 were in the sky at one time dancing, but never colliding. They ascended and just disappeared. There was no sound, no aircraft in the area, no tails on the craft above us.  The observers ranged in age from 81 a homemaker, a police detective (just retired)51, myself(laidoff)48, retired auto worker 53, spouse 54, niece 32, Ameritech line man, 51 and spouse, 51.   ------Being Report------- Comments on - WUFOD Case 2-826 - Fraser, MI Multiple Witness Daylight Sighting  I received FI (I.e. Field Investigator) David Twichell’s photocopied forms and report on Sunday November 9, 2003.  My initial impression of this case was that it was a solid case that would produce quite an extensive report due to it being a daylight sighting.  The investigator originally included with his report a copy of the original WUFOD report in context of an email I sent him, Form 1 (2 pages), with an extra page for the spillover of the reporting witness’s personal account, a 2 page hand-written description of the object by the witness, Form 2 (3 pages), Form 4 (1 page), Form 5 (1 page) with an added handwritten page describing the psychological and physiological effects as reported by the witness, a 3 page typed report by FI Twichell, a 2 page printout of the weather conditions for Mt. Clemens, MI on September 20, 2003, a one page small printout of a map of the sighting location and two cassette tapes of the phone interviews of all witnesses involved.  There were 8 witnesses in total however after all was said and done only 1 witness’s signature and form are on file with Michigan MUFON.  The 1-hour onsite interview was done on November 3, 2003 with R G and her mother S at R’s home.  Afterwards, R met with FI Twichell at a local Tim Horton’s restaurant, for another hour, to further discuss her possible abduction, as she didn’t want to discuss this in front of her mother.  The attention of the investigator has been drawn towards R G, who appears to be the dominant witness and whom initially filed the report.  I will summarize my thoughts on the other witnesses accounts first, then R G’ account, and finally on the case as a whole.  MA D, wife of L D, described the event in a very straightforward serious manner, with excellent detail.  The time of the event as noted by M A was around 4:00 pm (2 hour discrepancy here compared to other witnesses T.L.) or a bit thereafter.  She mentions that one of the objects could’ve been a ‘party balloon’ floating upward with a spiral tail attached to the balloon.  She mentions that L, her husband, in fact said it was a party balloon.  M is in agreement with most of the other witness’s in the fact that she stated she was facing south and the objects were moving from west to east.  She suggested that she thought it may have been a ‘weather gadget’ as appears in the movie ‘Twister’, and may have had something to do with weather testing.  She mentions a 45-minute duration to the sighting.   She described the movements of the clusters of objects as being ‘like a butterfly’, no jerky movements.  She also didn’t report any physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting.  L D, the witness who was first to see the objects mentions them catching his eye while he was walking up the back steps, to go in the house, around 3:55 pm.  He was looking towards the west at about 40o up from the horizon.  He stated the sighting duration was approximately 47 minutes.  He too reported no physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting.  He mentioned initially seeing 7 shiny ‘dots’…. 3 being in a ‘straight line’, and 4 being shaped in a ‘straight edged arch’.  He mentions some of the objects rotating around in a circle very slowly.  Most of his account matches closely with that of his wife M A and that leaves me with the question of, “Was there significant collaboration between the two witnesses resulting in some level of contamination in these two accounts?  This seems most evident in the time at which they estimated the sighting began.  S D - L’s Mother - The initial part of this taped conversation has only the voice of FI David Twichell due to the fact that his speakerphone was not turned on. After David asks her about what time [the sighting began - T.L.] there is some silence and then David mentions a time of 6:30 pm during the early part of their conversation.  I’m making what I believe is a valid assumption, based on the taped conversation, that they are speaking of the onset of the sighting event.  She mentions her friends present at the sighting location counting about 8 -10 lights. She stated they were moving around one another and darting back and forth.  She also mentions a sighting duration of 15-20 minutes.  Here we see a large discrepancy in the time of the event onset and the sighting duration as compared to L and M A’s account.  S states the objects were seen ‘overhead’ in the southeast initially and then darted to the west for a short distance further stating that she didn’t have to move her head very much to follow them.  She mentions also that the sun had set approximately 1 hour after the objects disappeared.  The sunset, as listed at the bottom of the weather data, was at 7:30 pm so her approximation of the onset of the event being at 6:30 pm could very well be correct.  She too mentions the possibility of the objects being helium balloons. She also stated she was emotionally excited and had ‘chills’ up and down her arms.  This witness has had a previous sighting of a cigar-shaped object, which she experienced in Canada but no specific information was given about this sighting.  AM G - She initially states the time of the sighting started at 5:30 pm.  She states she was initially facing south, which is in agreement with most of the other witnesses.  She mentions the objects slowly moving, or drifting across the sky and that she watched them for approximately 2 hours (a notable discrepancy in the sighing duration here - T.L.).  For the most part the description of the objects is in agreement with the others.  She states she suffered from no physiological or psychological effects, however she does mention one interesting effect and that was she saw “little white specks” like TV static in her eyes due to her head being craned up towards the sky.  She had to repeatedly look down to relieve this effect and readjust her eyes.  She believes this may have been due to her looking up in the sky for long periods of time.  She said the objects were at an elevation of approximately 80o to directly overhead. (Here too is a discrepancy in what was said to be a 40o elevation for the objects mentioned by the initial witness L. - T.L.)  J G had very little to add to this investigation.  His interview was extremely short.  He was in the house watching a football game and showed very little interest in determining what the others were viewing.  He states the sighting onset was approximately 6:00 pm.  He stated he didn’t look at the objects long enough to discern much detail.  He stated what he saw was a bunch of cluster type star shapes and then went right back in to watch the football game, not looking at them long enough to even determine if they were moving.  He stated that the other witnesses stayed outside for 15-20 minutes watching the objects.  M Z stated onset of sighting event was about 5:30 pm.  She stated she saw white ‘balls’ like a balloon but it wasn’t a balloon.  She states there was about 15-20 of them and the sighting duration was a good 45 minutes.  She stated that the objects were in different areas and not in one spot.  The witness says they [her and the other witnesses] were all kind of nervous.  M stated that R called [reported them to MUFON] because her and her mother thought these were some kind of thing from outer space.  She states the objects were moving in different directions, yet says that it could’ve been the wind blowing them.  She said at no time did they change color.  No physiological or psychological effects noted by this witness.  Witness, in my opinion, seemed very hesitant to give out her address, and left only her phone number with FI Twichell.  Her husband M was interviewed later.  MZ stated he saw 10 whitish things that could’ve been balloons.  He didn’t watch them too long and didn’t think anything of it.  Stated it didn’t interest him so he went back in the house.  Onset of event he says was 5:30 - 5:45 pm.  To him it looked like balloons.  He stated they were kind of drifting not going any certain way.  Objects were at a high altitude.  He watched the objects for approximately 5 minutes.  Nothing unusual noticed, as they were too far away to tell.  No color changes noticed.  Very short interview…approximately 3 minutes.  R G, the witness who reported this incident, was affected quite differently by this event.  She states the onset of the event was around 6:00 pm with a total duration of 25-30 minutes, which fits in well with most of the other witness’s accounts, except for those of L and MA D.  She first thought these were hot air balloons.  She went on to describe their movements using the word ‘dancing’ meaning they would move towards and away from, and around each other.  She initially saw 7 objects in two different groups.  She describes the color as being dim blue then turning brighter.  She goes on to describe in detail, as evidenced in the taped interview, many perceptions that weren’t described by the other 7 witnesses.  R’s size estimation being that of an aspirin, as suggested by the FI is quite in opposition to the starlike description given by the other witnesses.  She relates her account in a very excited way with a lot of emotion in her voice.  The other witnesses sounded much calmer when relating their accounts.  R mentions another sighting she witnessed about 17 years ago in which she called Selfridge ANG at that time as well, with no response from her message left on the automated answering system at the base.  20 minutes into her phone interview R adamantly mentions there was not a plane anywhere in the sky.  She then mentions, about 27 minutes into the interview that “after, a jetliner was by and it was higher than that”.  This point being unclear as to whether or not the objects were in the sky during the time the plane was seen.  I asked FI Twichell to clarify this if he could.  He states, “As to the plane involved in the sighting of Sept. 20th, I’m sorry I’m not making myself clear on this.  I didn’t make a copy of the recorded interviews so I can’t check them for clarity but the witnesses agree that they did not see any conventional aircraft in the sky until the very end of the sighting episode.  While the objects were still above them, a jet, coming from the direction of Selfridge, came into view and headed in the direction of the objects.  At this time, the objects ascended and were gone from view.  MA stated that the plane was visible while the objects were still visible.  R goes on to mention her husband’s flu-like illness previous to the sighting and it’s complete reversal during the sighting, and then a subsequent relapse afterwards.  She feels this may be relevant.  Her husband did not mention this during his interview.  R also noticed a definite difference in local animal activity whereas the others did not, and also mentioned an eerie silence during the event.  She goes on to describe the remainder of the sighting as mentioned within David’s report.  David then sent another report to me, via email, dated October 2, 2003 regarding RG's possible abduction event.  This report brings up the question as to why this wasn’t mentioned in her initial telephone interview with David.  I believe there is some level of malleability evident within R.  I posed a few intentional leading questions to David that he posed to R.  I asked, “Was there any physical evidence left as a result of these abductions?” and she replied, “I have a scoop marking on the left lower leg learing [nearing? T.L.] the front of my shin. Also on my right leg the first night of my ""dreams"" I recall injuring the inside of my leg just above my ankle with a terrible hemotoma, as I hit it trying to run away, I believe. When I returned to my bed there was dirt and tiny stones in my sheets and I had no socks on. (I ALWAYS wear socks to bed) The hemotoma was so bad I thought I had broke my leg...I iced it for several days. Today my flesh is still discolored, but it is no longer black and blue it is a dark reddish with a slight purple tint color that you would see from a fresh bruise. It is 4 inches across by 2 1/2 inches up and down. I will say this... when my doctor saw this back in May, he said it was a terrible bruise and it would heal right up with time... I never brought it up again.”  It is difficult for me to understand her knowledge of how ‘scoop marks’ are associated with abductions without any previous knowledge of UFOs or the abduction phenomena.  Another question asked was, “Did these abductions take place at the same time on each consecutive day?”  She replied, “Yes they took place at the same exact time each night consecutively @ 3:00 A.M. This is the first time I recall distinctively the time. I see the time on my clock in my room and I cannot wake my spouse. I am being pulled by my feet from my bed.”  Another question asked was, “Any poltergeist type activity in the home before or after the abduction event? She replied, “There has been an abundance of poltergeist type of activities in my home from the toilet fully flushing and the handle moving to the downward position. We have had books moved from bookcases and placed opened onto the table, mostly civil war books. I have had my college papers missing and my books only to look feverishly for them and they appear before my eyes as I could have stumble over them. We have gotten phone calls with tones instead of static and we have caller ID... nothing appeared or registered.  My sister came over and did a Catholic exorcism in my home with a tape and holy water saying prayers and Blessed candles lit. I was still in tears from the ""dreams"" and emotionally upset because I hadn't saved the baby... unable to sleep or eat, and did not want to be bothered by anyone as I felt they did not understand my emotional state. Oh yes! The radio would turn on in the bedroom and change radio stations from one to another and another and another.”  I believe her emotional state at the time of the above exorcism up until the September sighting event and possibly afterwards may be an important aspect of this case and should be looked into further, probably by Dr. T.  FI Twichell states that R claims not to have been previously interested in the UFO phenomenon prior to this event. She said that she hasn’t read any books or watched any documentaries on the subject.  If this is true then her ‘abduction dream’ is simply astounding and would correlate well with other KNOWN abduction accounts, however the question remains with me, where would she have obtained knowledge of the often reported, ‘scoop mark’.  According to R, there also appears to be evidence of an abrupt change in her personality.  There also appears to be other serious differences of opinion and disagreements between R and her other family members regarding the above-mentioned exorcism, matters regarding R’s mother, and her husband’s health issues that may be compounding factors in this case which would best be dealt with by Dr. T.  Again, a further in-depth background check would be necessary to confirm these personality changes as well as any family problems now existent and any previous interest she may have regarding the UFO phenomena.  On Form 2, first page, under ‘Shape’ I noticed that ‘disk’ was checked off but I hadn’t heard any witness mention anything about a ‘disk’ shape to these objects.  I queried David about this and he replied, “The one object that appeared to be larger than the others, with the curly-Q tail, was described by R G as being more disk-shaped than star like. She was the only witness that made this observation.  I’m not aware of where this statement appears in the context of the material that has been made available to me (T.L.).  I completed forms 4 & 5 as indicated on the forms.  These were sent by the FI, via postal mail, to the witness to be completed and signed.  Once she returned them he felt they shouldn’t be altered after her signature was placed on the form.  I added the necessary data in order to complete the forms.  At this time R’s possible abduction event and the sighting that was initially reported to MUFON will be handled as separate entities.  WUFOD, NUFORC and Filer’s Files were checked for sighting reports that may be relevant to this report but nothing of any significance was discovered.   This sighting was also reported on September 21, a day previous to it being reported to WUFOD, to Peter Davenport’s NUFORC website.  See http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31702.html I’m not aware of any other communications between R and Mr. Davenport.  Mr. Davenport has made the original report available to me.  Due south of the sighting location is Victor Airway 221- 464 which is on an 85o (E-W) heading.   Wind direction from ground level (329 ft. at DTX weather station at Pontiac White Lake) to ~35,000 ft. ranged from 240o - 270o (blowing from the west to east approximately) at speeds ranging from to 6 - 50 mph respectively.  From 35,000 ft. to 97,000 ft. the wind direction was a bit more sporadic, ranging from 20o - 240o at speeds ranging from 58 - 3.5 mph respectively. These figures were taken from radiosonde data from the above-mentioned Nexrad weather station located approximately 30 miles northwest of the sighting location near Waterford, Michigan.  Archived NOTAM’s (Notice to Airmen) were also checked for the date in question but nothing of note was listed.  In my opinion it is evident that helium balloons tied together could account for some of the movements described by the majority of the witnesses.  As far as the event time and sighting duration discrepancies are concerned I would tend to think the 6:00 pm time range is correct due to the fact that the party was completed and the cleanup had begun.  The football game (Michigan vs. Oregon) was televised at 3:30 pm with the postgame show starting at 6:30 pm.  The sighting duration discrepancies are wide ranging but all estimates are, as far as typical UFO sightings are concerned, rather long in duration.  This would make me lean even further towards the ‘balloon’ hypothesis as a possible explanation due to the objects slow and drifting movements.  There are some aspects such as the color change and ‘beam of light’ or ‘light bar’ noted by a few of the witnesses that would be difficult to explain via the balloon hypothesis, other than it being some type of reflective string used to tie the balloons together.  Overall, I would have to evaluate this sighting as BORDERLINE IFO due to the distance between the witnesses and the objects, the object’s ‘point like’ appearance yielding no notable surface characteristics or structure, and their slow drifting movements.  Currently R G has been put in touch with Dr. T concerning her abduction type experiences and she may be scheduling a regressive hypnosis session in the near future.   I feel that her abduction experiences, and their associated emotional difficulties, should be dealt with by a qualified Doctor who can separate the abduction experiences from the more ‘normal’ emotional difficulties that may have arisen due to unrelated health and family issues which R G is facing. This could possibly provide her some relief or coping mechanism for both situations.

Was not going to report this, but read another account for Hartford, WI which recounted an experience, similar to possibly three or four experiences I have had at nightin the past 18 months.  One of those experiences I reported on an earlier date that occurred last year.  I was awakened from a sound sleep by a blinding light which looked like a full Moon, but didn't make any sense at the time.  Later, I called a local observatory and found out that my experience happened on a night when the Moon was not full, and that the direction it would have been in made it impossible for what I saw to be the MOON.  Now in the past three months or so I have seen a light flash above my head over the bed on the wall in my bedroom.  There has not been any sound, but I am extremely agitated some nights and find it hard to go to sleep ever since the last experience with the light coming through my venetian blinds.  The first instance with this experience happened here the Summer before last.  I have found praying the Rosary, helps me go to sleep.  I only started doing the Rosary on October 18th this year.  I find that saying it while I am laying in bed helps me go to sleep and the fear factor has diminished due to this practice.  I had not felt compelled to say the Rosary for years and am what some would call a fallen away Catholic.  By coincidence the night I started saying the Rosary a friend gave me one.  The gift came a day or so after a good friend died.  Something neither the giver of the gift or myself were aware of, so the coincidental nature of all this is very strange.  Another event, I have not formally reported occurred last March and involved a huge triangle over the edge of the property where the driveway is situated which curves around to the apartment in which I have lived for close to two years now! I noticed around the time of my experience a pilot of a private jet aircraft saw a similar object in the air about 140 nautical miles SE of Columbus which is located approximately 20 miles S of where I am living.  I was never sure of the date of that occurrence, but have wondered if what he and I saw occurred on the same night.  He saw a huge triangle which is what I saw also!  Appreciate this website since it is helping me to relate and understand that other people are having the same expeiences I am.  It also helps jog my memory about them, since somehow I have a natural tendency to deny or block the stuff from myself!  That kind of bothers me and makes me wonder if there are other suppressed memories that my mind refuses to cull up? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-12-09T00:00:00,40.2827,-83.0559

His website is <www.FUSE.NET>, where many interesting cases can be found.  PD I spoke with the witness from Trotwood, Ohio (suburb of Dayton).  Mrs.R.(name on file) related to me her close encounter with a UFO on the evening of October 25th, 2003 around 10:40 P.M.  Mrs. R. was taking her granddaughter, age 3, home. She had been babysitting.  Her daughter lives in a semi-rural area with only an occasional lamp post on the road side. As Mrs. R. approached a 4 way stop which was Union Rd. and Little Richmond Rd., she spotted what looked to be a ""glowing red S"" just above tree top level. The elongated ""letter S"" was on its side as opposed to be standing up.  She likened the light of the S to the glow of the coils in a toaster. As Mrs R. came to the four way stop she then saw that the S seemed to be on the bottom of a stationary object. She described the object as a bell shape at top coming down to be shaped like a hat brim.  The object was as long as a Cessma plane and about as tall as a one story house.  The object was black or dark gray in color.  It hovered about 6-8 feet above the tree tops.  Mrs. R. goes on to state that around the bottom of the object there were small round white/bluish lights that held steady.  The object made no sound. At this point Mrs. R. says she became very frightened fearing for her granddaughter who sat beside her in the car.  Mrs. R. says she became so frightened that she did not know to speed off or stay to watch the object longer.  She said that another vehicle was present at the 4-way stop, remembering that she saw a pair of headlights.  She does not remember what the vehicle did as she concentrated only on the object.  She said that she watched the object for a little over a minute.  Suddenly the object shot straight up and veered off to her right and was gone at a tremendous rate of speed.  At this point Mrs. R. states she also sped off to her daughters house.  Mrs. R. went on to explain that she has no interest in the subject of UFOs.  She has seen pictures of them on TV.  She also stated she had no truoble with her car during the sighting.  She spotted no other aircraft in the area at the time of her sighting.  She called her mother and told her of her experience. She also spoke to coworkers of her event.  Weather condidtions for that night were clear with calm winds and warm temps. INVESTIGATION: I contacted the Trotwood Police Dept.  They reported that no calls had been place on the date in question of a poosible UFO sighting. COMMENT: I find Mrs.R. to be a credible witness and truthful in her remarks. ADDTIONAL NOTES: I spoke with Mrs. R's mother after our conversation. She confirmed to me that her daughter did indeed call her from her cell phone on the way home after the incident. She sounded frightened and upset.  She described what she had seen to her mother.  Her mother relayed the details of the conversation which matched what her daughter told me. At one point her mother said that her daughter is a very no nonsense type person and if she tells you something you can believe her. She also states that her daughter was a skeptic until she saw the UFO. Filed 11/30/03  This report was investigated by Donnie Blessing, Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON",2003-12-09T00:00:00,,

I was on my way to see my sister-in-law in Cleveland OH.  It is about a six to seven hour drive (depending on how you drive) from New York City.  I have made this trip several times alone; in fact, I should have been a trucker with all the miles I place on my vehicles a year.  I had taken a half-day from work so I could sleep and be well rested for the long drive.  I packed a few bottled waters, some Ritz crackers, and a handful of grapes.  I do not drink coffee, I do not smoke, and I do not use those ‘no doze’ pills.  If I am tired, there is always a rest area or the side of the road.  Therefore, I guess I can say I was ready to travel, wide-awake, and not under any influences. The roads were empty, the main reason I travel at night, and the weather was slightly cloudy.  The last sign I recall seeing was the Chesapeake Watershed indicator- lets you know this area sends its water to VA.  I had very little company trucking wise on 80, they were all moving way to fast for me.  (Should anyone recall my little auto, I pulled into the passing lane to let you all fly by.  Something about lane changes at those speeds in large vehicles frightens me.)  It was uneventful driving. I would say halfway through PA, the sky cleared.  There were no headlights in my mirrors and no tail lights as far as I could see.  The stars came out.  I have a telescope and star gaze often.  I pulled over on the shoulder between mile markers.  (I am going back shortly and will get the exact mile.)  I was on 80 west.  Using 80 as true west and seated in my auto, the Orion constellation was to the south-southeast declination + 40 to 45 degrees and the moon was left of Orion and almost directly behind me, almost due east.  It was half full, waning, and declination of +30 to35 degrees on horizon almost lining up with the tip of Orion’s extended right arm.  To see Orion I had to turn and look out both driver front and back windows.  The moon was in the farther most corner of the back driver’s side passenger window.  It was so far back in the window that I got out to look up at the sky.  It was clear as glass.  There were no streetlights or houses or the glare form a town to interfere.  I saw some stars I haven’t seen in a while living in the city.  I sat on the boot of my auto for maybe 8 minutes just looking up.  I can say 8 minutes because the song ‘Blue’ was playing and it is just about 8 minutes long.  Ah, size!  The moon was about the size of a racquetball at arm’s distance, it was very bright.  The ground was cast in the silvery blue of moonlight.  Bright enough that when I got back in my auto I drove several miles before I realized my headlights were not on.  Orion seemed to occupy the space of a standard mouse pad at arm’s length. Well, a Wal-Mart truck screamed by and I heard some roadside gravel hit my auto prompting me to get back in and go.  I gave one last look at the sky and remarked aloud to myself how the three sisters in Orion’s belt seemed brighter than normal.  I shook it off as I could see all the stars for a change and maybe that was it.  Again, it was such a bright moon; I drove without lights for a few miles before a passing FedEx honked me into turning them back on with quickness.  I think I drove for about 30 minutes, there was some light traffic from the trucks, and they passed me and I blinked them back over.  I passed a rest area and had 80 to myself again: no lights in the mirrors or taillights before me. As you can imagine, 80West turns here and there.  Orion moved in my windows almost to the front.  I just needed to glance out my window without turning to see him.  This is where it becomes weird.  I shall endeavor to do my best. The three sisters in Orion’s belt seemed to grow as I drove.  No, I was not tired.  I have not had the pleasure of highway hypnosis.  I was munching my crackers and trying to sing.  A line of 8 trucks, Wal-Mart, G.O.D, J.B. Hunt, and several municipal waste carriers flew by frightening the life out of me that I pulled off the road on the center shoulder.  It was not enough that I expeditiously moved into the passing lane to get out of the way of these maniacs.  No, they were barreling down in both lanes, blinking, and honking as they passed each other, almost drag racing and advancing on my little blue ’90 Toyota Camry sedan with bright lights blaring.  There was not choice but off the road completely.  I sat there until I was certain they were miles ahead of me.  If I were sleepy, under highway hypnosis, or just lost in my head, I was fully awake and alert now.  I eased back on 80W letting a few fellow travelers pass me.  A pickup from IL that had Truck on it’s tag, a green Lexus, a tow-truck towing a racing team trailer, All Car Racing Team-white, silver, and maroon formula racing car logo on the back ramp.  Then I was alone again. I looked up to Orion out my window and for a moment saw six sisters.  Then suddenly they were three.  I thought my eyes failed to focus, but the three sisters were huge then back to normal size.  I drove on with a mounting feeling that something was just not right.  I kept watching the belt of Orion.  They were getting bigger and brighter and to my horror closer.  Panic started to grip me as I turned another bend.  That is when I realized what might be happening.  God, I’m seeing a UFO.  There were three spheres of bluish white light just of center of Orion’s belt.  If not for the bend in the road, they would have aligned just perfect.  They were just about the size of a dime at arm’s length. Nah, I am just tired.  I poured one bottle of cold water on my head, just to be certain.  I looked out and they were still there.  I looked with earnest; maybe this was night balloon flight.  I have been on one and it is eerie.  Hot air balloons with lights shining up from the gondola into the balloon giving it an otherworldly glow.  I saw no burners and the shapes were perfectly round.  I stepped a lot harder on the gas.  Every abduction scenario I have ever heard raced through my head. Not me!  I grabbed my mobile: no signal.  I topped 95 MPH and my car began to shake.  All I wanted to do was get to other people, another traveler, truck even- just not alone.  I had to bring it back down to 80MPH to stop the shaking.  My eyes kept a watch on the three lights.  They seemed to be following me.  I glanced at the radio 2 am.  I looked back out the window and they were gone.  I craned my neck to see out every piece of glass and saw nothing. WHEW! This was a relief.  They were gone.  I eased of the gas and coasted to about 50MPH.  I opened the last bottle of water and poured it on my head.  I was sitting in a puddle, but it was preferable to ((deleted)) probing.  I eased my poor auto around the next corner and freaked.  All three balls of light were headed straight at me.  Yes, sure I though it was a vehicle in the wrong lane headed straight at me but this highway is split in half by some serious hills and valleys.  You would have to be suicidal to drive the wrong way.  However, they were at the tops of the trees ruling out a truck or car.  I feared for my life. My steering wheel suddenly started twisting left and right, swerving me all over the road.  I gripped it so tightly trying to keep control, I put a blood blister on my right thumb.  The more I fought the harder it became to control.  It seemed to me that the lights were controlling my auto.  In that clarity that comes in absolute terror, I let my steering wheel go.  They obviously were more powerful than I was and if they had control of my auto, how was I going to get it back?  I resigned myself to ((deleted)) probing and let go of the wheel.  The moment I let go, my car straightened out and the lights surrounded me.  There was one on the front bumper and one on each side.  They guided my auto on 80 for a few minutes, send beams into my auto, attempted communication, and then they shot up into the stars and were gone.  When I looked back at the clock it was saying about 2:15 am.  It seemed much longer. I got a very good look at their details.  They were perfectly spherical.  They all seemed to be identical.  The one on my door is the one I studied.  It was about 2 meters in diameter, made of a metal, and every millimeter was seamed in an intricate lattice.  It looked as if the latticework were the actual joins that made the sphere.  There was no external openings for the light or any propulsion jets.  It seemed to be bending light around it.  I felt vibrations like an electric shaver pulsing through me.  I saw what looked like the ripples from the hot pavement in the heat of summer pulsing just between it and my car door.  Perhaps it is some sort of energy field that pulled it through the air and now was holding my auto.  Between each sphere and my auto was this ripple, maybe some magnetic field that allowed them to control my auto.  There was no sound, not even my auto.  The engine had stopped.  The timbre of the tires sounded as if I were driving through snow.  The power to my dashboard dimmed, all the lights just barely faded out. The spheres changed color.  I could not detect the source of the lighting.  They went from the white blue of twinkling stars to a dim silvery blue almost the shade of the moon light on the ground then back to the white blue.  The sphere in front changed to a pale washed out sea foam green.  Then as it an aperture had opened a beam of that same pale green light shot out through my engine to me covering my pelvis.  It felt as if someone had struck me with a bat.  Not so much pain as being forced back into my seat. The sphere on the passenger side shot a beam through the door at the same level in the same green.  It was very short and painless.  When the beam stopped the sphere changed to the sea foam green.  I turned and looked out my window to see the last sphere change to a deep sapphire blue. I felt a slight bump, like a high speed bump.  That is when I knew what the ripples were.  My auto was somehow in the air from the moment I let go of the wheel.  It was some kind of force/magnetic beam.  As soon as I touched down, the two green spheres changed to a pulsing red and shot up into the sky. The blue sphere was still at my side. It opened my window.  (I sure as heck was not going to open it.)  I could see the entire sphere.  The intricate lattice seemed to glow in a deep purple.  Below it on the pavement, the air seemed to be buzzing, not rippling like before.  The sphere was about eye level with me as if trying to stare me down. A bright light blinded me hitting me square in the face.  I could feel its warmth on my skin, feel the same electric razor vibration, and I could not see.  I was paralyzed with fear.  I could not move, scream, speak, think-anything!  Suddenly there was this mechanical voice.  It sounded as if it came from inside my head.  It felt as if it were all around me.  It said, ‘sorry for your loss.  It is our loss as well.’  It was like a machine trying to imitate a sound it never heard before.  It was monstrous and harsh, but is had sincerity in it as well. I could move.  The light was gone.  I reached out to touch the sphere, but before I could raise my hand, it turned red and shot into the sky.  I stuck my head out the window (I know fatal mistake).  It joined the other two and they blinked out of sight in less than a second.  When I say joined I mean as a group not into one unit. My auto started.  The lights on my dash came back up.  It said 2:15am.  I was going about 5 MPH.  A truck horn made me stand on the gas and get out of its way. The next exit was I believe Loch Haven.  I got out and changed into something dry at the rest area.  Several trucks were parked, sleeping.  All my music is somewhat eerie and spooky.  I choose the radio.  I landed on Coast to Coast and there you have it.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,,

Iwas driving and looking almost directly west at the time. It was moving slowly from left to right (south to north) in the direction of Alliance Airport. I couldnt see it clearly because it seemed to be shifting somehow. I thought at first it was a small aircraft towing a banner as that would account for the rectangular shape but it was too blocky in appearance to be a banner unless it was either moving tangentially away from me or toward me. The color was a greyish..but it was mottled and also made me think it was a semi transparent banner from a pretty good distance. The other thing that made me discount the banner was it was moving a good bit too fast to be a banner..they simply dont move that quickly. It wasnt that fast because i could easily get the general movement of the object even though it was vague. For a moment i thought it may have been 2 aircraft in formation but discounted that as well because of the way it moved. i lost site of the object as it appeared to move away or turn with the narrow part of it toward me..i also was going under an overpass and when i came back out on the other side scanning the full horizon lost it all together. This was a very muted image at best..but was very substantial when it first appeared. the size of it when holding thumb and forefinger at arms length would be about an inch. It is altogether impossible for me to say how far it was..but the airport i related it to (Alliance) is approximately 10 miles n-w of where i-d put the image,2003-10-31T00:00:00,32.84832417582418,-97.1365054945055

I was curious because of its sleek apearance that perhaps it was some new type private jet I just assumed I didn't see the wings because of the angle I was looking at it from the side.  However I continued to watch it and it turned and continued off to my left as I watched it I thought it was strange that it was so slow moving and to my surprise it came to a stop.  I watched it another minute and it finally took off I even stopped my car in the middle of the road.  After it took off and I tried to continue to track it because of all the trees in the neighborhood I lost sight.  I never saw any wings on this craft.  I drove home immediatly to see if I could see it from my house and so I could show my son but it was gone.  Curiously it was following the path of the American River, flew over the fish hatcheries there and then over lake Nimbus when I lost sight.  Another odd fact..we have a very large company on about 20 acres, Aerojet General who builds and tests rocket engines right along side the fish hatchery.

In the sky, in my line of sight, I saw a bright spherical shapped object which was moving slowly to the SW. The ufo moved from straight above my position to a point about 35 degrees above the SW horizon, where it stopped. It remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then it began to move slowly towards the NW. As this ufo moved back towards my position, I noticed a second ufo of the same shape, size, and color and traveling on the same trajectory as the first ufo. The first ufo was beginning to dim as it moved to the NW. The ufo on the SW course remained bright. The two ufo's passed each other moving in opposite directions. As I was looking at the second ufo, I lost track of the first one. The second ufo also stopped in the same manner as the first, and then it also proceeded on a NW track. As the second ufo traveled NW, it too began to fade as though it were gaining altitude. I watched this ufo until it finally faded out. Both of these ufo's traveled on an identical triangular path in the sky,stopping at the same position, and turning to travel in the opposite transverse direction. The movement was very perfect, as though a designated flight pattern had been precalculated.  The entire sighting lasted for about 8 minutes.

One witness noticed a strange object in the sky, directly overhead and drew the other’s witness attention to it.  The object was heading due north at a very slow rate of speed at best guess at an altitude of 5,000 feet and much to slow for any conventional aircraft. Since the wind was out of the north, the craft had to be propelled by something. However, upon closer observation the craft appeared smooth, silver in color, cigar shaped and had no other visible means of population. We all listened close for noise a conventional craft would make but the craft made no noise what so ever.  The absence of wings or external engines/jets made us really wonder what was propelling this craft.

I looked up and saw what looked to me like a plane moving above without its lights on, just visible from what I thought was the reflected lights of reno on the bottom of it. It had the same color of the bottom of a cloud that has city lights reflecting on it. There were a few points of this dull orange glow that I thought were the wings and fuselage and other parts of a plane, in that they were moving along together.  It was not bright and nothing especially wierd about it.  I had time to think "" Why is that plane flying without its lights on""  I think I said that interupting my friend, but as he continued his story, the individual points of dull orange split apart and seemed to orbit each other, swirling in a sort of pulsating sphere and then shoot of in all different directions.  I imediately had a wierd felling because the motion was so synchronized and so amazing I felt like it was obviously a product of some superior intelligence.  My friend thought I was joking.  The light had changed but there was no one behind me so I stopped for a minute and looked to see if maybe something was reflecting on my wind shield (with so many lights in reno) but I didn't see anything and the objects were completely gone.

The reason I am posting this is because I have been sitting on it for so long and I have read and reread the report for 11/01/95 from my town and what my friend and I saw seems so similar that I am wondering if it was the same thing. I was driving my friend home really late at night- some time between 1am and 3am I guess, as that was the normal time for me to drive her home when she'd visit.  I turned down a side street, using the same way I always took her home (so I would not have to turn around on her street to get back to the main road).  When we got to the stop sign at the end of the street there was a very bright light kind of hovering above the power lines in the field across the street, I think what you call high tension lines- the ones on the huge metal structures.  I would say that, if I think about it, it may have been the size of a dime at arm's length.  Anyway, we're at the stop sign and looking and I said, ""Do you see that?""  And my friend said, ""What is it?"" and she wanted to get out of the car.  It was kind of surreal.  I can't remember if I put the car in park but I must have.  I reached to my friend and held her shirt so she wouldn't get out because I was terrified, like the blood drained from my body (I can feel it as I am typing this and remembering).  The thing hovered for a little bit, maybe 2 minutes or maybe more, it seemed like forever.  I also remember briefly wanting to get out of the car and look but by then it started to move parallel to the street I had been going to turn onto, going the same direction which I believe is W or NW.  So I turned the car and we watched it going faster until our vision was blocked by trees and I had to turn onto her street (the street we were on ends abruptly). Afterwards we talked about it and I remember saying her mother would be angry she had missed it because she was very much into reading about UFO's and other things like that.  We both agreed it was not a plane.  Neither of us were drinking or doing drugs and we were both several years out of High School by then.  I live right on one of the flight paths for Logan Int'l Airport and am pretty used to and familiar with the airplane paths and their looks.  The night was also clear so they were not running many patterns over our area.  Never reported this to anyone except family.  To this day if I drive down that particular street I stare up at those wires just in case. If you need to contact me, I'd prefer by email.

It was kinda hazy at times but it was following us.I didnt say anything to my husband because i was unsure of what I was seeing and didnt want to sound crazy. It stayed just above tree level and when we reached the shop my husband went in. I continued to watch it because it was in the field to the side of the shop.I watched it more closely because the light became very bright and started moving up and down side to side very fast.Like someone had a flash light and was blinking it on and off.I remember thinking this is not real and also thinking how I had seen stuff like this on tv.We were on a ranch backroad and all i could think was mutalated cows.Ha Ha! So in that instant all these thoughts were going through my mind I started getting a little afraid and then it was gone.It zoomed off like faster than anything i had ever seen.I kept my mouth shut and didnt say anything to my husband when he came out I think I was in disbelief.

I first noticed the objects as I was playing basketball outside.  I have been a UFO fanatic since i was very young, and still am.  The sun was on the horizon, giving the sky an orange-yellowish color.  The three objects were moving in various angles, shapes, and speeds.  at some points, they would move halfway across the sky in almost no time at all.  I observed them with my normal vision before i got my binoculars.  when i looked at them more closely, their shapes did not change, making me almost certain that they were circular or spherical in shape.  As i watched further, i noticed that they were almost playing around.  One would stay motionless in the center, while the other two would move in almost perfect circles and/or ovals.  Almost sparatically, one of the UFO's instantly disappeared from sight.  Mind you, these objects were way above the treeline, so it must have escaped at a tremendous speed.  the other two UFO's continued their flying routine, and sometimes would have one of them revolve almost perfectly around the other, motionless one.  At some points, they would disappear and then reappear at a different area in the sky.  what was strange was that they were both orange, which im guessing was because of the sky's color.  But what didn't make sense was the fact that the shape and color of the ships were so easy to distinguish in the sky.  they should have been hard to be spotted, but they were visually clear even by the naked eye.  I could only stand and watch in awe, and i knew that i was too young to have my parents let me use a camera of any kind in the house.  Then, the most amazing thing happened.  In the middle of the revolving dance, the center object began to grow larger, and it's glow became much greater.  the other object then flew right into the other ship and disappeared.  the remaining UFO then began to move in violent yet beautiful circles.  And then, just like that, it disappeared.  to this day i haven't forgotten a single detail of what i saw that day, and i h! ave been waiting to tell this story for a long time.

"" I was as close as 30 yards away"" Ive been holdin on to this imformation for years, thinking that maybe it could have just been some unknown or known military arcraft out of fort benning georiga, but over time, ive began to hear the same description from other people. what i do know is that what i saw was very strange....around the summer time of 1996, me and a friend were 15/16 years old camping, we decided to go riding the country roads looking for deer or just something to get into. 5 miles west of lumpkin georgia on hwy. 39 connector/canyon rd., we came around a curve about 11:00pm, there was a bright light that caught our eye about the same time, on the northern side of the road right across the road from this little out in the country poor lookin grocery store, as we got closer, we were kinda shaken up, because we had just prior to seeing this thing, talking about u.f.o.s. We were sober, not under the influence of our previous conversation or any kind of drug i can assure you. This craft was aprox. 35 to 40 yards wide, 8 to 12 yards from top to bottom, Circular shaped. It was hovering with almost no sound right above this old abandoned house with pecan trees around it. The craft had to be right at treetop level. coming up to this craft i seen it had two visible red lights, one at each end in the center of top and bottom. upon getting closer, i realized that the red lights were revolving around the craft at some speed, only the ones at each end would be at an angle for them to be seen from any standing point. There was a great white/off white light beaming down directly from the bottom all the way to the ground, almost like it was pulsing very quickly. by this time i was only about 30 yards from the craft, and i was proceeding directly under it almost to the left side of it. i looked out my window, stopped, the light underneath it shut off, and it began slowly moving off to the north-east, I got a birds eye view of the bottom of this thing. Its very hard to explain, i could draw it better, but ill try anyway, It was! circular, but underneath, it had the shape of a spiter, six to eight large steel looking arms extending from the middle to the edges, like a star shape from the bottom of it, there was very little sound, and my car was almost directly underneath this thing, it was only probubly 30 feet in the sky above me, in these spiter like legs, they were turning at what looked like a high speed, i seen heat vapors coming from under it, like when you look on top of a hot black top road, you see the blur of the heat rising. the outside edge that held the red lights was spinning, it was night, i did not get a perfect look at the thing, but i got a real good look at the bottom of it and sides. no flying craft that i know of consist of a 40 yard wide circle, that can hover above your head at 30 feet, make no noise hardly, and drift off like that, once it moved up over the trees about 200 yards away, it was like it just vanished, no sound, no light, the moment it went over the trees out of my sight, it was like it was long gone, it must have picked up some serious speed, but i did not see it. whatever was inside had to have seen me, cause i stood out in the road with a big mag light lookin at the bottom as it passed almost directly over us. it felt as if i caught it off guard when i came around the curve, cause i was going over 90 mph, i snuck up on it, the big white light underneath cut off, and then it started movin off, and thats when i seen the bottom of it. The reason for me not telling anyone about this until years later,...well i didnt know who to tell lol. Aint never really thought of tellin my story, but i figured some people might find it useful. since ive been watching on tv, and ive seen where people drawed what they seen and it looks almost exacally what ive seen, actually i could add to their drawing the missing pieces. I have no reason to file a hoax, Im not lookin for anyone to say anything back to me, or for anyone to post this, but feel free to if you want. Ive yet to see anything suspicious in stewart ! county since 1996. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-12-19T00:00:00,32.0356,-84.8549

All of the lights continued moving in the same direction as the original light; none appeared to fall, which I assume they would have had they been flares dropped from the original light (well, airplane, in that instance). Also, each of the lights--the original, as well as those that came ""out"" of it--were identical in apparent size--they were point sources--as well as color, luminosity, etc. They were identical, so far as I could tell.  The original object was traveling much too slowly to have been a meteor or other bolide breaking up in the atmosphere--or so I would judge. I distinctly remember that I had the impression that it was not a natural object of that sort, but rather an object--objects--under intelligent control.  I wish I had written down precisely what happened right after I saw it, because the details are now a little fuzzy. For instance, I cannot recall now if all of the subsequent lights ""merged out"" of the original light, or if each new light then split into another one; it may well have been the latter. In any case I remember being very perplexed by it. It was certainly out of the ordinary. I am an amateur astronomer, and this was something I had never seen before. I don't know what it was--I'm not prepared to say it was an alien spacecraft or anthing of the sort--but it was definitely something I could not identify.  I am a skeptic, but I'll admit I'm interested in the topic of UFOs. One point that may interest some: one often hears from (other) skeptics and debunkers that astronomers--i.e., people accustomed to observing the night sky and familiar with its various phenomena, from eclipses to apparitions of the planets to meteors, etc.--never report seeing unusual objects in the sky.

Having lived in this area all of my life, I know that air traffic into Newark, Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports are some times deverted in a ""hold"" pattern and then cleared for approach I believe this is called the ""Alpine Apporach"" but could be wrong...I am not an aviator. This night, I thought this plane / jet was going to crash.  Let me start with my condition. I am not, nor have I ever used drugs, drink or take medications....and I am not psychotic or delusional and do not seek money, fame or lie. I have no reason to write this other than to get this off my chest, after all these years.  Now that we have that straight.... It was a clear night (no rain), but there was a ""ceiling"" of clouds above. The lights from New York City / Yonkers and the Bronx (On the other side of the Hudson River) cast a ""pinkish tint"" of color on to the clouds above.  The object I saw, was a ""Chevron shape"". It had one big light in the center and several lights on both (what appeared to be) wings running all the way to it's tips.  I observed this while driving at about 40/45 miles an hour north. It's direction (from what I noticed) was coming in from the north headed south west. I noticed this because it appeared to be headed at the water tower in the back of what was then the Thomas J. Lipton Company, Scholastic Magazine Company, Lever Brothers and Volkswagon of America buildings. All have now departed and the new CNN World Head Quarters exists at approximately the spot from which I first spotted the craft.  As It drew nearer to Clinton Avenue (this road runs east and west) and Route 9W, I pulled my car over and got out to observe this object.  To my amazement the ship slowly appeared over the tree line with absolutley NO NOISE. Since this area of New Jersey sits on the Palisades Cliffs, my only guess as to how hight it was, was about 300 to 500 feet above route 9-W not above the Hudson River.  Traffic was very light and few cars were headed north at that interval but several cars drove south. They probably couldn't see this craft or object because as you drive south on 9-W the trees will obstruct any view of an object coming in this direction. The Palisade Interstate Parkway also runs adjacent to 9w with lanes going in a north south direction but I did not take note of this road or how many cars were on it.  As this massive, I'll call it, ""Mothership"" passed...everything seemed extrodinarily quiet. I made sure to pinch and smell myself just to make sure I was not dreaming. This thing had to be the size of ""Giant Stadium""...it was incredible. Thats the only way I can describe its mass.  It passed over 9-W....I got home found my binoculars and went back to Clinton Avenue. It had passed. I drove back down Route 9W towards the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey which crosses the Hudson River and brings you on to the Crss Bronx Expresway, Routes I-95, or Manhattan roads such as the Henry Hudson Parkway or the West Side Highway or Harlem River Drive......hoping to see this object.  It had flown away quietly!!! Why people crossing the George Washington Bridge from NY did not see this, I can not explain.  I went to several Police stations...Englweeod Cliffs, Fort, Lee and Alpine....I was told there had been many calls from local residents during this time frame...so I wasn't going nuts.  Years later, while skimming through a famous ""alien"" book, it was confirmed in the back by the authors friend, that on that same night, he saw the same object pass over the Long Island Express Way in New York, head in the same direction and coming from the same coordinates that I have just described.  It was a great relief to know I had seen, ""something"" that was not a plane, jet or conventional craft. It could have been a blimp of some sort....but the size was just too outstanding (similar to the ""Arizona - ""Phenoix lights"") to be a blimp.  Here's my question....if it was military, why would they fly it over a very populated area with the possibility of it malfunctioning, crashing or going down?  But I will tell you it was the color of a dark ""battleship-grey"" or possibly a charcoal grey and it blended perfectly into the night had it not had the lights on. It also appeared to have srtucture to it's underside / belly.... something similar to ""girders"". As it pass over it was a diamond shape from underneath.  NO SOUND, The size of several Jumbo Jets ...I can't tell you what it was but it was nothing like I had ever seen.  Thank you",2003-12-19T00:00:00,40.8915,-73.9471

Witnessed by 3. When this first happened years ago - I told my mother, and we together made an online report to a UFO newsgroup. I was interviewed shortly thereafter by three people in the group, but do not recall if it was MUFON or other - so I'm posting this again, in hopes that someone knows something.  I was a Freshman in college driving South on I280 at 12:45am, after visiting my girlfriend in Pacifica. There were few other cars on the highway, but I had been next to roughly 3 vehicles since entering the highway. The night was very clear, no fog, I do not remember seeing the moon or recall if there was a lot of moonlight. It was a ""warm"" evening, for I had the sunroof open on my VW Jetta. I had just gone under the Highway 92 overcrossing and was between (2) Vista Points headed towards the ""Edgewood Rd"" Exit. I recall squinting my eyes for a bright light was shining through my back window. I reached up flipped the mirror to night mode and assumed nothing. The light passed under the over crossing and continued to bare down on my car and the two next to me. I slowed down and moved over to the slow lane, for I thought it was a police officer with his spot light on. We came around a slow curve to the right and the light had closed to within a 1/8th of a mile of traffic. At that point I realized that it was just too high above the road to be a car, but perhaps a tall truck. I couldn't make out any shape to it, just an intense white light. It continued to close distance and by this point I could tell that it was not connected to the ground for its movement was ""smooth"" and ""frictionless"". The light didn't jiggle like that of a car when it goes over bumps. I recall looking at the driver in the car to the left of me and getting a quizical look back from him, I motioned with my shoulders an ""I Don't know"" expression... When the light was a couple hundred yards behind us, it was clear it was at approximately 50' off the ground, but I couldn't not make out any sound over my car and the wind noise from the open sunroof. Once again I made an assumption and figured it was a police helicopter with a spot light, or perhaps a small Cesna. My mom and uncle are private pilots and I have a lot of experience around small aircraft. The white light certainly could have been a landing gear light, but I did not see any blinkin! g colored lights to depict a plane. The light then sped up and passed directly over the my car, and the two other vehicles near me. SILENTLY. I could make out a slight dull figure contained within the orb of light, but cannot faithfully say what shape it was. After passing us the light continued off in front of us for roughly another mile, when it made a HARD angular ascent at roughly a 65 degree angle and sped out of site. Shocked, myself and the guy in the car next to me pulled over to the side of the freeway and talked about the ""thing."" Neither of us could explain, or hypothesize what it was. Creeped out by the dark and lack of other cars on the road we left the scene. I exited at Edgewood Rd, and headed to my house on Crestview Dr in San Carlos. I told my Mom about what I saw and retrieved my police scanner. We sat outside on the back deck watching the western sky for hours, too wired to sleep. We heard little on the scanner of reference, but did hear a call for a CHP officer to investigate a bright light seen at a Vista Point, which are supposed to be closed at dusk. I hope this report helps or provides a link to someone else's experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-12-19T00:00:00,37.54167687366167,-122.31694464668094

We observed two (2) saucer shaped objects over the boat landing area, which was located approximately one-quarter of a mile away.  They had a light green aura.  My sister and I ran out behind the house and up the hill to observe from a better vantage point.  When we turned back around to look at the objects, we noticed a third object over the water of the lake, which appeared to be approximately three hundred (300) to three hundred and fifty (350) yards away.  It's appearance was that of a sphere of approximately ten (10) yards in diameter, that was glowing from within with an intense, pure, bright white light which reflected off the water and tree tops.  The third craft moved slowly in a south-easterly direction at approximately five (5) miles per hour, crossing from the water onto the land and above the trees.  Meanwhile, our attention was recaptured by the two (2) saucer-shaped objects.  While my sister and I were observing the crafts and concentrating on them intently, I noticed that cloud-like formations appeared flanking the objects.  Both craft then seemed to move within the cloud-like formations.  One of the objects and it's accompanying cloud-like formation faded from sight over a period of approximately five to seven seconds.  The other cloud-like formation was at this point still visible.

For some reason I looked out the window on the driver's side and saw a large rounded disk hovering in the sky at an altitude of about 500 feet.  It must have had a diameter of at least 50 feet. It had flashing, sychronized ""chasing"" colored lights going around its diameter.  I couldn't tell the color of the ""craft"" as it was dark, but it appeared a dark silver.

Another vehicle coming towards me also slowed down and I could see the people in side looking in the same direction as I as they passed...I stopped and they continued on..as the dust settled from the road I got a much better look at this craft. From my vantage point it was simply a VERY bright light light in the southern sky...it was not all that far off the ground and I noticed it suddenly throw an incredibly bright beam straight down to the ground..I thought then it was just perhaps a police helicopter. What told me different was the incredible flashes of color it suddenly began to give off...first a brilliant green fading into green then blue then yellow...not airplane lights...these were bright and faded from one to another and the speed in which they changed varied ...as I watched this thing..it stopped the beam of light it had in the fields below...and then it swiftly moved to the right....then up and then back down forming a triangle type flight path of about perhaps a mile in length...it was no more than a quarter or a half mile from my viewpoint butI figure but who can tell?....I got out of the car and I couldnt hear any sound from the direction of the object at all. As soon as it made the triangle manuver, it suddenly took off at a speed no conventional craft could attain and went straight to the horizon and disapeered. I had a wonderful view to the horizon and I would say it crossed about 20 miles in less than 5 seconds...I sat in my car amazed and completly happy...I had my first encounter with something I believe wasn't of this earth...and buddy, they got the SPEED!!!

I was awakened around 3AM by a strange noise outside--A ""Whooo--whooo--whooo"" sound, fairly high-pitched.  There was a sliding glass door leading from my bedroom to the back yard.  I stepped outside.  It was a clear night and cold.  About 1/4 mile or so I saw a dics-shaped object in the sky, about 500 feet off the ground. It was hovering over a residential neighborhood, making that ""Whooo--whooo"" sound.  Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the craft darted towards my house, as if it sensed my presense.  It scared the crap out of me.  It looked to be about 100 feet in diameter.  The craft was dark, with a band of glowing orange light around the middle.  Since it hovered over my house I got a very good look at the underside.  There were 3 half-domes of glowing bright blue light.  I gaped at the craft with a mixture of terror and awe.  The next thing I remember, I was waking in my bed the next morning.  To this day, I don't know if it was real or a dream but I have never been able to shake the image of that craft hovering over my house.

They were blocking the sun. My wife said, go get the camera. I ran to the car to get the camera. I turned and looked up to see the sphers, which had a light gray bottom, move to the north, out over Lake Ontario. They stoped at the edge of the lake. The bottoms changed color to the same color of the lake, light blue. there were 7 of them about 200' to 300' in Dia. They were in a formation that they kept when they moved. Two in front, with 3 behind and 2 to the right side ot the formation. As I was trying to take a photo, they moved at a very very high speed straight out over the water. I would say they were no more then 150' above the water. Then the sphere that was at the right rear moved at a 90 degree angle and went East along the lake shore.

I live in a rural area, but the neighborhood I live in is fairly built up.  Because of my age, most people think that it was simply an overactive imagination, or a vivid dream that simply seemed real, but it wasn't a dream.  It was in the afternoon, about 2 hours before sunset, so there was plenty of light.  To my left were two tall pine trees, probably 80 - 120 feet high, and too my right was my house.  I was simply standing in my backyard, which is probably a tenth of an acre in size, and fairly clear, with only a few trees and grass.  I happened to look up, and coming from the west, moving east, approximately 300 ft up I saw a round, saucer shaped craft, colored like a copper penny.  It wasn't moving fast at all, maybe half the speed of a single engine plane, and making absolutely no noise at all, at least not that I could hear.  Being so young, I didn't have a very good perception of sizes, or distances, so everything is very approximate, but should be close, because I remember the event vividly.  It was probably around 30 - 50 feet in diameter, as far as I could tell and had what looked to be windows on the bottom.  Now, the windows could've been something else, but that is what they looked like to me. There were 3 on each side of the bottom of the craft, and the reason I say they were windows is because they looked opaque...their coloration was drastically different than the actual copper color of the disk itself.  There are realistically a number of things they could've been other than windows, but that is the best description I can give.  It simply moved from the west to the east, never moving very fast, in a straight line until it disappeared over the eastern horizon.  I've told people about this encounter, and because I was so young, everyone feels like it was simply the overactive imagination of a child.  It wasn't, and I'd take a lie detector test any day to prove it.  It was never scary, eerie, or creep! y.  It never did anything spectacular...it just flew from one side of the sky to another, in a straight line, never moving at a high speed, or defying the laws of physics by darting around.  It could've been earthly, but I had not, nor have I ever seen anything resembling it.  I do live near both Tyndall and Eglin airforce bases, so it could've been something from there, but again, it didn't look like anything I've ever seen.  I know it was real.

It was a clear night and at first glance I thought it was either an airplane, or better yet, maybe a satellite passing overhead.  It was neither.  It was a tiny dot of medium brightness that moved rather quickly, in a straight line, for a seemingly short distance before coming to an abrupt halt.  It remained stationary for 1-2 seconds, then darted off in a direction close to that in which I first saw it move from.  There was no accelleration.  It went from nothing to all out speed instantly, then once aqain stopped suddenly and remained motionless for another second or two.  This display of short bursts of speed, in different directions, followed by abrupt stops continued for maybe fifteen seconds, give or take, then the little dancing dot zipped away and vanished, looking somewhat like a meteor.  While this was going on, I asked if anyone saw what I was seeing, but there was no answer.  They were sound asleep.  The next morning, I told them about what I saw... and it took me quite a while to live it down.  Should have kept my mouth shut. I have no idea of the size or shape.  It was the same color and intensity as a high flying aircraft's white tail light, or a satellite.  It blended in well with the stars and I'd have not even noticed it, at all, had I not happened to be looking up, in the right place, at just the right time.  If I were to hold a ruler out at arms length, while this object was darting around, it would have been viewed as performing all of its maneuvers within about a two inch square window before 'zipping' away and vanishing.

I was hunting with a group of friends outside of Beatty, Oregon, but what I saw did not happen over the city of Beatty.  It was a around 12:00 and two of my friends and myself were hunting in the Gearhart Mountains in Eastern Oregon.  It was late and we took my Ford Pickup out to spotlight (young kids). I had a rather bright light mounted atop my truck and we came to a clearing at the edge of the road that overlooked the basin below.  This is a remote area and there were no homes, lights, anything out there but desert at that time.  As we approached the overlook I noticed a bright light in the sky and it was traveling laterally.  We became rather nervous because this light resembled an airplane and we did not want to get in trouble for illegally hunting deer at night so I killed the headlights and turned the truck motor off.  We all got out of the truck and watched this light and as we watched the light very quickly turned a 90 degree right toward us then it stopped.  The light became very bright and we watched it for around 8 minus, could have been less.  No airplane does a perfect 90 degree turn on the fly and stops on the dime in mid air.  Finally, the object just took off very fast and disappeared.  It was gone.  It just flew or whatever directly away from us and we watched and it was gone.  We thought it best to leave so the three of us quickly got back into the truck and headed back to camp.  Here is the weird part.  The light was pacing us in a parallel fashion as we were driving the mountain roads.  We literally watched out the right side window and this damn light was flying seemed to be following us.  Never did the light come close enough for us so that we could get a good visual on this thing.  But at the point when we first spotted the light it did seem to be flying at a very high altitude.  I believe that at or around that time frame dead cattle were being found in Eastern Oregon.  That’s it.......… ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-24T00:00:00,,

I have seen very bright, red objects slowly gliding through the nights sky (approx 2000 ft), to slow to be human.  These objects have a very bright white light that seems to orbit around them, clearly giving them a disc shape.  They will move across the sky slowly, sometimes then shoot of into the stars, sometimes stop completely, sometimes manuever in a different directions.  Lately ( the last week), every night I have noticed a couple ufo's in the same spot that to the naked eye appear to be VERY bright twinkling stars, but when further observing, I looked through binoculars, and was AMAZED at what I saw; Clearly, they where white/yellow objects hovering/still in the sky with BLUE, GREEN, RED, White, etc.  lights flashing all around.  They are clear as day that they are within our atmosphere, and obviously some type of space craft.  They are fascinating to watch, and I told my friends who didn't believe me at the time, but I showed them as well, and they are now shocked and amazed that they actually are there!

At first I thought it was a plane but it was not on a normal flight path. I know this because I watch the sky quite often. Also it was moving too slow to be a plane. After about 30 seconds of watching this light move to the north I decided to get my camcorder. I began to record and as I zoomed in I was shocked. There were three bright lights in the shape of a triangle. I taped it for about 30 seconds before my battery went dead. I have watched this tape a dozen times and can see the faint outline of the triangle. Unfortunatly it is on a actual hi-fi mini tape and I cannot zoom in on the object.

I got my 8x35 binoculars and observed a large cluster of lights and with a smaller cluster to its rear. The rear cluster had a strobe light. Initially I thought it was a military aircraft with a chase plane. As the craft continued south my view of it changed and it appeared to be triangular shaped as the view continued to change it was three lights in a straight row. The craft was making a gentle turn to the southwest the view changed to what I assumed was looking at it from the rear and it appear as an arch of 4-5 white to yellow-white lights strobing from left to right. No sounds were heard and no other aircraft were in the area. We see many commercial flights overhead going to and from Europe and this did not fit any of their running lights. I used to be a crewman in Army helicopters and it did not match anything close to a helicopter. The associated haze around it could be associated with a general haze over the area. ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) A cluster of lights moved silently from north to south changing shape to a triangle, straight line and shallow arc of lights. This is an addendum to my report filed 12/28/03. Due to the hurried nature of filing my online report I omitted a few items.  On December 28, 2003 at approximately 20:25 hours local, I took our dogs outside before going to bed for the evening. While coming out our door I noticed a tight cluster of lights with a strobe in the western sky. I went inside to get my 8x35 binoculars to have a closer look because this didn’t look like normal aircraft running lights.  While looking at the object I realized it was actually two tight clusters of light; a larger one on the left and a smaller one immediately to the right. The one on the right had the strobe. Initially I thought it was a military aircraft with a chase plane, but after watching it move, it appeared to be he same object, just illuminated on two different areas of the object.  The general direction of flight was north to south from my viewing position at approximately 20 - 30 degrees above the western horizon. There was very light haze outside, but not enough to obscure the stars and the moon. The object made no sound.  Because this aircraft was flying, it changed its position relative to my viewing position, therefore what I saw also changed. As it flew, the configuration of two clusters of lights changed to a triangular configuration, then to a straight line of three lights. A few minutes later it appeared to fly to the southwest and I am assuming directly away from me. The view of the lights at this time was 4 or 5 white to yellow-white lights forming a low angle arc. The lights strobed [flashed] from left to right. There was a haze or aura around it, but I dismissed this haze due to the general haze in the area. Still no sound was heard. No vapor trails were left. I observed it until the tree lined obscured viewing. The entire duration was ca.10 minutes. The temperature was 32 F, the barometer was 29.783, and the winds were ENE at 3 mph.  Our location is directly under the path for commercial aircraft flying to and from European destinations, These commercial flights are generally directly overhead flying at altitude. Most of these aircraft can be heard and most leave vapor trails. Occasionally we have helicopter traffic performing border patrol duty. The US/Canadian border is one mile away.

It sounded as if it could have been a plane, but planes do not move like this. It did not last very long, but it was very loud.

Right after crossing a cement bridge that spanned a river - We pulled up a farmer's access road approximately 100 yards and parked back at the edge of a field alongside a bend in the river with my car pointing back (East) towards the dirt road we had turned off of - Facing the bridge we had crossed... Being a clear night we noticed the stars - As well as to the north - familiar local transmitter towers with their red beacons lit...Looking towards the south/southeast I saw a similar looking tower light perhaps 3-5 miles away...Being familiar with the area however - I knew of no structures lit or unlit occupying that area - And stated to my partner - ""What's that over there? - There's no tower over there..."" The instant the words had left my mouth - Almost as if on cue - From the direction of that unknown light - Came a blur - The type of blur movies try to depict when a spaceship goes ""Warp Speed"" - And in the time it took one to snap one's fingers - There hovering at treetop level above the bridge - Was a dark object - Rectangular in shape - With one red & one green ""running light"" positioned together on the lower part of the craft at its center...We stared in amazement - But said nothing...After about 5 minutes we noticed the craft's position had moved to the right - (As we faced it) - But to look at it you could not tell it was moving at all - It was only after it noticeably left its position centered over the bridge - That we had any idea it was moving...It continued its ""slow motion"" - Again movement so slow & undectectable - That it was only in elapses of 5 - 10 minutes of time - That we could see that it had progressed more to the right than previously...After approximately 20 - 30 minutes - It sat directly across from us - Facing the passengers side of the car - At treetop level - On the other side of the river - Now 90 Degrees from where it originally was... After staring silently at it for another 5 minutes - My partner turned to me and said: ""Is THAT what I THINK it is?"" - Whereupon I replied: ""NO, NO - There are NO such things as UFO's - There are NO such things as UFO's""...After another 30 seconds my partner said ""Let's get out of here"" - Whereupon I started the car and started back down the access road to the county road...As I turned onto the county road & subsequently onto the cement bridge - We saw that the craft had now returned to its original position - Treetop height - Above us and slightly back from the bridge...As we started to cross - My partner said: ""STOP - STOP - I've gotta see if it's real - I've gotta see if it's real..."" I stopped the car center-bridge - We got out and looked up at a craft - Approximately 20-25 Feet wide - Again with a round red & green light at its base - And a rectangular glass window - Or what appeared to be glass - Running across the middle third of its front...Standing to the left side (As we faced it) - Looking down at us - Were 2 ""Beings"" - And although I could only see them from the waist up - Were around 4 feet tall - With abnormally large upper heads - And large black eyes - I describe as ""Insect Eyes"" - Just staring at us...I'll never forget those eyes - They were like a shark's - No feeling - No emotion in them - Their skin was pure white - Like the moon - Not grey - And the texture appeared like - I know no other way to describe it - Like that of an albino salamander...Very similar to what you see depicted in books etc. - Except the fronts/tops of their heads are larger/more bulbous than I've seen depicted - And their eyes - Ran almost north/south with their heads - As opposed to the angled versions - Again that I have seen depicted...Their craft hovered silently the whole time - Not even a hum - And no flashing lights - Just the two ""running lights"" - Which in retrospect - I imagine were there to convince anyone who might see them from a distance - That it was just a conventional aircraft...After about a minute of ""eye contact"" - We got back in the car - And rapidly - But still not panicky - Headed the two miles up the dirt road to the main paved road...I kept my eyes glued to the rear view mirror the whole way - And when we turned onto the paved road to head back to town - We could see the craft was still hovering where we had left it...Nothing like this had ever happened to me before - And nothing like it since - But the events are as clear to me today - As they were that night...The ironic thing to me is that although my experience really couldn't have been a better one - Regarding my determination of ""Aliens"" being ""Real"" - I have a very hard time believing others about their ""experiences"" - And have concluded that - No matter how much one wants to believe - The only way one CAN believe - Is to experience this firsthand - The old ""Seeing Is Believing"" adage...

At a Starbuck's near where I stopped, I approached a guy drinking coffee and pointed to the object. He said sometimes there is a kind of light blimp that goes along trhe coast but it doesn't look like that.

Through the bonoculars it was hard to focus and it didn't give much of a better view, which leaves me to speculate that it was a huge cigar shaped or rectangular ship, way far away.

As the witness watched the object traveling along over Pauline Mountain it flashed an extremely bright blue light. The object did this a couple of times and what came next surprised the lady. She clearly was able to see a ring of blue lights which ran horizontally around the center of the object. The woman reported there were a large number of lights, and said it was hard to estimate how many. But she figured there had to be a dozen or more.  She was able to observe the object for approximately 25 minutes. As it moved slowly further away the lady lost sight of it. The lady said it grew smaller and dimmer in size due to the distance away until it disappeared. She grabbed her video camera and ran outside, but she explained at this time into the sighting the object was already at a good distance away and she failed to get any footage. The witness did mention that if she'd thought of the camera at the time of the sighting she was confident that she'd have been able to film it. No sound was heard. No reaction from the pets.

The object appeared to be in the flight path of normal air traffic [ there were five or six aircraft on their approach to SEATAC International]. It appeared to be getting closer as if flying towards my location. I ran in and got my 10 x50 binoculars and my 30x60 spotting scope and  veiwed the object for a couple of minutes. Looking through my spotting scope the object was tumbling at about 5000 ft. alt. At first I thought that it was a balloon, but  then there was nothing tethered from it, and the spheres looked too uniform and brightly colored [it was back-lit by the western sunset]. It looked like it was comprised of 6 to 8 red, green and blue balls in a perfect cluster shaped something like this: 0880. I had to move my spotting scope that  was on the hood of my pickup because the object had moved  slowly behind a street light pole in my driveway while I was looking at it. I moved the scope and tried to reaquire the object but couldn't find it. Only ten seconds lapsed before I picked up my wide angle binoculars and tried to find it once more. The object had completely disappeared. I search for it for another 10 minutes and gave up.

Approximate time shown (it happened more than half a century ago). Walking along with friend in a northerly direction on the left bank of the Danube river of South Budapest. The river flows at this point quite accurately in the N-S dirction. We both were engineering students, the school was out, absolutely perfect day - no clouds, bright sunshine.  Discussing some technical problems, we stopped for a few seconds and turned around. With amazement, we saw a brilliant spot on the sky at about 35 degrees elevation about 245 degrees direction - the sun was now behind our backs. It was impossible to judge the distance of the spot, but it exhibited strong flickering light from it assumed to be the result of the air mass turbulence, similarly to star watching, indicating several miles. There were no aircraft of any kind in the vicinity. The size of the spot was approximately 2-3 times the diameter of Jupiter as can be seen from Earth. We do not know, how long the object was there before we noticed it, but it was stationary, no movement detected when we spotted it. It hung there for about 30 seconds or so, then very slowly drifted to the right from our vantage point - to the Westerly direction, and stopped for several seconds. After about 15 seconds, it started out in the same westerly direction, accelerating very rapidly, after moving about 15 degrees at an extremely high speed now, it took an abrupt turn 90 degrees to the North (from our position), kept moving with extreme speed, then slowly faded out. It was a Communist system in command at that time in Hungary, but apparently it overlooked the press report, because it reported that 200 thosand people called in about this phenomenon. That was the first and last official report on the subject. The most advanced aircraft at that time in that region were the Mig series (15, and up) Russian vehicles, somewhat later. The only rockets at that time were the German V1 and the V2 rockets. At any rate, the extrmely high speed right angle turn (could not see any turning radius whatsoever) would have torn apart any conventional earthly craft by the lateral vector. I was speculating as to whether it could have been an aerial phenomenon - concentrated ligt focused overhead, etc. - but I had to discount these theories, I found no credible report on such phenomenon in the scientific field in the past 50 years.

I was attending boarding school run by Episcopalian (Anglican Catholic) nuns in Mendham, New Jersey.  It was situated on a large, rather remote piece of property.  My dorm room was on the top floor of the main building on the back side under the eaves. The building, itself, was on a hill, so that the back rooms were four floors above ground level. It was just after lights out and I was lying in bed with the windows open.  The room was tiny and the bed was about four feet from the windows, which came down to about two and a half feet above the floor.  I heard a sudden very, very low thrumming noise which appeared to be right over the roof.  It lasted for about three seconds and faded.  I had never heard a sound quite like it and wondered what it had been.  I decided to get up and have a look out the window.  I kneeled down and looked out and saw a saucer-shaped object hovering at my eye level over the tennis courts about fifty feet away.  UFO's were not really in my consciousness at that time, so I didn't comprehend what I was seeing at first. The craft seemed to be shaped like a round clam shell.  It had approximately four or five large colored lights (or lights that changed color - white, red, green) spaced around its rim and it appeared to be revolving slowly because I could see the  lights moving to the back and then reappearing around the other side.  I kept asking myself what on earth this thing was and then suddenly realized with horror that it was a UFO.  I was terrified.  I silently begged it over and over again not to land.  While I watched it, it slowly descended toward the ground.  It stopped and hovered about ten feet above the ground (I couldn't hear the thrumming noise from that distance), then it rose a few feet, it tilted a little one way, then tilted a little another way, then descended again, then rose again.  All of a sudden, without any prior warning movement, it took off from the hovering position at enormous speed and disappeared over the very far off horizon in about two to three seconds. It looked like a star as it disappeared. The horizon was many, many miles away (I was high up on the hill and could see a great distance). The next morning, I went to my Physics teacher and told her what I had seen.  She believed me but told me not to say anything to anyone because I would be labeled a nut, at best, and maybe thrown out of school at worst.  She then confided that she and her husband had recently seen something while they were driving at night, but she dared not tell anyone for fear of losing her job and she swore me to secrecy. My family all said I was hallucinating and I just decided that it must have been some military experimental aircraft that I would soon be seeing flying the skies.  But the years went on and I didn't see it manufactured.  Years later, I was sitting beside a top-level air force officer at a conference, told him what I had seen, and asked him why this experimental craft had never made it into production and use.  He looked at me and said, ""That wasn't a military prototype.  You saw a UFO. We see them all the time.  We have no idea what they are, but they are commonplace.""  I have to say that it was a relief to have my experience authenticated like that.  Later on, I read accounts by other people who saw almost exactly what I saw and who described the same take-off speed of the craft.  I have since seen several other UFO's, the most recent in January in Georgia, which I reported on this site.  It was very different from the first one I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had stopped at a rest area on the interstate just before sunset. Vega, TX. is the nearest town, according to the Rand McNally Road Atlas. It was sunset (approx. 20:30 hrs) and the sky was orange in front of us (westbound). and stars were already visible to the east and most of the sky. Our vehichle was a 3/4 ton Ford Ranger pickup truck, with a medium-sized camper shell on the back. My dad was in the camper cleaning up a little and changing clothes, as we had planned on finding a restaurant to get a bite to eat. I was outside of the truck, throwing rocks and such as a nine-year-old would do at a rest area in the middle of the Texas panhandle. A pickup truck with a full-sized over-the-cab camper on the back was parked directly behind us. Upon hearing the screaming of children's voices, I looked toward the camper. I distinctly remember a girl's and a boy's voice seperately telling their parents that a flying saucer is across the highway. At this point, instead of looking across the road, I was compelled to look at the big camper behind us in which the screaming kids were in. As I turned to look at the camper of the frightened children, I saw the parents both closing shades and turning off lights in the pickup camper. The mother said very loudly to be quiet. Now that the campers behind us were all quiet and ""blacked out"", I felt a heaviness come over me. Fear as I have never known before (or ever want to know again) came over me. I was frozen in place as I looked across the roadway and saw a disc-shaped object with counter-clockwise ""flowing"" lights rotating about the top of it. It was in a descent that caused it to come to a ""floating"" landing behind a small range of rocky hills. Not being able to move, I called for my father by saying, ""Daddy! Daddy!"" I wanted to yell, but was unable to. When he heard me, he looked out of the camper and as I could not move, he noticed me looking across the highway. He then saw what had caused me to be petrified and jumped out of the back of the truck without his shoes on. He grabbed me and put me in the passenger seat of the cab and we drove off in a hurry. The next morning we were at a pancake house in Santa Fe, NM. and we heard several people talking about the incident. Dad and I remained silent and listless. No conversation of this was brought up between us regarding this until just a few years ago. My dad remembers it as clearly and vividly as I do. That is why I needed to share this with the rest of the ""Encounter"" community...

My friend Dave, and I, were sitting on a fruit shade...which is a sheet of corrigated tin on four wooden posts.  We were observeing a steady glow that was comeing from the interior of a nearby wooded area, when everything went completely quiet...no crickets..no breeze..no sound at all.  I noticed a deep red light...similar at first, to an aircraft light, moveing from right to left..in the sky ..in front of us.  I pointd it out to him.  He said...""awww...thats just an airplane."" I said..I don't think so.  Then he said your right!  It isn't an airlpane!  Its movement from right to left wasnt slow..or fast..but rather..somewhat..well..hypnotic.  Then..the red light changed into two small white lights...which grew larger..as they moved up ..and away from each other..in these elongated archs..as they were doing this..they were gettin LARGER..then pauseing in the air...two spheres of a very pure..white light...appearing to be ABOUT 3 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter...illuminateing the tree tops.  Dave said.""I'm gettin outta here!""..I grabbed him by his shirt..and said..Wait! Look!  The two spheres of light then followed the identical archs..back dowm...getting smaller and smaller..and merged ..and turned back into the original red light...which then departed our field of vision..in the same manner as it had entered.

NOW COMES THE STRANGE PART...For the rest of that day...I was wandering around in a kind of a daze...or trance.  That evening..(actually the next morning) at what seemed to be about 3 AM...I was sleepin in a fold out bed..(from a couch)..in the liveing room...when in my sleep..I became aware of the room..and from a certain area of the room an awareness ..or intelligence..which asked me if I wanted to know what was in the balls of light.  I immediately realized that I could not decieve this ..whatever it was..so I replied YES..I have been wondering about that. My reply was non-verbal. Then I was lookin down at my body still sleeping on the bed...and wondered how I could ""see"" if my eyes were in my body...I also wondered why I was not afraid.  Instantly..without physically turning around..I was ""looking"" at the wall opposite the foot of the bed..where ""I"" ""saw"" a sphere of very pure white light light ...that was about 3 3/4 feet in diameter..stationary by the wall.  I then moved across the room..and entered the ball of light. It was very bright inside ..with what seemed to be human souls...no identites..or genders...blending together..then briefly some would kinda ""spin off"" from the main brightness, then rejoin again.  Also I was saturated by a love that I had never experienced before...also I noticed there was a tim! eless element...like a hundred years could pass..seemingly..in seconds.  The love had a very secure...serene feeling about it. At this time the same ""voice"" that was initially in my room... asked if I wanted to stay...or return.  I thought that if I had said I wanted to stay..that my physical body would ...well...die. I figured my mom might be really upset by this...so I replied that I wanted to return...I left the ball of light...went back across the room..and re-entered my physical body.  I woke up ""all together"" again at about 12 noon....Sorry about the length of this report. I still don't understand how it seemed to be a UFO..or UAO thing AND a spiritual experience..in the SAME experience..I do know it was spiritual.  Also I had..at the time a kind of ""flashback"" of Dave sitting on this stainless steel like bench..with his shirt off..stareing straight ahead..as if he were in some kind of trance.  I went to a lot of trouble to type this out..so please let me know what you think of it...Thanks, Robert  P.S.  I am being completely honest and up front with you.

On approximately August 17, 1971, I was attending a Union meeting at a local motel and was asked by the Union rep. if I and another worker would go across the river to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico and pick up a couple of bottles of liqour for the group. My friend and I left, crossed the border and approached a place where he said we could get the best prices. As we were pulling up to park, I noticed people on the street (women and children) looking up at the sky. When we alit from the car we both looked toward the West where everyone was looking and was startled to see 4 large round red circles hovering just above the horizon. It was approximately 18:30 hours and the sun was just starting to set, so there was still plenty of daylight. As we watched, I started looking in other directions and discovered another 5 of the same objects coming from the North (from the direction of Laredo, TX). They approached the other 4 slowly and then grouped together and then started to get smaller. They kept getting smaller until they completely diappeared. I don't know if they were moving away from us or if they just got smaller until they disappeared. Laredo Air Force Base was still there at the time and I thought of calling the base when we returned to Laredo, but then decided not to because I figured the lines would be jammed with calls. To my astonishment the next day, not a single thing appeared in the local newspaper nor the Mexican newspapers.  No radio or TV reports either. My buddy and I just kept our mouths shut. I found all that very strange. I am and will always be a firm believer in UFO's. And I believe, someday, everyone else will, too. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))",2004-01-31T00:00:00,,

I did not notice any bright lights or flying objects, before or after the experience.

(I know this because right after the sighting, the car a little ways in front of me applied its brakes;  I thought they had seen it too, but it is more likely that they were slowing down to the 45 mph speed limit outside the town).  What I saw was a light green light fall from the sky in the north, slightly to the east.  At first I thought it must be a shooting/falling star, but it left no trail behind, like the shooting/falling stars that I have seen.  It also looked nothing like any aircraft I have seen in the night sky, and I have seen many and pocess a decent knowledge of aeronatics. It fell from approximately 75 degrees above the horizon to 55 degrees above the horizon, and then it disappeared just as it appeared.  I must note that either the object fell, or it flew across the sky, following the earths contour, much like a sattelite.  It looked almost as if it could be falling (if in fact it were) toward the Huntington Resoviour, which is located 5-10 miles north and slightly east of where I was when I had the sighting.  There is also an airport located right beside this resoviour, but I have never seen a beacon from the (or any other) airport that looked like this, nor as I have stated, an airplane. When we visited the park by the dam that holds back the resivour 5 to 10 minutes later there were several flocks of geese (50 total geese perhaps)  in the run off (spillway) of the dam.  They seemed to be nervous and more vocal then normal.  Not only did it seem slightly odd to see geese in the middle of the Indiana winter, but also I have visited this park at least once a month for the past 6 months and have never seen geese there before.  My mind and imagination could have been running away with me on this issue of the geese, but I thought I would mention it. Besides the other witness who was with me, 2 other people witnessed something in the sky around Huntington, Indiana earlier that night.  One of them is a pilot.  Although I know all of the witnesses well, we decieded that we would not talk about our sightings until we reported them properly.  Hopefully they will post on here as well. This is my first reported sighting, although I may have had a sighting in grade school.  i do have an interest in the unexplained, although my strongly held religous views make this sighting disturbing.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,,

They described how one of the three adults, at approximately 8:00 p.m. (local) had observed a cluster of approximately ""10"" objects, each of which had the appearance of a star, move across the sky at a ""rapid"" pace.  The witness was so struck by the event that he went inside to alert two other adults to what had just occurred, and all three of them moved outside to scan the sky for the objects.  Within minutes, all three witnesses observed a second, similar group, moving in the same direction.  Shortly after the second sighting, the three witnesses sighted a third group, which appeared to form a ""circle"" of lights, as it streaked across the sky.  The entire event occurred over 10-15 minutes, the witnesses estimated.  Despite repeated requests from NUFORC for follow-up written reports, the witnesses have not submitted formal statements, despite their assurances that they would.

Deputies were screaming over the radio...scared for their like.  I went out and looked since the calls said it was near my house.  I saw three crafts in the sky.  Two small ones flanking an absolutely enormous mothership.  They were approximately 5 miles from me just above the horizon.  They were diamond shaped.  All had 3 lights:  One on top and one on either side.  The mothership was different though.  The light on her top was the biggest brightest beacon light I'd ever seen.  Around her middle were red and possibly green lights chasing each other.  After I watched it for some time I heard the sound of helicopters and all of a sudden there were anywhere from 15 - 20 helicopters swarming these things like tiny gnats.  I could hear the helicopters but not the crafts.  They chased the crafts from their current position of due West to a direction of Southwest.  The crafts had been sitting above the area of Grand Parkway and I-10 in Katy and moved towards Fulshear/Brookshire. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the alleged event is approximate.

Great speed, seen from 1/4 mile away. I don't recall what day, or exactly what year, however it occurred in January. Whatever the year was, it was the year of comet Hyukutaki, and the date of the occurance was the night that the comet was to be most visible, for our area and weather. I was driving home from work that evening, and in casual observance I was looking to see if I could spot the comet; not realizing that the comet was to be seen in the eastern night sky, and I was travelling west on hwy. 60. As I rounded the corner by Crysteel Manufacturing, I saw a luminescent sphere the color of silver, appear from the northern horizon proceeding to the southern horizon and disappering in the distance. At first sight I thought it was the comet, yet in a split second I realized that it was something else. As I wathced; this object flew ""nap of the earth"", as it crossed over the expressway it appeared to be 100' above the ground, and was about the size of a quarter in perspective from my distance to it.(1/4 mile). As it continued its flight south, it crossed over a grove of cottonwood, just grazing the tops and silohueting the branches as it passed each succesive grove of trees. The length of time that I observed this was about 6 maybe 7 seconds, and the distance that it travelled from one horizon to the other is about 6+ miles. Naturally I was in disbeleif of what I saw, even though I knew I saw ""something"", when about 3 seconds later the second object dropped out of the sky in a very steep angle, as if it had been waiting for the other, and proceeded in the same direction, but with greater speed; the bottom of the second object was at the same tree top height above the ground. This second object was a sphere as well, only of greater magnitude, about football field in diameter. The color of the second sphere was this amazingly emerald green. To this day, I am still amused by the fact that I saw these two objects that were purposefully flying towards some objective, and that they definetly were not some natural phenomenom that were just ambling throught the air!  I also cannot get over how pristine and intense the colors of these objects were; that the colors were not necesarily a surface coloration, but rather a luminuous glow emminating from a reflective metalic surface, like the color you get from anodized metal.

I had been coming down the stairs from the second floor and looked out the big paladian window that faced south west.  I had been going slowly down and just gazing out that window when suddenly a reddish orangy light caught my eye.  I had seen it flash - disappear and reappear suddenly elsewhere but nearby. I thought I was seeing things so I stopped still and looked.  As I had been looking, my sister and brother came down and I told them to look outside.  We all looked and were silent, we saw more of these lights reappear then disappear at different points sort of like zig-zagging but disappearing. They were low down in the sky just above some treetops of the rouge river south.  I was amazed because I thought it might have been an airplane at first but no airplane could do these maneuvers all over the sky so quickly and randomly.  I don't know what it was to this day and neither do my sister and brother.  I know that there was someone who posted a message here in 2003 that sounds like what we saw.

I say to him ""get it up, get it up, get it up"" becuase his angle of attack is nearly paralell to the ground to gain sufficient speed for take-off.  The wing-like aeroplan-apparition, white or silver in color then lifted at a very shallow angle and accelerated to an incredible speed directly northbound over I-5, I noticed that his wing-tips grew smaller and smaller, closer and closer together untill it was just a dot that disapeard within 5-6 seconds.

I assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the local Air Force Base (Scott AFB)and proceded to gather my things from the back seat of the car.  About 20 to 30 seconds later I turned back towards the windshield and was about to get out of the car when I noticed that the lights had not moved - at all.  This occurance went against my intuitive understanding of the laws of physics, being that objects very close to the ground, such as this one in particular, move across the field of view much quicker than objects that are further from the ground... right?  So I watched this thing hover for the next 3 minutes totally motionless over my barn. Honestly I was scared out of my mind.  I was afraid that at any minute I would get beamed up or something.  I couldn't stop watching though; I had to figure out an explanation.  Then a third light came on so that total there were now 3 white lights forming a triangle.  I unrolled my window to listen for any noise and there was none.  Absolute silence.  It was unreal!

I thought this was strange because it was not holiday, fireworks are illegal in this area. None-the-less, people do shoot off fireworks sometimes but I had only see people shooting them off on New Years and Forth of July so I was curious what was going on in my back yard.  My house is on the bay and I got out of my truck and went around the house to the back yard and walked out on my dock to see what was going on.  The dock is pretty long and extends about 300 feet into the bay.  When I got to the end, I didn't see anyone and and started walking back to shore and to my house.  I was looking up in the air for the source of the lights I had seen earlier and at the exact second my I was looking in its direction, bright color lights came on.  The object was just above tree level and very close. It was not moving and I am positive it was reacting with me.  Several different color lights flashed on in sequence in a horizontial band around what I could best describe as an oval shape.  I was well aware of the hundreds of reports in this area from the late 1980s but generally thought they were fakes. At that split second, I questioned my belief and quite frankly got a little scared. The object was between me an land and I wasn't sure what to do.  It was dark and after the light display, I think my eyes dialated because I lost some of my night vision and I didn't see anything else in the sky.  I paused for a moment and walked, with a little fear, back to my house and went into the back door of my house.  I never told anyone but my wife about it. Some of the things that were striking about it was that it was so close, it was a relatively small object (maybe two automobiles in size), it was low, just above the trees, perfectly quiet and what was most rememerable was the crisp, clear color lights. They were very bright! but wha t I most recall was thinking how clear and pure the color looked.  I am an engineer, a general skeptic (read The Skeptical Inquirer regularly), professional and well known in the community. People around here don't talk much about UFOs because of the bad publicity we received in the late 80s and early 90s and I worry about my professional reputation by telling people. I can say for certain this was no airplane, helicopter, firework, ballon, star, swamp gas or anything else my rational trained mind can explain. It is by all accounts an unidentified flying object.  The funny thing is that although that was the closes I have been to an unidentified object, over the years that I have lived in the Gulf Breeze area, I have seen many unexplained objects hovering around here.

I was driving home from work shortly after 7 a.m., and witnessed a strange object.  It caught my eye because it looked like a short contrail very high up in the sky, but was really bright white.  Then as I watched, the ""trail"" became increasingly long and bright.  It was traveling from N/NW to S/SE, away from the Strait of Juan de Fuca towards the Olympic Mountains.  At this point, I pulled my car over to observe it more closely.  There were a few other cars pulled over as well, with the people inside craning their necks like I was.  By this point the ""tail"" was getting longer, and appeared to grow longer as the object made its way across the sky.  It seemed to travel like a missile, on a steady course, but with this tail behind it that was absolutely stunning.  The tail was brilliant orange by this point, and seemed to sparkle and wave, almost gossamer in appearance. This continued on for a few more minutes as it proceeded on course towards the mountains, and then disappeared from my view.  When I got home to my husband and described what I had just seen, he said ""that must have been a solar sail.""  From his description of what that is supposed to look like I agreed, but cannot find anything on the internet about a solar sail having been launched on or near that date.

My wife and I were fishing on Manasota Key in the Gulf of Mexico near Englewood Florida. We had been fishing most of the afternoon while waiting for the sunset. This was day 6 of a three week vacation. We had been to the beach for the sunset about every evening. It was just after the sun had gone below the ocean. The sky was clear. My wife pointed and said can you see that bright light? It's moving. I looked to the southwest in the direction she was pointing and immediately saw a light at an elevation of about 30 deg above the ocean horizion. It looked like the landing light of a large airplane. It was as large or larger than Mars was at it's closest this summer. The light was white, steady, and unblinking. It moved from the south toward the north parallel with the horizon. It looked like it could be a fast moving airplane. We watched it for about 10 to 15 seconds. It came to a complete stop without slowing, it just stopped almost due west of us (about 260 deg). We watched it for another 20 minutes and it did not move anymore. We talked about how far it had moved as we watched it. If you held up a yard stick (3 ft) in the middle at arms length, it traveled about the length of the measure in only 10 or so seconds. We looked around the clear sky and could see other lights from planes moving both high and low. All were blinking and all were closer to us than the light and moving much slower in comparison to the speed of the light. We watched two aircraft pass between us and the light in the approach to SouthWest Regional Airport at Ft. Myers. We have taken that flight several times ourselves. It was impossible to tell how big or how far the object was except it was far beyond the normal path of the aircraft and much bigger than the lights of the commerical airliners we were looking at. We finally left after half an hour and it was still there. The following Monday (11/10/03) we went back to the beach at sunset to see if the light was still there. During the same time period on the 10th, no ! light was present. We went again on the 11th (Tuesday, 11 November 2003) and after sun set, suddenly the light appeared in about the same location we saw it in on Friday after it had stopped but just a little more to the south of west (about 250 deg). We had watched the sun set and had a sense of time of setting objects. A while after the sun had set, it was completely dark, the object began to slowly sink toward the horizon until it went out of sight below the ocean level. It did not sink as fast as the sun did. The ocean horizon at a standing elevation is about 12 miles away. We did not see the light any more. It could have been in space for all we could tell. It looked like a big bright flood light. I have followed UFO reports for some years. Except for an incident in 1954 when I saw 5 silver disk the size of a new dime, at arms length, in a V formation, go over in Kentucky, I have never seen anything I could not identify. I read several other people have seen very large bright lights recently. Perhaps something similar.

One night when we were out the back, I glanced up at the silhouette of Mt Ngungun and saw a light flash near it's highest point.  I first assumed it was some campers up there, so didn't pay much attention.  Then when I next looked, it flashed in a completely different area, this time I could see that it was a fair distance above the treeline.  I pointed it out to my roomies, and we watched as every few seconds it would flash in a different area: sometimes well above the mountain, other times in spots that I knew to be halfway down 50 metre cliffs (I walked and abseiled that mountain quite a few times, so I knew it well enough to pinpoint where the lights were flashing from).  Occasionally the lights changed from white to orange, and once red, and at one stage I thought I saw it split into three, although it was back to one a few seconds later.  Just for reference too, I realised that my initial thought of it being a camper was ridiculous, as the intensity of the light we saw could never have been produced from a torch, camp fire, or even a spotlight. Eventually the 'light show' slowed until it was a flash every few minutes instead of every couple of seconds, and in the end it just stopped and we went to bed.",2003-12-09T00:00:00,,

It was tilted at an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizon, and held that attitude. What the heck is that???

There was only one other car at the park and I asked the lady in it if she had binoculars or camera, but she didn't. She got out of the car and as we observed the 3 planes apparently spraying, we noticed a small flash of light right at the junction of 2 trails, where the trails made a large X in the sky. The flash was only momentary and we couldn't perceive what it was, it seemingly ddisappeared.  We turned our backs on that spot to follow a certain plane as it was preparing to swing back around for another flight over the city.  Then we saw, at our left field of vision, a peculiar object. It seemed to rather glide, and it maitained a consistent altitude, and it came our direction.  I became rather frightened as it approached. It was not too far away, not so high. (I have difficulty estimating distance and altitude, as I've never had a reason to do so before) At first I thought that whatever it was, it was the same thing as I'd just seen, ie. that ""flash of light"", though it may have been a totally different thing. As it got closer, I  could see that it appeared metallic silver, and it was perfectly spherical.  Also, completely silent.

I asked the lady with me if she could see the color, but she couldn't see it. I know that as an artist I am more sensitive to color that the average, non-artist.  The color was not solid, the substance seemed to be a vapor, a mist, or like a gas.  When it just about had made a complete 180 degree parade across our field of vision, it began to ascend, rather quickly, and straight upwards. This sighting occured on a relatively clear day. I don't use drugs or alcohol, and don't take any medicine that would interfer with perception. I can't speak for the other witness, but I did find out that she was a Christian also, and after this incident we were both frightend and we prayed together before leaving the park.  Two days later, over my house, I watched similar planes apparently spraying.  Another silver orb seemed to appear at the X mark of the trails.

North Bend is a small town, with the main street running only about four or five blocks. It was near the end of the day, not sunset yet, sometime in the late afternoon, when we noticed some dark object in the sky just beyond the town. From the start, we couldn't make out what it was. I have never seen anything like it. At first, I thought it might be some type of balloon, but I quickly ruled that out. Its shape was going from circular to flat, and it was zigzagging slowly up and north, rather than floating straight up. I could see it quite clearly, although it was pretty far away. After ruling out the balloon, I thought that it was a saucer shape, rotating with one end down at an angle, so that it would get flat and round looking intermittently, just like a garbage can lid does, or any disk shape, when you drop it and it rolls around its perimeter on the ground. We watched the object four about five minutes as it moved higher and north (or more northeast, sort of towards the mountain). I could see it quite clearly for a long time until it got to small and disappeared in the high clouds. I was wishing that I had binoculars when it was lower so that I tell for sure whether or not it was a saucer shape. But I am fairly sure that it was.

I pointed it out to my friend, and we started watching it. As we watched over the course of several minutes, the object definitely moved in what appeared to be a southeastern direction, with its light flickering brighter and darker (not radically so, but we could see the difference). After a minute or two of watching, something smaller seemed to fall off the object, casting its own identical light. It appeared to fall straight down, and its light extinguished after just a few seconds. The primary object continued moving southeasterly, and after another minute or two, its light slowly faded to nothing, taking about a minute to do so.

After seeing this report I decided maybe it's not an airplane so I am filing the report now.  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32206.html  I've seen SEVERAL (more than 5) of these.. I thought as well they were too low, too silent and too large but still dismissed them as suspicious aircraft and not UFOs.. However, one week ago (10/18/03) I observed one through my telescope and it looked exactly like the drawing in the image provided in the aformentioned report. One thing eerie about the observation was how it seemed to ""react"" almost as if the occupants knew I was looking at it. This one was approximately 3 to 4 mi due south traveling at a constant rate of speed until I watched it. Then it became extremely bright (actually lit up me and everything around me in a diffused light similar to what you would get with a partial moon) like it was pointing a huge spot light of sorts. I could no longer observe it through the telescope due to this light and simply watched it for another 30 seconds or so with my naked eye when it ""really"" surprised me by reversing direction completely and abruptly, shooting away from my location to the south-south-east at a breathtaking speed especially given it's estimated distance from me. I do truly believe it's closest distance to be 2 mi from me before it reversed direction and disappeared behind the horizon.  To put in my perspective..  The craft was to my direct south, traveling west-north-west.  Estimating by using some known markers (flashing tower lights) I would think the craft to be almost 3 to 4 miles to my south and moving west and towards me.  With one arm extended, the craft was about the size of an eraser head and approached at probably 1"" per 10 seconds.  At it's closest, the craft was probably 1 to 2 miles from me to my direct south-south-west and approximately 1/2"" in size.  When it reversed direction abruptly I do mean abruptly it traveled at probably 3"" per second.  When the lights were on it appeared much larger and it truely did seem to be directed at me unless the lights were omni-directional.  The craft took the same route it came, almost like (I know this sounds crazy) but it's almost like I scared it when I aimed my telescope at it.  Anyway, I did want to share this with you to simply make note of it and hopefully give some additional information. As I recall the evening was very cool and visibility was excellent with no haze and very little light pollution. I was simply taking advantage of the atmospheric conditions to look at Mars which is why my telescope was handy.  Some additional information. When I saw the object, I changed to a 1.5x Barlow lens lens and a 20mm eyepiece - I believe that makes a 125x zoom on my scope (which I purchased shortly after my completely life-changing experience before as read in my last report a couple of months ago)  When viewed through the scope, it appeared exactly (from memory) as the picture depicted and was approximately 6"" wide, 1/2~1/3"" high.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,39.33755163934426,-84.40442295081967

It\'s the first and last time I\'ve ever seen a UFO.  I was at the Cleveland National Air Show, and even though I\'m not sure of the exact date, I KNOW it was Labor Day weekend.  It was the last time the B-2 Bomber (awesome!) did a fly-by here, which I feel could be a key to this incident.  The incident occurred early in the show when the Golden Knights were enroute for their act.  I distinctly remember watching their plane slowly zigzagging at 9 o\'clock to reach the proper height for their jump.  It was a perfectly clear, warm sunny day, without a cloud in the sky ANYWHERE, which I found amazing in itself!  (Being in Cleveland, totally clear weather seldom occurs).  For some reason I looked straight up at 12 o\'clock and saw a clear grouping of 6-7 white orbs close to each other but not in a specific pattern. I think it was seven because I remember thinking it was an odd number.  I was with my ex-husband at the time and because it was early in the show, there wasn\'t anyone else sitting close to us (it figures). We were not on the main grounds of the show but at a nearby outdoor restaurant upper deck.  This sighting was NOT clouds!!!  I called my husband\'s attention to it at the time, and he was kind of freaked out and admitted he thought it was a UFO.

I followed these objects until they were out of my sight. I feel they were at apx. 4000 ft. and traveling at apx. 400 to 500 mph. That evening I was tempted to go to my roof with my binocilars, not to look for UFO's, but to look at the Barn Owls that were nesting a few blocks from my house. As I did not see any Owls that afternoon, I decided to lay down and watch the sky. within seconds what appeared to be the same two objects came into the view of my binoculars. As most people know, you can not keep a steady view of objects flying high and at a fast speed. I continued to watch them for apx. another ten seconds until they were out of my view. After thiry years of sky watching, this was my first truly encounter with objects that I can not explain. Begin that I live in Brooklyn over the LaGuardia Airport fly zone, I am very familiar with all sorts of objects that fly in this zone and these objects were nothing that I can explain.",2003-12-19T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The light traveled left from my view point and stayed on a perfect line not going up or down an inch. The light traveled very slowly, not even reaching 10 m.p.h. as it was going the light changed colors: blue,white,green,red, and some mixes of the colors. After traveling about a hundred feet in about 2-3 minutes it stopped and continued to change color, never going up or down at all. My mother and sister both observed it and we decided to see if we could get close to where we had last seen it. After about 30 minutes of searching we didn't find anything even after going right by where the phenomenon had been. When we got home I looked back out side and the craft was there, It hadn't moved an inch since we went searching for it, there must have been some kind of nearby cloaking system or something. I decided to just let it go and go to sleep. Any way I have seen many in the area around this valley that I live in, maybe there is something special about it, besides the hundreds of acres of farmland. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The witness told me he packed his camera and tripod up and headed over to one of the fields on their farm. He was going to capture some shots of the planet Mars and the Moon as it is so beautiful right now. As he was setting up his equipment he noticed something very odd. In a totally clear sky he watched a cloud starting to form very quickly. As he mentioned it came out of no where and seemed to be shaping up in a oblong shape. Due to the Moon being bright he had no problem in watching this phenomena. The fellow also said there was some type of disturbance which was taking place in the cloud itself. He tried to explain what he saw, and the best example he could come up was: From end to end of this narrow formed cloud, it appeared to look like someone had taken a shot with a powerful gun, and the force of the shell was cutting through the cloud. Causing a disturbance within, or center of the cloud which ran from end to end. There was no lights/object seen at all, just this strange long mass of cloud which appeared right out of nowhere. It sat stationary for approx: 4 to 5 minutes and dissipated.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

It was one of those incredibly clear high country nights, not a cloud in the sky, no moon. Just above the tree line, my eye caught a moving light. It was a perfect sapphire blue, and was large enough to just show a disc, rather than a pinpoint. My immediate impression was that this object was at very high altitude and moving very fast. As I watched, it crossed an arc of about 100 degrees of the sky, in about 5 seconds. Then I saw another object coming in on a converging course at about a 30 degree angle from behind. This object was a greenish white pinpoint of light, also moving very fast,and converging on a collision course with the first object. At this time I thought the guys at at Sandia Missle Lab had really come upwith some kind of intercepter missle, and there's going to be a hell of an explosion up there. To my surprise, ther not only was not an explosion, the two objects met, merged, moved another 30 degrees across the sky and winked out. I then had the immediate thought-scout ship pick up!!! This had all happened so fast that I hadn't said a word to my ex, so I asked her if she had seen it too, and she said yes and described exactly what I had seen. I would like to add at this time that I have spent most of my life outdoors, in all conditions, and I am very familiar with aircraft of all types, having seen them in every combination of light and weather. Further I have ecellent depth perception and distance judgement, as I am a life long hunter and also a competitive shooter. I point this out because while I had no real reference points to judge the altitude of this object, I had an immediate impression of extreme altitude [possibly sub-orbital].  Given that the first object was showing a disc, barely, and that it covered an arc of sky of about 130 to 140 degrees in about 8 seconds it would have to be BIG and FAST !!

I was sitting in a restaurant having lunch in front of a high, plate glass window facing east, with an unimpeded view of the sky over NYC. It was a very clear, hot day with no humidity or haze and only a few small, scattered clouds were visible. In the distance, I saw a helicopter and a small plane cross my field of vision (one heading north and one heading south); then I noticed two more ""objects"" in the same vacinity  that seemed too close to the others. As they continued heading in a westerly direction, I thought it was very odd that they were flying so close together, so I locked my gaze onto them. As they approached (flying directly toward me), I could see that they were not conventional aircraft; they were perfectly round, silver spheres and were highly reflective. From my perspective, they did not seem to be flying at a very high altitude, perhaps only a mile or so high and were moving relatively slow (no faster than a helicopter). As they passed directly overhead, my view of them was very clear. This is a heavily populated area; there were hundreds of people on the street shopping that day and not one other person was looking up, so I was left to assume that these craft were silent. After they were no longer within my field of vision, I ran out the side door to see if I could still see them in the (western) sky, but my vision was impeded by too many buildings.

She had seen nothing but the view of the sky and mounains nor heard or felt anything unusual when she took the photos. The object is a triangular shape with the corners ""removed""; exactly the shape of the UFO reported by someone on this same website from the U.K. [See in NUFORC database: Occurred : 3/12/1996 17:30 (Entered as : 03/12/96 17:30)  Reported: 8/31/2001 05:33 Posted: 3/4/2003  Location: Clacton-On-Sea, ]  The object is in a clear, blue sky approximately as high as a plane flying relatively low and about 20 miles away from downtown Sedona.

Other witness was driver.  Object was seen around the Mt. Tipton Area north of Kingman.  Driver looked out drivers window (to the east towards the Mountain) and stated ""Whats that"".  I leaned over towards driver and looked out his window and saw a medium green (medium-nor bright nor dim)object (about the same color as a traffic light)round object at approximately a 40-60 degrees angle in relationship to the ground.  Object was stationary and I was unable to determine size.  Best description would be that it was about 1/4 the size of a full moon when straight overhead.  Looked at object for approximately 20 seconds, looked away,(to undo my seatbelt) and then looked back for about 20 more seconds.  Object then markedely increased the light intensity enough to where I was able to see the entire landscape surrounding us including the slope of the distant mountain.  This lasted for about 3-5 seconds.  Light then ""shut off"" and object was nowhere to be seen.  I determined thea object had to be between us and the mountain (probably about halfway)due to fact that entire area between us and mountain including the slope was illuminated.  Illumination can best be described as approximately twice the brightness of full moon night on clear night.  At time of sightning, there were no clouds and weather was clear.  When light increased, I could no longer see the object, just the landscape lit up.  Landscape and surrounding area was lit up the same green color that object was seen as.  Light was not emitted as a beam or anyting like that.  It was as if someone just turned on a dim to medium light that lit up surroundings on an otherwise dark winter night.

I'm in agreement with you on,the wasted effort of reporting what I saw after all its not like they could do much about it.  I was very excited since this is my first sighting of an unidentified flying object.  It was on the 29th of dec. 2003 at 6:50 that saw this glowing almost round shape (at first it seemed like a very big and bright star) coming from the south west then just stoping and then moving slowly to the north then just sort of hovering  this lasted about a minute and a half then it just slowly went back to its south west position hovered some half minute or so and then zoomed off towards east at an amazing speed. I stared for another five minutes or so and then went inside trying to convince myself that I should call someone.  I went outside and stared at the sky again and saw what could only be ;  a) the same object that had returned to almost the same spot but much higher,or b) a different object that was near the same spot, and was either smaller or higher,  this time it did'nt hover, it moved slowly, and then zoomed away to the south east. end of story. I know what I saw, and am 100% sure of what I saw.  Unless its some kind of manmade experimental object,that is out there well we both know what else it could be.

Did not move like a plane or helicopter.  It hovered and flitted around in a zig-zag.  After a few minutes of this, the object shot straight up in the sky, and hovered there.  Then the color of the lights changed.  The lights initially were bliking at the back, once it started moving over my house, there were red and white lights blinking in a chasing light type fashion across the front of the object.  The oddest thing was, there was absolutely no noise whatsoever from this.  It was dead silent.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

The lights moved to the left, then to the right, and appeared to go out so I quickly went in the house and shut off the porch light to see better. When I came back outside, they were on again, and were travelling from east to west. I then figured this had to be an aircraft as that I often see a airplanes taking this route, so I went inside.

It was round and about as bright as the brightest star visible in the southeastern sky.  My wife saw it immediately, as I said something like ""meteor"" when I first saw it.  But it moved slower than a meteor and didn't disintegrate.  I followed it until it disappeared behind the roof of the house (I stood up to extend my viewing time).  Its highest point was just to the south of us.  I then asked my wife about what she saw.  How large?  About six times as large as the brightest star (which was the EXACT figure I had in mind).  Color?  Slightly orange (I agreed).  Nature of the light?  A bit diffuse, as though an intense light was shined on a cloud.  Agreement again.  The track never varied.  There was no noise.  There was nothing visible around the light.  Its intensity never changed.  A satellite?  No, it was too late in the evening to see satellites, and the track would be quite unusual for it to be either a satellite or space debris.  A meteor?  Possibly, but given its speed, constancy and duration, unlikely.  It was definitely not an airplane (no sound, no flashing lights).",2004-01-17T00:00:00,44.9412471106758,-123.00423516160626

I noticed a bright light low in the sky just above the tree line The light seemed to have a flashing red light as well. This really bright light seemed to hover and move around in the same area for 15 mins. I repeatedly looked at this light not believing my eyes. There was no explanation for this thing to be there as I often wake up during the night and look at the stars and usually see planes in the sky with flashing red lights going past but this thing was definately not a plane. I was pretty scared and hid under my doona for a while and had to check this thing out again so I sat up in bed and rubbed my eyes to get a better look at this thing but the light was to bright. I then tried to go to sleep again but decided to have another look at this thing and this time there was another bright light high in the sky but appeared bigger than the one lower to the ground and never had a flashing red light and it was just hovering there in the one spot. I tried to go to sleep again but had to check it out again as I couldn't believe what I was seeing and this time they had both gone and there was just the usual distant stars in the sky. I live on a property 30kms from town and there is nothing to explain these lights it definately was not a reflection or a plane. I just hope it don't come back again.

These objects along with the smoke at their tail, which was now a very bright pink light as the sunset, appeared to stop descending. It's very difficult to explain, but somehow the trail of smoke that was attached as a tail was now above the objects, almost like the trail was a very bright light being shined out of the top of the craft, but it still resembled smoke of some kind.

The dates above are a guestimate. It was some time ago when I saw this but thought I should document it as it was the most dramtic. I have had two other sigtings, one prior to this report and one afterward. My first sigting was in Scottsdale, AZ about Summer of 1982. I saw three red light that were in a triangular formation that spanned about the space of 3 to 4 football fields. It made no sound and was much lower than any aircraft would have flown. The odd thing is is that the three lights flew as if it was one craft. YOu could not focus on the space between the tiagular shaped lights. It flew off slowly over the Pima Indian reservation.  My second sigting, the one mentioned in this report was near Flagstaff, Arizona while camping. Two craft came over a bluff moving very slow. They were oval shape (I am not sure if they were oval shape or circular as I saw them from an angle) with the perimeter out lined in singular lights. After moment when the craft came over the bluff then came military jets moving at much greater speed and passing the craft. The two ships did a semi-circle around our position and went back over the bluf again. As they started to go over the bluff in the center of one of the craft a warm colored light came on and the faded off as if it was like a dimmer switch. the light in the center was about a 1/3 the size of the craft itself. The strange thing about this is I don't remember falling a sleep that night and was awoken a couple of hours later by a third person who was meeting us at our camp site. I don't remember falling a sleep.  The third time I saw somthing was the event over the Phoenix Valley a few years ago. I awoke out of a sleep and walked to the window and saw the lights over what looked like camelback mountain (I was in the east valley.) Why would I have awoken out of sleep to see this?

I was in Denver on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 9th, and at 4:15 PM in the vicinity of 32nd and Federal. It was a perfectly clear, windless day, and as I was walking my dog I looked up and scanned the sky. Almost directly overhead I spotted a round gray object moving to the northeast at a fairly high speed. My first thought was a balloon, but it was moving far too fast. At arms length it was the size of a BB, and as it moved away to the northeast my eyes focused in on 5 similar objects following the first. They were silent and flying in a loose formation, and appeared like the 1950 Great Falls UFO film as they faded away in the distance. The pilot of a light plane flying south might have seen these craft if he were looking up. I believe the objects were under 5,000 feet. I scanned the sky and saw a helicopter to the north that was probably over the area of Federal and I-70. At 4:45 PM I was again looking at the sky, and to the north where I had seen the helicopter I spotted what at first appeared to be a black cylindrical object with a white tail below it hanging motionless about 30 degrees in the sky. My first thought was a kite, but when I looked at it through my binoculars it appeared like a cluster of orange balloons with red lights on them. The white tail was not moving and appeared rigid. I watched it for about 5 minutes, eventually it began to rise higher in the sky, to about 50 degrees. I went back inside and returned about 5 minutes later, but could not relocate the object. Strange objects that I had no explanation for. I am a MUFON member and watch the sky quite a bit. The 6 objects I saw did not appear any different than ones I have seen in UFO films and videos shot worldwide over the years.

After I got on Tolend Road and crossed the bridge that goes over Route 16, I saw it again.  The time now was 6:55 PM, or so.  It flew over the road right in front of me, travelling perpendicular to the direction of the road from my right to my left.  This time, there didn't seem to be any fog surronding it.  I only saw it for a few seconds before it disappeared behind the trees to my left.  Again, it looked to be triangular and had two very bright headlights in front.  It couldn't have been going very fast.  I would say no more than 25 to 50 miles per hour which seems to be way to slow for an airplane to travel.  It was approximately 100 feet in the air at this point.  Another interesting thing that I only realized after my friend started to ask me about it was that this object was very quiet.  Despite the fact that I was in a running car with the windows up, the object didn't seem to make a sound, which was strange given how close it was.  Clearly, I would have heard it if it was a helicopter or an airplane.",2004-03-17T00:00:00,43.18716428571429,-70.90978392857143

I came home about 9:30pm Tuesday March 9th of 2004.  (7miles East of Chanute) I noticed what appeared to be a large bright light low to the west horizon. (Much brighter than any others stars) It appeared to have two lights on top of each other.  The night was perfectly clear and completely silent.  I stood and watched the light for about 6 minutes trying to figure out why it seemed to be flickering.  I then called my daughter and her boyfriend (they were still in town) to ask if they could see anything from where they were at.  They could not see anything though.  I then continued to watch for another 2 or 3 minutes when I started to notice a triangle surrounding the lights.  These lines that formed the triangle were green and like what appeared to be on a car dash display. (Color/shade of green) I hurried up and called my daughter back and told her and her boyfriend to get out here before it was gone.    I continued to watch and noticed that the formation was definitely coming towards my house. The triangle was getting larger in size therefore I knew it was coming closer.  5 or 6 more minutes passed and I called my daughter again to see how far away they were.  They were on the main highway near my house only ½ mile away from me but could not see anything.  (That’s how low this thing was flying) I ran out to the gravel road north of my house as I noticed it moving slightly northwards.  It seemed to be hovering at what appeared to be about 80' or 90' above the tree tops and only 1/4 or ½ mile away from me to the west.  I determined my distance using the strobe like flash the object was emitting on the trees.  About every 5 or 10 seconds there would be a flash of white light shining downward.  On a few occasions the light was red.  The light would be bright enough I could see the hedge rows below it.  I then used the hedge rows to calculate my distance from the object. Having to guess the actual size the object, I would say that using the three green lines that formed the triangle, the object was equivalent to 2 (two) full moons width.  This was calculated when the UFO was at its closest point to me.  I heard my daughter coming down the road so I phoned her to tell her to turn off her lights but her car does not allow lights to turn off while car is running.  When they pulled up I quickly jumped in the car so we could drive closer.  As we started to drive about 65mph on the gravel, it quickly started moving back towards the west. (The way it originally came from) We drove back to Chanute and on through town continuing 11 miles on west of town.  All the while we were traveling at a high rate of speed.  The object disappeared into the horizon at a low altitude. There were three of us that saw this happen yet none of us could even begin to explain what exactly it looked like.  I did report this to the Sheriffs Department but they had not heard anything about it.  The object made no sound whatsoever. (The night was perfectly still and noiseless) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses via telephone, and they seemed to us to be exceptionally seriou-minded and credible.

I remember the date clearly as I told myself I would never forget. I have told this story to quite a few friends over the years, but have never made an official report. I have always been afraid of the attention this story might arouse, and of ridicule.  I was 19 years old. I was in my front yard in Jacksonville Beach, Fla. looking north. About 5 miles north of where I lived is Mayport Naval Station. I saw a very small red object in the sky that seemed to stay in one position for a long time. Then it would move slowly to another position and stay awhile. I went inside and told my Father about this light. It was too far away to determine what is was. I went back out and watched this light again. It started moving slowly eastward toward the Atlantic Ocean which was only a mile from my house. I went inside and told my Father I was driving down to the beach to see if I could get a better look at this object. I drove down to the beach and parked in a parking lot beside a Holiday Inn in our town. This is right up to the seawall. I looked to the north and believed I spotted the object out over the ocean to the Northeast. But it was tiny, and I could make out no detail at all. I watched this object for maybe 10 minutes. But I could see no detail, and grew tired of watching it. I was standing on the seawall. I turned south to walk back to my car, when I saw a large orange football shaped object coming down our beach. It looked like glowing steel in a furnace. It glowed. It also had a halo or a fog around it that was also orange. It did not appear to be even 200 feet in the air, and was moving slowly northward toward me. We had a pier in our town that was about 1 mile south of my location. This object was closer, because I could see its reflection in the water between me and the pier. There was a car driving up the beach. The object appeared to be almost directly over it. But the car was actually approaching me faster than the object. I would estimate this object was 60 feet long. It appeared about the size of a streetlight maybe 75 feet away. As this object moved slowly toward me, I began to be a little afraid. This was late at night near Midnight, and there were not a lot of people out. There is a stairway on the seawall down to the beach itself. I started to go! down in there, when I saw a man standing in front of the Holiday Inn smoking a cigarette. There was a railing on the seawall. He was leaning against it and looking eastward out at the ocean. He did not seem to be aware of this object that now only appeared to be 3 or 4 blocks south of me. I ran over to the man and said, ""Look at that!"" pointing. He looked up and said, ""Wow, what is that?"" I said, ""I don't know, but I think its one of those UFO's!"" The object had stopped now and seemed to just sit still. At times it seemed to glow slightly brighter and then dim. We both just stared. Then the object seemed to flatten out into a long narrow rectangle. Maybe like a cereal box on edge. Even at this shape it seemed to glow brighter and then dim slightly. It stayed like this for maybe 1 minute. Then, it shot eastward at the most amazing speed I have ever seen. It moved so fast that it appeared to stretch like taffy and then turn into a tiny orange ball that shot over the horizon to the east over the ocean. It left a long orange vapor trail that took several minutes to fade away. The man asked, ""Do you think that was a rocket?"" I said, ""No, I've seen rockets before, and they don't move like that"" (You could see rockets go up from Cape Kennedy on clear days where I lived. I have seen numerous Apollo launchings and even the Space Shuttle years later). The man asked me if I was going to tell anybody. I said I didn't know who to tell. We talked for a minute. He told me his name but I can't remember. I do remember he told me he was from Detroit, Michigan and was down for vacation. I left and drove home. I tried to tell my Father about it when I got home, but I woke him from sleeping, and I don't think he was quite awake. I told some co-workers the next day, who laughed at me. After that, I didn't tell anyone for a year or two. But after that, I would tell some friends. I still tell people sometimes, but I have always feared people would think I'm lying or some kind of looney.  Just to let you know. I am very familiar with military aircraft. My Father worked for the military as an Aircraft Instumentation Calibrations Technician. I lived by air bases most of my young life, and have seen many odd military vehicles. But I have never seen anything like this object. It was very close. It was not a rocket, plane, helicopter, balloon or whatever.

As far as calling the Air Force they would tell us it was some sort of weather ballon. So thats why we called the Radio station. Who do you go to for help in knowing what these are. I was I was very late that day going to work it seems that time was slowed down and while seeing these objects there were no dogs barking or birds chriping it was like a dead calm . I had to go to work eventuly when at work I was reluctant to mention anything about my incounter but Isaid to myself what do i have to lose. So I told two coworkers about the objects that I have seen. they told me they have seen the same objects but from a far distance accelerating at very high speed going up ward. To this day I'll never forget what I have seen I remember it like it happen yesterday and I now know we are not alone in the universe . You have to ask yourself what you belive in like what is god is god human?  Or is god of extraerrestrial origin. Are we the only life forms in the whole galaxies because we don't know where the universe begins or where it ends. One time in histroy people though the world was flat until someone proved otherwise. Some say it imposable to travel to far away planets because it would take forever. But intelligent life would use a diffrent way to travel by manipulating time and space because they are far more advanced than we are. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On my way home alone from a church service I rounded a steep curve and looked to my left across a river and up to the top of a steep hill. It was a crystal clear night and suddenly noticed a large object outlined in red lights with a flashing amber light at the center of the object.  It appeared to be at least 150 ft. long.  I first thought it was a large military helicopter.  I stopped my Chevy Blazer in the road, cut off my stereo and rolled down the window. The object was close to 300 ft. away.  I suddenly realized there was no noise at all. It was roughly 20-30 ft above the tree tops,yet the trees were motionless.  The craft was moving about 10-15 m.p.h. I drove quickly about 200 ft and pulled off to the left side of the road.  I got out of my vehicle and stood looking at it when I suddenly noticed an identical craft around 500 ft above the first one and slightly ahead.  I have lived here all of my life and I could tell by the direction they were heading they would pass over the crest of a hill about 1 and a half miles on down the road.  I figured I would be a lot higher and I would be able to see a lot more so I started for the crest of the hill as fast as I could get there.  It took around a minute to get there and as soon as I arrived I spun my vehicle around so I could see the crafts approach, but to my amazement they were gone.  I tuned my cb radio into a channel a local coal Strip mine was working because i knew, due to their location on the hill, they had to have see the crafts. They were working as usual and did not indicate any sighting at all.  I strangly was not afraid, but after I arrived home, I started to think about what I had seen and realized in what danger i could have possibly been.",2004-01-31T00:00:00,37.1338,-82.8747

As I was taking my shower I heard this strange low humming sound coming from outside the window. I was curious as to what it was. I pulled back the curtain to look out the window and floating next to the house above the tree line was a UFO. It was metallic, grey and disc shaped with moving lights around it's edge. The UFO was very smooth with no signs of seams, doors or windows. I do not know the size of the UFO because I could not see the whole thing.

This phenomenon did not only happen once but twice in a one week interval and both have witnesses. It has been 8years and the memories are still very vivid and unfortunately I am the only witness to publish this material - I do not currently live in the Philippines anymore and the whereabouts of the other witnesses is not of my knowledge.  It started in a humid summer night in Cebu,Philippines in Mandaue. As usual, me and my mates(we were of varying ages: 17,16 to 10) hang out in my friend's topless jeep and share jokes or whatever. Suddenly at around 8PM, my friend alerted us to a red light up in the sky moving(right to left) from east to west, and we(about 8 of us) spotted the single red light and unexpectedly another red light popped out in the east following the first and another until it completed into four red lights trailing each other that moved quite fast from east to westward manner. The distance between these four red lights were very uniform in a straight line(east to west) and suddenly all four halted in mid air(12o'clock in front of us, about 50degrees above our sky view, their height might be around a normal cloud height). After halting, the four red lights ""waited"" for a few seconds and the fourth red light(from the right) moved clockwise around the other remaining 3 and climbed up to sky about 10o'clock position above the remaining 3 and is about a few miles up the sky(estimated) and stayed there - while the fourth red light was manouvering, the second red light moved counterclockwise around the remaining 2 and moved slowly to the east and ""played"" around in the sky(easterly) for a few minutes and decided to go ""high speed"" up the sky into nowhere like the ones you see on starwars. The first red light(from the left) while the fourth and the second red lights were manouvering, just went ""high speed"" up the sky into nowhere, again. The third red light(which was the brightest of all 3) remained still without any ""visible"" movement. The fourth red light remained in its position until it was covered with clouds. All this happened in about 30minutes. At that moment, there were 2 adult witnesses which makes it 10, and I called my parents and saw it in disbelief and concluded that it was just a ""satellite"" - I said to them, ""Doing those ridiculous moves, no way"" I know how satellites move, I have observed them very well, but not this one. The third light remained until 9:30PM and did that ""high speed"" thingy up into nowhere. These red lights were quite bright and vivid up, like LED(light emitting diodes) up in the sky, but not so bright or so intense.  After that incident, the following week, which was Wednesday(I could still remember) at 8PM as well, me and a friend of mine were having a chat at the back of a pick up truck. I innocently gazed into the patchy cloudy night sky and thought of nothing and the second time I gazed on the exact position I gazed before, there, the intense third red light(which I recognized) was there along with the passing clouds, as if looking at me. I called upon my other friends(about 3) and saw it too. We were excited and both fearing why it showed up again as if it's intention was only meant for us - I could feel it. A passing cloud covered the red light and by the time the cloud was gone(about 10 seconds past) the red light was in no sight. That was the last of it. We speculated the possibilities of what the red lights might be, and a lot of them have been junked: 1. not an airplane, surely it wasn't, not even helicopters(no noise) and moves too fast ""upwards"". 2. not a kite with a very bright red lamp, why: a. the intervals of all four were seemingly uniform moving from left to right, east to west, not to mention how it stopped abruptly in mid air like there is a pause button somewhere. b. the level of brightness in that height would require a huge battery and a reasonably huge lamp, as big as a car's red lamp, which require at least a 6volt(very heavy battery) - not even a 3metre kite can carry it. An LED can't produce that level of brightness at that distance. c. a kite in a night sky is not very steady, wind pressure is weak. These red lights were as still as you can imagine. 3. not a satellite, too bright, and the movements are very complex.  Whatever it was, I only wished I had caught it in video with a steady tripod, it would had astonished the whole world who owns a TV. I might email a sketch of how it moved in the sky and its arrangegments.",2004-01-31T00:00:00,,

This particular incident that I had witnessed was zat night and it was dark. I was in the living room talking to my friend on the phone. As I was talking on the phone I was looking out the big picture window. I saw this light in the sky. It didn't look any different than a bright star. The thing that made it stand out was the fact it bobbing up and down and sometimes left to right. I watched it for about a minute and then it went straight up and out of my sight. I tried to take a picture of it but it came out dark probaly beacause I had taken it from through the window. I really belive that it was a UFO.

I was located inisde the Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn, NY. We observed the shower, just over the horizon, through the center and upper level of the Verrazzano Bridge. It was an amazing sight. But when we looked directly overhead, we saw about twelve unknown craft, all bottom-lit and flying in what I could only describe as a group of pool balls in a triangle formation, moving at a high rate of speed.  These craft were definitely over the ""ceiling"" and were moving much faster than a passnger jet would fly at the same altitude. The most amazing thing about this sighting was that the UFO's switched positions rapidly, in like an ""X"" fashion, just as they were flying over my head. all of them did it at the same time, quite rapidly and precisely - it was then that I knew that the only group capable of doing such aerial arobics at that speed would be the Blue Angels.  But why would they be flying over the city on an average day and at night - and in such a formation? And why were the fighters bottom-lit? Alot about this encounter did not make any sense to me. My natural assumption is that the craft must have been extra-terrestrial. I'm just hoping that I wasn't the only one, aside my cousin, who had my eye on the sky that night.

There it was in broad daylight a cheesy looking 50's style ufo it was a dull gray. I looked at it, it was there there was no denying it. It was halfway between my house and an island between were I was and the Ohio shore. The thing that made it real was when lowflying clouds in the storm blowing under it. It did not move. I looked at it and it did not go away, I made my dinner going back and forth and it did not go away. As soon as I took it for granted 20 minutes later is was gone. I never really thought about it till recently, so I am not 100% sure on the day that month. The reason I finally found an interest in it, when peoples discriptions on coast to coast am.

I had a full battery at the time, and when i went to record it, the video camera would not turn on.  I tried to call neighbor at the time, and phone lost all cell phone signal.  Any help on figuring it out would be helpfull. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-02-12T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

These orbs of light streaked across the sky and then reversed their directions and began ""playing"" and interacting with each other as if in a ""dog-fight"".

I am a skeptic at heart and did not want to believe what I saw clearly taking place. These aerobatics continued for some time and we ruled out all of the usual causes that may have created this illusion: 1) neither of us were in intoxicated in any way 2) the sky was totally unobstructed by clouds or Moonlight 3) they were not birds or bats due to the velocity of travel across a huge portion of the sky and the way in which they could stand completely still, They could veer off in any direction without breaking speed, either. 4) I woke up my roommate and had her come and see this orbs also. 5) last, but not least, at 6AM they all returned to the ""star"" just before daybreak. I might add also that this occured just days before Hurricane Isabelle began its journey towards our shore. I live one mile from the Atlantic Coast and Isabelle was headed directly for us as a catagory 5 hurricane. In the last approach to our shoreline Isabelle reduced to a catagory 3 and changed course to come inland above us.

I am no stranger to unexpected events happening around me (not to say that it doesn't still creep me out a little bit...or a lot bit). Last night I was in my upstairs kitchen making bread in preperation for Thanksgiving. I had the TV on and there was general noise in the background. It occured to me that I was hearing what sounded like a helicopter very close by outside. This in itself is not unusual as we are on the flight path for the trauma rescue helicopter (which I fly on occasionally). Since the noise was not fading into the distance as it usually does when the copters fly over, I went out to see what the deal was. I thought maybe Life Flight had landed closeby for a ""hot"" load (load in the patient without shutting the blades down). I looked up and there hovering in my front yard not far off the treetops is this absolutely massive cigar shaped white or light colored ""helicopter"". It was hovering in an area close to my pond. We live on 16 manicured acres and this thing was clearly visible in the treeless part of my front yard (this area is roughly 4 acres in size). Not sure what the heck it was doing. Just hovering at an absolute standstill. The thing did not move even one inch in any direction. The sound it made was like a weird sounding helicopter. More like a loud whirring or something. The lights in my house and landscaping flickered and my dogs were freaking out. Occasionally, this thing seemed to make almost no noise at all. It sat there for what I thought was about 10 minutes. Later noticed it was actually more like 40 minutes. This would make sense though because the bread dough I was working with was nearly completely done rising (second rising takes about 40 to 50 minutes). I called my neighbor to see if she was seeing the same thing and she said she did and also wondered what the heck it was doing there. I'm not psychotic. I'm a nurse with a very responsible job and I do not drink, smoke or take drugs, prescription or otherwise. The only mind altering thing I do is meditate...alot. Called the police, but they said they had no other reports of helicopters low flying in the area. They said they'd send over a patrolman to check it out, but I never saw any sign of him. The thing eventually moved off towards the direction of the neighbors house. It moved incredibly slowly. I could have walked way faster than it was moving. I noticed that there seemed to be no downdraft from the rotor blades.In fact I do not recall ever even SEEING any rotor blades. When it went over the neighbors backyard, it turned east and moved off over my woods and eventually out of sight. One other thing I noticed is that when it hovered over my front yard, there was one round light coming from the bottom in the center. It didn't seem to be a spotlight or anything because the grass beneath it was not illuminated. As it moved off over the woods, it had 3 lights. One on each end and the same center one. One of them was green, and the other two white. I went back out to the area this morning and noticed nothing out of order. I had intense dreaming last night, but not what I would call unusually unusual. I have no idea what this thing was. Maybe just a new type of helicopter I have not seen yet or maybe something else. Not quite prepared yet to assume it was a UFO. The military is always coming up with new designs for things. I don't live near any military base. I think the closest one is Wright Patterson (?) AFB to the south of me by several hours. This object was clearly hovering in MY yard though. Not like the pilot was just taking a break or something. It was clearly and obviously hanging over my yard not far from my pond. Maybe the pilot was looking at the fish in there??????  Well, this is in a nutshell what happened to me last night. There may be a prefectly reasonable explanation for it. Not sure. I'm not an expert in military flying craft. So many odd things happen to me all the time (you have no idea...) that I can't immediately rule out something remarkable.",2003-12-09T00:00:00,,

Donnie  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 27, 2003, COMMUNICATION BY KENNY YOUNG, ON CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST))  SUBJECT: Unusual situation and 'bright lights' LOCATION: Morehead, KY (Rowan County) DATE: Sunday, November 23, 2003 TIME: Around 10:00 p.m.  This is a follow up to a N.U.F.O.R.C. sighting report that was just posted by Peter Davenport  SUMMARY  A report was submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center concerning a strange situation taking place near Morehead, Kentucky.  The report stated: ""Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from Morehead Police Dept. of a female crying for help three times  From 2 witness then they was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and started searching the area 1st & 2nd witness reported seeing this. The fire dept. was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with no results found. Res.of Morehead was one of the witnesses.Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person,the search will not be continued.""   INVESTIGATION  This morning I contacted the Morehead Police Dept at (606-784-7511) and talked to two very nice officers that were in the department (located at 105 E Main St Morehead, KY).  I asked the first dispatcher if he could provide any information about an unusual report I had concerning mysterious lights seen near Morehead.  ""I think that was from the Rockfork area,"" he said, ""and it was the northern lights, what they call an aurora. We had some calls on it. We had a report of the northern lights in the area.""  The dispatcher also informed that no officers reported the lights.  ""There were some calls on it, one female caller reporting something in the sky, but it was the aurora borealis.""  I asked if the calls were related to the report of ""screaming sounds"" and the dispatcher said he did not think so.  I asked if there was a search conducted and he did not know for sure and began checking the logs. There was some confusion as to the date of event but found from his logbook he informed that a search was undertaken near Adams Lane on Sunday evening, November 23.  ""There was some type of search because of a woman screaming, I think,"" he said, and also checked with another gentleman who was in the office, the captain of the fire department. I could overhear the gentleman talking (his name may have been Randy) who was knowledgeable about the situation. I then asked if I could speak directly with this person.  The Captain of the Fire Department came to the phone and said that on Sunday night, November 23, persons near Adams Lane began hearing a woman screaming three times around 10:00 p.m.  ""We had a report of a woman screaming and then they didn't hear it no more,"" said the Morehead, KY fire official, ""they called and the local rescue squad went out there, the fire department and the police went out and a search was conducted. The search used a thermal imaging device and lasted for about an hour and a half when it was called off.""  ""We thought it might have been two kids who got scared,"" he said. ""Maybe one scared another and they were frightened.""  I asked the fire official if he had any knowledge about the bright light in the sky seen for one minute and he said: ""I got there at the tail end of things so don't know anything about it. I didn't see anything myself.""  I asked if he heard anyone else talking or rumors of a bright light in the sky during the time frame of the search and he said ""no.""  COMMENT  The two officers at the Morehead Police Department were kind and helpful. They were able to validate the report of 'mysterious screams' that appeared on N.U.F.O.R.C. but did not have any information to link the 3 mysterious screams directly to a ighting of a 'bright light' in the sky.  The first officer said the bright light, seen a couple of days earlier, was caused by the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis, yet it seems unusual to think that several residents, as described, would see a pretty sunset and interpreted the situation in such a manner as to contact local police authorities.  Further, the initial report to N.U.F.O.R.C. sought to link the sighting of the bright light in the sky directly to the scream/search event and seemed to suggest that a ""Res."" of Morehead was one of the witnesses. ""Res."" might mean 'resident' or 'rescue' as in rescue worker. The poorly worded report also does not indicate what this 'Res' was a witness to, exactly.  Also, there may be some issue as to the time listed on the N.U.F.O.R.C. report as the claimant logs the event as occurring on 11/21/2003 when the dispatcher said the search took place Sunday evening, 11/23/2003 (and also noted that the northern lights were seen ""a couple of days earlier"").  Northern Lights have been prominent lately due to increased solar eruptions and flares from the sun.  Thanks to Peter Davenport, Donnie Blessing  Filed, November 27, 2003 KENNY YOUNG   Dear List: At approx. 11 A.M. today, December 2nd, 2003 I spoke with another witness to the amazing UFO/Screaming woman incident in Morehead, Ky. The claimant, who is ex-military, informed me that she and her daughter witnessed the same UFO as it came down near to her home. Her testimony fits the same statements made by the prior witness, Mr. Virgil Davis.  A full report of the claimant's story will follow shortly.  The mystery of this case only deepens as this story unfolds.

CURRENT ENCOUNTERS ""OPP-APP"" List  A short time ago I located and interviewed a very credible witness in Morehead, Kentucky that has provided me with a sober link between a UFO sighting and bizarre report of desperate and blood-curdling screaming sounds heard at the same location immediately after the unidentified flying object had departed.  After the conversation I had to call a 'time out' and take some time to contemplate over this development as the report is terribly interesting. It is one of the best reports I have ever taken as I am impressed with the witness  and extreme strangeness of the case. I will prepare the details of this case shortly and have a report put together in the next hour or so.  The witness did not report this except to the police and has no idea how it ended up at NUFORC (Peter, can you help if you retain a source for the original report?). As stated earlier, the Morehead police department was dismissive of this incident, when I contacted them they acknowledged a search party and report of screaming sounds but said that 'northern lights' were seen in the area. From my conversation with this very credible witness, northern lights can be positively ruled out. This is a real mystery.  Full report is pending....  KENNY YOUNG  ((END))  ((NOVEMBER 30, 2003, POSTING TO CURRENT-ENCOUNTERS LIST BY KENNY YOUNG))  SUBJECT: Screaming sounds firmly linked to UFO sighting LOCATION: Morehead, Kentucky (Rowan County) DATE: Friday, November 21, 2003 TIME: Between 9 and 10:00 p.m.  SUMMARY  In effort to further explore the report of 'unidentified lights' and screaming sounds alleged in Morehead, Kentucky, an internet search was conducted to retrieve the address and phone numbers of residents of ((deleted)) (law officer earlier contacted had advised of the search taking place near this location).  After a ""reverse lookup"" was conducted at the internet resource Http://www.theultimates.com one residency was identified on ((deleted)) Lane in Morehead, Kentucky.  That number was called around 6:30 p.m. this evening (Sunday, November 30, 2003) and I inquired if anyone could help me with information about the report of screaming sounds heard around one week earlier.  The call was received by Dr. ((name deleted)), a ((deleted)) college professor.  ""I was here when the screams were heard,"" he said.  ""There were some loud, blood-curdling screams but nobody could find out anything more.""  I then asked if Dr. ((name deleted)) knew anything about any UFO sighting and he said: ""Yes, I saw it.""  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that he was driving toward his home on Friday, November 21 between 9 and 10:00 p.m. with his 2 sons, 15 and 18-years old (He recalls the specific date, knowing that one son is in college and would not have been home any day except Friday).  While driving, they all spotted a soundless aerial object over a nearby open field that was described as an oval-shaped, white-colored light source as big as a pea held at arms length which moved 'like a hummingbird would move.'  The object, seen in the dark and clear night skies, was relatively high when first seen and was ""coming down, moving in increments as if an elevator would drop and stay there awhile, then drop and stay there awhile,"" Dr. ((name deleted)) said.  After the first 3 or 4 minutes of visual observation, the object began moving around to different parts of the sky. They got out of car to see if they could identify this object and verified to their satisfaction that the object was not a plane, helicopter or aurora borealis.  ""My first inclination was to rationalize what this object could have been,"" Dr. ((name deleted)) said. ""rather than jumping to conclusions. After we ruled out the various possible explanations we assumed that this was a UFO.""  ""I know for a fact that there was no explanation for this object and I'm just glad I had my two sons with me to see it,"" he said.  After observing this object for a few minutes, Dr. ((name deleted)) and his 2 sons got back in the car and drove on to their home under a certain sense of apprehension.  ""I would say that our feeling was more a sense of apprehension than fear,"" he said, ""I did not know what it was we were looking at and had some concern that it might or could have spotted us.""  After driving the short distance to their house, they went to a second floor bedroom and looked out the window to the northwest where they continued to watch the object. It descended lower toward the ground and seemed to be settling in a nearby field where its color had shifted from a white to an orange. As the object got lower and lower to the ground, it became bigger and its color changed to a reddish light.  He said that the size of the object increased from a pea at arms length to a dime at arms length, stressing that its size, from his perspective, was ""not quite as drastic as a nickel at arms length.""  ""There was like a vacuum of silence while we watched this,"" Dr. ((name deleted)) said, ""it was like everything was real quiet, at a standstill and then when it became a red color, everything went crazy.""  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that animals in the area suddenly erupted in a frenzy. His neighbors dog was barking crazily and his German Shepherd dog tried to break its chain.  From his perspective, the object descended to the ground but was not certain that it touched or made contact with the ground as trees prevented him from seeing this with certainty.  ""At that point, after this object got red, it just ""shot off"" like a dart, some kind of acceleration and it just took off to the west. We just stood there dumbfounded.""  He said the sighting lasted for an estimated 10 to 15 minute duration.  ""I was very reluctant to call the police about a UFO sighting,"" he said, ""at that point, we were not going to report this.""  ""Right after that my 2-sons went back outside and heard the screaming. It was a female voice. They got in the car and within minutes had called from their cell phone to say that they had been hearing screaming sounds in the field where this thing came down,"" he said.  ""Approximately 20-minutes after the UFO sighting the police were at my door, there were about 20 officers and a rescue squad over in the field where I spotted the UFO. They were combing the area and had asked me what I knew about someone screaming.""  ""Apparently, others had heard the screaming sounds.""  I asked Dr. ((name deleted)) if he could explain what was heard and he emphasized that he did not hear the screaming sounds himself, that his 2 sons heard the disturbing commotion, along with other residents in the area that notified law enforcement.  Dr. ((name deleted)) paused from our conversation to check with one of his sons, asking if he could recount the nature of the screaming sounds. He said it was a desperate, blood curdling scream of a female voice that kept saying: ""Help me, oh my God, help me!""  ""Apparently several people had heard the screaming, I don't know how long it lasted,"" he said.  When the police arrived at his doorstep knocking on his door (an estimated 15 minutes after the UFO departed), Dr. ((name deleted)) volunteered information about the UFO sighting.  ""I took the officer to the side and explained to him that this is going to sound crazy, but I need to tell you what I saw tonight.""  ""I told the police about the UFO after they came to the door, I don't know if anyone else saw the UFO but the officer taking my report took me seriously. He didn't write anything down while I talked with him,"" Dr. ((name deleted)) said.  When asked if the police officer indicated that anyone else had also witnessed the UFO, Dr. ((deleted)) said that the police officer said he had seen a UFO also, but was uncertain if he was referring to the same object or a separate, unrelated sighting.  Dr. ((name deleted)) said that aside from reporting this to the police officer who knocked on his door, he had not reported this sighting to any other person and that he was not the source for the report which was submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center. He was puzzled how the report made it to NUFORC and said that neither he, nor his sons, reported the sighting to anyone.  ""I'm still trying to figure out who reported this,"" Dr. ((name deleted)) said after our conversation. He went on to say how he got ""freaked out"" when the cops came to the door asking about the screaming sounds.  He described the area of his residence as isolated and surrounded by fields and woodland. His road is paved. He emphasized that the screaming sounds came from the immediate area where the unidentified object had came to the ground. ""The screaming sounds came from the field, and I have no explanation for it.""  Dr. ((name deleted)), who teaches ((deleted)) for the ((deleted)), also said that he had previously seen a UFO when he was in his Freshman year in college at ((deleted)) in 1976. He said the object was similar to what he saw on Friday, November 21, 2003.  COMMENT  I am deeply impressed by Dr. ((deleted)) and his efforts to remain objective and rationalize various explanations about the sighting. Based on his observation, the object in question is nothing to do with Aurora Borealis or 'northern lights.'  Dr. ((deleted)) allowed permission to use his name and employment in this report, having no objection to it attached with the UFO sighting and situation involving a search party near his home.  Information furnished by Dr. ((deleted)) sheds new light on this case. Comments from him directly contradict the dismissive approach taken by law officers in remarks made during earlier inquiries (who also incorrectly advised that the event was on Sunday, November 23) regarding a UFO situation that corresponds with the screams.  When informed that a Morehead policeman and a fire rescue officer told me that ""someone had seen the northern lights,"" Dr. ((name deleted)) scoffed at the suggestion and was in disbelief.  ""I can't believe they said that, this was definitely not the northern lights.""  He said that tomorrow he will inspect the 50-acre field where the object descended.  The report to N.U.F.O.R.C. suggests that the UFO was also sighted by witnesses with the rescue squad responding to the scene. This might suggest that the screaming sound was heard simultaneous to the visual sighting of the UFO. Peter Davenport of N.U.F.O.R.C. states: ""The person who submitted the sighting report for Morehead, KY, provided no personal or contact information, to include no e-address.  It ""reads"" as if it was submitted by a member of the team that was dispatched, i.e. it reads as if someone just copied a written record of the dispatch.  I would have responded to the report, save for the absence of any means of contacting the source.""  That report states: ""Morehead-Rowan Co. Rescue Sq.had a call from MPD of a female crying for help x3. From 2 witness then there was a bright light in the sky for about 1 min. RESCUE SQ.arrived on scene and started searching the area 1st & 2nd witness reported seeing this .The fire dept.was ask to begin searching with the thermal imaging camera with no results found. Res. of Morehead was one of the witnesses. Unless there is a confirmed report of a missing person, the search will not be continued.""  The report of desperate, blood curdling screams from a woman crying ""Help me, Oh God, Help me"" mar this case with a disturbing sense of unusual dread. Clearly, there was a problem taking place and this report raises the specter of reported UFO/human abduction or interaction.  Morehead, Kentucky is an estimated 45-miles south of Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where a crop formation appeared in a Rye Field in the spring of this year. A flap of crop formations and UFO sightings also bewildered Southern Ohio in the summer of 2003, and during this flap one strange account of a woman found in a Southern Ohio soybean field is under investigative consideration.  There is no certainty that this situation can be linked to the UFO or crop circle flap aside from the chronological and regional closeness, but the woman - who was hospitalized for a week after being found by a farmer - reportedly experienced amnesia and did not know how she got in the field. This matter is also held under close consideration by researcher Donnie Blessing and will be pursued further.  This present case of 'screaming sounds' from a female voice is linked firmly to the UFO sighting as per the same location in one specific field near Adams Lane in Morehead, Kentucky and the '20 minute time frame' of the conclusion of the UFO sighting to the arrival of officers involved in the search and rescue operation.

I was standing outside at a house party in Oakland. I was having a conversation and smoking a cigarette with a friend of mine (tip of the hat to Jeff Rense). While talking, I saw in the sky and clearly noted what, appeared to be a distant orb.  At first I thought it was the landing lights or 'approach' lights for an airplane, as Oakland and San Francisco are often filled with commercial air traffic. Upon closer inspection though, I noticed that the apparent distance and stable quality - and indeed the color (a pale white-blue that I wouldn't associate with the operating illumination system of a commercial aircraft) - of the light didn't appear to be sourced from a plane.  My next assumption was that is was a satellite, due to the uncharacteristically clear and beautiful weather we have been having in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, you can catch one or two satellites a week zooming by in orbit reflecting the light of the sun, if you care to look.  However, this object, although probably most similar in appearance to an orbiting satellite, was of too great a size and brightness to be even the largest of low orbit satellites. This thing would have had to have been huge to produce an illumination of that magnitude at orbital distance.  It's smooth and extremely regular emission of light, at a very consistent brightness, and it's dead straight trajectory from roughly West to East - at an apparently level path from my vantage point there on the ground, and almost its ponderous quality of movement quickly disqualified any description of a ""shooting star"" or meteor that I've ever heard.  It had a roughly similar size and slightly diminished brightness compared to the current appearance of the now closely approached planet Mars in the night sky. NOTE: I would like to plainly iterate that this object was indeed NOT the planet Mars itself, to dispel any ideas of mistaken identification.  Perhaps the most notable thing about this light was that after about 15 seconds of very consistent traverse, it slowly, and extremely evenly, faded to black without any apparent change in velocity. I've never seen anything like it before...",2003-10-31T00:00:00,37.80316672771673,-122.2309960927961

Suddenly, my fiance noticed an orange ball in the west sky.  All of us stood up and observed the orange ball come slowly over our heads and slowly fly in the distance.  When I first saw it, I thought it was an asteroid and told everyone to get out of the way because it looked like it was heading right to us.  As it got closer, the orange ball got bigger in size.  I gestimate it was about 10 - 20 times the size of my thumb at arms length.  I estimate it was anywhere from 500 - 2,000 feet off the ground and moving about 200 mph.  It was the same color as fire.  All 3 of us heard no sound whatsoever.  When we first saw the ball it was coming straight from the west.  Once it was over us it seemed to curve slightly to the south.  After it went over us, my fiance asked if she should get the camcorder.  I said by the time she got it, it would be gone.  Then it came to a stop in the distance and I told her to go and get the camcorder.  I set the camcorder on the tripod and recorded the orange ball for about 6 minutes.  The ball hovered in the distance for close to ten minutes.  When it was stationary, the ball of light turned off and on twice.  The first time for about 30 seconds and the second for about 5 seconds.  It was a very clear night.  After a few minutes of watching it stationary, it slowly drifted away while the ball was flickering or illuminating in and out.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,42.88859999999999,-88.333

It was bright, starlike, and it made a loop around the house and hovered above me for about five minutes. I went into the house and got binoculars and looked at it. In the binoculars it seemed to change shape, from a sphere to a elongated figure. My daughter came out of the house and I showed her the ufo. She was surprised to see a bright star in the middle of the day. I gave her the binoculars and she also commented that it was changing shapes. This ufo gradually grew dim and we went into the house to eat lunch. After lunch, I decided to get the video camera out with me in case the ufo returned. I went back to work and as I was coming out of the garage with some wood I had cut, I saw three ufo's coming from the north. I quickly grabbed the video camera and recorded the ufo's as they traveled above the house. These ufo's were bright and closer , and are the ones in the video.

Irwin U.S. Army training facility.  The alleged landing took place approximately one week ago (10/10-11)at the Lake Beverly resort on the western edge of Coyote Dry Lake.  The landing site is actually in a marshy area of the small artesian well fed lake itself near the end of a small unused wooden dock.  The area is completely overgrown with a dense stand of very thick 6' to 8' tall cattail reeds.  Whatever it was caused an area of flattened reeds approx. 20' long x 15' wide in a roughly oval shape.  Standing on the dock it is apparent that the reeds are neatly ""laid down"" in a very obvious ""swirled"" clockwise pattern.  There is no stalk breakage and in several locations about the perimeter are large bundles of reeds that looked ""blasted"" out as if by some great force but still just ""laid down"". Numerous cattails have been burst open by the force.  In the bottom of the depression is a small area of browned reeds and what appear to be some randomly spaced depressions although the reeds have settled over these making them very difficult to discern. I did not venture out into the depression due the marshy conditions, but the property owner assured me that he had investigated the ""landing gear pad"" marks and found them to be equidistant (either 3 or 4 marks) and pushed deep into the soft lake bottom.  The property owner did not actually see what caused the disturbed area but found it the next morning.  He admitted that the appearance of this ""landing site"" coincides with weeks of nocturnal light sightings in the area.  I plan to return to the site next weekend to take photos, measurements, etc. This really looks weird to say the least.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,,

Scooter said that he had seen something on the Sci -Fi channel about drone ships coming done to do the dirty work while the mother ship stays safely out of sight.   This would lend credence to the majority of most sightings being that of smaller vessels.  I think Scooter is right about this because he's into all that stuff.

Geroge Nori had a guest on, talking about UFOs. I have never really given much thought to whether there are really UFOs visiting our planet. I guess you can say that I am skeptical of the idea. However, I do have an instance that happened to my family and me about 12 years ago. I have only told a few people about this incident because I still believe that there is probably some explanation for what we saw that night. In 1991 I was 35 years old, my wife 32 and our sons 9 and 12. We had moved into our new home on 40 acres only a few months before. Our place was in a very rural part of the County. Our closest neighbor was approx. 2 miles away and it was 8 miles to the closest small town of 1000 residents. The largest city, and the only major airport was about 70 miles south of our place. On this particular night we had just returned home from our 12 year old son's little league baseball game. It was around 11:00 pm and He had immediatly went upstairs to his room because he was upset that they had lost their game. My wife and other son were in the family room and I went up to try and cheer my 12 year old up. Our house was built on a hill in the middle of our 40 acres and my son's room faced the west. There were 3 six foot windows side by side in his room. The back door to our home was right at the bottom of the staircase. As I sat down on his bed I just happened to glance out of his window to the western sky. That is when I saw something in the distance headed right toward our house. This thing was very large with many lights and at a low altitude. My first thought was that a commercial jet was about to crash on our land. I yelled to my wife that a jet was about to crash into our field. My son and I got down the stairs very quickly and we met my wife and my other son at the back door. We all ran out into the back yard. I was expecting to hear a plane in trouble. instead, we all stood there and watched this thing with many lights and a string of lights behind it go right above our heads. As it traveled over us there was no noise at all and it was moving very slowly. We just stood there and watched it as it disapeared to the east. The next morning I was really expecting to hear some kind of news about it, but I heard nothing. To this day, I have no idea what this was that we saw, but I know that I will never forget that moment as we stood in our backyard and watched this string of lights silently fly overhead.

This light was moving from northeast to southwest.  It moved along for awhile and I thought it was just a satellite or something.  Then it did a very sharp u-turn and when it was returning the way it came from it did a zig-zag type pattern on it's way.  This pattern I know is not possible with any type of jet or anything we have.  The size of the zig-zag pattern was a decent size in the sky and as fast as this thing was making it the pattern had to be miles long from zig-zag tip to zig-zag tip.

We were just sitting there on a picnic table and talking. We enjoyed staying outside all night since we were all only 14 or 15 years old. Well anyways it was a fairly chilly morning. As we talked we were looking towards some woods. The woods were roughly northeast from the house. We noticed the sun had come up over the trees directly in a straight line from or view. We didn't think much of it and just continued to talk. Then one of us (I don't remember who) happened to look over to our right and more in a easterly direction. And the sun was coming up over there! We then being somewhat more confused then shocked looked back at what we had assumed was the sun. It was a huge round, bright orange sphere. We all were just flabbergasted and couldn't figure out what it was. It then dissapeared. It sort of imploded,kind of like the circle the cartoon characters stick there heads out of at the end of the cartoon. You know it goes whooop. A few things became apparent looking back on it after having time to think about it. The object was of course too far to the north rather than east to be the sun. Also it couldn't have been near as bright as the sun or we couldn't have stared straight at it like that. It was definitley very close to us and above the woods. I realized as well that light reflected off the trees as if the object were directly above them. Not a celestial body thousands or millions of miles away. It was very bright and very orange. The only explanation i can give for us thinking it was the sun at first would be that we just werent really paying attention to it. During this whole episode a fog had rolled in. We didn't really feel any fear but we felt enough apprehension to head inside. We don't really talk about this much. In fact the two of them sort of denied this happened for years after the fact. Me and ((Witness #1)) had several strange things happen to us in those woods throughout later years. In fact i'm a little scared of them. But i really wonder about this still.

We have fished in this cover for decades, ever since we were young children. The cove itself is only about knee deep as we have waded in it many times. It was dark out that night, cloudy, no stars could be seen. We were bottom fishing, just relaxing,not much talking. All of a sudden, we both heard this tremendous sound. The only thing I can think of is it sounded like a house coming out of the water. It was happening right in front of us though we could not see a thing. Without a word being spoken, both of us immediately ran backwards frrom the water's edge. I looked over at my fearless brother and he had a 25 caliber pistol pulled, aimed at the water (he was a manager of a rest. and carried alot of money so he carried a gun). Both of us just looked at each other and asked what the heck was that, though not in such nice terms. We both basically ran to our poles, grabbed them and reeled them i nwhile running away fro mthe water....  My brother refuses to talk about that incident to this day, and tho we fished there every monday, we did not go back to that spot for 2 months.

The object was gone. There was never any sound. The object  appeared to be circular, maybe 10 - 15' in diameter.

I was driving with a friend of mine to Pierce City Missouri.  We were on highway 97 heading south.  The sun was shining bright that day and there were only a few high clouds.  About a mile north of the city, there are a few hills and valleys.  As we came down a hill, I noticed an object floating about a hundred feet from the ground. I assumed it was one of the Goodyear Mini-blimps that they have for sports events.  My first thought seemed reasonable, that it was flying somewhere for a big sports event, I had seen one fly over my house in 1985, so it was not a big surprise to see it. But two things caught my attention immediately.  First, it was a little skinny for a blimp and secondly, it seemed to be flashing a bright spotlight.  I laughed and pointed it to my friend in the passenger seat.  I had to watch the road, so I looked away for a second to drive, as we passed a tree. I became concerned because my friend's jaw was wide open, and he had a look of total blankness.  He was able to get a really good look at the object.  As we passed the tree I suddenly realized it was no blimp. There was no GOODYEAR written on the side, no propellers, no tail fins, no flashing signs.  What I thought was the harsh reflection of the sun on the skin of a balloon was in fact, a bright light coming from beneath a large (100') metallic cigar shaped craft. It was only about 100 or 150 yards from the road.  It was barely above tree top level.  I had assumed I would get a good look at it as we continued down the highway.  The object continued to hover for a second, then vanished into a shadowy streak, climbing altitude and disappearing over the road. The whole event lasted about 5 seconds.  The craft made no sounds.  A few hundred yards down the road, we saw a family bar-b-que outside, but they were totally oblivious to the sighting.  There were no other cars on the road, so it seems there were only two witnesses. My friend got a much better look at the craft then I did.  He told me later that there were beams of light shooting out from underneath it.  I can remember being hit with the light, which was very bright.  Because the sun was starting to set on the other side of the road, to my right,my thought was that an unlucky reflection was hitting me in the eye. What I didn't see, that the passenger did, was that as we came down the hill, two beams of light (like search lights) poured out from the craft and pointed at the car. The light was very bright, but annoyed me to look away. Very quickly, I began to have difficulty remembering the shape of the craft and what it was doing.  A couple of days later, I had forgotten about the lights and was forgetting the shape.  The only thing that was clear to me was what went on in my mind.  I remember what I was thinking just as clearly today as then (8 years later).  I have trouble remembering what I SAW.  That's odd. Fortunately my friend remembers it all.  He doesn't talk about it much, I don't think he'll ever say more about it.  We have all the details locked in our memories between us. UFOs are pretty common here in Missouri.  There was a sighting this morning (Sept. 19, 2003) outside of Carthage MO (64836)- but I didn't see it- so I can't report it.  Four cars saw it, maybe someone else will.

So we went back inside grabbed her keys then walked back outside.  While walking back to my car we searched the woods where I showed it went straight down.  As we kept walking the woods would be clear from walking between the trees in the distance, therefore a BRIGHT white light would appear every 10-15 steps. The whole time I'd say walking to my car we each saw the light in the woods 3 times.  My girlfriend became very uncomftable. I inquired why she was, she replied ' My whole time living here I've never seen a light like that there night or day.' we hurried to our vehicles and I left her house in a hurry.

As it ascended it left a flume or wake behind.  It eventually stopped and was in the shape of a ball with low burning lights pulsing from it.  More objects have begun to appear over the last week.  Last night, my friend and I counted six objects, all with the same colors, red,green,blue and red.  There was one object located on each side of the Big Dipper, both seemed to be on the same parallel.  There were also four obejcts in the western sky.  One of the objects near the Big Dipper was in the shape of a triangle.  As these objects ascended, they took the shape of a ball, with low burning lights pulsing from it.  It almost seems that each comes to a rest as if they are awaiting orders to move.  I was reluctant to file the first report but with so many last night and the fact they have been present almost every night since the first sighting, I felt this was the right thing to do.  The witnesses to these events has been myself and two different neighbors.  I tried to photograph one of the objects but it was too far away.  I know this is not something from this world as no sound has ever been heard and they are very distinct in the heavens due to their brilliant collors and pulsing lights.  It would seem to me that you all should have the ability to see these lights due to their distance from the earth and appearing in the same general area nightly.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,31.349300000000003,-81.8271

At 20 min after midnight I noticed a group of red and white lights, locked together, zooming across the sky at what seemed to be airliner cruise altitude, from east to west. They seemed to be about twice as wide as the jet's light formations. There was one red light in the middle of the group of white lights denoting a diamond or trianlular pattern. These were much, much brighter lights than those of the jets. The red light did not seem to blink, only 'flutter'. They seemed to be running at the same trajactories all the east-west airliners were traveling along. No sound from anything in the sky that night, including the lights in question. Too late in the night and too fast to be satellites. The thing that stood out was that these crossed the sky in 30 seconds.**  All the other jets took 3 minutes. Thats 6 times faster than the jets: which means that the craft was moving at 6*.85Mach = ~Mach 5 if it was at cruise altitude -OR- If it was closer to the ground the speed may be closer to Mach 1 but I should have heard it either through engine noise or sonic boom.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,,

Sometimes one would fly away from the others.  It was very hard to determine the distance.

Another, smaller group with 2, 3 then 4 appeard directly behind us and flew in the same random manner, often bouncing off of one or two at a time.  Made a few attempts to call police on the non-emergency line but kept getting a recording for the fire department.

As we drove from Globe into Superior on saturday afternoon we noticed dozens of cars pulled off the road with people outside looking up....we drove through Superior, and a few miles later decided to pull over because of the number of cars still pulled over and looking upwards.  We got out, asked some questions, and looked up as well. Very high up there was a bright silver spherical object (the size to the eye as a BB held at hands distance.) We obseved this for about 10 minutes, durig which the object would move in any direction almost instantaneously by the distance of about 1 to 2 hand-widths at arms length. Several people had large cameras observing the object.  during this time some commercial jets crossed across the sky, as the object stayed in roughly the same area of sky moving from pace to place. I would have to guess altitude of 60,000+ feet considering we travelled 20 miles of highway where hundreds of behicals were pulled over looking up.  We never figured out why anyone ever noticed it at first, but whatever the reason it eventially spaked hindreds of vehicals to pull over and look up for at least 1/2 to 1 hr (the time I estimate it took for that much trafic to decide to pull over).  There obviuosly was no noise, and it definitely was not a balloon, as a balloon would drift in a common direction with the wind, and would not be visible for a stretch of highway 20 miles in length. It was not a common jet or airplane.  I just dont undersand why it wasnt on the news or in the newspaper...I have never seen anything like this before.

About 4:45 pm i was checking the air in my tires when i looked up and saw the moon, as it is out early this time of the year. There i saw what first appeared to be 3 stars, with one being red. the Red one was about 3-4 inces away from the moon and the other 2 were about 1-2 inches away..I didn't think much of it right away, but i looked around and there were no other stars in the sky so that got me curious. The objects were a long way away, almost like they were even with the moon..i scanned the sky again for other stars and still did not see any. The Red one seemed to move ever so slow, the the other two moved just a little, about this time my Son, who is in the Navy and is getting Married Saturday as he is on his way back off the coast of Iraq. he is stationed on board the U.S.S.

I asked him to take a look at the objects i saw, he first said they were stars, but after he saw them move a little he said , ""Dad, those are not stars, they are moving around, by this time the Red one was about 6 inches away in the 8 o'clock position Using the Moon as the 12 O'Clock position, the other 2 were about 3 inches away in the 5 pm and 7 pm position, they would move a little then stop, move a little then stop, about 7 mins into the sitings the red one took off super fast..the other two were now in the 6pm and 9 pm position, there they stopped for what appeared to be a couple of mins, then they moved again but with a little more speed, in about 2 more mins they both took off super fast and that was the last we saw of them. There was nothing else in the sky. I was a former Deputy sheriff, left there and went to work for the local Air Force base as a DOD worker and saw planes all the time at my work, i have never seen anything move in that type fashion and then leave in that speed..This is no joke and i would be interested in talking to any one that may have saw this that same day, this was New Years Eve, 12-31-2003.

The witness is a 57 YOA female resident of Duluth Georgia, employed by an internationally famous Atlanta area university. Witness is from a ""scientific"" family, her father being involved in atomic research during the WW II era.   On 7Jan04 at about 7:30PM, witness was enroute home, driving through her neighborhood. The witness indicated she had been enjoying the beautiful weather and full moon and as she prepared to turn onto her street she noticed overhead a set of bright lights beginning to glide past. She added that she was caught off guard by this, and upon looking closer noticed that the lights were attached to the bottom of a LARGE DARK TRIANGULAR CRAFT (WUFOD ""Actual Size"" data field entry indicating 101-300 feet).   She continued watching, then turned onto her street, keeping it in sight. Witness' stated that her first impression was a LARGE ""stealth type"" craft. She described the craft as being VERY LOW in altitude (treetop), with no sound noticed (vehicle windows rolled up). Witness indicated that it was low enough that she had no trouble observing a ""suction cup"" like configuration around the steady white lights, one in the middle and also one on each corner, totalling four. At that point, it was traveling parallel to her and a little bit ahead (appx. 40mph). She sped up, but it appeared to be going a bit faster than her vehicle. The craft then began to ascend, it banked slightly to the left, and departed the scene. Simultaneous to the above, the witness was attempting to get out her cell phone in order to summon her friend to run outside and look skyward, but the phone was dropped onto the floorboard. She noticed two neighbors outside at the end of the street and intends on speaking with them ASAP. Within a few minutes, the witness arrived home and called the local police, Atlanta's Channel 11 (NBC) and Atlanta's Fernbank Science Center........all to no avail, as they had no information or additional reports.   As with all such preliminary reports carried in ""MUFONGA Updates"", this case requires additional scrutiny in order to vet the witness and attempt to determine the cause. This witness has agreed to a sit-down with our investigators and the case is in the process of being assigned to SSD/FI David Brown of Norcross.   David Brown, MUFONGA's State Section for the NE area of the greater metro Atlanta area, did in fact contact this witness.  She agreed to meet with him on 10Jan04 to complete the paperwork, make a statement, and provide a sketch of what was observed.  David found the witness was indeed employed in a managerial position on the staff of a world renowned Atlanta area university. Said facility having a history of close association and participation in technical government projects and various scientific disciplines. Witness was ascertained to be a well educated person, and seemed to be very concise and observant. She repeated her account in person to David and during this detailed debriefing, added additional details as to what occurred.  The duration of the event was about 5 minutes, occurring as the witness drove through her neighborhood, made a few turns, and all the while keeping the object in view.  It dissappeared for a  brief few moments, but the terrain and direction of travel brought it back into clear view.  She added that it was just over the treetops, which was determined by FI Brown to be flying at about 150 feet in altitude. Shortly before it banked and departed the area, she got a good view of the underside.  The witness stated to David Brown that there was a LARGE ROUND white light at each corner and one in the center, seemingly like FLOURESCENT TUBES, with a surrounding structure that made them appear like ""SUCTION CUPS"".  While the triangle was dark, it did seem to be of the gray shade (it was that close and well lighted).  She noticed no sound, but her windows were up and the radio  playing. Weather was clear, about 35 degrees, calm, CAVU.   FI Brown's follow-up included contacting the Police Department which verified that she had called to report the event, but that no officer was dispatched. Atlanta's Channel 11 (NBC) did not refer any other witnesses to MUFONGA during that time frame, nor were any concurrent similar events reported directly to this SD.  FI Brown also spoke with PIO personnel at Dobbins AFB which is about 25 miles west of the event location, also authorities at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. They provided no information.   MUFONGA has considered in this case, a fly-over of the much discussed/rumored experimental government ""lighter than air"" craft. No blazing speed or incredible manuevers were reported in this event.......BUT......why would such a ""legitimate"" (though possibly experimental) aircraft be flying at treetop level over a densely populated area at night?  Crew training?  Equipment testing? Operational/navigation training?  After reviewing FI Brown's investigation, this writer is of the opinion that this craft was yet another of the mysterious triangles as reported from all over the USA and Georgia (See NUFORC reports sorted by craft shape).   Please note that the witness in this case was found to be VERY CREDIBLE, requesting to remain anonymous due to the  sensitive nature of her position and occupation.   We've classified this craft as an official ""UNKNOWN"" in MUFON's WUFOD (World UFO Database).   This writer and the rest of MUFON of Georgia wish to take this opportunity to thank Peter Davenport and the NUFORC for continuing to provide this additional database for use by the Georgia chapter (and others) in it's continuing investigation and research.

It was small and hard to determine the altidude. It seemed to drift slowly to the south then to the south east. The object appeared to be small and round. It seemed to wobble or spin. It flashed a firey red light at an irregular interval. Sometimes the light was quick and dim. Other times it seemed to flare up. As it slowly drifted over the building I lost sight of it an so left my office to go downstairs to see if I could catch it on the other side of the building. When I came outside and looked around it was gone. However at the same time I looked south and saw a single military aircraft moving untypically fast from the direction of Ellington Field an moving WNW. It seemed to be 3-5 miles to the south. The plane then went west and I think did a U-turn back toward the east. I would note however that President Bush is in town tonight for a fund raiser. That's it. I don't know what it was. It was NOT a plane or helicopter. It seems like it could possibly heve been a baloon of some kind but the flashing was wierd - unless it has an irregular surface that was ""spinning"" and possibly reflecting light from the sunset in the west. Plausible - but I just can't say. It was certainly unusual enough to get and hold my attention. I took 3 digital photos but they don't show much more than a small reddish dot.

It was a very clear night and i could see all the stars very distant though and the moon which was very bright that night, when this very very bright light caught my attention in the sky and i first thought it might have been a plane (as i see planes out of my window all the time because heathrow airport is only a couple of miles from my house which is the busiest international airport in the world) or an extremely bright unusual star because it seemed so low not more than 10,000 feet probably as my guess becuase i could see planes flying over this object, this was very weird!! so i focused my attention on this orb (for want of a better word) anyway all of a sudden it starts moving left and right and up and down dimming and coming back to full strength in brightness which would make you squint it was so bright, thats when i absoluteley cringed in fright i sat up in bed and my heart was in my mouth i could not beleive what i was seeing. i have seen a lot of shows on these things and beleive in them having witnessed another sighting in 1995 in seattle. but this sighting lasted for four nights i could not sleep a wink that is the truth this was witnessed by two other people on the following nights to back up my story cause i thought i must have been seeing things but when it came back for 3 more nights this is more than proof of these objects. the thing is that this was so low and there were no clouds in the sky heathrow radar and other people must have picked this up and seen it i just hope that they get in touch with mr davenport at nuforc i will keep a look out for this this things and see if it comes back but believe me watch the sky's these things are real and quite frightning when you do not know what there intentions are, i will keep you informed.

He said, ""Get up and go look up into the sky.""  My roommate, who was laying on a futon stretched out in the living with his head facing the window, sounded calm but I heard a sense of urgency in his voice. It scared me. I stumbled towards the third floor window of my downtown Seattle apartment overlooking the Westin Hotel.  For some reason, I was unable to stand up, so I kneeled at the windowsill, and looked up into the sky.  I immediately saw 3 shiny, round white blobs of light darting around in very erratic patterns above Elliott Bay.  As I was watching, my roommate said in an equally sickly calm voice, ""I have been in the military for over 20 years, and nothing, nothing we have can make those moves.""  Then he rolled slightly on his side, smiled, closed his eyes and started snoring. Within about 4 minutes of his passing out, I remember stumbling about 3 feet towards the couch and nothing after that.  The objects were shiny, white, and flying slightly lower than cloud level.  I had some difficulty focusing on them. In the distance they looked to be about the size of a Volkswagen beetle.  The most remarkable aspect of these objects was their flying patterns, which defied gravity.  Each of the three objects I observed were moving in straight lines and then quickly shooting off at right angles very, very fast. Much faster than I have ever seen anything mechanical move. I don’t see how a human body could take that kind of movement.  They also moved in close proximity to each other, which appeared equally as dangerous.  Their flying pattern reminded me of fireflies, and it looked they were playing in the clouds.  I can only say this is not something I have ever witnessed before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had an awning that would roll down to protect the glass door.  It was rolled down and I was going to beat on it to scare them in the living room.

So I started pushing on the awning a little to see if anyone would notice when I realized it was getting brighter outside.

IT ""READ"" ME AND HID ITSELF What my grandma and I saw was unbelievable. The whole experience took anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. It was late at night, like about 1:30 am, in 1999 (Im not 100% sure of the year, or date, though). We lived (myself and the family still does) in a one-bedroom apartment. The windows are facing the back yard and an abandoned building.But if you look out of the window, to the right, you can see a crack which lets you see the buildings further down the block and a few blocks thereafter.  That night my grandma came over so I gave up my living room bed and slept on the couch. Well anyways, granny wanted to go to sleep so I turned off the lights. As I was heading to sleep, I passed the window and noticed a bright, strange-looking white light hovering above one of the apartment buildings further down the block. There wasn't much room to see it but I noticed it for the sole reason that it was so BRIGHT. At first I figured it was some crazily helicopter but it was absolutely silent, and it was so dark out that I could not see the structure of the object other than its light(s). As I came closer to the window I noticed that the light had a narrow but bright,white line (like a beam) coming down from it to the roof of the building and right on top of the roof, this line was connected to something rotating on the roof in a circular motion. I couldn't tell what it was, but I could certainly tell that it was rotating extremly fast and voilently. Right about then I was thinking UFO. After about 5 minutes of glaring at the object(s)I went to find my binoculars so I could take a better look but I had no luck as everyone was sleeping; Then I woke up my grandma, who was almost asleep and told her to take a look at this unbelievable thing. Granny wanted to turn on the light so she could see it better but that didn't help, so I turned the light back off. Right after, the object's narrow, bright line swooped to our window and shined a light directly at us through our window for about 3-5 seconds. It felt like a helicopter shining its light at somebody on the street except it was at least 1/7th to 1/8th (a guess) of a mile away, much too far. Imagine a giant searchlight on the roof of a 5 story building shining at you directly through your window. I guess that meant that it could probably tell that we were observing it because of the light switching. Well anyways, it felt like the light was ""reading"" me. I was scared like hell and my hands started to shake. Right after, the narrow line came back to initial p! osition and, along with the rotating object(s)appeared to have moved from the roof and into the bright light on top of them. Suddenly, the light slowly dissappeared behind the building and I never saw it again.  By the way, it was very possible for other people in my building to see this, but most of them were probably asleep. And, oh yeah; One of my friends from high school tried to make me promise to never tell this experience to anyone ever again after I told it to him (we are not friends anymore). Who knows why he asked me, but the fact that someone like that seriously told me never to give this info away is crazy. I HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SAY WHATS ON MY MIND. Thank you for listening to my story. Please respond. I really want to know more about this strange occurence.",2004-01-31T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The following is from mysent email dated 111401.  “I have two purposes in writing. First, to describe my own sightings of some of these ‘fireballs’ in the north central California area in late fall early winter 1999/2000. I did not record the events other than mentally. At that time I was driving truck on a weekly run from Portland OR to southern California. ...  The first of my fireball sightings occurred as I was northbound on I5, about half way between the Weed airport and Yreka, in northern CA. It was between mid Oct and mid Nov. It could have been on a Tues or Thur night, but was most likely Wed night. I do not recall the exact time, but did make a mental note of the time. I think it was between 2300 and 0100 Pacific Coast Time (GMT –8). It was a large green pulsing fireball that was emitting golden sparks. Relative size to me was most likely slightly over two inches in diameter. I used objects in near field vision within and on the truck, and middle field vision along the freeway as references. Horizontal vector distance was most likely much less than 20 miles from me, based on the distance to hills on the western edge of this relatively North/South valley. The golden sparks were associated (possibly not emitted) with it on the sides and backside of its traverse. None of the golden sparks moved downward toward the earth so were most likely not influenced by earth’s gravitation or else the sparks extinguished quickly enough so as to appear to not be influenced by earth’s gravitational field. I have seen several greenish and other colored meteorite fire trails one of which lit up the sky and exploded over the San Antonio Texas area in 1967 when I was stationed there in the Army. This was definitely not a meteorite. I rolled down my window to listen and observe directly. It was soundless and left no after image of light in the sky or on my retina, nor any light streak, as do most meteor trails. In the ‘tail’ area, somewhat obscured by the golden sparks, were several (I think I remember counting either three or four) smaller objects. Each of these objects was approximately ¼ inch relative diameter with one larger than the others. When I first noticed the small objects they appeared to be slightly not in exact formation with the larger object. I observed them to maneuver independently into an exact single line path following in the path of the larger object. For! the res t of my observation, these objects appeared to follow and maintain an exact distance from each other and the larger object. In color, they appeared to vacillate slightly with the predominate frequency being a yellow-gold different from and paler than the golden sparks. The frequency shift ranged between reddish and bluish around the periphery of the entirety of each object with enough transparency to note the predominant central yellow-gold. Because of the pattern, flight path, and general and specific appearance, at that time I believed them to be manufactured objects (this includes manufactured plasma balls) under some kind of either external or internal control. The direction was roughly slightly east of south, but possibly south by southeast. The track seemed to be parallel to an average altitude above the earth. I observed them as they appeared from over the hills to the north of me until I could no longer see them as they passed out of my field of view as limited by my direction of travel and position in the truck. They could have been visible for as long as 30 seconds. Time is relative and subjective and even more so in situations such as this. I think they were at quite low altitude because during part of the observation they appeared between me and the hills to my west. I was listening to the Art Bell radio talk show at the time and tried several times to call in on my cell phone, but never got through. Others were calling in to the Art Bell program with incident reports. The objects were seen from at least as far north as Portland OR. It was reported that jets were scrambled from a National Guard station at Beaverton OR airport, but never caught up to the objects. Observers reported that somewhere over central CA the fireballs made an orderly sharp-angled turn to the east toward Nevada. I vaguely remember hearing another day that they disappeared or ‘exploded’ somewhere over Nevada.  On two or three Sunday evenings or nights sometime between then and early March 2000 I observed similar greenish fireballs coming from relatively west southwest of my position as I was southbound on I5 within 100 miles north of Sacramento and 50 miles south of Sacramento. These incidents each occurred between 2100 and 0200. On one occasion I saw three fireballs on the same relative directional track, each within one to five minutes of each other. I saw no golden sparks or other small objects during any of these observations. Each of them appeared to be relative size approximately half or less of the Oct/Nov object, and much further distant. My observation period was very short as they traveled quickly from the western horizon over my head toward NV. I remember hearing later of one report from a woman someplace in Castro Valley CA reporting a similar observation but do not know if it could have been the same as one of my sightings.   I am certified in NLP and Clinical Hypnotherapy and was in practice for a few years. Part of NLP is about learning to be a good observer and make fine distinctions. I am also a snowboard instructor and used to climb a bit, both of which provide good perspective on outdoor distance and orientation.",2004-01-31T00:00:00,41.5109,-122.3648

At about 8:30 I went outside my home to take a bag to the trash.  I saw overhead what caught my eye as a flash of bright light that appeared to be at first directly above my house.  (Standing on the porch it was directly overhead when it came it's stopping/ reversing point at that side of it's pattern.)  Looking up, i saw that the object was actually moving in a kind of back and forth motion over head, so that it looked like it was making a zig-zaging pattern, appearing to be very close overhead above the treetops. It was moving quickly, coming to a stop then making very sharp reversals above so that it seemed to appear and disspear as it moved out of sight beyound what I could see over the roof.  (Hence the ""flash"" impression that caught my eye).  The object above the lights was dark and hard to see because the lights  were clustered on the bottom that were very bright.  The lights themselves were green, blue white and red in a cluster pattern appearing to be underneath the object. I was not able to see above the lights other than an impression of a shadow, above the lights but I was not able to tell the shape of it.   Mr Davenport asked for a comparision to the full moon in size and I believe that though there was not a full moon here tonight, this would have obscured it if it has passed in front.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  It appeared to me to be much lower than a normal aircraft would be, appearing to be not much higher than the tops of the elm trees along the edge of the fence.  The object appeared to be moving back and forth quickly and would disappear from view beyond the roof of the house and then reappear because of it’s flight pattern.  This went on for a few minutes.  I lost the object when I went inside to get my camera; when I came back outdoors the object was not visible.  In terms of other conditions, here it was about  20 F outside, and quite clear with many stars visible.  After watching for a few minutes to see if the object would reappear I returned to the house and found my 3 cats VERY excited and agitated though I couldn’t see anything inside that would have caused them to be. (there were very calm and behaving normally beforehand) I heard no noise at all. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we were impressed with both her, and her report!

It was around 1:20 AM, when for some apparent reason, I decided to turn my head slightly to the left, and I noticed a Green ""Flame"" traveling downwards towards the Earth. It seemed like an eternity, but it lasted for about 3-5 seconds. It was not zipping by, but it was not floating either, it simply looked as though it was falling down from the sky. It had a very slight trail behind it, the same color as itself. It seemed close, but it wasn't huge, and it wasn't small, at least from the brightness aspect. I lost sight of it after it went behind the trees, and it went out of my field of view. I related it as looking most like a Firework ""Dud"" falling back down. It was so brilliant. I don't recollect hearing any noise though. I talked to a NASA Astronomer however, and my second assumption seems to fit best. It was a Meteor/Meteorid in my view. I was so shocked though, simply because I didn't know they came in such fantastic colors. I always thought of them as being Yellow/Orange/Red. According to the Astronomer, it was made up of Nickel. Nickel apparently burns in a Green Color when mixed with Oxygen, and a little Nitrogen, or better put, the Atmosphere. I completely believe it to have been a Meteor/Meteorid. I live in a populated area, with 100,000+ people within a 5-7 mile circle of myself.

One was about a dark-colored form changing parachute-like (not the round kind but the more oblong or oval ones) and the other a brownish jelly-fish like one that appeared to be ""swimming"".  The one I saw, I at first thought to be a orangish brown tarp or plastic sheet or trash bag that had been blown up into the wind and was just blowing along while slowing undulating or changing shape as though made of a very light material.  And it very steadily traveled in its general direction, from north to south over the Isthmus/Willy St. area. (Unfortunately I did not think to check if it was actually going with the prevailing wind - though I do remember there being only a light wind that day.) It did not radically change shapes or take on any definite common shapes, but just stayed generally oblong (like the ""parachute"" story). The sky was clear and it was a around sunset so the object was fairly well lit.  However I had hard time focusing on it.  Sound-wise I heard nothing from it and the neighborhood was quiet.

I watched it for about ten seconds then it became obscured behind tree branches so I walked down the block about 40 ft to a clear view.

On New Years Eve I was sitting in my kitchen looking west/left towards S.A. Mts. Both my girlfriend and I saw 4-5 objects huvering just over the mtn top, they would all (one by one or 1-2 at a time) ""shoot"" straight up several thousand feet, huver for a while dissappear for a while, re-appear sometimes much higher approx 15k ft., other times just over the mtn. top. they all had strange light formations mostly bright, but dimming periodocaly or lights sudenly tuning off. I was able to keep a pretty good eye on them with my binnoculars. was unable to see much of a formation do to it being at night, their lights gave too much of a glare. when lights off they looked like the eagle on the back of a silver dollar with a string out the bottom. almost like a kite string. the next day New Years day at approx. 2-4 pm the same objects appeared and when I looked with my binnoculars they defineately looked like the eagle. the color they gave off was like that of an old motor cycle tail pipe, goldish blues, then grey, and almost incadescent at times. the string on the bottom appeared to be a jet stream or exhaust about the same length as the craft. They (3-4) flew the same way as the night before. huvering, ""shooting straight up, floating side to side while perpindicular (slow 360's) then turning the other way. this lasted for approx. 1 hour, somewhere between  2pm & 4pm. since then i have seen similar objects several times usually late at night. I have also noticed a sincere increase in military aircraft for approx 2 months now. prior to last Oct-Nov. there were rarely any aircrafts flying over head. (El Toro air base happens to be directly behind the sightings) If it is closed? aprox 2 weeks ago in he middle of the week around 2pm an aircraft traveling approx 4-5K mph,(based on fighter jets that go overhead at 1.5k mph?) went overhead it looked similar to the space shuttle without any wings and was white or silverish. since 1-1-04 i leave my binnoculars out, this is reason i was able to see this aircraft. after it passed overhead, the turbulnce caused the middle of the lake to raise up in a circular fashion as like a round wave approx 10' diameter, then it became a wall type wave approx. 20'-30'long for a brief moment and turned into a whirlpool about 10 diameter. it was by far the fastest aircraft i have ever seen. 2-3 days after that for two consecutive days there were at least 20 rocket trails in the evening. the first night they were from the south towards Mira Mar? the second evening north/west towards LA. the day i saw the super fast object no trails were in the sky.

Many of them centre around Dublin Airport, with one report exclusively described to the Fingal Independent by the UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), an organisation that monitors the skies of Ireland in search of strange and unexplained ‘aerial phenomena’. Late last year, the organisation received a report from the co-pilot of an airbus who said he had seen an unidentified ‘red disc’ flying in Irish skies after the co-pilot’s flight had taken off from Dublin Airport. With what the crew said was ‘phenomenal speed that no aircraft could perform,’ the disc shot vertically upwards and disappeared from sight at 7,000ft Twenty seven minutes later, the crew say they overheard a KLM pilot radioing air traffic control at Dublin Airport with a similar report. The Irish Aviation Authority checked flight logs for the reported date at both Dublin and Shannon airports but found nothing unusual while a spokesperson from the Pilot’s Association said that none of its members has ever expressed concern over unidentified flying objects in the skies around Dublin Airport. There have been a number of other incidents, equally as mysterious. One former local aviation writer contacted by the Fingal Independent stated that he did not believe in the whole UFO thing or rarely heard reports of any strange incidents but was the victim of one such experience more than 20 years ago. Liam Byrne was living in River Valley Heights in Swords and, being a keen ‘plane spotter’ was following one 747 across the sky when a strange, bright star appeared within five miles of the aircraft. ‘It was a beautiful day and there was not a cloud in the sky. Suddenly, I saw this bright star and I watched it for a couple of minutes. Then it darted right overhead and within half a minute shot southwards towards the Wicklow Hills. I would say it travelled about 30/40 miles in less than two seconds.’ ‘I knew people working in the tower at Dublin Airport and I rang them but they didn’t have any record of what it was. I have never been able to figure it out to this day.’ Mystery still surrounds an incident last September when a garda helicopter was called out to investigate an unidentified flying object over Dublin Airport which resembled a paraglider. When asked if that was possible the Irish Paragliding Association stated that ‘no one in their right mind would paraglide around the airport.’",2004-02-12T00:00:00,,

As he made a north turn to the gravel road that led to my mother's house he noticed that the craft was about less than a 1/4 mile in front of him and flying pretty low just above the treeline.  As he got closer he rolled down his car window and to his surprise the craft did not have any type of engine noise to it and it was just sitting up in the air not moving at all.  There was at least 3 lights on it.  One was blinking toward the NE about the size of a flashlight and another one on the opposit side that was just steady but a little brighter.  There was another steady light in the center of the other two lights.  Againts the skyline, my husband could only make out an oval shape craft about 25 ft. across and had dome-shaped top.  Realizing that he must be the only one witnessing this he sped to my mother's house to pick me up, which was only a few seconds away, but the craft was already gone by the time we got back to sighting.

I thought it may be a very low flying plane, but the light was odd.  It was VERY bright and clear, like the headlamp of an approaching motorcycle, or train, until it seemed to change direction taking on a clear bright light, a red light, and either a blue or green light.  It appeared to form a wedge-like shape, until it changed again to something that seemed more cylindrical. I  was stopped at the intersection while the traffic light was red, and then kept my eyes on it as I crossed the intersection to visit a local business. I lost it as I pulled into the pharmacy.  The initial bright light seemed VERY close, yet I heard no relative sounds.  The light seemed to move rather randomly and quickly.

Creston, British Columbia  Date:  November 25, 2003 Time:  approx: 9:20 p.m.  Two men driving from Creston, British Columbia along highway 3 heading west towards Fruitvale, B.C. saw briefly a number of bluish lights off into the distance, heading east towards their direction at a very low altitude. As they drew closer, the lights seemed to spread out and all of a sudden and all of the blue lights blinked out approx: one mile in front of them. The two men thought was rather strange as they had never witnessed anything like this before. The witnesses could not make out any type of shape, or structure as everything took place rather quickly. Mind you they both mentioned that there may not have been any body to the lights. It wasn't until the fellows were at junction (highway #3 and #6) did they wonder where approx 25 kilometers.  Both men sat stunned, the driver pulled the car to the side of the road and the two guys just sat and looked at one another for a couple of seconds, then starred out the front windshield not saying a word to one another. Finally after a few minutes of silence the passenger turned to the driver and asked what the heck just happened and how did we get to the junction when they knew they still had a large number of kilometers to travel.  The passenger then noticed a trickle of blood running down from the drivers right nostril which alarmed him to know end. The driver used his hand to wipe around his nose area and then found blood on his hand, be started to panic due to all this strange things that just took place. Immediately the driver put the vehicle in gear and started traveling north on Highway #6 towards Samo picking up speed as they drove along. The evening was very cool outside, but inside the vehicle it was rather warm. With both men shivering with coldness (from fright and a possible experience) the passenger turned the heaters temperature up to high and both of the fellows were still not able to get warm and comfortable. Very frightened, cold and an over whelming thrust coming on they traveled along almost in shock.  After traveling a good distance to their destination which was Fruitvale, B.C., they arrived at a family members home, got out of the vehicle and as they walked up the sidewalk to the door, the diver broke down. His friend told me his nerves were shot at this point.  A family member had seen the vehicle and the fellows pull into the driveway I was going out to greet them both when she saw her loved one bent over crying hysterically. She yelled out loudly and two other people in the home ran out to lend a hand with the man. The family was very upset as you can imagine and questioned the men to find out what was wrong, not imagining what they were about to hear. After some time a hot bath everyone settled in for the night.  Both men trying their darnest to get some sleep, which wasn't easy after what just happened, finally they dropped off only to start having vivid dreams. One of the fellows remembers being in an object. He did not know exactly what it was. But in his dream he did believe it was a room of some type. So I am trying to work with him to see if he can remember any thing else.  Case ongoing.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

Now I was about a mile out from route 93 (where the helicopter's hover near boston, and about 12 miles outside of Boston itself).  At that point I noticed a blue/green object stopped behind the treeline in the far distance. I thought nothing of it really (though why I don't know cause the thing was blue/green) cause I just figured it was a plane taking off facing me.  When I came back I looked up and saw two commercial airplanes in the air to the south and strangely enough, a jet leaving a smoke trail directly overhead. Then I noticed the blue green object had started to move in a direction it couldn't possibly have moved.  It was huge, looked to be a weird top heavy shape with a round, thinner, bottome. It was flashing white and red lights. Immediately I started comparing it. It was moving incredibly fast (passing my line of vision over the horizon every 5- 10 seconds). I started to doubt it was a plane (no plane would ever fly that low) and by now was pretty freaked out because I realized I was the only one seeing this and even contemplated knocking on someone's door to get a confirmation.  This thing was viewable from where I was for about 5 minutes (the view on old farm road is massive), and then it fell out of the viewable horizon.   I thought it could have been a helicopter, but I don't think helicopter's are A) completely silent, and B) Glowing blue/green.

This part of Oregon is one of the most isolated places in the United States.  There weren't any lights and the sky was clear, so you could really see the milky way going across the sky.  I was the only one on the highway at that time and my partner was in the truck sleeper.  I looked in my rear view mirror and saw another semi truck coming up fast behind me.  I thought he would pass me but when he got up behind me he slowed down really fast and started yelling to me on his CB radio about lights in the sky.  He wanted to know if I had seen the lights in the sky to the left (east).  I told him that I hadn't seen the lights but that I would keep my eyes open for them.  I could tell that something was wrong because you could hear he was afraid of something in his voice.  We traveled down Hwy 95 for about three minutes when he started yelling again about lights to the left of us in the sky.  I looked out my left window and saw two large round lights sitting side by side in the sky.  I could see the outline of the hills and the lights were about 45 degrees up.  They were a yellowish white and not moving at all.  At this point I slowed my truck down and watched the lights for about 10 seconds when, all of a sudden, no other way to explain it, like from the movie Close Encounters, below the two top lights the bottom row came on.  The lights started coming on from the left to the right, then started all over again.  As one light came on, about the third light back would go off.  There were always three lights going across from left to right.  These lights were the same color as the two top lights but were shaped like beer cans.  When the bottom row of lights came on, I yelled at my partner to get up and see this.  The top and bottom row of lights stayed on together about 10-15 seconds, then all the lights went out.  There was a turnout on the highway so we pulled both trucks off the road and the three of us got out and for about 40 minutes, the three of us watched the sky but the lights never came back on.  One thing we noticed was was only one cloud in the sky and it was a clack cloud that was in the area of the lights.  There was a strong wind blowing but the cloud never moved.  When were were looking at the lights you could tell they were hooked to a structure.  The structure was very large, dead still in the sky.  With your thumb at arm's length, it would cover about 1/2 of the lights.  I would say it was disk shaped by the way the light looked.  I heard the military took pictures of it and was on the news.  I am a retired deputy sheriff and have studied astronomy all my life.  What I/we saw that night was not one of ours.  This is the first chance I've had to report this to you.",2003-12-19T00:00:00,42.9694,-117.3667

However, the ball of fire was much larger than a balloons would be at the close distance, it was moving much faster than a balloon but not fast enough to be an aircraft; that was also a consideration beacuse there is also a small airport in the area.  We watched it move at a steady speed in a straight path across the sky, right to left,(Mars being on the right)and then it looked like it shrunk and dissapeared. We took 2 or three pictures on a disposable camera but as of yet have not had it developed.  I figure it won't look like much.  The next morning I called that area airport to make sure that any aircraft in the air at night should have the blinking lights (which he said yes) and to see if hot air balloons were allowed up at night (which he said no).  I then asked him if he had any reports of anyone seeing anything in the sky last night (which he said no).

I noticed a white, completely perfect round sphere going in a  northerly direction. It was definatly NOT a balloon. There was no string attached and it was perfectly round, as balloons are not.  It stayed at a constant speed and was completely unaffected by wind currents. It may have been going about 30-50km./hr. It stayed at the exact same height. I watched it until it disappeared out of sight. I felt like it may have been following along main street, however it may not have been. It was also difficult to tell the size at that distance, but it may have been larger that a beach ball. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Has anyone else mentioned this to you?

They moved at a rather slow pace considering.  Within their formation they seemed to be moving independently as well, in an erratic, but quick short manner.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen.  They were circular, and they glowed, with a luminous type light. They were moving with a motive.  I was mesmerized and then my fiancée said look, there are three more. They were following the first two lights.  They seemed to be in formation as well, never leaving their positions.  Within their position they seemed to be formation with the first two, but ""zig zagging in the same erratic way.

We didn't see any type of shadow or background behind the lights to suggest space ship.  But it was unlike anything any of us have ever seen.

We are all very well educated, in addition to group and individual continuous education. We  all believe in the evolution of intelligence. Two of us have had previous experiences and sightings.  Since this experience we have shared with many, and have been told amazing stories as well.  Each experience shared with us has had one thing in common, and that is the fact they never shared their experience with anyone else. They kept q! uite, until now. We waited outside in anticipation of seeing additional sightings. We all kept saying the same thing, "" what the hell was that"", over and over again. All of us agreeing, it was not of this planet. All of us in amazement, but at the same time, fearful. My neighborhood is filled with military families, of all types. I am informing you of this because of what followed about 30-40 minutes later. A very big, military helicopter began flying above the area we last saw the ""UFO's.  And it was definitely military. It was huge.  It was long and with very few lights, except for in the back.  It was searching for something in the sky, because it did not use a spot light.  They looked like the black hawk down helicopter.  It began searching in a circular manner, and slowly widened the diameter of it's area, as well as gradually inclining.  If I had to guess, I would say it searched for about 45 minutes to an hour.  In a distance we could hear an additional helicopter.  Our view was blocked by our limited view, we were on the back deck.  WE didn't feel anything a far as energy, or  the climate nor the sky. Our bodies nor our minds were altered. It was simply amazing!  We all discussed it, and continue to do so.  We all had the same thought as we watched.

I was trying to think of what these lights were, my friend was really having a good look too - I asked him what he was looking at, he replied, lights - I don't know. We pulled over the side of the road and pulled the sun roof back; by this time we noticed that these objects were not lights but some type of craft that were now alongside each other slowly hovering above us, they looked quite large and a glistening orange colour, we stopped the car engine to see if we could here something. These craft made no sound at all, they weren't far from us and were obviously having no concern of being seen as they were quite easily located and noticeable. My 15 yr old daughter and her friend were very excited about it, my friend and I were simply trying to identify what type of craft these could be, though unable to come up with anything. After a good 10 minutes of the craft hovering above our area and slowly moving North, one of the craft made a 90 deg turn to the left and proceeded to fly West / inland. We watched in amazement as they got further away; I then remembered to quickly grab my camera from the car and take a couple of photos, though they were quite a distance away by then. My camera is only a cheap digital camera though one of the photos has succeeded; though I am unsure if the craft took off quickly - or I moved when taking the photo as the light looks like a serated line on a black night sky - it doesn't look a very convincing photo to me, though - not being of any interest of UFO's or there reports in the past, I certainly have changed my attitude on what is seen in our skys; these were inexplicable craft. As we all hopped in the car to go, the street light which we were parked under suddenly went out for about 1 minute before coming back on again; wether this had any significance to the craft, we dont know. I phoned the Williamstown RAAF Base (about 20 mins drive) the next morning to ask if th! ere were any domestic or military craft in this area at that time, there response was no, and they gave me a phone number for reporting sightings to.

I remember that specifically. Victorville is 30 miles SE of Edwards AFB. While laying on the patio with my dog watching the thunderheads blowing to the NNE I noticed a dark grey, sometimes shiny object bobbing in and out of the clouds to the NW. It was stationary relative to my patio eaves so I could see it was not moving with the clouds. It was bobbing.  It was stationary relative to its position over the ground, but lost and gained altitude. Here's the cool thing. Since I am a geological engineer, I know directions, relative velocities, etc., etc. I have vision so good at that time it was better than 20/10. Anyhow, I could see this object  would have been flying near and over the SE part of Edwards AFB, which is not inhabited. Here it was in BROAD DAYLIGHT!  So I got my binoculars (15 power) and was stunned to see a saturn shaped metal obect making gyroscopic manuevers in place. It was almost at the top of the thunderheads (the top of them being probably about 45,000 feet).  The object turned on its side with the flat side toward me and I could see it was round with the profile being saturned shaped. Like that famous UFO photo that those goes took in South America decades ago. It had a black circumscribed ring in the bottom. Then, I noticed 3, then 4, little wispy ""blobs"" flying around it and seeming to merge with it and also fade in and out! Since the sky was crystal clear (due to the strong jet stream wind.  This thing just stayed there for about 3 hours spinning (apparently), then turning verically, then sideways, etc. like it had no particular preference for what direction was considered level relative to the ground.  The wispy blobs (slightly rectangular) seemed to have some kind of light energy coming out of them. As the orbs bobbed around the object they would ""smear"" themselves. Like when you move a candle and looke at it from a distance in a dark room.  An Southwest Airlines (?) airliner flew on its designated flightline (maybe about 35,000 feet AGL) below the object which was about 40,000 feet. I could not believe the airliner pilots did not see this or that this flying saucer and companions did not fly away.  Relative to the jetliner this think would have multiple times the size of the jet. I'd say at least 6 times the length of the jetliner. Keep in mind I saw all this in binoculars very clearly.  Finally, I looked for my instamatic camera and it had two pictures left. This camera did not have a zoom unfortunately.  I took two pictures. Eventually, the clouds thickened and I could no longer see the object and its campaions again. The whole sighting was about 2 hours.  When my wife came home I  told her about it and she did not believe me. Well, I developed the pictures and you can see the object in the photos but it is real small.  I ran the photos through Photoshop to see if I could pull up some detail and you can see it looks similar to a toy top and you can see the blobs which appear to be more like rectangles.

It has been a few years since the event, but it still sticks out in my mind and I don't think I'll ever forget it. We were on a week long camping trip in the BWCA, when on the fourth night, we were at a beautiful campsite with great fishing from shore, and I had decided to try my luck at some night fishing. So, I left my companions at the fire and walked down a small trail and onto the rock outcroppings on the shoreline, about 150 feet from the campsite. The stars were out and were brilliant. There was no wind and the water was dead calm. I started casting for a while, and after about 15 minutes I snagged my lure on a rock in the water. I tried getting it loose, but it wasn't working so just as I reached out to cut my line, something caught my eye above the trees on the opposite shoreline (which was about 1/4 mile away). I saw a bright bluish-white light rise up from the treeline very slowly for about 15 seconds. I just stood there looking at it in awe. If I had to guess at the size of it, I'd say it was as big as a bus, but I couldn't exactly tell the shape because of the blue glow around it. As it got further above the treeline, it stopped moving and just hovered for a few seconds. I yelled at my buddies, but they were too far away and busy talking around the fire. I kept my eyes on the light the whole time. It then started moving horizontally at about the same speed it had risen previously. It probably moved horizontally an eigth of a mile when all of the sudden, it shot off into the sky and out of sight faster than anything I'd ever seen move before in my life. The object made no sound/noise at all. I just dropped my fishing rod and ran back to camp, shaking and hardly able to spit out a sentence. When I finally calmed down and told my friends the story, they just joked about it and would not believe a word of it. None of us were drinking or had any sort of drugs, unless there was something weird in the fish we ate out of that lake (just kidding).  I am not making this up. I would never lie about something like this. I wish I could find out if anyone else was camping in the BWCA at the same time and might have seen the same thing, from a different lake or somewhere nearby. A year and a half later, I saw almost the exact same thing in the winter, but not in the BWCA. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-09-24T00:00:00,,

It was a sunny clear day,,i was out on the patio laying on a lounge chair and i happend to look up to a very clear blue sky,,,and saw a strange,,,oval silver object floating is best way i can describe this,,,,,it was floating fast from north to south,,,,,i watched it because i am out there all the time ,for twenty years or more and have never seen anything like this,,,it waw mesmerizing,,,,well i just told myself this must be a weather baloon, since i hadn't ever seen one before. The dates i have given are approximate,,it was during the last part of the ""clinton"" administration. The president was comming here to stay at a place called, ""Chautauqua Instution"", this is a place he had visited in the past as govenor. This was to be some kind of meeting with dignitaries, i am not sure of the excate reason for this visit. The president flew in a day or so before the first lady, and came in on ""air force one"" hellichopter. A day or two later, Hillary flew in. I was home that day,,,,,and as the chopper carrying the first lady flew towards my home,,,,i went outside,,,on my front walkway to try to get a look at it, as this is not something that normally happens. I saw the chopper , which was realy loud come into clear view,,,,,on another clear sky day,,,,not a cloud in the sky that day,,,so i could see this , and it was flying very low,,,what i saw next,,,,was what realy caught my attention,,,,,and i couldnt stop looking at this shiney silver,,,,orb,,flying directly above the 'air force one"" chopper, that is when i thought to myself,,,this couldnt possibly be a weather balloon as i had thought the first time i saw one of these in the sky. What realy bothered me,was that i would have thought that the air space in our area would have been closed , with the first lady and airforce one flying.  I went into the house,,,,,and i couldnt help but wonder,,,,,what in hell had i just seen. How is it possible, that something would be allowed to fly,,,this close,,,,to air force one. I thought about calling someone,,,but i didnt know who,,,so i let it go,,,thinking that ,,,i couldnt possibly be the only person to see this. Its just not possible. I never heard any reports on our news about anything seen by anyone that day. All i can say,,,,,,is that god as my witness,,,,i did see a sliver oval object flying with that chopper,, right over the first lady. If it werent for that, i think i would just ignore it,,,but i felt i had to say something to someone,,,the thought of this just doesnt totaly fade awa! y. I am sure that the dates i gave that are not excate, as i dont remember excately when it was,,,,but it was in the last part of his administration. I am sure that this date can be checked in the archives of our local news paper,"" the jamestown post journal"" I have to say,,,i said nothing for fear of being ridiculed,,,,this is not something that i realy belevied in. In all the years since,,,it has bothered me to not know if anyone else had reported this that day.

A huge triangular object at least two football fields in size suddenly appeared from the south above my house.  It was coming from the south direction near NORAD in Colo. Spgs.  It was Triangular in shape, and definitely had cloaking or stealth capability.  It was travelling at a slow rate of speed over my house, and following the I225 corridore parallel to Buckley AFB.  The whole interior of the craft was lighted when decloaked and I could see inside the craft as it passed me.  It had huge rectangular wing spars which may have been power sources or generators.  The control center at the front of the craft was all lighted.  As it was parallel to Buckley AFB (classified-Radar Domes)it started to cloak or go into a stealth mode and as it proceeded North and disappeared.  The amazing part, is Denver International Airport to the north uses this area as a holding pattern for commercial jets landing but, it did not seam to interfere with the Triangular UFO as it slowly moved along the interstate.

I don't remember the exact date but it was the night that the MOON WAS THE CLOSEST that it will be or has been in many, many years. In fact I think they had either Dr. Sky or one of those astronomers on the radio that night to speak about how the Moon was phonomenally close that night. I have a Red Pot Bellied Telescope that I bought from Edmonds Scientific so I pulled it out and decided to take a look. I set it up in the front yard and as the moon came up in the North East, I looked at it through the telescope. It was about 2/3rds of the way up the sky well above the neighbors trees. I am guessing about *;30pm or so because it was after dinner but the housekeeper had not left yet. Since I don't remember what season it was I can't really tell the time by the darkness, but I was cold, it may have been November or December, and it was definitely dark nighttime. While I was looking at it I suddenly saw several dark things go across the moon. It took less than a minute for them to cross the whole moon and I stared at them in amazement. It happened again maybe about 20 minutes later. I I didn't report it because I surmised that it must have been something close to the earth that came through my field of view. But they didn't flap like birds, but moved smoothly and all at the same time. When I saw them again they weren't in the same exact juxtaposition amongst themselves, but I still thought it might have been something close to earth, or perhaps satellites or something. But when this guy tonight said that because they were in focus they had to be close to the moon, I decided to report it because they were in sharp focus. Several dark shapes against the brightness of the moon. And just as the guy said on the radio tonight, they would have been about the size of a pea if the moon was the size of a beach ball. But the optics on my telescope did not reveal any spherical nature, they simply looked like flat dark round or oval shapes, not all the same size because I remember my first thought was like a Momma and some baby birds, but they didn't have wings or appendages nor did they appear to flap. Did anybody else report anything that night? I am sure millions of people must have been looking at the moon that night like I was. In fact that's another reason I didn't report it because I figured if there was something there, then somebody else with a stronger telescope than I had would have reported it.

At 5:13 that moonless night was walking out to get the mail... was facing the S/W sky.  I saw the sky was lighting up on the holizon... was as bright as if an atomic bomb had hit Atlanta 400 miles away... the light came towards me, and looking up saw that that were 2 clouds over my head and they were so fully charged with electrical energy you could see plasma like activity on the clouds.  The light in the sky continued to get brighter and wider till the whole sky was illuminated.  As the intensity increased i was able to look around and saw street lights turning off, and could view objects far away as if were high noon.  The light was not coming from any one location... rather the whole sky was as if suspended in cloud to cloud lightening.  The intensity after 15 secs was so bright -- that it was actually brighter than high noon on a sunny day.  The light was odd... made everything appear the wrong color.  Some pine trees near me appeared blue.... a blue shit was wearing had a green tint.. was like a the lighting a ""black lite"" gives... all had that odd tint to it.  Well 15 secs after the lighting had built to a peek saw moving across the sky at a VERY high rate of speed a cigar shape object...  the object appeared like something out of a 1950s B grade movie.  It had a metalic look to it... like a needle on the end.  It looked cheaply made .. but the speed was one of the fastest objects ever seen cross the sky and am aware this could have distorted my perception of the shape.  From the back appeared to be sparks like a fake spaceship would release in a B grade movie.  I lost site as the objected entered clouds behind me.  The sky remained illuminated for another say 10 secs. You could see the light receeding behind the object and vanishing back into the edge of the N.E. sky line.  About 5 mins later 3 fighter craft passed over and ! was obvious they were following the object and they vanished in the same area of the sky as this object had vanished towards slighly before.  The offical news report said the object was seen from Montgomery Al. to past Asheville N.C. by 1000's.  The offical news release went on to say that while hundreds of calls were made to police and sherrif's depts across the flight path, that it was believed to be a meterior.  While i saw no signs of any course correction... and as fast as the object was moving realize i cannot swear to the appearance... what has struck me odd all this time was a few things:  1.  The amount of EM energy that it would take to produce this much lighting. 2.  The lighting in the sky came BEFORE the object by at least 10 - 15 secs at the peek. 3.  Watching the clouds... the plasma moving on the edges was so odd.  4.  The craft was actually the least amazing part of the siting.  5.  Aircraft do not chase meteriors.  I wish i had been able to take EM / mag readings during the passover or gotten some video footage of the event.  If you are curious have the WLOS TV news coverage with some police officers talking about it on this night and how freaky it was.  I asked and never got a reasonable explanation to why the lighting came so long before the ~whatever it was~ and just how much energy it would take to excite what i assume is the ionasphere during this siting to be so bright for such a duration over so wide an area as this was seen.

Going back to the ranch we had to travel quite slow as these are gravel roads through thousands of acres of cattle/wheat/ect. and  my equip. could be damaged. There were no lights anywhere for miles other than the headlights.  As we came up a foothill rize, I saw 3 bright lights in the northern sky. I pointed them out to the young man and he freaked. ""Wow""!!! he said ""My good buddy and I saw lights like these last winter coming home from football practice"" We stoppe the truck, turned off the headlights and watched these 3 lights in the form of a triangle move through the sky from west to east... then stationary...then move.

They were climbing a small hill on Highway #16 just before Babine Forest Products when they both noticed a red ball of light a head of them, dropping on a slight angle from low in the sky. The witnesses said, the object, what ever it was seem to come down just on the other side of the hill they were climbing. Also what they found to be strange was just after they lost sight of the red ball of light behind the hill, all of a sudden at the crest of the grade, on the highway , the whole area was glowing a bright reddish color. They reported that the tops of the tress were also bathed in a reddish glow. From their vantage point they could not see anything as they had not arrived at the top of the hill. They were only a few hundred yards away from reaching the top and from this location they should have been able to see what was causing this reddish glow.  Just before they reached the top the light went out. The couple slowed down and kept their eyes open to maybe catch sight of it again somewhere just off the highway. But nothing could be observed. No vehicles were seen driving along the highway a head of them.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.

My Mother has told me this story twice with about a thirty year interval between the tellings.  I believe it was an experience that greatly impressed her and the story was substantially the same at both tellings.  When I was approximately 24 months old (born 1/16/52)my Mom and Dad and I lived in the two upstairs rooms of my grandparent's house in Virginia.  At that time the area was very rural.  My Mom said that she woke up one night after midnight and I was crying.  She was also aware of a loud buzzing sound like bees.  She went to the crib and tried to quiet me but was unsuccessful.  She began to become frightened and the noise was intensifying and hurt her ears.  She tried to awaken my father unsuccessfully.  She said that her thought was that the noise was coming from a UFO. (I guess they were often in the papers at that time.)  She thought of going to the window to look but was frightened and reports feeling they did not want her to look.  Eventually she picked me up and rocked me until the noise gradually faded.  When the noise stopped I stopped crying and, eventually she went back to sleep.  The next morning at breakfast she tried to tell the family about the experience but was ridiculed.  Nobody else heard anything. However, when the paper came that day the headline story was about UFOs over Washington.  The one thing that doesn't make sense to me is the date.  Apparently the date of the big DC sighting was July 1952 when I would have been only 6 months old.  I was in my early twenties the first time Mom told me about this.  It is possible she got the dates wrong or was confusing the Langly AFB chase, which I believe also made headlines with the Washington sightings. It also seems that the way she discribes my behavior, simply crying might be more characteristic of a very young baby that a two year old.  I spoke quite well by the time I was two.  In any case when Mom told me this story again this summer and was so consistent I thought it was worth recording. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,38.69152580645161,-77.20670322580645

Since I am facing west, they are initially spotted to my right (north) at about 140 degrees, and watched as they disappear to the left (south)at approximately 30 degrees. The elevation is some 35 degrees above the horizon. Requiring about 18 to 20 seconds to traverse the 110 degrees or so viewing field between the angles, and at an estimated altitude of at least 15,000 to 20,000 feet, their speed is great. There is no sound, no trails, no maneuvers--just straight, swift, purposeful flight.  The objects are round and flat (saucer shaped) and wobble as they fly--an action similar to that of a thrown tin-can lid. This wobbling behavior enables me to notice that the upper surface is a bright, whitish silver-blue--a color quite like that of burning magnesium--while the underside is dark gray or almost black.

Hearing a piston-engined airliner flying towards the south, I lloked up--almost immediately noticing a greenish-orange or yellowish light meandering along soundlessly, first heading in one direction then another. (quite unlike any conventional aircraft of the time) I know what it is...UFO! Calling my friend, we watch for perhaps half-a-minute what appears to be a seemingly aimless flight pattern.  Suddenly, another night traveler arrives on the scene. I hear it, then see its navagation lights. A jet! a millitary plane...has to be, for (at this time--1953) there are no civillian jet-powered aircraft of any kind. At almost the same moment that I see the newcomer, its pilot spots the UFO light, immediately changes course, and makes a bee-line for the thing. Thereafter, what follows is a ""cat an' mouse game"" of ""Catch-Me-if-You-Can"" between the light and the plane. The UFO zips ahead, the jet falling behind, then slowing nearly to a stop, the chased allows its pursuer to close. Once the seperation is minimal, away it goes at an unbelievably high speed--sometimes executing angle maneuvers of less than 90 deg. (with little or no slowing) until ready to once again tease the adversary.  For its part, the jet is able to make only gentle, sweeping turns; as its prey, in ghostly silence, traces various geometric figures in the night sky. Only the roaring and panting of the military aircraftis heardin its utterly futile attempt to catch the soundless speck as it continues its Will-O-The-Wisp dance. It is quite a show. And, after some two-and-a-half minutes or so, the participants disappear in a southwesterly direction--still engaged in a one-sided midnight game of tag.  It is my opinion that the military plane (was) a Northrop F89 Scorpion, because few (if any) single-seat jet fighters were flown at night on missions such as this. The Scorpion, a twoseat, radar and rocket equipped aircraft, was used in the intercepter roll. And, on this night, it definitely appears that one was trying to catch a ""boggy"". There is a possibillity tat the ""chase plane"" may have been a Lockheed F-94 Starfire. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The closest one which was hovering by the window may have been around 9 feet in diameter. I was 6 years old and with my mother one afternoon after kindergarten going to meet my father. My mother and I were walking down this street when we noticed many people starring up at the sky. Of course we had to look up to see what everyone was looking at. I remember looking at these objects and wondering what they were. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

Similar in intesity, pulsating, flickering. However, to my astonishment, It remained stationary. After several minutes I commented to my friends who looked at it with disbelief. We observed it for a few more minutes, when they exclaimed it must be a plane, or a flare that caught an updraft. Hoever to my eye it appeared far away, almost star like, however it pulsed and flickered much greater that any star I have seen. I watched for a while and grabbed my video camera. It was extremely difficult to view, except in night vision mode on my camera. It appeared to gain elevation slowly and to drift slightly to the east. after another 15min+ it flickered brightly and just dissapeared. 2 guests at my party commented they had seen the same thing a few years back, 3 of them (red lights) together in fact, even closer and to the south.

Brian,  The event happened on Jan. 1st 2004 at or around 3:30 PM EST. My family and I (wife, daughter age 5, son age 2 almost 3) were on our way home from lunch and shopping. We had turned off of I985 onto Spout Springs Road (heading east) and I guess we were around 1.5 to 2 miles from the Interstate when my wife said ""what is that?"".  It appeared to be several hundred feet up and my first thought was that it was a child's balloon--one of those reflective foil-like ones but the sun's reflection from the object was so bright and the objects surface appeared to be so smooth (like finely polished silver) that I got real curious. Also, though it was hard to tell, my wife and I both got the impression that the object was 4 to 6 feet in diameter.  We passed the object by and turned around and came back. We actually turned into a side street to get closer and parked. From this vantage point we could clearly see it (not trying to drive and look). The object was moving slowing away from us (like the wind was blowing it though there was no wind at ground level) and it was moving on its axis. This is hard to explain...it would flip and roll sort of like it was tumbling but not consistently in any given direction. From this movement we could make out that the object was an almost flat disc.  When it would roll to its thin side it looked black and there was no reflection.  When it would roll and reveal its flat side it would appear to be silver and the sun's reflection was strong. It looked like polished silver in the sun. Also, in the middle of the object was a red color--a circle--my wife said it looked like a big silver button in the sky with a red dot in the middle. This middle dot area did not reflect the sun like the rest of the area around it.  Also, I might ad that when looking at the flat side of the object, I mentioned before how it was smooth and silver...but it also looked solid. I mean it did not look like something filled with helium. I understand that in this we could have been mistaken but to us it honestly looked 'hard'. That along with the way it was moving on its axis (tumbling) made the object 'not fit'--what I am trying to say is that it is unexplainable to my wife and I.  We observed it for several minutes as it was moving westward away from us (I am assuming it was West because it was heading back towards the Interstate). I decided to try and drive to another subdivision off of Spout Springs road to see if we could get under it. My wife was looking at it as we were driving away, she turned away and when she turned back, it was gone. ""It's gone"" she said. I looked all over the sky and it was just gone. This was the most baffling part to us. Our eyes were off of it only for a few seconds.  Another odd thing...When we first saw the object, it appeared to be moving to the north-east. When we were at the place we stopped to watch, it was clearly moving more westward (which from the pace we had stopped was directly away from us).  Afterwards, I asked my 5 year old daughter what she thought it was, she said that it was a CD (Compact Disc).  As far as she is concerned that is exactly what it was (a 4 foot wide, floating Compact Disc).  As far as witnesses, there was light traffic moving along the road. Also, right across the street from the area we parked was two men walking up and down the side of the road looking looking as if they were looking for something on the road side that had fallen out of their vehicle. Neither of these people seemed to be looking at the object as their attention seemed to be on finding something in the ditch. There may have been trees in the way that obstructed the view for these guys.  The area that this happened in is filled with thousands of homes from closely packed subdivisions. Someone else had to have seen it. There is just too many people living in this area for us to have been the only ones.  To conclude...I do not buy the aliens from another world bit. However, I can't account for the object we saw. It appeared to literally defy the law of gravity. If this was a hoax or some strange toy some kid got for Christmas, the joke is really on us.

Around 3:45 in the morning. a sunday.  I was about to turn around and go to my bed when I saw a blurbed little red light pop on near Jupiter.  It was originally heading south, but it turned west from its course by large swoop-like turns, like a ball on a string.  After the first light had caught my attention, three more came out of the east, at a steady speed in a loose echeleon formation.  Two were flying straight and rigid, while the one farthest south was swerving around like a bouncy ball.  While they were as close to being directly above me as they ever came to be, an incredibly bright meteor, short, extremely fast.  It did NOT effect the craft in formation. About fifteen minutes afterwards, I saw a another strange looking meteor, the reason I say it looked strange is because it looked extremely low, like a trace bullet. The red lights had no particular shape, just little red blurbs of light.  I am known to be a mostly honest person.  With only one witness, that being me, this probably doesn't count all that much.  But I knew what I saw and it scared me plenty.

So is the time. I was at my parent's house - I was home from college for a week or so - using my mom's computer. This was back when I used chat rooms, so I was in one at the time. The way mom's desk is set up, when I was using the computer, I couldn't help but look out the window, so any movement would catch my attention. Being very dark though, that didn't happen; until I saw these lights, that is. I don't remember the exact colors of these lights, but I do remember there was more than one color (I'm pretty sure red and blue were a couple of them). I immediately could say that this was a not plane for several reasons: 1. It was moving fairly slowly.  2. It was apparently flying bewteen the trees immediately behind the house and the forest at the bottom of the hill beyond those first trees - really low, no more than 100 feet from the ground at the bottom of the hill and roughly eye level with me on the second floor.  3. The aforementioned lights looked like neon bars - it appeared they ran along wings, but I could see no substance to this craft - only the lights. I exclaimed to the people in the chat room that I just saw a UFO, but that was really the end of it. It flew roughly NNE out of my sight. I'm not sure what it was. Ultralight, maybe? It's either that or something I'll never know about. Either way, it was obviously an object, it was flying, and I sure couldn't identify it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On 03/02/2004, I was alone on the 8th floor (top floor) of a corner conference room of the building I work in. I was in the conference room approximately 1 1/2 hours as I was listening to a conference call.  The office has two very large windows which presented 180 degree view of the north and east. It had rained the day before, but on this day, there were some clouds @ roughly 2 - 4 thousand feet. There were also breaks in the clouds so some sun was available. The visibility was very good. I could see JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) on the north side, and to the east 20 + miles, and to the south east I could see Catalina Island. A very clear day.  I noticed a few helicopters during the time I was on the conference call. We have a lot in the area, police mainly. I also observed a few birds (hawks and crows) flying nearby.  At approximately 12:35 I was seated looking out the window facing Mt. Wilson and slighly to the East of it. I noticed an object I took for a helicoptor come into my line of vision from the mountains. It was moving towards me. I kept thinking it would soon become larger and I would see the roters spinning above. It did not get larger. As I kept watching it, it moved up just under the clouds and began to slow. It was still to small to get a good description other than it appeared an ovid type shape. I could see no appendages. Twice it was caught by sunlight and the color changed to a reddish metalic color.  The object continued to move just underneath the clouds and stopped just south of the building I was in, directly above Colorado Blvd. It continued to remain stationary for a few minutes. At that time, the conference call ended and I moved to end the call. When I looked out the window again, the object could no longer be seen.  I also noticed before I lost sight of it, that during the time it hovered over downtown Pasadena, a small private plane flew under it by a few hundred feet.  At arms distance the object would be about 1/4 the size of the nail on my little finger.  I would be interested to know if this is some sort of weather collection object. I am not saying it's alien, but I don't know what it was. Due to the closeness of JPL and indeed, the Skunk Works (just the other side of the mountains) who knows.

I would love to know if these egg shaped objects are omething that is not mysterious if we only knew they were around (i.e., the weather gathering devices).

I was driving north on South Tomlin Hill Road.  After making the 90º left turn in the road, I was headed west at about 7 miles per hour when I saw a luminous yellow sphere. It was about 45º above my line of sight in front of me and slightly to my right, or north of me, plunging swiftly downward for approximately 1 second, north to south, on about a 30º angle. I thought it was a meteorite. I expected it to burn out, but then it became a bright white light and headed west/northwest. I continued to drive west, speeding up to about 30 miles per hour as the light sped away from me. At this point it resembled a star moving away. It diminished in size until I lost sight of it in the still red glow along the western horizon. I thought perhaps it was a plane but I did not see any blinking lights. There was a jet headed east overhead to my left. The light moving west did not seem to be at the same altitude as the jet. My guess would be that it was perhaps at half the altitude of the jet. Tomlin Hill is higher than the surrounding area making it is possible to see a wide expanse of sky in all directions so I never lost sight of it until it reached the western horizon. I watched it for perhaps 90 seconds.  I live in this area and the Columbia Regional Airport is to the southeast of my home. I am very used to seeing lots of aircraft in the area. I am very familiar with what aircraft look light at night. This did not seem like any craft I’m use to seeing pass overhead at night. It moved west much too fast for a small plane. Even a jetliner passing over head would take about twice as long to cover that same distance. For the brief moment it was plunging down it seemed perfectly round with no distortion around its circumference. Even though I momentarily thought it to be meteorite, there was no smoke trail or streak of light. My impression of its color and shape at this point would be like that of the sun high overhead on a hot hazy day, but not that size and more spherical in shape. It initially appeared about the same size as Venus, still clearly visible in the western sky that evening. It did not twinkle or have any blinking lights. The night was perfectly clear with lots of stars and aircraft visible in the area. I don’t rule out that it may have been a smaller jet of some kind flying at a much lower altitude than that of a jetliner except for its swift downward motion when I first noticed it.",2004-03-17T00:00:00,38.91147669172933,-92.30242962406015

No one else was around since church had been out for about half an hour, and I hid in the long marsh grass. It flew directly over me and I could see tiny red, green, and white lights on the bottom of it and larger, more bright, yellow lights in a circle pattern on the bottom of it. There were no lights in the middle, but there was a combination of three figure eight patterns made with yellow light. The three figure eights were connected together and seemed to be coming from the large yellow lights. I have seen many airplanes, jets, satellites, and meteorites fly at all times of day since Ripon is located near Oshkosh. Oshkosh gets all kinds of planes from around the world for the EAA and I can tell the difference between planes and what I saw. I have never seen an aircraft just sit still for about forty minutes, then when you glance at it a second time it moves at a very fast speed towards you. What caused me to wonder what the object was is that I have never seen it before while looking for fireflies, and that the object was brighter, larger, and a different color then a star. As I was leaving I saw an object that looked the same as the first object out towards Oshkosh flying in an odd pattern. The object was raising its height, then lowering it (bobbing up and down). I was just wondering if anyone else in the Ripon area saw this strange object.  Note:The objects lights were in a disc shape, but I could not see the outline of the object due to the bright yellow lights. The object seemed to be less than 100 yards above my head, but it was hard to tell because I did not know the exact size of the object. If the object was a little less than 100 yards high, then it had around a 100 foot radius (assuming the lights were on the edge of the object). I compared the objects height to the roof of the church as it passed over it. As I noted before, the yellow lights were extremely bright and they made it impossible to see the outline of the object, only the smaller lights were noticeable with the large yellow ones. ((NUFORC Note:  It is unusual, in our opinion, for a UFO to remain motionless for an hour, although not impossible.  If the report that the object moved swiftly across the sky is accurate, then it could not have been a celestial body.  PD))",2004-01-31T00:00:00,43.877100000000006,-88.84570000000001

Besides myself, they have been witnessed by my wife, our eight year old boy, and my wife's non english speaking mother who was living with us at the time. I bring to point that my mother-in law does not speak english because that shows the level of communication that she and I have. When she first saw the lights in the sky, she led us out into the front yard and asked if we(my wife and I) were in some kind of trouble. The frequency at which they had appeared had became so upsetting to her that she assumed that it was some type of law enforcement watching over our subdivision. -My home is located about one mile northeast of Kennesaw mountain, and about five miles due north of Dobbins Air Force Base. a huge cell tower sits close to our house and a railroad train right next door along w/ a man made lake (that serves no purpose in our subdivision due to the lack of up keeping). -The bright white balls of light come up vertically from behind the tree line about a half mile south of my house in direct line of sight with Kennesaw mountain. They come up very slowly in groups of three and post positions equal distance from one another approximately 1500 ft off the ground. They then slowly move one after the other in a single line formation towards and then over my house. I know the height that they are from the ground because I have a cell phone tower IN MY BACKYARD which when they pass over they barely clear. These objects make NO SOUND when moving, and never move faster than approx. 30 knots (the landing speed of a piper cub). From below they look like a triangle shape similar to the stealth F-117 with three lights that would be at the respective nose and two wing landing gear formation. These craft come up in groups of three hover for approx. 5-10 minutes at their posted position then depart with a second group coming up in the same fashion. We have witnessed up to 12 craft in a one hour period on a nightly bases. It apprears that when all craft are airborne they then equally distribute themsevles throughout the marietta/atlanta city areas. This has been going on since october of 2002, maybe i'm just seeing things. ATTN: NUFORCE personel please contact me by email only as I am currently reloacting due to employment changes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate. It would be unusual, we believe, for ""bona fide"" UFO's to make nightly appearances in the same location.  We believe that lights associated with the nearby military base would be the first possibility to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses were observing UFO's.

I came inside to get my camera [a simple Kodak CX4200] and snapped a picture of them.  [I remember having to hold the camera high to get the shot]. I didn't get a good shot, as the 3 lights were very faint in the photo so I saved it in my files to check out later. [Planets ""line up"" all the time]. I found this picture the other day when cleaning out my files, cropped it some, and used my ""brighten/contrast"" feature from the camera software to bring out the 3 lights, deleting the original almost ""black"" photo. The 3 horizontal lights at the bottom now looked bright red, and then there were horizontal ""Y""s that seemed to be linked by the tails, and 4 red lights at the top right side of the formation lined up at an angle that I didn't see that night. Also, on the right inside light there seems to be a red dot next to it. [I don't think we can photograph ""moons"" of distant planets with cheap digital cameras!].  Just an interesting shot, though, and wish I'd gone back out later to check on it but didn't think it was anything spectacular. Maybe my software changed the colors unjustly; but there's no doubting the odd formation, even in a legitmate constellation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The strange thing about this is that it simply hovered in the same spot and literally would light up very bright and then dissappear from our sight only to reappear in the same place.  Every so often it would move slightly from one side to another, but it seemed pretty localized to that one area.  As we drove closer to our home it seemed as though we were also moving closer to it.

A few seconds later a second boom hit and rattled the windows about the same. I wondered if there was some sort of huge metal dumpster or something that fell off a truck near the house but couldn't believe that would rattle the windows like that. Less than a minute later my father who lives about 8-9 miles west of me called me on the phone. He asked if I heard the sonic booms. I said yeah but I didn't know what they were. I had not heard a sonic boom in over 30 years and wondered about that. I immediately hung the phone up and ran outside to look in the sky. I observed at least 7 or 8 contrails going across the sky mostly from east to west or west to east, as I could not see the end of them. But I noticed that to the North Northwest there was one contrail that made a hairpin turn and headed back north. I thought that might have been the source since it would probably be a military craft that made that maneuver. Then about 25 to 30 minutes later I was in my car about to start it when my cell phone rang. As I was answering it I heard a smaller boom but it was distinctly the same as early just much quieter. At that moment I said hello and it was my father again, he asked if I heard the sonic boom again. I said I just heard it as I was answering the phone. I then asked him how long ago he heard it and he said about 30 seconds before I answered the phone. So since he lives about 8 miles west of me we figured that the sound was also west of me since it took at least 30-40 seconds for the sound to travel to me. Then later that evening I took my son to meet with the Boy Scouts to go camping. While the boys were all loading up their gear I told the story to one of the boy's fathers who is retired air force and now works for the air force in civil service. He was in Dallas at the time and did not hear it but a mother of another boy said she heard 3 booms like me and another boys father said he heard it ! and though somebody must have been dynamiting something. The lady lived about half way between me and my father while the other boy's father lives right on Lake Grapevine about 12 miles west of me and about 3-4 miles southwest of my father. When I got home that night after dropping my son off with the scouts, I called my father to tell him what I had heard from others. He then told me that my mother had heard the sonic booms also. She was in the front yard at my brother's house about 12 miles north northwest of me and about 7 to 8 miles north of my father. She said she heard the first two booms that were close together but was probably driving in the car when the third one hit so she did not hear it. I just now called her to ask her if she saw anything and she said she did not but thought that the sound was north of them but could not be certain. She also said that a neighbor asked if she heard the sonic booms and she said she did. He said he heard them and called DFW airport to report them and the airport said they did not hear them.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,33.044733514986376,-97.01126376021797

The sun had gone down; however, the sky was still fairly light.  As I sat on my front steps looking west, I began to examine the dark clouds that were just hovering above the homes a few miles away.  Initially, I didn't think anything about it.  Since we had mild thunderstorms the night prior, I thought the objects were lingering storm clouds.  As I continued to look in their direction (as the sky became grandually darker), the objects began to lose their cloud-like appearance.  The became metalic.  The new appearance was dark grey (very dark); however, they were not black.  I could tell that they were just a few shades lighter than a solid black color.  Their appearance was similar to that of our U.S. Military/Airforce's flat grey paint.  There were no reflective surfaces.  As I have indicated below, the crafts were in a five degree spread formation.  I will use the X to depict how they were positioned in the sky:  x     XXXXX      xxxxxxXXXXVXXXXxxxxxx      XXXXX      xxxxxxXXXXVXXXXxxxxxx  The single X represents what appeared to be a cubed like craft--it was the smallest of the five.  The five X's represent what appeared to be a tubular craft.  The most interesting, were the larger crafts.  These were shaped (from my vantage point) similar to that of a hawk or eagle as it floats in the sky awaiting prey.  If you were to take a head-on shot of either bird prior to its dive, that is what this larger craft looked like.  These larger craft was positioned firmly in the sky, traveling about 5-6 mph.  The wings of the craft were flapping slowly, much like a bird of prey.  The wings were several hundred yards long (tip to tip).  As I called my wife to help me identify these crafts, each craft began to slowly fade.  When my wife walked to the steps, the smaller craft took-off.  From the nearly motionless position, to several thousand miles per hour (much like a shooting star).  My wife screamed.  The tubular craft on the far right, began to slowly fade.  Then, the larger craft on the far right began to fade.  The transition was slow and deliberate.  The tubular craft on the far left, began to fade once the larger craft on the right faded.  The last remaining craft (one of the bird like crafts), just seem to sit there.  I got the impression that it knew we were stairing at it.  We could feel something staring back at us.  I wanted to get a better look, since we couldn't find a camera.  We jumped in our vehicle, and drop up the hill toward where the final craft was positioned.  Once we got there, it began to fade as well.  We saw the final transition.  It went from an extremely large bulky craft to a transparent (which isn't a adequate expression).  The craft appeared to blend into the sky.  We could now see a camouflaged craft that had lights/dim orange lights completely surrounding the outline of its shape.  The lights were very orange.  What was once a bulky bird-like craft, became fluid limber well camouflaged craft that seemed to glide much like a stingray in the ocean.  It was like watcing fluid in motion as this craft twirled (as if it were displaying its prowess) in the sky.  Within a second, it went straight up, and was gone.  Needless to say, my wife and I could not do anything else for the rest of the night.  We just sat there watching the sky.  One interesting point, when we were jumping into the vehicle to chase the craft, we decided to take the family dog.  The dog didn't want to go outside (this is a dog that runs to the door when it hears the lock click--he's always game for the outdoors).  He was scared of something.  My background is military, two science degrees, own businesses, and consider myself normal (both mentally and pysically).  My wife has a science background, and is an executive with a prominent medical corporation.  We are a grounded family.  These things were real, and there was a threat present.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,38.86859124423963,-94.83400184331798

It looked like my other car which my wife drives. Same make, color and year.  The opening came and I started to turn but decided to look at the Licence plate. It was my Licence plate!  In the two seconds I spent there making the turn and trying to slow down to take a look at the driver (cars honking behind me) I thought someone had stollen my car. I looked at the driver and I was startled. He saw me looking and he was startled. It was me in my other car! Wearing the same coat, hat and sunglasses as I was!  I was forced to complete the turn but franticly tried to make a right in the first driveway. Keeping my other self in view in the rearview mirror. I saw him/me halfway turned into the street. I was now in the driveway trying to turn the car around to chase myself. Constantly looking behind me and around as I turned the car so i wouldn't loose him. I dashed back onto the street but did not see him to the left. Looked to the right and no cars were in sight. So I figured he must have straightened out the car and not turned but went straight ahead. So I went back in that direction driving extremly fast for two intersections and could not find him.  I pulled over at a payphone and called my wife asking her where she parked the car. She told me she left it at the subway station as she takes the train downtown to work. I drove over there in less than 10 minutes and found the car parked exactly where she told me it was. I placed my hand on the hood and it was cold.  I saw my car and licence number and me in the driver seat. I'm not imagining this and I don't do drugs. Did my reality cross with some parralel universe?

The video footage of this event of Jan 21,04 is astounding.  In freeze framing the video by way of milli seconds I have been able to see things which I could not see that night by my naked eyes. The computer enables me to not only freeze a milli second but to blow it up much larger to see just what it is or might be. There is a series of photos that I can only describe as the  fireball spliting up into many smaller balls of light all attached in a long rod like formation of 11 balls of various pastel colors of light and then it goes into a progression of from 11 balls of light to 10 to 8 to 4 to 2 to one the fireball shape. It does this a few times where it goes from a long rod of attached balls of light to a single fireball of light.  This is incredible and it happens so fast it could not be seen until the video was freeze framed.  In other photos is is obvious that the solid white interior of the fireball is moving very fast because it changes it position and angle continually. There is another unexplainable part of this footage that puzzels me. In the bottom of the screen there is a very small dancing ball of light that at first I dismissed because it was so small in comparison to the main fireball . This tiny ball of light moves from side to side and and then at the end of the video the main fireball seems to disappear and reappear at the bottom of the screen very small with the other very small ball of light. It seems to be communicating with that tiny ball of light.

The object appeared as a bright light (no collision beacons), as it passed overhead on a southwest to northeast course the object became brighter as it moved farther east.  A few minutes later, my co-worker and I were able to compare the object to other aircraft in the sky.  The object was 10X brighter ,5X higher and 4-5X faster than the propeller driven craft that were in the sky nearby.  I have never seen craft travel that quickly at that altitude and never appear that bright.  The object was much brighter and lower in the sky than any satellite that I have observed.

It was close to 9:00 pm and the sky was dark.  There had been no cars on the road as it was a cold winter night.   There were two lights ahead of us.  At first I thought they belonged to an oncoming car.  They were bright white-yellow and looked like car headlights.  What was unusual was that they did not appear to be moving, and the closer we got to them I realized they were not on the ground, but in the sky, not high in the sky.  They just hung there.  We talked about them, trying to figure out what they were.  They didn’t look like airplane lights; they were too close together, too big, and too low.  We tried to make them be helicopter lights (because they hovered in the air), but there was no tail light and nothing to indicate propellers anywhere around them.  All we could see were the lights.  As the road curved around to the right, the hovering lights were now closer on our right, and  I could see a third light under the brighter ""headlights,"" it was dimmer in intensity, but also white-yellow.  They hovered just about the tree tops, and we seemed quite close to them, but it was harder to see them clearly because tree branches were in the way.  I asked my husband to roll down his window to see if we could hear any noise.  He was trying to drive and look at the same time, and couldn’t get the window down fast enough for me - I rolled down my window, but I was on the wrong side of the car to get a clear view.  He stopped the car in the road, and I jumped out, and then I could really see.  There was no noise at all, which seemed very strange, no motor noise at all.  My husband pulled the car into a nearby driveway, leaving me in the road.  The area is rather rural and there were no street lights, no neighborhood house lights.  These lights hung in the air just above the tree tops.  I could see the underbelly of the craft as it was reflecting the lights.  It was metal colored and seamless with no  rivet spots where two sheets of metal were joined.  It appeared to be curved, but where the light reflection stopped, I couldn’t make out any overall shape.  I couldn’t see any wing tips or top or end.

During a hunting and tramping trip through and area known as Whareorino, in the central North Island of New Zealnd all six of our group witnessed what we all felt as a very unusual happening. Our background include many years in the Aviation industry and this background most certainly convinces us that what we had seen were not any type of aircraft that we have any knowledge of. Around 9.27 pm we did notice what appeared to be several stars ""flashing"" in the sky overhead. The flashing got much brighter. There was absolutely no sound of any sort. The sky was clear and the milky way could be seen clearly, with no light interference from any near-by city. The lights eventually stopped flashing. These lights were white and appeared stationary overhead. Another flashing white light appeared and then moved very quickly north wards through the night sky. Approximately 1 hour after this sighting, what appeared to be a star in the western sky, simply got brighter and brighter, then as quick as a flash, just disappeared. All six of us are absolutely convinced that what we saw was in the very least unusual and would definitely not be attributed to any type of aircraft that we are aware of. We know what we saw and in fact are a little embarressed to mention this to anyone, however I am a long time sceptic when it comes to UFO sightings. I am now a believer and will not change my mind for anything!!! Myself, Phil, Peter and the boy's are now converts!!!",2004-02-12T00:00:00,,

It was around 22:00 PM. I was standing outside my house with my dad. He was watering the garden and I was thinking about the Aliens and looking at Orion's Belt. I was talking to my dad and I said ""Woudn't it be great if I could look up at the sky and there would be a flying saucer, and I would ask you to look up and you would witness it with me??"". I looked down and stared at him waiting for a response. 10 seconds later I looked back up and looked again at Orions Belt. It was a clear night sky and you can see almost all the stars there where to see, millions of them. Just then in that same 30 seconds after told my dad about how great it would be to see something like that together, there it was very amazingly, a disk shaped object like zig-zaging through the stars at a very very high velocity. If I would guess at it I would say about a quarter the width of Planet Earth in a few seconds. That ship surely traveled very fast and was probably in a very big hurry. I bet all the other Space-ships waiting for the final clock 'dong' are just sitting there and communicating with each other while they wait for the right time to intervine. I guess 2007 is nearing quite fast and if Nibiru is going to cause the earth to stop rotation for 3days (just like the bible says in Revelations) than I think we have something to be worried about, very much in-deed.

It was almost 10 o’clock, and by that time of night, the roads in the northern part of Howell Township loose most of the pulsating traffic that defines them during the day. I was heading South on Brickyard Road, and as I came to the junction at State Highway 33 (business) I could see these bright lights (six of them, three on top of three) just above the overpass of State Highway 33 (bypass; I was just near where 33 splits into the bypass and the business routes) to the south of where I was. As I crossed through the light and under the bypass, I did not really think twice about the lights. Brickyard Road becomes Fairfield road through the light. I was continuing along that way, heading south, when I noticed up ahead, through the trees, the same six lights. They were now closer, obviously. Before, I had noticed that they were in sight just over the overpass, though much further in the distance then they were now. I realized how low the lights were. As I continued to drive south, it struck me that they were heading north, straight towards me. I stopped my car and got out to look on that cold night. Again, at first I thought it was one craft with two levels of three forward facing white lights. I soon realized instead that each ""level"" as I had described it, was actually one craft. I stood and watched as they came closer, seemingly right at me. I noticed, however, that the night was extremely quiet and clear, except for the occasional cold breeze. No sound, no jet engines, no chop-chop of a helicopter. I watched as the two craft turned west as they were almost over me, gained altitude and flew parallel to route 33. It isn’t really like they flew. It was more like they drifted, slowly and quietly. From behind, I could barely see them. The light seemed to be directed mostly straight ahead of the two craft. I never got a very good look at the structure of the craft themselves.",2004-02-12T00:00:00,,

I saw in the sky a light that I thought to have been the sun. But to the south of this light was where the sun was positioned, noticibly brighter and more visibly defined in it's shape than it's neighboring visitor. The light was white with a lightly yellow colored brightness. The light was shaped like an acute triangle at the left with the bottom nearly paralell to the horizon. The right side was undefined and lead almost what seemed to be a curved line back to the base of the light. The light did not move and was wider but smaller than the large sun. The skies were spattered with thin clouds that were so much like lace that an airplane could easily be seen through a great majority of them. I childishly raised the question ""why are there two suns"" to my mother as I pointed to the western skies. She became as baffled as I at the sight of this luminous spectical. When an M.P. finished filling out a visitors pass and had barely had time to hand the pass over to me I pointed and asked him if he knew what the second light in the sky was, he looked but seemed puzzled and only responded with a ""what."" My mother then leaned over to try and convey in better detail the question at hand by saying ""there are two suns."" She also pointed and added a motion of the head that meant for the soldier to look again. He did, and apparently noticed the light in the sky because his head remained to help his eyes focus. ""Do you know what it is?"" The soldier answered that he did not and I teased him saying ""come on you're the government."" Hearing my sarcasm, he replied ""that's just it, I'm in the Army"" I and my mother continued and kept a watch on this light that began to fade then dissapear. We reached the chapel soon after and continued to talk about what was just witnessed, and as we talked in the car I saw that the light had resumed it's place in the sky only to dissapear once more only moments afterward. I used my cell phone to call a local television station WGNX Atlanta via 411. After allowing the automated system attempt to search my request a live networker assisted me by routing my call for me, but there was no answer.

The night was clear and cold.  I noticed three greyish lights moving across the sky, approximately SSE.  At first, the lights reminded me of geese flying in formation, but after watching for a few seconds, they ultimately appeared to be part of one triangular object. There were lights at each point of the triangle, although the lighted areas themselves seemed rounded, not sharp-edged or pointed.  The lighted areas were dim and hazy, and they were fairly large in size compared to what appeared to be the relative size of the object.  It is possible that the lighted areas consisted of groups of smaller lights, but the lights were too dim to tell.  The lights were moving in a very smooth, consistent manner, and were moving in a straight line.  Ultimately, not very far away, the object faded away, as it had moved quite a distance fairly quickly.  However, a normal aircraft would still be easily visible at the point where this one effectively faded into the sky.  I could not see an outline of a triangular craft, as there was no moonlight in the sky, so it is also possible that there were three objects flying in formation.  However, I believe that most likely they were all part of one object.  The object was completely silent, and it was not directly overhead, although it was close to being so.  It was flying at a fairly low altitude, well below where planes fly in the area.  Any planes/helicopters flying even remotely close to where this object was are quite noisy and clearly heard.  Again, this object was completely silent, and it was moving much faster than an aircraft (at any altitude).  I have lived near airport flight paths in Los Angeles for many years, but I have never seen anything remotely similar to this object. My wife also saw the object, and she recalls seeing an outline of a triangular craft.

We were all struck in awe, and after about 4 seconds one of us said, what the hell was that.  There was no sound, like an explosion, that we could hear, and if there were, I am sure, that we would have seen maybe some reddish color before the bluish-green.  There were seven of us in the van, but only five of us saw this event.  The other two, were asleep.  We continued talking about it all of the way home.  We figured that maybe the light originated in maybe Delaware, cause as I said the """"LIGHT'', filled the windshield and it was away from us, I would say about 25 miles away, cause we were on a like straightawy on the parkway, and we could seen the outlines of the trees against this light.  The trees are in the middle of the parkway and on both sides.  The light did appear far off, but none the less it was there.  The next day, the driver of the van, called a friend of his, who has something to do with reporting either weather or news for a local newspaper, to see if he had heard of any type of story regarding what we saw.  He said ""NO"", but suggested that we contact the United States Weather Bureau, for a event report.

As my girlfriend and I were driving down highway 50, heading back to Gatineau after visiting my father in Buckingham, the object sundenly appeared in the sky out of knowhere to our left. It was a bright white light, but it wasn't white, it was more like a light green almost white kind of color. For a fraction of a second, the object remained still in the sky at about 500 ft. It's almost like it turned ""ON"" it's light or something.  Then, it did this strange flying sequence, in the shape of a ~ (see attached image), at the speed of a falling star (too fast for a plane, too strange of a sequence for a firework or falling star, plus falling stars don't show up in the sky at 500 ft. to remain still and then continue to fall, especially not in this kind of sequence).  The flying sequence lasted about 2 seconds and it then turned ""OFF"" it's light when it was at about 200 ft. from the ground. The light did not dimmed down, it simply turned off. It was also too bright and too big to be a falling star and was not the same color.  It wasn't high in the sky like you normally see falling stars, it was at 500 ft. and at about 3 kilometers away from us, above farm fields / industrial parc.  When we saw this, my girlfriend and I both looked at each other, tears in our eyes, asking ourselves, what the $#@% was that? We saw planes, falling stars, helicopters, fireworks, lots of stuff at night, but nothing like this. You just had to see it.",2003-12-09T00:00:00,45.48421847649919,-75.67076288492707

When we flash small laser lights at them, they come closer.  They stay in the same spot for hours at a time and alternate directions every 15 minutes or so.  They are tilted sideways and appear to be sousers.  There is a local private airline a mile from us and they have said nobody flies that time of night (it is too risky).  They do not leave untill the morning dew starts to fall about 4 hours before sunrise.  Onece they had flashed a pure yellowish-white light down for a few seconds then left.  Both my grandfather and I had blacked out for a few seconds yet were still standing when we snaped out of it.  There is a big spot in our back yard where we had to replant the grass in result of this light.  We have taken pictures, but everytime we try to get them developed, the place we take them to refusses to give them back to us and will not say why.

I was headed SW. The moon was visible in my windshield ( approx 30 degree azimuth )and directly ahead. I noticed a triangular pattern of very bright gold/amber lights approaching. and which passed approx 10 degrees west of the Moon. From my vantage point, the ""flight"" path was straight, roughly  South-SW to East-NE and passed directly over downtown Los Angeles. I lost sight of it as it passed directly above my head ( and hood ). The speed was slow in relation to the aircraft (747's) turning on final approach for LAX which were also visible concurrently with this object. This object CROSSED OVER, and perpendicularly to the established LAX approach path, though at a higher altitude than the traffic on approach. The path it traveled was unusual enough due to the tightly controlled nature of the L.A airspace and the resulting familiar and CONSTANT air-traffic patterns. The craft was comparable in size to a large airliner. There were no port/starboard running lights- no strobing lights of any kind. The lights were large, similar to a head on view of landing lights but, unlike landing lights, as the craft passed from ahead and low to the horizon, to the point where the object was directly above me, the lights became even more visible as they took on a more distinctly round appearance. The intensity of the lights remained constant- never got brighter, just more visible. When directly above me, they appeared to be on the bottom of the object. I wasn't able to count the number of lights at this point because I was still driving in heavy traffic. I believe a stationary observer would have had no trouble counting them. They formed either a triangle or possibly a chevron, and my recollection is that it was an odd number of lights along the leading ed! ges, including the ""nose"" or tip which had the same light. All lights were of equal size, shape, color and intensity. I have consulted a map of my route and location at the time and will forward graphical info if needed, plus illustration. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke briefly via telephone with the witness, and he sounds quite serious-minded and credible.  We may post an image of the sighting, to accompany the written report.

On this occasion, I noticed a bright, flickering light traveling along the Columbia River, about 2 thousand feet above horizon.  I couldn't see the craft. But the light was incredible: it was very bright and flickered, like a disco light flashing. It also resembled a tool I used many tears ago to set the timing on a car tune-up, where the light flickered.  And it was also noteworthy that the light was so bright and looked like the new halogen (?) lights on new cars.  Very BRIGHT, it was unusual.  Another thing, the object was fast but jerked up and down slightly.  Much faster moving that a commercial jet.  Also, the light was eminating from the rear of the object, as if it were on the back end of the craft.  There was no sound like jet engines, not the thumping of heliocopter rotor blades.

There was however a loud sound, unlike a plane or jet.  More like the rumbling of the space shuttle on launch from a distance.  Very much the sound of a huge rocket.  Looking up, and due south, we saw what appeared to be to craft moving in tandam, turning slightly to the east/southeast.  Looking closer we could see the outline of a single craft connecting the two lights.  These lights were non blinking and visibly connected, white lights.  Now moving in a straight line away from us.  Within about 15 seconds of being able to see the outline of a single huge craft, the lights simply faded away into the distance.  They did not appear to be extinguished.

A friend and myself were driving to lunch around 1:00 pm in northwest Austin, TX.  As soon as we made a righthand turn onto the frontage road along 183 N., I noticed what appeared to be a teardrop or possibly a triangular silver object that was reflecting sunlight approximately 3000 to 5000 feet (it could have been as low as 1000 feet) above the surface looking to the south/southwest.  My buddy noticed it as well to confirm that I was not seeing a reflection in his side door window.  The sky was perfectly clear, so we were not mistaking a cloud formation, nor were we mistaking this for man made utility infrastruture because it was well above these in the sky.  We were about 1000 yards from the intersection and my buddy decided to make a u-turn to get on the other side of the expressway to get a better look.  As we were heading towards the u-turn, the object appeared to be heading at a slower speed than usual for any type of aircraft that I know is possible barring a  helicopter.  It was moving steady from south/southeast to north/northwest.  At times, it appeared to be actually hovering.  It also appeared to be vectoring in about a 30 degree slow and steady ascent.  There appeared to be no wing or tail structure of any kind that I could detect.  The skin was smooth with no identifying features (windows, ports, markings, etc).  No propulsion of either propeller or jet type was visible.  There was no sign of a contrail or any kind of exhaust or distortion in the sky from the leading or trailing edges of the object.  Since we were in the car at the time of indentification, we could not determine if any sound was coming from the craft.  I am former military in communications/intelligence with top secret, so I DO know my aircraft recognition.  By the time my buddy made his u-turn and we got to the other side of the expressway on the opposite frontage road, the object was nowhere to be seen in either direction of it's vector for next 3 to 5 minutes after making the u-turn.  It appeared to had just vanished without a trace.  There were other aircraft (commercial and private) in the nearby vicinity, but these were clearly recognizable as man made aircraft; and did not appear to be evading the object.  This is very interesting, because this sighting is very similar to the sighting in Houston on 10/07/2003.  If I had to guess if this craft was noiseless, then I would say that it was.  A very interesting day for us indeed.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

My friend asked what that was over my right shoulder just above the tree tops.  The event occurred next to the Memphis Airport, 1/2 mile west and about 3 miles south of us.  I turned and observed a Black round object facing me about 5 miles sse just observed over the tree tops.  We thought it was a large bird circling.  It was not.  As the round portion turned downward, we saw a cross section very thin that made the object appear to disappear.  As it continued to turn or move, the what I call top portion turned toward the sun and was very reflective.  It appeared to be silver, yellowish, and had what looked like a structure or beam across the top red in color.  It was going in a NE direction very slowly and rising slowly.  As it continued a tumbling motion, the top portion fully faced us.  We observed the red beam and the color of the top appeared to be yellowish.  It continued to do a tumbling motion.  We observed what I call the bottom, it was all black and round.  As it went over the airport, appeared to move north.  When it looked like it was almost past the airport, at about 3-4000 FT, a small aircraft moved below it at about 2,000 Ft.  Once that aircraft moved away, the object appeared to go NE and gain altitude slowly.  At no time did we observe noise from this craft, no lights, no string or rope.  We watched it till it got so far we couldn't see it anymore.  Once we went inside, I called the control tower to see if they have anything or observe anything.  Nothing noted from them.

I know the sound of aircraft, navigation lights, etc as this is a part of my job.  If this was a balloon, it would have to have been a very large one and at least round on the bottom, top, and have a very small cross section.

I told him to check the news to see if an airplane went down because it happened right near where Jacksonville International Airport is.  I was about 5 miles south of the airport.  But this was NO plane.  I didn't think anything else about it until I read on Compuserve news about the sighting in Durham.  I remember looking at my watch when I was walking out of Wal-mart and it was 8:35...so, I figure it was around 8:37-8:39 pm when I saw it.  Again, I do not take these kind of things seriously, but was shocked when I read the Durham account.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,30.266904680969628,-81.6163728336584

I lived in Colorado a few months ago, not the mountains, but near Denver (it was all prarie).  While there, I became fascinated with UFOs, for a number of reasons.  The most signifacant thing that turned me into a believer was an actual sighting.  I remember it perfectly:  It was about 8:30 pm and I was watching TV in my bonus room.  When the commercial came on, I walked into my room to get a pencil for this quiz-type thing that was on the show.  I had a fairly large window in my room (it faced my neighbor's feild in their backyard), and we had quite a bit of air traffic in my neighborhood (I lived in a suburban neighborhood), so it wasn't unusual to have airplanes flying overhead.  But tonight when I looked out there, it was different.  The craft I saw was much to close to be an airplane, and it was noiseless.  I would have missed had I not looked out there.  It was like a ""V"" in shape, but more boomerang-like.  It had 6 lights that I could see.  It was set up like this:  o O 00 O o        (""o, O, 0"" represent lights)  The two lights on the sides (the smallest ones) were not blinking at all.  The two slightly bigger ones were blinking slowly, and the biggest ones (in the center) were blinking rapidly.  It was almost like a code, or a pattern, the way they were blinking.  Every second the middle light blinked, the smaller ones blinked with it (if you could understand that).  The lights seemed to change colors, from a tint of green to a tint of red.  The color that there seemed to be more of was a bluish-white color, like halogen.  It moved south-western directly over my house, and my neighborhood, at speeds slightly faster than I have seen any airplane move.  It could have been an airplane, except for one vital thing.  It was silent.  It was about an estimated 50 feet over house, and if it had been an airplane, my entire house would have reverberated.  Instead it moved silently, smoothly over my neighborhood, right over my roof until I could see it no more.  I dashed to the front of the house, ripping open the door, but it was no more.

Full 360 deg ridgetop view.  the event ""followed"" us to Hawaii as well. Will describe three episodes. 1. Looked to the west on very clear summer night, no forecast of clouds.  Clouds as described moved in, ceiling @5Kft. One cloud glowing with something inside, apparently.  Balls of light decended through the clouds, moving down and ""playing"" with each other in random, beautiful patterns. Immediately looked in vain for ground source (first impression, spotlights playing on clouds) but in country area, little liklyhood of that.  Possible prank or hoax with lazers? But wait. Balls of light left nascent trails behind them. Plasma? and would occsionally pass up and through glowing cloud area to be seen faintly through cloud and dissappear, only to surge back down through the cloud. Also, balls seen in cloud background and night background mostly the same.. Then, above cloud, could be made out spinning ""armature"" of light, like a great wand (estimate length, at at least one mile) with greater glow at its end. Like the spoke of a wheel only light.  round and round it would go like clock work and the plasma balls  would seem to go up into this phenomenon and come back down.  This went on for some time at least 45 min as we watched the show. Kept trying to think of logical expl. (total skeptic, feel that most UFO either imagination, mistake nat. phenom or primarily secret gov. tech or gov mass hysteria hoax/deception) No ground source.  Balls covering many square miles of air in their dance.  Had the impression at times that the  ""wheel of light"" was spitting these things out, like a vortex. Almost seemed alive.  Next day (we are not far from Travis A.F.Base) Huge and silent A.F. surveilance planes with bulbous nose, etc. cruising back and forth around area at very low elevation. Have seen phenomenon several times since. One ti! me, wheel of light phenom above cloud quite separate from   ""plasma balls"" that were streaking very high in atmaoshpere at great speed in definite alignment and purposeful direction, unlike playing balls.  In Hawaii at Waikiki Beach (not kidding) we looked up to see same glowing cloud formation over hotel we were planning to eat dinner at! Not kidding.  Wife says, oh my goodness look. We look up and point,express amazement,(hoping to encourage others to look up) yet the strangest thing. Everyone around us seemed in a daze, totally oblivious to what I thought were our antics , pointing skyward.  This time, the rotating beacon or arm of light was smaller, very low in the sky (cloud was only 500 to 1k ceiling max)and more intense. This time no ball of light, but bundled rods (?) of light emerged from cloud, that's the best way to describe ""it"", moving on a vertical axis and ""pulsating"".  Of note, the huge black triangels people report seeing are most likely huge jet assist military dirigibles meant probably for troop transport, cargo lift etc.  There are plans for such triangular mega-dirigables to be seen in Pop Science I beleive. that is why people report ""silent""slow movement and hug size.

I had the keys to his car and shined this blue LED into the hills to enhance the visibility as to what was happening.  A few moments later, I heard odd crying-distress sounds as if they were from a child or cat, etc. I assumed it was an animal, but however was shaken by the experience and ran inside the house.  After I told my cousin of the sounds, we went outside with his camera to see what we could find.  We heard the sounds again, which were shortly followed by odd electronic beeping sounds, not tones that would be musical, but microtonal noises.  We became frightened, and got in the car and drove to my house, which is 100 ft up the road.  We loaded the keyboard into my garage because the house was locked and we forgot the keys to the house.  We relectantly stepped outside again and heard more rustling.  Oddly, his steering wheel had become very sticky, like a film of slime, (this might be condensation, but could be related).

While in our backyard, my son's 10-year guest first drew our attention to an object floating in sky at about 5:10 in the late afternoon. At first, the object looked like a dark dot in the sky and was too high to determine what it was even with my low-powered binoculars. Initially, I dismissed it a cluster of balloons set adrift. But then I noticed that the object was stationary which was unusual especially at this altitude. At times, it would sway back and forth to show that the object had an irregular shape. As it swayed, a lighter shade of color could be seen on its body. It was my wife's opinion that it was not balloons.  After some ten minutes, the object slowly started drifting through the sky. During this period, a small non-commercial plane, at an altitude of several hundred feet flew by between us and the object. The object stopped once again after traversing what I think were miles. We were still unable to determine what it was.  Then my son's friend alerted us to two more similar objects further out in the horizon. One of the objects slowly drifted to our direction but still not close enough to determine what it was. At about 5:40, all three objects could seen, stationary and distanced from each other by miles of blue skies.  Eventually, my attention was drawn back to our backyard activities.

Saturday August 16th we were on the beach in Seaside Oregon star gazing. We had stayed out after watching a beautiful sunset and sitting in our sand chairs with perfect weather and an enjoyable evening. Sometime after 10:00 PM we both spotted what I would call a Fast-Walker, moving from south to north in a rapid long hopping or pulsing movement. Possibly with a reddish glow to it, brightening and dimming as it pulses forward through the sky. These are very fast and you can count four or five pulses as they skip across the sky in a matter of seconds and the they are gone from view. We actually saw two of these within an hour moving in a northernly direction.  Those were exciting and I had seen one once before but what we saw at approximately 11:00 PM really excited me! I pointed and yelled out UFO, UFO, as these two objects raced across the sky in a very unusal pattern. There was no doubt that these were very annomalus. There were two objects which my wife says were gray lights. I have trouble with colors and take her word for the color. All I can say is that there were two lights and that they were speeding north paralell to each other and appeared two come together and criss-cross each others path four to five times in a steady rythm as they rapiddly sped north from the south along the Oregon coast. Kind of hard to explain a sighting that only lasted about 5 seconds and I probably wouldn't have reported just a fast moving light in the sky like a pulsing Fast-Walker that allmost seems to be common, but these twin objects or lights were extraordinary. They appeared to be lower than the other objects we had seen. Yet very high with no known noise or visible trail associated with them and what struck me as almost a playful flight pattern, zipping in and out of each others path as they streaked along. It is possible that they were not criss-crossing but mearly appeared to come together and then part in a repeated pattern as they raced across the sky, but it was my impression that they were criss-crossing and traveling extremely fast in a very exciting, annomalous sighting. There were over 50 people on the beach and about seven campfires as we did a rough head count of the activities around us as we stayed out untill about midnight on this perfect summer evening on the beach. I don't believe anyone else heard me or looked up soon enough when I shouted UFO, UFO, probably muffled by the ocean surf and distance on the wide beach.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,45.9282,-123.7093

It was 12:30 AM this morning.  My brother was going home after he visited me and my family for the day.  I saw him to his car and talked to him for a couple of minutes.  We were then distracted by green lights overhead.  The vehicles were about 100 feet high.  These objects were moving east at a velocity of 10 mph.  There were six of these objects and were all traveling together.  Some of these objects were moving erratically left and right but were all staying pretty much in formation.  Two teenager ran towards us from the left in excitement screaming what the hell are those!!?!  My brother and I did not say anything for abut twenty seconds as we were in awe.  I then told them that they looked like green glowing eggs, and one of the kids said, they are definitely not airplanes, not helicopters, their not even making any noise.  A blonde girl around 22 joined us and began watching them as well.  She was speechless.  Then a car pulled up and a 30 year old woman asked what we were looking at, we said we have no idea.  Six green egg shaped objects just flew over our heads and you can still see them right next to the tree on the left.  She said, *I See them,"" and her son said I see them too!!!!  We stood there for another 3 or 4 minutes until they just disappeared.  Ten minutes later, my brother and I saw another object fly quickly over our heads but this one was flashing a blue light.  We saw its outline as it passed overhead between us and the white cumulus clouds above.  The object was black and shaped like a disk with a very bright blue flashing light underneath.  It continued towards the east for about 400 meters then made a sharp left turn and disappeared.  That is all I can say, that is what we perceived.  Can you tell me what it was?  Did the air force pick up anything on radar at this time?  Let me know!  Thank You ((name deleted))",2003-08-28T00:00:00,47.30653737623763,-122.34290074257426

I went out to the front of my house to get a better angle away from my citrus trees.  I had a clear line of sight from my driveway.  The objects now wobbled together and one circled around the other, stop, do it again, this went on for about 45 seconds, then both began climbing rapidly westward, the one on top first, followed almost immediately by the other. At times when the two were briefly very close to each other, they seemed to form an upside down V shape, (but the haze was constantly changing shape as the objects moved,so the V shape might just be a subcouncious fabrication) There were starlike objects moving randomly within the balls of haze, at least two or three within each one. As they traveled upwards they got smaller, they circled around each other, clockwise and counterclockwise, stop, wobble and travel together again. I screamed/called my neighbor to grab his eyeglasses and come outside and tell me I wasn't imagining the whole thing.

Peter,  When I started to hear what your guest saw, I knew it was EXACTLY what I saw thru my scope last year in the spring.     I have a 4.5 reflector, observing the moon, which was in half-moon stage.  I saw this object appear from the left... transit to the right and disappear into the dark portion side of the moon.  I could see the object shining against the black of the moon, and followed it move to the right of the moon until it disappeared. I kept viewing the moon...astounded.. and the object reappeared again from the left and traveled across the face toward the right once more!   This damned thing was ORBITING the moon!   It must have been incredibly huge in order for me to have viewed it.  It is described just as your guest had told.  I could not discern a shape, just a dark silhouette on the bright side, and a sparkle of light on the dark side of the moon. From what I could tell, it wasn't in close orbit to the moon, it was some distance away from it.  It would have to be in order for me to observe it.  I have been an amateur astronomer since a child,  taught astronomy, and have spent countless hours observing the heavens.  But I have never seen anything like this before or since.   It too spooked me. I have told some people, but they dismiss it.  I considered many factors such as a satellite, high flying birds, aircraft, but all do not ""fit"" in explanation.  I have caught Earthbound objects in the eyepiece, highflying birds and planes, but one tell what they are immediately. But this unknown object behaved in a different manner. And as this thing was viewed twice in a span of three minutes, it must have been orbiting the moon very quickly.  There is something up there, but it ""ain't"" of human construction.

I had never seen a star glow like this...all of a sudden this star turns a red color and then a greenish color and then back to a white glow. We start trying to figure out whether this may be a weather balloon or some kind of plane but it's not moving. As we are talking we see much much higher up....another star doing the same. Automatically we assume this may be some kind of satelite giving off signals..which is really interesting to us, being that we had just moved from a big city and have never seen anything like this.

I and my wife were driving back from Pocatello. We were about to the raft river area on Interstate 84. I saw what I thought at first was perimeter lights to a house or a compound. The lights were on the right hand side of the road and seemed to be on top of a hill in the distance. However, after seveveral minutes, the lights stayed at their relative distance and hight. I then pointed the lights out to my wife. She thought, as I did at first, that the lights were perimeter lights or possibly lights from night skiing. Pomerel mountain was too far distant for this to be the case. We then both noticed that we were gaining on these lights. As we got closer, we could make out about 15 to 20 lights. Our speed was 75 mph at that time. When we got to the top of the incline we were traveling on, we at first lost sight of the lights. We then noticed the lights on the left side of the highway. It had crossed the highway. We could see it in a valley across from us, and we slowed to its speed, about 67-68 mph. It was about 500 to 1000 feet off the ground. At one point I could see under it and it had the outline roughly of a triangle with the courners rounded. It lit the sky above it, and it was dark grey beneath. It was at that point about less than a mile from us. I guessed it size to be about 200 to 300 feet across the back of it and about 150 to 200 feet from front to back. It was about 30 to 50 feet thick. The lights on top were all of the same color, about that of a mecury vapor lamp. We also noticed ,after the fact, that there are many farm houses and dairies in this area that this object was over during the time it was on the left of the highway. None of those lights were on as it passed over that area. It finally passed behind a mountain range. As it did, it lit up the profile of one of the montains. It was traveling south towards Nevada.

While cleaning the car I just happened to look up and saw some thing I could not make out to be a plane, it was long kind of a stick with no wings white in colour with a red kind of light at the near side end that would pulse on and off with a glowing intensity realising I was looking at some thing out of the ordinary I ran in to tell my wife and two children who then went to the back garden to look for themselves I then ran to get my binoculars and joined the wife and boys who were by now just standing there looking up at the object looking through the binoculars I could see that it had no wings and was white in colour and what seemed to be a red light looked like some kind of exhaust which would glow with such intensity that it would obscure  the object and then the glow  down to a point where you could clearly see a type of exhaust. The object was in a clear blue sky with no clouds of any type what so ever to obscure anything it was clearly visible in every way. One thing I did note was that it seemed enormous, We have a flight path right over the place we live and are accustomed to seeing lots of different sized planes at all different hights, but I did notice that at the time there wasn't any planes visible anywhere in the sky. This object seemed to much bigger than the normal sized passenger planes, and I remember quite clearly at the beginning of the sighting it was a lot lower in the sky and as the time went on it got higher and higher the last time I saw it through the binoculars it was much much higher then I have ever seen any plane at. It was going off in a westerly direction from my house and was getting harder and harder to see one thing I do regret was that I grabbed the binoculars instead of the camera.",2003-09-24T00:00:00,,

The sampler film is 11 seconds in length, and only 590 KB.  Below is Martin's description of how the taking of the video film in question transpired.  I decided to have a look at the early evening sky, camcorder at ready just in case. At about 16:15, I first spotted the unknown object quite a way off in the distance (through binoculars and spotting scope). It took me around 20 minutes before I could zoom in with the camcorder to start filming.  The sky was quite clear with just a few wispy clouds here and there. The distance is quite difficult to judge but I would say that the object was possibly around 10 to 15 miles away. I was on my own this time with no other witnesses and with the distance involved, I couldn't hear any sound emanating from the object.  All in all, I managed to film around 20 or so minutes before the object disappeared behind a cloud in the distance.The object went behind the cloud at around 17:05.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,,

I was about 12 years old delivering newspapers early in the morning in late September 1965(?). It was completely dark. I was standing at the entrance road to the old Averill School on Oakland St. when I looked up in the sky toward the south and saw a round blue circular object. At first I thought it was the moon but it was 3 or 4 times larger than the moon appears in the sky and it was a solid blue color. It did not move at all and there was no sound coming from it. There were no lights on it but it seemed to produce its own light. In other words, it didn't seem as if it were illuminated by any kind of reflected light. The object was a perfect circle and completely opaque. As I saw it, it appeared two-dimensional in the sky as the moon does. After a few minutes it began to dissolve. I'm pretty sure that it maintained its shape while it dissolved. I noticed at one point while it was dissolving that I could see stars behind it which I couldn't see a few minutes before. It eventually dissolved completely. I wondered if it might be a natural organic phenomenon of some kind but it seems to me such a thing would not be perfectly round.

I am a fifty two year old builder, married with three adult children. I was at a cricket match with friends. It was a fine day with blue sky and no clouds. If I had to estimate the size of it I would say it was about the size of a car, a small car.  We were standing in the shelter at one end of the oval looking straight out towards the other end of the oval. The object came over the top of the pine trees to our right and stopped right in front of us. There was enough time for me to gesture to my friend by touching his arm and pointing. I couldn't speak. I was renderred speachless. Not by the object but just by the shock of seeing it. It sounds so cliche that it was saucer in shape but it was and it was a distinct black on the underside and the silver of a wine bladder on top. The was no noise but if there was any we couln't hear it from where we were at the other end of the oval, and it didn't get the attention of people on the oval, that I know of. As it moved away it seemed to move in about before it went towards Para Hills at incredible speed and agian making no sound. During the time it was in front of us it was about 50 feet off the ground, and as it moved away it rose up to several hundred feet. When it sped off it did so in a straight line, then it disappeared out of sight in a split second, as though it had vanished. We expected to see reports in the paper about others who had seen it, but there was no mention of it. To this day, when we talk about it, the hair stands up on the back of my neck. I had always scoffed at other reports and they are lights in the night sky, I still do. But this was a clear day. It was about 26 years ago, but I can still see it. We have relived it dozens of times. I wish I had a camera, but I didn't and it's gone. It hasn't affected my life, and we haven't kept it a secret, and I don't expect this report will be any different to dozens just like it.

I lived in Bisbee Arizona for about twenty years, moving to Erie in 1992. In looking for accounts of an extended sighting of an aerial object in Bisbee in, I believe, 1980, I came across ((name deleted)) account on your site of another set of sightings I am not very familiar with. I do know ((name deleted)), consider him a reliable witness and he is one of the many witnesses to the 1980 affair. This was reported, years later, 30 Nov 95, in a Bisbee newspaper in an article by their staff reporter. None of the published accounts were even remotely like what I saw and carefully noted in my mind. Doing further research and field work, I found that this reporter was known to be inaccurate- to be kind about it, and even prone to gross sensationalism, this being the likely cause of the bizarre accounts published. No intended reflection on the publisher. I didn't think to remember the date of this incident but memory serves perhaps well enough. It was not hot, just comfortable, breezy and my recall of the nature of the lighting and timing and bearing of the sunset would all together lead me to estimate the time to be late winter, early spring. The news account gives the year as 1981 but I think it had to be 1980 from my own reckoning. I don't know how to contact ((name deleted)) to verify his account in the newspaper article. I'm surprised he didn't give you folks there at Citizens Against UFO Secrecy an account of the 1980 spectacle. It was truly stunning.  ((name deleted) was quite a ways further away from it but still had a good view. I and another fella, ((name #2 deleted)), stood nearly under it for quite some time. I cautiously state that we did so for 10 minutes (no watch) though it was likely quite a bit longer. ((name #2)) and I (my first name is ((name #2 deleted)) too) were Bisbee's two leading mechanical shop owners and good observers of physical/energy realities. I had worked previously as a telemetry collector/analyst in the ASA for the NSA and so was! quite familiar with spacecraft and their capabilities, even being able to make the dubiously embarrassing claim of being a rocket scientist! This event occurred at about 6pm at ((name of fuel station deleted)) station on the Bisbee traffic circle. The object was nearly directly overhead, stationary, clearly visible!! ((name #1 deleted))  was about a mile and a half away, in South Bisbee, I seem to recall him saying that when he came upon us after the object left. We were about 150-200 yards from the Lavender Pit copper mine. I arrived from Douglas Arizona as ((name #2 deleted)) was closing his station, which he customarily did at 6pm. He and I stood for a few minutes talking, each with one foot up on the front bumper of my white 53 Chev panel truck on the station parking lot in the waning sun. I then had an odd feeling, looked about, then almost straight up and was shocked to see an object had appeared and was absolutely still above us. It was over the back of the Chevron property, overlapping onto an area called the Shady Dell. The sun was just disappearing down behind the Phelps Dodge mine track embankment, as seen from where we were standing. The object itself was in full sunlight, being higher up. My hand, at arms length, would not cover it up. There was a slight breeze. ((name #2 deleted)) then looked up to see what had me agape and was himself riveted to the sight. I finally looked over at ((name #2 deleted)) and asked him, ""Do you see what I see?!"". ((Name #2 deleted)) said ""I sure do!"" We then looked it over keenly, both of us comparing notes of our observations. We were in agreement about what we were looking at. I'm sure we both had thoughts run through our minds about whether we should leave the area immediately. We didn't feel threatened at all. It was just so extraordinarily strange to be in near company with such a thing. We had no idea what was going to happen and waited with bated breath. I, at one point, cast about looking for a stone to throw up at it to try and get a clearer sense of its height above us, and it's size. Then decided my action might seem unfriendly (stone! age savages it would appear) and for that matter the stone might come down and cause some property damage. Or some antimatter reaction. I abandoned the idea. It was a fair sized object. I thought that perhaps a low humming I was hearing might be coming from the object. We talked it over and finally decided that the slight noise was 60hz hum coming from the nearby overhead electrical wires. We had a kind of feeling about the object's presence that I can't quite describe, sort of as though there were some being up there observing and aware of us. The fact is though, we never saw any sign of such a sentient being. Just the handiwork and actions thereof. We noted that many of the cars coming around the traffic circle were slowing down, somewhat dangerously, then most accelerating vigorously on through the mine track underpass, itself nearly under the edge of the object. The cars could then be heard accelerating hard away from it onto the pit circumference highway up to Old Bisbee. Nobody stopped although they could be seen leaning down and forward briefly trying to get a better look. I think a lot of those people wished they hadn't seen it, my judging their reactions as they exited the area. I remember pinching myself and slapping myself, almost jokingly, to make sure I wasn't dreaming. In fairness, I should now describe the object though there is little to be said even though it was likely within a stones throw of us. It was an oblate spheroid. In more common terms, it was like a flattened or squashed sphere. From the top or bottom it would appear to be perfectly round or circular. From the side aspect it had kind of a horizontal football shape except the ends weren't pointed but instead gently rounded. It appeared to have curvilinear symmetry above and below the arbitrary ‘belt line’. It did not revolve or move whatsoever in the gently gusting breeze. It appeared to be made of stainless steel or perhaps aluminum or titanium or beryllium with a finely brushed matte finish. The disturbing thing, to a couple! of good physical observers as us two ((name #2 deleted)), was that the thing was absolutely perfect. There were no seams, slight irregularities or distortions, plates, rivets or any other deviations from it's monolithic perfection. The nearest thing that I can call up from our technologies would be a metallic balloon somehow squashed into the oblate spheroid shape. This would have stress lines and wrinkles though. It could not possibly be perfect, as this was. It would also be bobbling in the breeze. As I stated, this object was rock steady. As well, our observer sense of it was that it was hard bodied. We peered intensely at it for a long time. It was not hard to see at all, the object was nearby in full late afternoon sunlight. Atmospheric conditions, late afternoon, were good, with some slight shadowing on the object on the side away from the sun. There was no significant cloud cover other than a little bit of scuddy, stringy stuff.  We were not in a position to see where the sun angle would have thrown the objects shadow, unfortunately. That would have been an astute observation to make. I also did not attempt to walk directly under it, which would have given us a good lateral distance and from that a better guess at height off the ground and, of course it's size. We were a little too awed, I think, to put that plan in motion, thinking that something could happen at any moment, though I thought it out at the time as I tried to estimate those parameters. Making this process even more nebulous was the fact that the object had absolutely no features except for it's shape, color and finish appearance. There were no rivets, as I said, no seams, plates, ports, lights, hatches, vents, doors, windows, antennas, pitot tubes...nada. Featureless. ((name #2 deleted)) and I both discussed this back and forth as we carefully looked it over. Nothing. Nothing by which one might then judge it's size, distance and nature. It couldn't have sat up there any stiller than it did. After quite some passage of time, it suddenly did a small maneuver, ! almost comical, like the wobble of a top as it spins down. I would relate this as being a precessional wobble as of the physics of a gyroscope spinning down through it’s structural harmonics and beginning to lose it's stability. The object wasn't spinning though, just wobbling. It was over in about three seconds, a couple of wobbles, and was instantly and fluidly moving quite steadily in the direction of the copper pit at about 10-12 miles an hour for the first hundred or so feet, which took it out of our line of sight behind the ridged embankment which carried tracks for the copper operation. It then appeared to us, visible over the tracks, in the direction and going in the direction it had originally disappeared in, approximately a mile away and going fast. It was now proceeding upwards at a steep angle at probably a thousand miles an hour, clearing the mountain containing the Queen Mine next to old Bisbee, and proceeding straight on out of sight at that angle, roughly in the direction of the setting sun. Surprisingly, considering the great speed it was now moving at, it still made absolutely no sound. These movements gave some hint as to the elevation of the object and it's size though not too reliably so. I would then estimate that it had been stationary over our heads at about 250 feet and was probably 80 to 100 feet in diameter and about 35-40 feet in height or thickness. ((name #2 deleted)) and I were surprisingly tired out by the experience and could conclude little other than what I have related. No little green men. We don't know what we saw. But we know what we saw. Paradox. It was nothing that our technologies could do then or even now unless it was an extremely realistic hologram projected from a satellite in space, as in Ronald Raygun's space based missile defense technology projects or something of that nature. I don't think so. Whatever it was, I don't think man had any thing to do with it. My memory is a little fuzzy about this but possibly ((name #2 deleted)) wife arrived at which point ((name #3 deleted)), ((name #4 deleted)) and a friend of theirs drove up, greatly excited. I can't remember the details of what they said they saw but I'm sure it wasn't what was reported in the Bisbee news 15 years later. I then left, heading out down the pit highway towards Old Bisbee. I had gotten only through the mine track underpass, through the first S turn and was just straightening out towards Bisbee Blue when I heard a tremendous, shattering roar, echoing wildly about. It kind of scared me, I hunkered down in the seat of my old truck and looked out the window to see the second astonishment of the day. A jet fighter plane on flaming afterburner, flying an extremely risque trajectory from over Warren out over the pit, to my left not a hundred feet above my elevation, going in the same direction and flight path the object had a couple of minutes before. This aircraft actually had to bank hard left to miss Sacramento hill, or what's left of it on the edge of the pit, then hard right back on track followed immediately by a hard pull up to clear Copper Queen mountain. It following the path the object had, moments previous. Obviously in pursuit. Our government knows about these things. Who is kidding who here. Breathtaking.

I had lived in the area all my life and I knew that beyond the trees was a fairly small residential area where this object was hovering.

While home on leave from the service, my parents and brother and I were returning from my grandmothers house. We were traveling on a paved road which for the most part was free of traffic. We passed maybe one car before the incident. The night sky was clear of clouds and spotted with stars. I do not recall the moon cycle at the time, but I believe it was a sliver. It all began when we were just having a conversation about the evenings visit and dinner. I was just admiring the stars out the mini vans window when I noticed something catch my eye. It was postioned to my right of the vehicle in the sky. The object was spherical and a deep blue color. At first I thought it was a plane light but i'd never seen a plane light that dark before. I quickly told my dad who glanced over as did the whole family. The object remained almost even with our vehicle. In this I mean it never traveled out of our line of sight. My dad slowed a little and my mom put down her window to make sure it wasnt a relection. After viewing the object for a couple of minutes it was my mother who stated that she something on the drivers side of the vehicle this time. In the night sky on the opposite sid eof the road was a similar object but this one was dark red. The light from these vehicles didnt pulse, didnt blink, but were constant the whole time. It was at this time that I felt a sense of awe and unbelief. Both objects kept up the same distance and speed with each other. It appeared that each was just smoothly traveling as we were. After taking in both objects, for some reason I leaned forward to look up higher and was stuned by what I saw. I pointed out an off white spherical shape positioned above the road. This would put the lights in a triangular formation. After watching them for about 3 minutes the red and blue lights lifted even with the white light. The two outside lights began to draw in towards the white light and they appeared to change position on the opposite side of the road. After this the lights then d! rew closer so they were almost side by side. They then increased thier traveling speed and quickly flew off into the night sky. It was also at that time that we came into an area with a large number of trees that obscured the objects departure.

The craft was smooth, with no visible breaks in its surface, it had no antenna, no landing gear, no intakes, or exhaust ports.  The only activity was in the lights around the center of the craft.

While patrolling a saucer shaped craft came overhead. It had a white light that shined straight down and made no noise at all that he remembered. This frightened him quite a bit and he went in the hanger where the watch supervisor was at his desk and asked him to come and see the craft. When they went back outside it was gone but the fellow who saw it was so excited that he wanted to call the Air Force early warning radar site which was also on the base at that time. The radar site said, ""Yes we saw something on radar but we get blips like that all the time."" This tells me the Air Force was very aware of what it was. Also none of us knew of groom lake at the time which was only a short jet flight from Fallon. I always wondered where they got it if it was Air Force. This was all duly entered into the VA-125 night watch log. The witness took a lot of flack over the sighting and the next day in the log someone wrote. 2100 no saucers sighted.

I have never forgotten about what I believe to be a UFO experience that happened a long time ago around the year 1977 when I was about 11 years old. I'm not too sure about the date since I was a young kid. But I figure it had to be between the years 1976-1978 because I was in Elementary School and around 10-12 years old during the time. My family and I lived on the 3rd floor of an apartment-housing complex during the time. It was one night about 9:30p.m. My three sisters and I were all sitting in my mom's bedroom in a half circle while we intently listened as my mom read to us a storybook. I was the only one directly facing my mom's bedroom window, which faces an outside courtyard with planted trees and grass near the main street of Valencia and Albion Street. During the reading, I saw what appeared to be a shadow of a large object with spinning rotating lights (red, yellow, blue, green) going around it. (Not to sure about the colors, but it had many different colors) The lights only shown dimly through the window shade and curtains but just strong enough to attract my attention. This object with the rotating lights went pass the window QUICKLY back and forth about 3-4 times totaling about 15 seconds. I wondered what that object with lights could be? After the 4th time when it passed (end of 15 seconds), I remembered calling out to everyone in the room, ""Wow, did you guys see that, those colorful light? Apparent no one noticed it except me. And unfortunately, back then when I was a kid (only boy in the family), I was always pulling jokes and teasing my sisters, therefore no one took me serious and went to the window. I must have told them at least 3 times to look at the window, because I seen something strange. But, I guess I told them to LATE, because by the 4th time (end of 15 seconds) when my brain finally registered what was happening to call out ""look"", the object had made it's final pass from behind the window shade and curtains (I thing it was just hovering/hiding along the back left side of the cement building wall or high above the building roof, I don't know). Anyway, I tried telling my family I seen something, but my mom told me to stop interrupting the reading of the story. No one believed me. At that point I got up and lift the shade and curtains aside and looked out my mom's windows. I saw nothing through the trees but I was sure there was something there. Then I decided to get a better angle view so I quickly ran to my empty and dark bedroom and look out my bedroom window, which is to the right side of my mom's bedroom window. On the left side of the building I saw this round circular object. It was about the size of a car or van but it was completely circular in form. Beneath the bottom of the circular object it had many colored bright lights built all around it. The lights were spinning. The object did not have any sound as it moved and hovered. The technology was unlike anything that we had back then or now. It was the quietest thing I ever seen. There was a large glass window on one side of the craft. This is where it gets unbelievable and really weird. But this is honestly true! I saw only the shadowy outline of three skinny figures inside the craft. It appears as if they were passing their hands over lighted panels or some how using their hands on the front of the craft that appeared to be some kind of lighted control panel to maneuver the craft. I could NOT see their faces or inside the craft clearly because it was too dark inside the craft and the spinning lights obstructed my view. I started to call out to my family once AGAIN but changed my mind, because it looked as if this craft was going to depart and it would probably be gone by the time they got to the window in the next room. Anyhow, I doubted that I could somehow convinced them to at lease get to the window in time before it flew away, they seem more interested at listening to the read! ing of my mom’s story. I was speechlessly staring at the object almost in deep wonderment for about five seconds. At that point, to my surprise, it did not fly away. In fact it flew closer to my bedroom window hovering there. At that point, although being an extremely curious and inquisitive kid, I remembered getting nervous (and it took a lot to make me nervous, I didn’t scare easily as most people- not then and not now). I remembered letting the curtains and shade go and running back toward the room door about eight steps. Then I could see the hovering object lights through the shade and the curtains silently back away from my window at a distance. I could not help but to be so curious, no one will ever believe me I thought. I decided to run back a second time to my window and lift the shade and curtains. The object was still hovering at a distance, but when I came back to the window it flew close to my window a second time. I got frighten and ran away from the window again. The object seems to sense my reaction because it withdrew from the window again at a distance. I was amazed at the QUICK precise speed and exactness it moved between our building (without hitting or smashing the walls) and without making a sound at that close level. Therefore, although feeling a little nervous, I was filled with curiosity, I decided to go back to my empty bedroom window a third time. I looked at the object hovering at a safer distance for about 8 second. At that point, I heard the voices of children in our neighborhood running and playing. Although, it was around 9:30 p.m., I remember children in my poor neighborhood always stayed out playing hide and seek real late at night (especially during the summer months-if I got the month/date correct). Anyway, I think the children in the neighborhood also seen it because I heard one of them yell, ""There it is, up there.""  Then the object begins to slowly depart higher and higher without a sound (it was weird how it did not speed off fast to conceal itself). I think it begin! s to fly toward the east of San Francisco near the freeway near Mission and Fourteen Street. I have never seen anything like that again my entire life. I was thinking, I had a pretty good unique view of the object. Since these objects usually fly in the sky, most people only see them when they have both feet on the ground. I was able to see the object eye level at my window around nine feet away. I was thinking, that is probably the reason why I was able to have a unique view of the figures inside the craft. Anyway, ever since that experience, whenever the subject of UFO comes up I always tell my wife and friends what I experienced. Since they know my characteristics, they know I seen something but they all say they find it very difficult to believe it was a UFO. I don’t blame them, because if I did NOT see it myself I would find it very difficult to believe any one also. But I will tell you one thing, for some strange reason, I wish I could see it again! I have already searched your database to see if anyone else has experienced seeing a similar strange object in the sky around the time of 1976-1978. There is ONE other record in your database, which occurred on 7/15/78. I wonder if it is the same as my experience except either he or I was a little off with the date. Since the person who recorded the event on 7/15/78 was NOT detailed as to the street and area of San Francisco, can you please tell me if the experience in your database that occurred on 7/15/78 match my experience, meaning did it happen near the SAME area as me - the Mission Area, around Valencia and 15th and Albion Street?

I was on the couch downstairs in the living room, covered up with a blanket that my mother always kept there.  Thinking my parents had decided to paint our bedroom, and had therefore moved me and my brother in our sleep, I curiously went back upstairs, and found my brother sleeping away in his own bed.  My bed had obviously been slept in part of the night, and the room was unpainted.  I had never sleep-walked before then, nor have I ever done so since then.  I determined to get to the bottom of this mystery, so I made a point to ""interview"" each of my four older sisters, to see which one of them had played this trick on me.  None ever admitted to such a prank.  At about the same time, I have another memory which in retrospect may be related to the couch incident.  I remember being outside in the backyard, looking up at our deck, which was built directly off the living room, and ""knowing"" that I could fly onto and off of, that deck.  It was more than a simple wish -- it was a conviction.  The deck was some seven or eight feet off the ground, which sloped away from the back of the house.  So adamant was I of my conviction, that I got a piece of rope (old clothesline, I think), tied it onto a kitchen chair, and wedged that chair into one corner of the deck.  Don't ask me why I did it this way, but that's the way I did it.  Once this was done, I slid down the rope to the ground, burning my hands in the process.  I had never heard of a flying saucer or UFO at this time, much less the apparent abduction phenomenon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-08T00:00:00,41.3074,-73.4947

We were walking on Riverside Avenue and went down to a field area in order to save time and take a shortcut.  I saw a dog running and barking.  I thought this was strange as I knew if a dog was barking there was someone in the field.  I am thinking at the time, a person was down here.  Believe me I was not thinking space ships.  I then looked up and there was the ship.  It was very white, round, and had lights around the bottom of it.  It was over our heads so I could not see the top of it.  It was so close to us that if you had a good arm you could have thrown a rock and hit it.   That is how close it was to us.  I was scared shitless.  This ship made no noise at all.

A strange but very real fact,Rio de Janeiro (Brazil),,1970-06-13T03:30:00,disk,1 hour ?,"Occurred : 6/13/1970 03:30  (Entered as : 06/13/1970 03:30) Reported: 11/4/2003 8:27:36 PM 20:27 Posted: 11/8/2003 Location: Rio de Janeiro (Brazil),  Shape: Disk Duration:1 hour ?",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32876.html,"A strange but very real fact  I will try to report what happened more than 30 years ago, so please consider that some details may be a little imprecise, even though as true as one can be.  I was just 17 years old and it was in Rio de Janeiro, June 1970. When the weather was nice, I and my friends used to go a suburb named Barra da Tijuca.  In the 70s, Barra as we called it, had just a bunch of houses in its first 15 miles of unspoiled beach (now the place is full of luxury skyscrapers). As everybody else, we bowled, laughed and had a wonderful time with our girlfriends in front of a paradisiacal beach. Close to the beginning there was a biological marine reserve with barbed wire fences at both sides of the beach road. There is also a nice restaurant at the Marisco rock, at the end of the 15-mile long beach.  One day however, on Friday or Saturday of the week before my 18th birthday, I was driving my girl home in my blue Opala Chevrolet from this restaurant a little after 3 AM. We were speeding fast on the bumpy beach side road to arrive at the girl’s home before her mother woke up. I was singing happily while listening to the radio and seeing the beautiful night sky with a full moon and bright stars. I was totally unconcerned while my yellow high light beams vanished the darkness ahead of us. When we started crossing the marine reserve with its fences, the radio suddenly started to give static and went completely off. I thought it was just because of a bump on the pavement. Then, the road lights also went off in a sequence of stretches, blackening out the entire beach, but this was not unusual at that year in Rio. However, to my total surprise, seconds later both headlights also went off entirely, and the ENGINE stopped!  That was something else ! We still had half a gas tank, and I felt it very strange that a motor could stop at such speed ! I had never heard of such a thing!  I hit the brakes at once and they worked perfectly (mechanic drums) while trying not to leave the road, as we were going damn fast. Since the road was perfectly straight and there were no close trees, only the beach on the right side and the long lagoon and vegetation about 150 feet on our left side, I managed to stop safely at the side of the road. Both of us were a little startled, but I dropped from the car to see if the tires had suffered any damages, but they were intact. I tried to start the engine, but it refused to go and more - there was no sign of electricity whatsoever. This puzzled me as everything had been working perfectly. I checked the circuits, cables and connections using a cigarette lighter but everything seemed OK. Well, we were stuck in the middle of nowhere, with a small chance of getting mugged, robbed or worse. I walked around to see if there was any house or lights approaching, but we were entirely alone. A wind started and I looked up to the sky, but it seemed to me that it was going to rain as I could no longer see the stars. A big round black cloud was just in top of us and I could already feel some cold and electricity in the air, just like before some storms - but the sky had not a single cloud moments before! Well, what a bad luck !  We first stayed outside near a tree, so that if a burglar came he would not find us, but as no car appeared for 10 minutes, we decided to get into the car, get some shelter and relax. The last time I looked at my clock it was about 3:30 AM. It seemed to me that I had dozed for a while, when I woke up suddenly with a loud noise coming from shaking fences, the girl screaming at my right, and a super-bright beam of light - so bright in fact, I thought it was the highlights of a motorcycle gang. The girl immediately complained from a strong headache and eye strain, but I could barely see and was not able to do nothing besides hugging her at that moment. When the lights diminished I got out of the car. First I looked around and could see the barbed wire fences stopping to shake and shivered. How strange was all that! Then I looked up to see the cloud, and noticed that the black cloud now had bright colored lights shining in a circle over us. At that time very few people cared or worried about flying saucers, and my mind was in beautiful girls not UFO’s. I guess that as I do not remember seeing people then, but a huge shape, I did not realize I was seeing a flying saucer but rather something very unusual. I met something unexpected and felt uneasy, dizzy, confused, a little scared but I do not know why, I was not in any way terrified, paralyzed or the like.  We noticed that the lights were splitting from half sides of the circle to meet at their opposite sides, going back and forth, I had a very, very strong feeling of being closely observed, tried to run back but felt suddenly weak, stumbled but continued to the car. I found the girl trembling and, ridiculously enough, we both yelled at those lights to get off. It took them a long time (10 minutes?) to leave. Then, the cloud literally exploded in light, and slowly got high in the sky above us. It took a few seconds at uniform speed to reach the beginning of the 15-mile long beach stretch (we were near the middle), and then it propelled itself to the beginning and then upwards in the direction of the open sea with a tremendous acceleration to become just a point in the sky, and join two other points. Minutes later, the beach road lights went on again, I could start the engine in the first try, the radio was OK, and we could finally get home.  I could never talk to the girl again. Her mother was really worried (read pissed off) since she had to go to the hospital because her right eye had been severely injured - her retina suffered burns and seemed to have ""dripped"" in the white sclera area. I myself had a very strong headache for almost two weeks but it went off. Months later however, I started having strong ""surges of energy"" throughout my body (I still do), have some odd dreams, premonitions and feel like floating at night (I still do sometimes). Strangely enough, for some reason (mental block, innocence ?) I can recollect fear but no panic at any moment, besides people made fun every time I tried to tell them what had occurred, so my mind repressed what happened as ""unimportant,"" and I did not made any effort to remember it clearly until fifteen years ago, during a spiritualist meeting. Spiritualists are a different kind of people who always look to expand the truth - like it or not.  As strange is the fact that, thirty years later, I got acquainted with a good friend of my wife, ((male's name deleted)), that has my own age and is also an engineer, and passed through a very similar experience in the very same week, in almost the same circumstances, and also suffered from similar after effects! He even told me the UFO had been detected by the Navy radars, Rio’s traffic air controllers, and even noted on the news. I can’t remember all these details, but later learned they were true. Anyway, by different paths, we both became spiritualists, and give ""energy healing passes,"" and are very good friends. One day I shall do a regression to dig more about this.  I obviously think the governments know all about this kind of phenomena and there is a huge cover up, which makes me wonder how far from the whole truth is ""The Great Conspiracy"" of Ernesto Bono. It is clearly much exaggerated (sometimes a total fantasy), and is poorly documented, but if just half of it is true we are in deep trouble!

The UFO was shaped something like a foot ball the length of about 2 school busses but with many white and red lights on the underside. As all of us gathered outside I mentioned to my mother we should get a picture of this. At that moment I do believe we were taken aboard the craft. I don't remember being on board but we lost about 45 min. The last thing I remember was being inside our home with both my parents as they were looking a blank T.V. screen and my brother was later found at the front of the house outside. My brother didn't remember anything about this but has been visited many times to this day only saying that he was with a small girl in all cases and she has never revealed herself. My mother only remembers the craft as they were driving home. My father doesn't remember anything to this day. At the time that this happened none of us remember this ever happening until about 8 yrs later. We still talk about this when we see one another. There are not any markings on my parents or brother but I do have a scare on my left ankle about 4 in long that I or my family do not know how it got there and is still visible today that may have been made by a surgical device and now has something visible under the skin. I'll get this looked at some day soon. I only hope that some one will read this and possibly notify me if they were in Kansas at the time and remember anything. Thank you.

The night was completely clear with no moon out. I had gone into our back yard on the east side of our house and noticed a bright light above the foothills to the east about 7 or 8 miles from me. The light looked like an aircraft landing light, staying stationary in the air, about 1000 feet above the hills. I stared at the light because it wasn't moving and wondered why it was so still if it were a small airplane. It was too bright to be a star. All of a sudden, the light took off with no accelleration toward the north. The best way I can describe how fast it took off is if you were looking at one frame of a moving film and then started the movie, you would see instant motion. The light flew horizontally and covered about 10 miles less than a second. As it flew further to the north it got farther away and I couldn't see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was in a hurry as I was late for work at the local precast factory on the outskirts of the town. As I walked along the center of town I was nearing the railway station on my left and the railway hotel on my right. the hotel had a large tower to it . It was a beautifull morning only a few wispy clouds high up. I happened to gaze at the top of the tower and was suprised to to a small ultra white perfect triangle shape in the blue sky. i thought at first it was a cloud but then relised that the edges were too perfect and straight to be a cloud. if i were to have lifted a 10 pence piece up at arms length I would say the objects three outer points would have extended beyound the coins  covering . Then suddenly from the triangle appeared three disk of the same colour each snakeing out from the central object in different directions and then stopping short. the three then swirled about one seaming to hover over the local army ordanance stores behind the railway station and then returning to the main triangle . as it aproached the main object the other two swooped towards it and merged with it and then all disk vanished. The triangle was now moving and heading off at an even pace towards Grangemouth . Grangemouth has the largest ICI plant in the country. I followed it as far as I could and then i enterd the factory and told a few mates but by the time we got back out to view it it was gone. I have never seen another sighting since.

Very close. While chatting with my friend i looked accross the street. And i glanced up, up above a house accross the street. There were tall trees directly behind this house. And what i saw was a ring of lights in a circle. It was very large, bigger than a couple houses put together. The lights were different colors, they were very bright alsmost glowing. They were in a horizontal plane above this house, just sitting there. And i said what the heck is that, well putting it nicely. My friend said i dont know. I said thats not normally there, and she said no. And i said its not making any sound. It was close enough we should have heard some sort of noise . I mean it was directly accross the street from us. I said well it cant be a balloon  becuase a balloon would have fire, and would not be out at night anyway. Then all of the sudden it started moving. It was almost directly over the house accross the street from us, and directly above the trees. It started moving away from us. There was no sound. It was so strange. Anything that big, should have made noises, and that close. It did not move up it went sideways , horzontally. Away from us. Almost as if it knew we were looking at it. Before it moved it was just sitting there above the trees, then it just started moving , away from us. So i said lets get in the car and chase it , and get another look, but by the time we went around the block , it was gone. I thought about calling the police, but said noone would believe us. So ive only told a few people about this, and most people say they believe me. Scince this happened to me, im always watching the skys. Hoping to see something again.

The object emittted a sound like a radial aircraft engine.  I saw and heard a similar object flying in circles over my home immediately after September 11, 2001.

The two seperate lights caught up to each other, in a leap frog fashion, each crossing and catching up to the first. Both were evenly lit from below, and in the area we were in, could not have been lit from below. I listened as well, given the low cloud cover, and could not hear any sign of aircraft noise. I have extensive experience in video, as well as audio and have filmed both cars at high speed and planes. I have seen and videotaped everything from A-10's to F-14 and F-16 aircraft, as well as Stealth aircraft at near and far range. With the cloud cover, the noise should have been obvious as the sound would have been reflected by the clouds. There was no perceivble sound. Both points of light disappeared into a cloud bank and we saw nothing more after that.  I immediately started running through things in my head to make sure I had time and distance and direction. My girlfriend was freaked out that I was so freaked by the situation.  I also have experience in visually tracking satellites and other space based objects, and nothing I have experience with could explain what I saw. As mentioned, the two objects converged on each other and diverged at a fairly high rate of speed, and remained consistently lit.

I noticed it and told my friend I thought it was the balloon that transmits Radio Marti to Cuba. (Many people may not know-the US government has a large balloon loacted at Cudjoe Key, FL that transmits Radio Marti to Cuba). I have seen the balloon in the daytime and assumed that's what I was seeing last night. Right away I noticed we were still far away from Cudjoe Key. At first I thought maybe they put another balloon up. Anyway, as we got closer to whatever it was, I noticed the lights were very noticeable. I saw a red light and a green light. I was concentrating on seeing if it was a balloon, so I was looking mostly below the lights. I noticed it was not attached to anything and there was no tower below the lights. It was also too low to be a plane. My friend was looking out the passenger window and said he saw a white light and a red light. He did not see the green light that I originally saw. When we got closer to the lights, they moved from my side of the truck because the road hadn't curved but I couldn't see them anymore. My friend said whatever it was moved, and he saw it more over the road. He saw a red and white light 100 to 250 feet hovering directly over the highway. He also saw a black mass between the lights in what looked like a triangle but didn't totally point at the top. From his account the white light was on the top and he saw a red light on the corner of one of the bottom of the points. There was never any sound it made. We opened the windows of the truck when we were close to it, and it was just quiet. I kept driving looking for a place to turn around because there was a car right behind me. I had to go about 1000 feet before I saw a driveway to turn around. When we went back, there was nothing there. No lights, and we looked to see if there was anything in the air it could have been, and again nothing. It was as if it just disappeared. We had not had anything to drink last night or anything like that. We shared a pack of cheese crackers but I don't think that would give us any hallucinations.

The light reflected off of it but not a flashy or metallic type of reflection. The object moved northboound just over us as we drove southbound.

They were also egg shaped but grey, non-mettalic. The white egg shape then changed shape slightly into a smoothened diamond like shape about 200ft above and North of me. The two grey craft stopped in mid-air and the white craft joined them briefly in a delta formation over our heads. The white craft then again sped off towards the north a few hundred feet. The two grey craft quickly went straight up and dissapeared. The white craft followed us slightly southbound as we drove off then sped off. I took several pictures with my camera which has special black and white film that I'll need to take to special lab to process, not a one hour service. There were several car salesmen in the lot of the dealership I had pulled up in front of. The car salesmen also saw what had occured.

To bank a turn as this object did and traveling at a high rate of speed only leads me to one thing...it had to be a UFO!  A few seconds after banking the turn, it shot away.  There's nothing I know of that can travel like that and cover so much sky in only about 25 seconds!  I have been a sky watcher for a number of years and I have never seen anything like this before.  I have observed other crafts and twice I've had cases of missing time.  But this sighting proves to be the most fascinating one yet! ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) Too much distance covered in such a short time On the sepcified time and date, I witnessed an object flying at a very high rate of speed.  I was outside having a cigarette and was admiring the night sky as I often do.  I've been a sky-watcher for a number of years since my first sighting in Aug. 1991.  There were some very high, thin clouds and some airplanes visible at the time.  The object appeared from the west and moving toward the east in the direction of the moon.  After about 15 seconds, it was quite near the moon.  Then it banked a turn and moved toward the northwest.  The object appeared as though it was out of our atmosphere.  It appeared to be as high as some of the stars.  After banking toward the northwest, it slowed down considerably and then shot away after about 10 seconds.  It left no trail and there was no visible tail.  It did not appear to have the characteristics of a satellite or any known aircraft that I've ever seen!!  I have been watching the heavens since my first sighting in 1991 when my car was approached by a solid white orb and I was left with 1.5 hours of missing time...as was the passenger in my vehicle that night.  To have seen something flying that high and appearing only slightly larger than any of the other stars that were visible through the coud cover, it suggests that the object may have been quite large.  It did not twinkle like other stars and to have covered such a large area of the skies, I am inclined to believe that this was a UFO.  I am wondering if anyone in the area saw the same thing I did?

I got a good fifteen minutes of what I saw in the sky. What I saw in the sky were objects spaced apart from each other that looked like stars. Some were up high in the sky and others were moving by the horizon. Of course, where I live I could not see the moon and that made it better. Now these UFO's, when looking into the camera at them had a circular look to them and one was white another was blue, and the others were pulsating different colors. The white one was just white and it would move to the left and then to the right when my back was turned. It was a very extreme movement in the sky. The blue one was pulsating and it moved very slowly and again only when my back was turned.  Later on in the film I noticed some by the horizon and when I mean some I mean a few. At first I only saw two moving East, and these lights were very bright but faraway. When you look at them through the camera they were white like a ship or pulsating with multiple colors. I then saw one or two more by the horizon moving East. These were to my farther left but were moving East. They weren't moving fast, and the oddest thing about these UFO's is that they looked like very small planets but they also were white when zoomed in upon and looked like they had a black spot in the center of the UFO but to the far right of the center but not close enough to touch the end of the circular objects. I know it wasn't my camera because I saw this on all the bright UFO oblects that I saw. It almost seemed like an invasion! The reason why I say this is because this is the first time I have witnessed UFO's and I saw five to six of them in one night, and mind you these were perfect circles. These were awesome and I got fifteen minutes on tape. I hope I see more tomorrow night, and the funny thing was that after I saw these objects I still saw the first one when the others were gone and I filmed them all in order of how I saw them, and my Grandpa also! witnessed it but he believes it was satellites but these were bigger then satellites. My camera also stopped zooming in or out at times but I don't know if that had anything to do with the UFO's.

It was a clear sunny day at around 11:00 AM. I was riding my bike to Lanikai from Kailua beach, and at the top of a small hill that overlooks the ocean, near Flat Island, I saw two lights that were horizontaly a short distance from eachother. they sped along to the right, away from Flat Island. They appeared to be farther away than the island, but I cant tell for sure because I never saw them go behind the island. They were barely above the water, and they frequently disappeared behind the swells, then reappeared a few seconds later. They only moved in one steady direction, and appeared to be going quite fast, if I had to estimate I would say around 60-70 mhp, although it was impossible to tell for sure because the distance from me was impossible to tell. They looked a lot like the type of like reflected by shiny metal. It was not putting out its own light, rather reflecting the sunlight. I couldnt tell the shape of the crafts because they were entirely covered by the bright reflection. If I was to estimate a size or shape, I would say not more than 3 feet across, apparantly as a sphere. As they traveled, the distance between the two lights appeared to remain EXACTLY the same, they didnt spread out or come closer together. I am sure it wasn't a boat, becuase there was nothing under the lights when the came clearly into view above the choppy waves. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then, all that changed.  Carrie Martin told The Chronicle Monday that she was afraid at first that ""people would think we're crazy"", but she said she and her husband had just passed the Corinth Fire Department when they first saw it. They were approaching the new home of their neighbors, Bryce and Michelle Moss on Corinth Road, when they saw something in the sky to their left.  Sparks which appeared to be several inches long were coming from the unknown object in the sky. Carrie Martin said it was just high enough to cross over utility lines. It crossed the road and struck a tree on the Moss property.  ""There was a car directly behind us so we couldn't just stop,"" she said. They turned around after a short distance and returned to the scene. ""It was in the tree,"" Mrs. Martin said. They could still see the sparks and the ""ground was catching fire.""  They drove to Bryce and Michelle Moss's present home and reported the situation to them. Mrs. Martin dialed 911 and got Union County Communications Department who advised they call on a ""land line."" Mrs. Moss called Cherokee Communications who said they had already been notified by Union County.  The incident occurred about 6:15 Sunday night, Mrs. Martin says.  The Corinth Volunteer Fire Department answered the call and extinguished the fire. Chief Doug Bowers said that after a conversation with the eyewitnesses, fire department personnel shined a light into the top of a tree where the object crashed. Chief Bowers said departmental personnel spotted a shiney object about 20 feet off the ground in the tree. The object appeared to be about six inches wide, Chief Bowers said.  Cherokee Communications Department contacted the Federal Aviation Administration who said they had had no reports of any plane in the area having any difficulty.  Bowers said FAA officials said they had no idea what had been spotted in the skies of rural Cherokee County. ""They called it a 'headscratcher',"" Bowers said.  Carrie Martin said she and her husband went back to the scene on Monday but could not find the shiney object in the tree. Too, they checked the brush area which had burned and found nothing suspicious.  Mrs. Martin said she wondered if what fell could not have been some piece of the experimental objects that are placed in the atmosphere by the United States or some other government.

I was looking at the sky (South, South East) at approximately 8:56 pm EST when I saw two rapidly pulsating lights just appear - approximately 3 inches apart in the sky. These lights were pulsating in a sequence of 3 rapid bursts, a slight pause, and then 3 more rapid bursts. Most air craft are displaying a regular and consistant blinking of the light. The intersting part of this is that the lights maintained the exact same distance apart (from my perspective) during the entire time they traveled thru my field of vision ( my field of vision was quite large ). The speed at which they were traveling seemed much faster than the average air craft. If, in fact this was one object traveling thru the sky, it must have been moving at an increadable rate of speed and must have been extremely large.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,42.48409310344828,-75.04896379310345

The sound stopped as quickly as it had started.  4:00am She woke again to a flickering light (like sheet lightening) in the bedroom and thinking it was lightening waited for the thunder to come.  When there was no thunder sound she thought this was weird and once again looked out our bedroom window (facing east) and saw four lights stationary in the sky, which then quickly disappeared (travelling away from her).  I woke up while she was looking out the window and there was no question that she was awake and actually saw something.

It was a clear cold day the sky was bordering on very pale blue to white. Sometimes the object would look black next to the brightness of the background sky and as it moved it would appear metalic. The object was silent and didn't appear to be moving from side to side although i think it was but very slowly indeed if at all it was. The most interesting thing was the other movements it made. The object seemed to be very slowly moving in a circular way as if piveted in the middle. It's hard to explain really, because of the shape sometimes it would appear like a rod but as it moved round you could only see one end of the rod so then it would appear small and circular. It wasn't changing shape but it seemed that way due to the smooth movements it was making. It seemed big ang close but as there was only sky around it was hard to determine the size and distance away from me. I live in a busy town so i'm sure somebody must have seen it. The object then seemed to become very small very quickly but I still wouldn't say it changed shape but moved very high in the sky with undescribable speed giving the illusion that it had become smaller. When it was moving as if on a pivet it would move slowly in a circular movement but only for about 90 degrees then it would move back the opposite direction. It wasn't a balloon.

I didn't think this was a meteor because it was to large to be a meteor that burned in the atmospere (unless this meteor didnt burn up much).  This object resembled a flare, but it couldn't have been that either due to flares having a longer light life.  This couldn't have been a firework due to it making no sound, I dont think it did anyway.  The object was seen just over the tree line less than a quarter mile away.

Shooting at the sky and blocking the sun out with the eve of my house and only seeing the rays of the sun,I filmed about 30 minutes of ""unidentified flying objects"". It was a clear morning, this past Sunday. Living in the county there are no tall buildings,just open sky around my house and tall trees. I started off by having the roof of my house in the lower portion of the filming, for reference points and for focus. While getting my house in the lower portion of the vedio, and looking out & up from the view finder, I notice a light shadow coming up from behind my house, where I was filming and Luckily caught a dark, saucer, disk shaped UFO going straight overhead. It was about the size of a pea at arms lengh. And lasted til out of the view finder.  In this 30 minutes of filming in the front and in the back of my house, up toward the sky and blocking the Sun,there are at least 3-4, maybe more of these in the film.  They seem to blend in with the rays of the sun, but if you shoot away from the Sun, you can catch them on film, and they appear to be what I would call it, invisable; but,you can make out their shape and see them go across the sky, make turns and motion in their movements.  You see the saucer or disk shapes and as they move, and as the Sun reflects off them. It looks like a white spot going across the sky when, I guess the Sun shines directly on them. Then at the correct angle you can see the saucer shapes.  They move in and out of the film and are definatly saucer or disk shaped and in motion.

If the ""UFO's"" were in fact in proximity to the Sun from the vantage point of one witness, from another vantage point, they would be in an area of the sky farther away from the Sun, and therefore clearly visible in the daytime sky.

He was outside his home and reports seeing three very bright lights sitting over the Rocky Mountain Range. He reports watching them for approximately three minutes before they all blinked out at the same time. The witness reports that the lights were white/yellow in color. The lights did move around from side to side, up and down which the witness found very strange. He also reports that the lights moved individually, not together as one unit. Due to the distance the fellow was to the lights, which as a long ways away, he said they were fairly close together when looking from his location.

I have enjoyed your articles on Rense, and thought perhaps you would be interested in my story, or could point me to someone who would care to investigate.  I live about 10 miles east of Cloudcroft, New Mexico, in a rural subdivision bordered by the Lincoln National Forest. On Nov. 28, 2003 at about 1pm I was walking my Akita Nikki in the National Forest and came upon a dead elk laying in a shallow ravine. The elk was no more than 200 yards from our subdivision, and perhaps half a mile from my house. There is a substantial elk population in the area, and sightings are not unusual. The dead elk was a small one, the length of which from chest to rear end perhaps 4 feet, and weighing maybe 400-600 pounds. Rigor mortis was full and complete. There was no apparent bloating. Nor was there any evidence the elk had been gutted by a hunter, as there was no apparent longitudinal incision on the lower abdomen/chest area. The head had been removed, as if cut from the body right where the neck joins the body, and the vertebrae stuck out from the cut area about 6 inches or so, ending in a smoothly sliced vertebrae. So far one would suspect a trophy hunter possibly who just killed for the head to mount on their wall, eh? However, I believe this elk to be much too small to have had any significant antlers (maybe no antlers at all).  Now for the really interesting part. As you can see by the photo I am sending you, the rectum of this elk has been smoothly cored out. Further, the genitals have been removed, and there is no obvious way to tell the sex of this animal. The removal of the genitals could be attributable to animals perhaps (we have mountain lions and bears, as well as coyotes) as the removal does not appear  to have been in such a clean, surgical fashion upon my limited observation. I will allow you to draw your own conclusions.  You may reach me via email, or at (deleted by HBCC UFO) for any further info I failed to give you. I will be happy to assist further in any way, plus provide additional photos. Also, if it will lend credence to this situation, I am a former Federal investigator, as my wife was also. The elk is carcass is still on site for investigation.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

Multiple lights flashing and appeared to be changing in shape. I will have each of them write up a separate statement.  The object then SINKS on the horizon VERY SLOWLY. As if to land? This lasted a good total of 20 minutes as of us able to view it. AND it was HUGE. Biggest I have ever seen for the distance.  Hubby had to leave and the boys were a little shell shot. They just couldn't believe what they saw. I continued to watch and a JET came in or at least it sounded like one and I grabbed my camera and keys and went to my car to pursue it.

When I looked away (to check for on coming traffic) to make a left (heading west) the target was no longer their.  I scanned the horizon to reacquire the target, but it was gone.  I do not believe it was a plane (to large, no contrails,and not the right shape), at first I thought a blimp, but I could have easily found the target again as a blimp cannot deviate so drastically as to appear to vanish.  The day was cold (approx 33 degrees); the sky had very little clouds (the thin ones that are high in the atmosphere), However, nothing could have obstructed my view.",2003-12-19T00:00:00,42.0178,-71.0242

It was then I noticed the ufo appeared to be dark in color, indicating to me the ufo was made of a hihgly reflective material.It was also more of a disk shape rather than a sphere.This sighting took place in broad daylight just before sunset and when it moved in front of the cloud it appeared to be ""white"" in color.The 2nd object appeared ""white"" in color at all times for the duration of the sighting.The clouds were moving rapidly from Northeast to Southwest. This is a rough estimate of direction.Winds were approx. 10 MPH. The objects moved AGAINST the wind.

I was stopped today in the mall and pulled off to the side. A lady who I know very well wanted to tell me about something she and her husband and two children witnessed on December 8, 2003 at approx: 8:45 p.m.  Her husband had just picked her up from a friends house and they arrived back home shortly after. They pulled into their long driveway only to see the two kids standing outside yelling and pointed towards the mountain behind their home. The husband stopped the car quickly and both parents jumped out in fear as they had no idea what was wrong, thinking the worst. They almost immediately noticed a white oval shaped object sitting stationary over the back of their property.  The oval shaped object had a solid ring of blue lights which seemed to be moving around the white colored object. A slight and annoying hum could be heard coming from it. The Mother went over and grabbed the two children and went into the house with them, Dad followed close behind. They thought it would be safer than standing outside as they had no idea what is was they were looking at. Once inside the home, they proceeded to a back bedroom, closed the door behind them as not to allow any light from inside the home to give away where they were. (feeling frightened at this time)  But still curiosity was getting the best of them. So they watched the object, still sitting in the exact spot from when they first noted it. The family told me the trees which were below it were all lit up in a white light, and for a good distance around the area. After a total of approx: 4 minutes of watching this unusual craft, it slowly started to move. As it did so the witnesses claimed they could see sparks dropping off the bottom side of it. The sparks were reported to be a white in color. They told me that there was no quick moment to the object, it just rose up rather slowly and as it reached the top of the mountain this is where they lost sight of it. The craft did not blink out, they thought it just crossed over the top and maybe moved down the other side. They reported that whatever it was, was huge.  The husband told me it was not a helicopter, no way !! He said we were very close to this thing, and what noise it gave off was minimal, except for this consent humming sound. The husband also said area residents would have been blind not to see this as it was so bright and large in size.  HBCC UFO Note: After I talked with the witness in the mall I made arrangements and did go to visit the whole family earlier today. I sat with all of them for a long period of time and I can say this for certain. I believe they saw something really strange as everyone was still very excited over what they saw that evening. I also will be going back tomorrow to look around the area where this object was reported to be hovering.

I thought it was an rocket from the air base but it sat there in the sky for almost 30 min. Then it began to sink into the horizon out of my point of view. It could be a star but this would have been the birghtest star I have ever seen. It looked like it was definitley inside our atmosphere. Simply because I could not see any stars around it. The only stars I could see were directly above me. The stars above me were very dim due to the marine cover that was setting in. We are due for rain tomarrow so the clouds are building off the coast. The light was west of me so it was in the direction of the fog on the horizon but I could see it like it was right in front of the marine cover. I could see lots of planes flying around in the sky mostly five at a time. I saw two jets one below the object and one above it fly past the object coming from the south. I could tell they were jets because of how fast they moved past the object from such a great distance. It looked like alot of activity in the sky all at once then when I couldn't see the object because it went below my point of view I saw less and less air traffic. I am used to seeing bright stars in the sky but this was not a bright star it was inside our atmosphere.

I showed it to my wife and we observed it together. The shape appeared to be like a cylinder with the center part being narrower than the extremities. The object was about half an inch if I would size it with my fingers and had a solid white color with no visible wings and was flying East very fast and silently. There was no trail. I was trying to identify the object but could not. The speed and the shape appeared out of the ordinary. Was it a missile?

I was contacted a while back by a gentleman by the name of Mark who had told me he had some excellent footage of a UFO, or an unknown object which he took on August 11, 2003 using his new JVC mini DV, GR-d90 camcorder.  Mark's wife was the first to take notice of the unusual object.  She was standing in her kitchen at the time. She moved quickly onto the deck of the family's home and was surprised, or should I say shocked to see an unknown object hovering over the trees close by. She said it flipped over and it turned a bright blood red. She screamed to her husband to come quick to watch this strange thing in the sky.  As he arrived on the deck he saw a cigar shaped object.  He thought quickly,  ran back into their home and grabbing his brand new camcorder he scanned the sky for the object and began filming. Eventually when he lost sight of the object he went back inside and played the tape over and over.  To his surprise and everyone else's .. what he saw completely shocked him.  Mark quickly contacted Peter Davenport at the NUFORC in Seattle, Washington in the United States to file a report and told Peter what he had caught on tape. Mr. Davenport passed the report onto myself (HBCC UFO Research) and Gavin McLeod. Gavin made arrangements with Mark to visit him  and take his report and to view the video footage.  A couple of days after speaking with Gavin, Mark sent out a portion of the footage to myself, Gavin McLeod, Mr. Jeff Rense and a number of others who may have found the Quick Time Player UFO footage of some interest.  Many did find it interesting but one  immediately ruled it as ""a helium filled foil balloon"".  ""This material below is from my observations of this tape.""  Mark and I corresponded and discussed the video footage. In one of our telephone conversations he mentioned that he'd not bothered to slow the tape down. When the running speed of the footage was slowed down greatly, some interesting things started to appear. Mark suggested sending me a copy of the original tape he'd filmed so that I could have a better look at it.   When it was slowed down it was apparent that this was no ordinary ""helium filled balloon"".  As the fellow started filming, the object drops down from the sky, then enters from the top of the screen.  Mark at this point has the camcorder zoomed in and catches the object making sharp turns as it goes down, moving to the right, then back to the left, drops down, moves right and back to the left, always making sharp movements downwards until it disappears very quickly........  Mark was still filming when the object left his view.... however when the film was seen slowed down .... it was still there. It had moved rapidly across the sky. One blink and it would be missed !   Suddenly in the distance one can clearly see it re-appearing and entering the camera's field of view looking like a white dot in the sky. As it travels a great distance to the east, over a good portion of the sky, with a reflection that could have been caused by the sun ...  it finally disappears.  What it does next is very interesting.  From out of the east (its position where it disappeared) .. it reappears, still glistening, and travels west at a steady pace.  At one point it makes a complete stop.!!!  Then it moves south towards Mark's position.   When using the Quick Time Player to view his footage one can notice that Mark zooms in on the object and catches what looks like an aura surrounding it ... for a short period of time.  He also films what may be the underside of it, until it slowly moves away, turning on its side, taking on a clear saucer shape and  it appears to be discharging a dark unknown substance.  The strange discharge occurs  twice.  One from the left side of the object and the other from the right.  Again Mark tries to find the object in the sky but can't seem to locate it. He zooms back out and finds nothing.  He continues his search  zooming out and in and for a split second he captures it once again in the very spot he was searching and where previously there was nothing.  The camera again picked the object up and it seemed to come out of nowhere and was gone again as quickly as it appeared.  Regarding the Quick Time Player internet clip..... I have heard a number of things about the footage, but not once have I heard anyone mention the discharge which comes off the object just after it flattens out and before it disappears from view  (or when the object is lost due to Mark trying to focus in on it). If you take a good close look at the internet footage, you will notice two of these types of discharges , one to it's left and the other to its right. )  I found it interesting when viewing the footage that the day before, on August 10, 2003, Mark was filming his family's visit to the Abbotsford Airshow, which is a major happening every year and draws aircraft from all over the world.  The video footage clearly shows an aerial display of known aircraft  taking place the day before the sighting happened.  One other note I would like to make, which I found to be very important also, was the remark made by Mark's mother-in-law who was speaking in her native Romanian tongue as she watched the object perform in the sky.  She made a comment and Mark translated for me... ""the bottom of it has turned brilliant bright red"".  Conclusion:  1. The object makes extreme sharp maneuvers. 2. The object travels at a great distance and then returns from the direction it came from. 3. At one point in the video, the object comes to a complete stop and hovers. 4. The bottom of the object changes it's color to almost a blood red. 5. The object ejects  a black substance on two occasions. 6. In some parts of the film it travels at an extreme rate of speed. 7. In one portion of the tape the object looks like it has an aura around it. 8. There were a number of witnesses to this sighting.  What the object is for sure I am not certain.   It was extremely interesting, extremely puzzling, and who knows what it was.??  I spent hours viewing the video .. over and over again.... at all types of speed to try and determine what it might have been .. all to no avail.   I enjoyed it immensely and found it very exciting.   With Mark's permission I will be forwarding it on for further examination.

She hollared over to me and her best friend (11 years young) to look at something weird. We took the few steps down the back porch to get the view she had. She was aprox. Instantly we noticed the strange craft. It was a charcoal colored disk with a center that was shining. The color of the light was a whiteish/blue and simliar to the color of electricity. This craft was...guesstimating here....about the size of a larger helicopter. It seemed to fly at a slow speed. I would compare it to a car going 30 mph. I have no idea as to how high up it was. Again, I'll compare it to something familiar. We often have medivacs cruise thru here everyday or so. They seem to be heading to Seattle or out to the VA hospital area (Fort Lewis). Well, I'd say that this craft flew a little higher than theses helicopters. It made no sound and was in no hurry. I checked the wind direction to decide if it was being blown but it was not the wind doing this. It was moving in a straight direction towards Puyallup Valley area which is aprox 5 miles from my Eastside neighborhood. I feel foolish now for mocking all of those silly spaceship/UFO shows from the 50's/60's. It didn't look like a man made object. The way it moved was unlike anything I've seen. And the shiney light, (probably blinding if you were 500 feet or so closer), seemed to be an energy source. Perhaps the sun? It also seemed to be reflecting the sun and maybe that reflection is maybe why it seemed so shiney and  the color of lightning. To my shock, this darned thing was a flying saucer.

I am a truck driver.  Circa 0500 on Saturday 16 August 2003 I was picking up a loaded trailer from a warehouse at McClellan AFB / Industrial Park in northeast Sacramento, California.  At the time it was still dark, there were no other persons or traffic observed inside McClellan, and the industrial parking lot area where this happened was very well lit.  I had picked up my load and was driving out slowly when I noticed an unexpected light formation in my left mirror.  I watched for a short time.  I am accustomed to commercial airline traffic from Sacramento International, and the now sparse military traffic into and over McClellan.  This one caught my attention because it was on the wrong course for normal traffic out of SAC, the wrong time of day for traffic into McClellan, and too low and slow and too bright.  It was unusual enough that I stopped the truck, shut down the engine, and got out to have a look.  The aircraft or UFO approached from NW, bearing est. 315 degrees, directly for McClellan.  This is east and north of normal flight paths for departing traffic out of SAC.  It was also too low for departing SAC traffic, and not climbing.  As it approached, I could see that it was low, est. altitude no more than 1,000-1,500 feet, and slow, est. speed about 100 kts.  It approached and made a button-hook turn south, then east, then est. due north, over the south part of McClellan, with a turn radius est. 1/2 mile, then departed est. due north until it was out of sight without climbing.  While over McClellan it was for approximately 30 seconds sufficiently well lit by the parking lot lighting to get a good clear look.  The AC/UFO was a flying wing - no fuselage, no empennage.  The wings were swept at an angle of 90 degrees at the apex, and very long, est. 200-300 feet, with a high aspect ratio.  Near the tip of each wing were two very bright white lights shining directly down, and at the apex were two very bright white lights shining directly down, one of each pair near the leading edge, one near the trailing edge.  There were no position lights visible (green and red on right and left wing tips, respectively, red and white at tail - since there was no tail), which I believe conclusively proves that this was not an ""ordinary"" AC, since all are required to display position lights at all times (except military ops in restricted airspace).  There were no strobe lights, and the visible lights were not landing lights, since they pointed straight down, not forward.  There was enough ambient light from the very bright parking lot industrial lighting, and the AC/UFO was low enough, that the underside of the wings could be clearly seen to be either white, or light gray or light blue.  The AC/UFO flew nearly directly overhead, at a straightline distance of no more than est. 1,500 feet from where I stood, and was silent - or at least inaudible at 1,500 feet.  No engine noise of any kind.  Definitely not a helicopter!  My hearing is very good, my vision is 20/15 as of my last physical, June 2003.  Total time of observation est. 3-4 minutes.  When I got back in the truck the clock time was 0506. ((FOLLOW UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Peter Didn't share with anyone there, just several friends.  McClellan is decomissioned and is now an industrial park, the only remaining military activity is a clinic and civilian contractor aircraft maintenance.  Nobody else around as far as I could tell while I was there. It was an interesting siting.  I have a private pilot's license, and have been an airplane watcher as long as I can remember.  It didn't take long to realize that this was something I hadn't seen before.  Whether it was a ""real"" ET UFO, or a classified military or experimental type, I have no way of knowing.  But big, slow, and silent, without position lights, and on an unusual flight path, sure got my attention. ((END))",2003-09-24T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

These object were high in the sky, I would estimate 3000-4000 feet ?  As I looked more closely they began zig-zagging from one side of the highway to the other in a wide sweeping sharp motion. All this time the 3 objects were flashing and seemed to be chasing or following each other. They accelerated ahead of me , still seaming to follow the highway. They kept zig-zagging back and forth in sharp motions, NO aircraft that I ever saw could make these fast sharp-hard-left to right changes and stay airborne.  Much less 3 following each other in the same manor. The entire crafts were all plusing or flashing from back to front, after 2 to 3  minuets of observation they made  abrupt 90 degree verticle turns and headed straight up, vanishing in the nights' sky.  It almost seemed like they were buzzing the highway, or observing the the many cars with  head & tail lights on traveling at 65-70 MPH, along the highway.  It was hard for me to see exactly what these craft looked like because of the dark-sky and the objects were plusing off & on. I can say that they didn't seem to be very big, and they seemed to be Cigar shaped vs Saucer shaped, much more rocket or missle-like. It also seemed that they were flying Very close to each other,about a ships length apart. They flew so close together it looked like they were towing each other or connected in some way.

Realizing that Bowling Green has a small airport, I at first thought it was an aircraft of some sort.  But then I began to notice that the object was not moving at all, and it was hovering silently in the same position.  There was no sound at all from the craft that I could hear.  I was now close to the Church of Later Day Saints on the Cave Mill Road, and the object was still hovering silently in the same spot.  Then all of a sudden the bright red pulsating glowing light somehow became smaller, and I could see that the object was triangular in appearance.  The object had a red pulsating light glowing underneath it, and also two smaller white lights on the back tip ends of the triangle.  I immediately pulled into the Church of Later Day Saints parking lot to observe the craft some more.  After watching it hover for close to five more minutes, the craft then began to slowly move away to the southwest.  The object was still so bright that I could see it moving away slowly for several miles before it finally disappeared.  This was indeed a very strange incident, and it DID happen.

They are  seen 1/2 to 2 hours after sunset.There is a pattern in that they"" light up"" in the same latitude (34 deg +/- 1deg), which is the same line that approximately connects Los Angeles and Phoenix. The longitude is ( 117 deg +/- 1deg ), coincidently is the same as Spokane where very similar ongoing phoenomena is observed. Interestingly, Yermo, CA,  where a recent landing was reported (Oct 03), falls on that same line. About half of these objects pass over,usually off white or yellow, brighten up at a certain point for 10-20 seconds then  go back to normal and continue on. The other half brighten up and simply terminate or end in a ""spiral reentry""of some sort. Ninety percent of this type of object eminate from the south and are on a northerly path. A few fly N-S or W-E. Even fewer go E-W. They are up around 250 miles. (height determined from crude angular measurement then calculated. This method checks well with the ISS). The S-N objects are the most ""colorful"", N-S and E-W usually just pass on by. A third of the W-E will display an event. As many as 4 objects have been observed flying in a parallel formation with no other events seen. Formation flying is at about 350 miles high and tend to go the southeast. Other on going observations include stationary strobing lights (1to 4 strobes). Some of the single strobe lights will cast a shadow.

I heard you mention your sighting on Art's show in the past and said it sounded like my experience, but your sighting in 54 was a little late for mine.

The sun was setting or actually down, but at that altitude I still had light. All this was SOP. After a while of cruising out over the water, I spotted a light approaching below and infront of me, about 10 miles away. Assuming it was one of the other aircraft I was looking for, I set up an attack run on the assumed plane, rapidly descending, going to full power, reversing course to slide into a ""6 o'clock"" firing position on the target plane which was at about 33,000.' As I was turning in the descent and by then going just supersonic, about 1.1M, I realized I'd misjudged the other's speed which put me in a ""sucked"" trail position. Nevertheless my speed was adequate to start closing on the other aircraft. Shortly the plane came onto my gunsight radar and I was pulling it into  machinegun range. The light was getting much brighter, but I was not close enough to make out its shape visually in the dusky light. At about the time I reached simulated firing range, the other aircraft made an immediate, 90 degree ""change of direction"" which was not a turn as we would know it, but an immediate directional change, and then accelerated over the the open ocean to our right, still maintaining the same altitude, and straight over the horizon line defined by the sunset. The speed this vehicle reached, seemingly instantly, must have been in thousands of miles per hour.

I turned the car off and rolled down the windows so we could be sure to hear for any noise from the craft.  It was so close, any occupants had to be aware of us.

There were 11 young adults (approx. ages 17-25)about equal distribution of male/ female, of which I was one; we were on the outskirts of a university campus. -- The unidentifiable ""flying"" object was directly over the treetops, traveling quite slowly.  It was a medium olive-brown or dark ""kakhi"" in colour, and probably the size of a small bungalow. I do not recall seeing inhabitants, nor any of the group referring to or noticing ""inhabitants"". -- We piled into a motor vehicle and tried to follow it; it gradually ascended in a semi-cylindrical pattern, increasing speed, and we lost sight of it. -- I am rather certain this occurred on a Saturday or Friday afternoon, as we were on our way to a party or some sort of gathering at first. One of the boys said he knew about a military person (there are several bases in the area, only one of which was Ft. Campbell, KY)of whom he could inquire whether any other reports had been received. -- This guy and I talked via telephone the next day around 16:00k or 17:00k; he said he was told it was a military ""experiment"" (I think he said Airforce, but he could have said ""army experiment"", too). -- It is interesting that I remember this much of it so clearly, perhaps because there were 10 other ""peers"". -- However, none of us have been in touch for the past 30 yrs. at least, and probably none of us would know each other by sight, or even by name in most cases. I've no idea if any but myself still exist. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

About 1 mile out they simply stopped and hovered there for a minute and then left even more quickly than they came.  When they left, they went back in the direction they had come from, the horizon, and it was so fast that they almost seemed to diappear.  Everyone saw them.",,33.8622,-118.3995

I'm unsure of the exact date and time of day, but when I was about 13 or 14 years old (1967 or 1968), living in Las Vegas on Hobart Ave. in the Charleston Heights section of town, I was outside on our street playing with my siblings and friends around mid-day.  I looked up in the sky, which was completely free of any cloud cover whatsoever, and in the distant blue above our house there appeared a white light.  It was extremely visible in the vastness of the deep blue desert sky (before pollution invaded the valley) and from the distance I was watching, it looked about  the size stars look at night, only much closer, and it moved in an irratic pattern, but only within a very restricted area of space.  In other words, it rapidly moved up, down, left, right, etc., etc., but never left the radius of sky  just above our house, which amounted to about the radius that the full moon takes up in the night sky, only it seemed much closer than the moon.  I remember it was so very strange to see this in broad daylight, with there being no apparent reason for it being there, and nothing in the sky that could be causing a reflection of some sort.  I pointed it out my friends, and we stared at it for awhile, then I think we just got tired of guessing what it might be, and like all kids with short attention spans, went on with our playing.
