I am a long time “we are not alone”, phenomena observer since my first experience in 1970. On June 3, 2019, just after midnight, I was lying on a lounge chair in my back yard observing stars when a white flash of high intensity light appeared directly above me.  Only catching the last glimpse of the light as it went out, I kept focused on the area the flash came from. Approximately 3 seconds later, another flash appeared, only this one was a bit lighter in intensity yet still very bright and only lasting 1 second before going out.  Another few seconds and another flash only this one was much less in intensity and still lasting about 1 second before going out.  The last flash came a few seconds later and it was hardly noticeable being very dim.  Then the show was over. A booster rocket perhaps firing bursts to get out of our galaxy?..",2019-06-07T00:00:00,,

I have a business in the McCurdy Sydney Airport here had just started to drive home around 9PM. When I got to the end of the airport road and turned onto the main highway I noticed blinking lights to my left side, sort of just over the tree line.  There are towers in the area and I chalked it up to that. 	As I proceeded on my drive, I realized these lights are still there and moving.  What I seen was simply three lights blinking just off timing of each other but were consistent in blinking time and distance apart. The distance apart seemed to be massive; much larger than an aircraft. 	I could not see anything other than the light. I saw them continue on right over the city of Sydney.  Once I got onto the TransCanada Highway, I lost them but when I got into Sydney River (5 minutes away) I spotted them again over the mountain range.  I got onto my final road (route 4) and watched the light go out of sight over the mountains. 	This is very unusual and I feel lucky to have seen these lights.  I was expecting to wake up and hear news reports of this but nothing.  This went right over the city!  	I am still amazed about it and will always wonder what it was.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,46.12571413043479,-60.193147826086964

I admit that when the original poster shared her sightings with me, my analytical mind started looking for ways to “explain” away her reports.  However, I do trust the original poster. Several months after the 2/21/18 poster shared her sightings with me, I woke up at about 2 a.m.  I live directly below the original poster.  While laying on the couch, I could see out my blinds across the abandoned yet improved adjacent property.  I could see through the blinds three very bright lights . . . in close formation.  The lights appeared to change in colors and I do recall a red light and a very bright cold blue light.  I know I saw what I saw – I even got up off my couch and walked out onto my balcony.  The lights/device/thing was probably 100 yards away – to the North – and appeared to be about treetop height – approximately 60 feet in the air.  I kept staring at whatever it was.  With a few exceptions, it remained stationary.  My initial thought was “drone.”  My second thought was “drone flown by some pervert trying to look into our apartment windows.”  But it was all too weird. Look – I have a graduate degree.  I’m 48 years old.  I love science.  I consider myself pretty sharp and definitely not hysterical.  I dig on the scientific method and I get that the simplest explanation is often the correct one.  But . . . based on operational logistics and the location of the observation, something was strange and inexplicable.  I saw what I saw – it got my chalupa eating hiney off the couch and onto the patio for a better view.  It was too large to be a drone.  Plus – why at 2 a.m.  . . . over a very abandoned but secure retirement community???  If someone were flying a drone, they would “fly it” . . . as in it should move . . . instead it hovered for like 15 minutes til it simply disappeared with no change in elevation. Very strange. I would be interested to know whether my location was the same as an earlier poster above from April 2019 who reported seeing an object while with her fiancée.  I wonder if that occurred in the same area/location. I saw what I saw.  I was intrigued enough to go outside for a better look.  My upstairs neighbor has seen similar objects.

Vernon Ave., Flint, Michigan, 48503, I looked to the North and just below the Big Dipper, I noticed what appeared to be the three (3) stars from Orion's belt.  A moment later I realized that Orion would not be in that part of the night sky.  I continued staring and confused for about a minute or so.  All of a sudden the three (3) stars began to move to the East in formation and at a steady speed.  I continued to watch them until they flew out of sight (approx 5 mins).

I took out my phone and took 2 quick pictures in about a second. I then looked up and it was gone.  A guy came out of the pub and I was telling him about what I had seen then I was pointing to where it was and then seen it again just over the top of the trees closer towards me, so I went to take another picture and it disappeared in front of me as if someone had turned a light switch off.   Then my cab came.  When I got home I was telling my roommate about it so I wanted to show the pictures so the first one which was actually the second one there was nothing there so I just figured I didn't catch it.  But a couple days later I was looking at the picture bu! t decided to look at the second one which was the first one and there it was after I zoomed in but it wasn't a ball of light it was a cylinder shape at an angle, so I zoomed in more and I can make out 3 distinct bluish lights.

There was no moon and it was a clear night.  I was walking back towards the house.  Normal night sounds when suddenly there was a glow in my immediate area.  Probably about 10 feet across as bright as the full moon.  I've had 707s pass directly over head at 3000 ft turn their landing lights on which was similar but there was utterly no engine noise.  None.   So I spun around and looked up as that seemed to be the direction it came from.  This put me looking roughly sse.  At about a 45 to 50 degree angle from the horizon there was a really bright light, kinda blipping around.  I saw no blinking anti collision lights.  No wing position indicator lights.  Just a single bright white light that was not painful to look at.  It was about the size of a pea held at arm's length.  Solid white.  Fluttering in a area about palm sized for about a minute.   Then it ""turned"" in place and shot off to the sse at an incredible speed.  We are talking one second it was there and within a beat or two it was a dim dot on the horizon.  No noise at anytime. No sonic boom (I've heard those) no afterburner kawoosh (heard those too). Nothing.  Although a few seconds later I heard a fighter craft coming out of the nnw.  Which from my home is the rough heading towards wright pat.  It was twin engine and booking it.  Not afterburner level but could tell he was not just out for a cruise.  He was going the same heading as the unknown.  He had a single red anti collision light and I could see the glow of his engines as he passed.  Definitely heard the rumble roar of his jets too.            So that happened in July of this year.

As we drove farther west I noticed that the orbs were just to the south of us about a mile or so and were brighter, and were closer together now traveling a little ahead and to the southwest of us, as we entered the town I realized this was one ship, and the lights were much brighter although still above the clouds, we made a left, and then turned back west on our street, I thought the object was still in town. Our road is curvy, and as I made the second curve,I almost wrecked the car!  I caught sight of the craft just to the left of me and a bit ahead. I almost wrecked the car!  we were the only ones on the road and the object was now just above the clouds, and you could see 6 white lights rotating in a pattern and 4 red lights that spun, then the white lights ran to the inside or center of the craft, made a star formation,then reversed direction and made a circle around the center star like light. This thing stayed in the cloud cover, never coming out into the bare sky, so I never saw the whole thing. As we took a left into our driveway and parked, the craft stopped and hovered, literally, 200 feet above us and 100 feet next to us, just above our pasture. the lights slowed down, and as we got of the car, it looked like it was coming down, by the way it made no noise, had no wind there was no engine noise at all! at this point we both decided it was best to get inside. We got the dogs out of the kennel, and took them in the house, they had been raising holy hell, and were franic!  I decided to go out side and see if the craft had left, it was no longer at the front of the property and I did not see it at first. This made me feel better and I walked out to the street and headed west to see if I could see where it went, as I walked up the road I looked to the left and looked out at our pasture, and saw at least, 25 rays of light pointing up to the sky, they were like spotlights and were bouncing all over the place! the craft was now on the ground behind the barn  so I could not see it, but I knew there were no lights out there like that! I took off for the house  and told my husband we needed to leave, he agreed and we got the dogs loaded and took off down to the next cross street, we turned left to go to highway 12 and the craft went right over us heading due west, and then it just disappeared!

San Marcos pass summit is at approximately 1000 m in elevation and drops rapidly to sea level.  At the summit there is a clear view out over the Santa Barbara channel for about one half mile. The initial brightness of the object as it passed directly overhead entering my field of view through the windshield is estimated at -8, i.e. much brighter than Venus.  Within seconds the object had descended to at or below my elevation and was approximately five miles ahead of me now directly over Santa Barbara town.  The brightness of the light did not change in this period even though I now witnessed it from behind rather than below.  Within thirty seconds the white light changed to red flashing port side and green solid starboard which seemed like ""domestic"" aircraft but the lights weren't distinct and separated as normal aircraft lighting is.  Both red and green lights displayed laser-like qualities rather than incandescent or led.  Furthermore the lights seemed to blend with one another to a degree as though seen through a haze.  The flashing of the red light was not metered in any sense either as though it was randomly flashing in about one second intervals. At this point my view was obscured (and I hadn't crashed the truck (I refer to this stretch as ""the death zone"" due to the number of car wrecks here)).  Within seconds the view opened back up and the uap was now at least fifteen miles to the southeast over the channel off Port Hueneme.  The light now appeared further away, but more intense which defies my understanding of the physics of light.  At this point my view was obscured.

Unknown object moving extremely fast through sky.,Lakewood,OH,2019-09-09T18:45:00,cigar,10 seconds,"Occurred : 9/9/2019 18:45  (Entered as : 09/09/19 18:45) Reported: 9/18/2019 10:53:19 AM 10:53 Posted: 9/19/2019 Location: Lakewood, OH Shape: Cigar Duration:10 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/148/S148907.html,"Unknown object moving extremely fast through sky. I would like to preface this account to state that everything happened so quickly that I can not say with complete certainty what I saw.  The account below will be on the long side, but I am attempting to be clear in what I know for sure and what is a little hazy.  The experience was very surprising and almost surreal.  After thinking about the experience for the past week and talking with several people about it, I remain confident that what I saw is not explained by any object that I am aware of  (bird, plane, helicopter, drone).  In the early evening of Tuesday, September 19, 2019, I was out for a walk with my five-year old son.  We were outside in part because there were thousands of dragonflies in our front yard and the yards nearby.  I have never seen anything like that.  When I got home from work, I had noticed quite a few flying around.  Over the next hour or so, they became more and more numerous.  Around 6:30pm, I took my son outside to see them.  We then went for a walk down to Lake Erie.  As we were walking back to our house, I kept looking around at the dragonflies which were everywhere. At 6:45pm (+/- 10 minutes), we were several hundred feet west of our house in a relatively open area.  The sky was clear, with very few/no clouds.  As I looked up in the sky, I saw a moving object in the south sky.  I immediately noticed its very fast pace.  I could not associate it with anything such as a plane, helicopter, or bird.  My first thought was that it was a drone, based on its apparent size and distance away.  We see small drones in the area from time to time, but they usually move somewhat erratically, slowly, and always seem to have blinking lights.  As I tried to process what I was seeing, I realized that it was moving as if it was an arrow shot from a bow.  There was absolutely no deviation from its course. I noticed no lights.  The object appeared to me to be gray and elongated (in the direction of travel).  I saw no exhaust or trails.  I attempted to listen for a sound, but heard nothing discernible. When I first spotted the object, it was slightly east of due south.  It was traveling east/north-east. I would say that it was at an angle of approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.  There was no obvious change in its elevation during the time that I saw it.  I followed its path until it disappeared from my view just north of due east.  There are condo towers east of my neighborhood.  They are approximately thirty stories tall.  I lost sight of the object when it passed the towers and my sight of it was blocked. After it had passed, I tried to process what I had just seen.  I sat down on a bench in our front yard with my son to continue watching the dragonflies.  Approximately several minutes later (maybe more), I heard the noise of a large helicopter.  Very soon a Chinook helicopter appeared from the east heading almost due west.  We see one or often three Chinooks heading east or west out over Lake Erie (1000' north of our house) not infrequently.  This one was probably less than 200' north of our house.  I haven't seen one so close before.  My son and I watched as it passed over, and I rushed to get my phone in camera mode.  I was able to snap a photo of it when it was about to disappear behind some trees several hundred feet west of me. Since seeing this, I have tried to figure out what it was that I saw.  The speed that it was moving was much greater than anything that I have seen before. I have watched the International Space Station pass over, and this traveled across the sky much, much quicker.  My best estimate is that it traveled about two miles during the time that I saw it (5-10 sec...I can't be sure).",2019-09-19T00:00:00,41.4817,-81.8024

I saw an arrowhead-shaped (triangular) craft at 6:30-ish p.m. Sept. 10, 2019, while driving home from my office in Los Angeles.  I was stopped in the left-hand turn lane on Sixth Street at Alvarado, facing east.  On my right was the corner of MacArthur Park. On the left was a Bank of America.  The object was about 150 to 200 yards away, hovering above the street on the north side, about 4 or 5 stories up.  It rose about 10 feet, banked up and to the left (north) and went behind a building.  It was about the size of a small car (judging from where the building sits on Sixth Street).  The back of it was black and had two bright lights.  The top, as it banked, appeared to be black down the center, and either side of that swath was midnight blue.  It was metallic because as it banked, it reflected the sunlight (sun was behind me, in the west).  There were no propellers and no wings. That’s what made me feel it wasn’t a drone.  The next day, I called two of the LAPD’s Ramp! art station non-emergency numbers.  I never got a human to pick up the phone.  I left my name and number and told them only that I’d witnessed something and wanted to know if anyone else had phoned in. I also phoned the Bank of America, which has a security camera on its overhang on the corner of Sixth and Alvarado — four times.  I wanted to know if someone on their security staff would look at footage from that evening. I know within about a 5-minute window when I saw this.  Not only did I never get a human to pick up the phone, the bank doesn’t even let you leave a message.  I am also sure the Rampart station has security cameras, too.  I saw the object for only about 3 or 4 seconds but I saw it as plainly as I saw cars on the street.",2019-09-19T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

I didn’t see any lights and the object looked to be pure white and the length of any commercial plane. It did not have a vapor trail and I saw it through tree tops so it disappeared from my view very quickly.  I thought it was a jet at first but what caught my attention was that it was so low for this area.  There is no commercial airport nearby.  I quickly realized it had no wings and was just a cylinder or cigar shape.  I heard nothing which I thought was strange based on the height it was flying . As soon as it flew behind some leaves (about 4-5 seconds after I first saw it), I ran around the trees to a wide open area to make sure of what I was seeing.  Maybe 25 feet on the ground and then there was nothing blocking my view.  It only took maybe another 3 or 4 seconds to get to the clear area.  I was shocked that it was gone.  Nothing at all in the sky.  No vapor trail.  It was way to far below the clouds to have gone behind them or into them. It was not traveling anywhere near fast enough to have disappeared.  I even waited a couple of minutes to see if I was missing something.   I have no idea where it went and the fact that it disappeared like that is why I am looking into this further.

I was in the park with my wife and daughter and laying on my back staring up the swallows flying high above. A small white dot caught my attention (a small star bright light) much higher than commercial airline flights seem to be and way higher than the swallows above. At first I thought nothing of it as it could be something reflecting light from the sun, but the object started to move to the left. After it moved it really caught my attention and a few seconds just stopped. After the obeject had stopped moving, two more lights (or star bright dots) appeared directly underneath the original object. It was in perfect vertical straight line underneath the original dot and totaled three lights. The three lights all proceeded to move left again and after a few seconds of following the dots/stars I tried to alert my wife and point out the general direction.  In this time more had appeared sporadically (in no formation or visibly noticeable) formation.  The number grew till around 7 stars could be seen and spaces all over the area of sky.  The whole event lasted around 2 minutes and my wife (to my frustartition) didn’t managed to track or witness it.  I’m actually sad that I alone witnessed it and would have even tried to contact a complete stranger to highlight what I was witnessing!  I would honestly love to know if any sighting (other than mine) happened and up till yesterday would have literally laughed at anyone telling me they had witnessed something extra ordinary or a UFO. This really changed for me yesterday and tried in all ways to rantionalize and explain what it could have been, both civilian and military wise.

Witness was at home and his roommate called to him to come outside onto the balcony to see something in the night sky at about 10:50 pm central standard time.  The sky was clear but it was especially dark because it was a waxing crescent moon with 21% visibility that evening.  They thought it was a plane at first but it was flying relatively low and they were were unable to make out a shape of the object which was strange because there were commercial and small engine airplanes flying this evening at varying altitudes and they could make out the shape of the planes even though it was dark.  This thing had about 5 rectangular white lights oriented vertically across the back of it.  The lights pulsated and flashed in a staggered order and then they would go completely dark for about one or two seconds and continue flashing again in rapid succession.  They were not able to hear any sound coming from it nor were they able to see any kind of exhaust trail coming from! it.  It moved from west to east in a straight line and they observed it facing south.  It moved slower than a single engine plane would which made it stand out even more.  They thought it might be a drone but it was unlike any drone they'd ever seen before.  They followed its trajectory which was viewed above a tree line for about the next 4 minutes until it was no longer visible behind the tree line.  Witness included digital photos / screen grabs from video (a couple are zoomed in and cropped) and video that are relatively bad quality because of how dark it was but it highlights well what they saw.,2019-06-20T00:00:00,41.548,-87.4564

I pointed it out to everyone and passed my sunglasses around to kids. The sunglasses made the colors much more visible and I most likely would not have even noticed it without them. It  was quite beautiful and something that I had never seen. My kids described it as being ""really cool"". I wanted to photograph it, but being so close to the sun I doubted I would be able to capture all the colors. I decided to hold my sunglasses in front of the camera lens on my iPhone. I snapped two pics, perhaps 15 to 30 seconds apart.  A while later I decided to look at the pics and that's when I noticed the brighter circular object within the cloud.  I know I must have looked at that cloud for 2 or 3 minutes as we floated down the river.  I can say with all certainty that the object was not visible to the naked or sunglassed eye.  Today I applied a couple different filters that come with the phone. If u look closely to the left of the orb, it seams like there is a shockwave.  In the second pic the object has dropped down a good bit and there doesn't seam to be much going on. I figured the cloud to just be filled with ice particles and catching the suns rays just right. The orb thing does however have me dumbfounded and why couldn't I see it? Makes me wonder how much I don't see.  I did take a couple more pics the next day, trying to replicate conditions as much as possible.

She notices first light, but from her perspective she’s able to see 3 additional lights that were obstructed from my POV behind a tree.  They are positioned true east from my position.

It began playing very strange atmospheric, almost psychedelic music, with what sounded like whales in the sounds as well.  The noises in the music all put together sounded like something I had never heard before, it is almost impossible to describe the sense it created.  I continued for several miles, still tuned in for curiosities’ sake.  At this point I was only a few miles south of Rogerson (8 miles from where I originally began hearing the strange music)  My dog that I travel with began barking very loudly, which he never does on car rides.  I very briefly looked back to calm him down when suddenly the music got much louder and when I shot my view back forward there was a very bright purple/blue light just above the road, I swear it grew brighter and brighter with every passing moment.  It almost appeared like an air traffic light burning very bright in the middle of the highway.  I braked almost immediately and pulled to the side of the road, terrified as my dog continued to bark, yelp, and howl.  As I reached in my glove box for my pistol, the music went down to its usual volume and as I hopped out the large light was gone.  I could almost see nothing since the light took away my adjusted night vision.  I took out a cigarette to calm my nerves as my eyes readjusted, continued listening to the strange music still playing through my Oldsmobile and realized my perception of time during this whole incident was very skewed, a 15 minutes had felt like hours.  Just then I noticed five lights, getting brighter and brighter just as the first had, they were staggered almost like a Z with an extra line going straight up and slightly to the north from the south as I was facing it.  They stayed bright for several moments before one by one faded into the atmosp! here.  At some point during my dumbfounded staring at the sky m! y radio had gone to static.

I have a window in front of the toilet.  While doing my business, I look outside of the window. I am interested in astronomy, so I look up to the night sky.  I was looking at the stars, and I noticed a very peculiar star, which was brighter than others. It was lights.  From space, not like beams shooting up, but lights.   I first saw what it looked liked to be a star, a white-looking star, then another joined under it, and another under it.  The 3 stars formed in a line.  After about 5 seconds, they merged into one star.  Then the stars looked like it was making an unknown shape.  From what I saw, it looked like a teardrop but the tip was very curved.  I also noticed some sort of beam shining out of the UFO.  I also noticed a minuscule-sized aircraft flying around the light.  The small one was flashing green lights.  Then it faded into nothing.  Came back, then faded once more.  After the 2nd fading, the light never came back.   During this, I decided to go get my camera (I was amazed at the sight, but also still.  But I snapped myself out of it and tried getting the camera).  My camera couldn't take the picture of the lights, everything was too dark.   Keep in mind that that UFOs were at star-length.

You know there is a huge crowd out there but you cant see them because you are lit and they are not right?  Then a single flashbulb goes off as someone takes a picture.  That is what it looks like.  A single flashbulb going off. It will then move a bit.  Not really far but it never pops in the same place. These things are NOT satellites since they are not moving at a steady rate which would be required if you were on orbit.  Also not an airplane as they are not moving properly to be flying and there is no sound associated with seeing them.  If you take the time to watch them they will flash in an area half a dozen times then, go away?  Then you will see some in another area. I have seen them near the ISS as it traveled by as well.  This is a good way to see them as well because they are almost always near when it goes by.  I encourage anyone seeing this to go look for them. I am at a loss as to how to photograph these things.  I totally would but it would take a bulb setting and all I would see is a white dot against a field of white dots (stars).  Not sure how to identify the flashers in a background of stars via a camera.  Perhaps with a bulb setting long enough it would be the white dot that was still a dot and not a smear like the stars would be?  IDK.

They came from our right -  over Sanibel end of the bridge - and we all noticed them at about the same time.  I didn’t hear anything, but saw a long, cylindrical (rocket-like) object that looked as if it had flames coming from the middle and end of it.  Around it were 6-10 small lights.  They all traveled at about the same speed and in the same direction, toward Ft Myers Beach.  The small lights didn’t break away from the rocket-like cylinder, they all stayed in the same pattern that we first! observed. At first we thought it was a meteor shower, but none were reported that night.  Then we thought maybe a rocket launch gone wrong, but we none were reported being shot up that night/morning.  Perhaps it was a satellite breaking up, but the smaller lights traveled at the same speed and in the same direction as the rocket-like cylinder, so didn’t seem to break up. Of course our cameras were facing the wrong direction to catch the unidentified flying objects and were on long exposure, so were useless to catch the UFO.  But I did catch a quick photo with my iPhone and tried to get a movie (tho it isn’t good), though by the time I thought to grab my iPhone, the objects had moved quite a distance away.  You can identify the rocket-like cylinder and a few lights around it as well as the Ft Myers Beach skyline.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,,

We were focusing on the object and what it was doing, and observing time could have easily  been over 2 min. The object traveled in a straight line from the SSE to NNW during the entire observation. A little about me: I am an amateur astronomer with thousands of hours of observing time and know the sky well. This includes many naked eye objects and locations of objects that can only be seen with binoculars or telescope. I was in the Air Force and my specialty located me near the runway.  I have observed MANY types of craft and objects in the sky under a variety of conditions. I attended a brief but informative police sponsored training session, provided by a former employer, in looking for and noting details when witnessing an event. I will send you a sketch of the sighting to the address listed on your website, and I intend to contact the local radio station and newspaper. Summary: While in the street, in a residential neighborhood, I noticed a rather bright orange light about 15 degrees above the horizon moving directly towards me.  At first I thought it was a helicopter with a spotlight, but helicopters around here never have orange spotlights, only white. I could only see the bright orange light, and not the body of any craft. As it approached it grew in size until it expanded into an orange orb, the closer it approached the larger the orb appeared. I don’t think the orb actually expanded, it just appeared larger, as perhaps an approaching car moving in ones direction would appear as it drew closer. The object wasn’t that far away. The orb grew in size until features became visible.  It was clearly NOT a helicopter. There was no propeller, and no body of a craft of any kind visible at this point. The craft made no sound AT ALL during the entire observation. The apparent size of the object from our position was a little smaller than a dime held at arm’s length, and appeared to be about 1000 to 1500 feet in elevation. The entire orb was orange, but down the center of the orb was a straight and solid ‘semi-wide line’ of solid orange light that was somewhat brighter than the rest of the orb. It was easily seen.  It extended all the way across the orb, except for the center, from one edge to the other. It essentially split the orb in two. The axis of the solid orange ‘line’ pointed in the same direction the orb was travelling.  The ‘line’ did not have a sharp edge but quickly blended into the light orange on either side of it. The circular outer edge of the entire orb was also a little brighter but not quite as bright as the ‘semi-thick line’. It did not have a sharp edge, and quickly blended into the lighter orange as well      At the center of the orb, between the solid ‘lines’ was a pulsing light (not blinking). It was not a sharp point of light. It could also be described more accurately as a throbbing light.  It was orange in color and pulsing-throbbing dimmer and brighter, dimmer and brighter at a steady and even rate of about 2 ½ pulses per second. The solid orange ‘line’ described two paragraphs ago came close to the edges of the pulsing light at the center, but didn’t appear to connect to it. The pulsing center light was separate and pulsed on its own. The orb was travelling in a path that would take it directly overhead. At about 80 degrees overhead it started to slow down, gradually and very smoothly. The other witness who was also observing the slow down stated… To paraphrase… It’s slowing down to look at you!... I felt the same!! This was a little concerning, and almost spooky for both of us. The orb only slowed down but did not stop. I estimate it slowed down by 25-30%. I don’t recall it regaining its previous speed, but it may have. 5 to 10 seconds after noticing the orb slowing down and passing in the area overhead, the lighted orb began to turn off and on at random on either side of the pulsing center light and solid orange colored axis ‘line’. The throbbing center light did NOT turn off and continued to pulse unchanged.  The axis ‘line’ of solid orange light on either side of the pulsing center light remained lighted and unchanged most of the time, but flickered a few times and sometimes fragmented into separate distorted pieces of light, then reformed very quickly.  The random turning off and on of light on both sides of the orb occurred more often than the fluctuations of light on the center axis ‘line’. When in the area directly overhead,  ALL of the lights on the orb suddenly blinked off and the object tuned completely dark.  They did not turn back on even for a moment for the rest of the observation. After all the lights on the orb blinked off, a solid dark shape remained that is best described as a distorted square with uneven rounded corners. The distorted square appeared to remain the same size or very close to the same size as the orb when it was lighted.  It continued moving at the same smooth speed.  It was dusk and the sun was down but the sky was light blue and clear at our observation site and objects could easily be observed against the background sky. After a few seconds the dark distorted square changed shape into a round disc. This occurred while the object was directly or nearly directly overhead and moving away. The disc remained dark and continued to move smoothly toward the NNW. Because of its changing angle as it moved toward the horizon it became apparent it was a flat disc. I watched carefully to see if ANY type of lighting reappeared. None did. I observed the dark disc as it smoothly cruised in a straight line toward the horizon until the line of sight approached a row of trees about 250 yards away. Because of the dark, brownish black color of the object after the orange lights blinked off , it would have been impossible or nearly impossible to spot the distorted square or disc in a dark sky. The light blue background of dusk is probably the only reason we could observe it.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,27.285686301369864,-80.36344363992173

I was watching the fireworks show that had been going on for about 15 minutes when I noticed out of my left peripheral vision a large bright orange round-except the bottom was flat-horizontal-object that was descending and heading south along the interstate at a very high rate of speed with absolutely no sound when it made a right hand ""fishhook"" 180` turn to the north and came to a sudden stop directly east and parallel to the fireworks and appeared to be a couple thousand feet above the fireworks, just north and west of the Sandia National Lab complex and Kirkland air base. When object 1 came to a stop and hover, a second object of the same size and color appeared to slide out from behind object 1, sliding to the west towards the fireworks.  The two objects hovered for about 30 seconds and started to come north towards my location. When the two objects started to move north three more objects of the same description and slightly lower than the two original objects, one right after the other like you turned on a light and they hovered in place. As object 1 and object 2 were heading north at about half the distance between my location and the other three objects, object 1 had started to get ahead of object 2 and made an immediate right hand 90` turn with out sound, towards the Sandia mountains, just south of the radio towers on top of the mountains and shot over the mountains in a 45` degree climb on the horizon and disappeared in 3 seconds.  When object one disappeared object two started to make the same right-hand turn and it then just disappeared. When objects 1 and 2 disappeared objects 3,4 and 5 hovered in place for approximately 20 additional seconds and one by one in the order they appeared disappeared as if you turned them off. This whole event took place within approximately two minutes starting at 2202 and ending at 2204.  The night sky was high thin overcast with 20 plus mile visibility, winds calm at the time.  No other objects/aircraft or airships were observed during this timeline of event. At 2202 on my android phone I started rerecording this event for 27 seconds.  That’s when I went to get my houseguest ((male's name deleted)) to witness it.  When we returned approximately 20 seconds later I started to record the event again as my phone was flashing Rec and this recording went on for about 1.5 minutes.  After the event we went into the house to see the videos and for some reason the second recording was not logged on my phone.  I do have the initial recording of 27 seconds, in which you can see the first object, see and hear the fireworks in the background lower right.  I will attach that video to this e-mail for your review.

This thing scampered across ceiling and disappeared into the wall where ceiling and wall converge. I gave a time for the 7/5/19 incident, but was not by my phone or a clock.

I seen a strange Bright light flashing at a slow pace kinda, on the  East side up ahead going at a fast rate.  I told  my granddaughter to look it looks like the same kind of bright light we saw a week before, on Aug. 13th 2019.  And it just came across where we seen it.  All of a sudden it turned going North in a sharp way I can  only describe as in an L manner.  As I topped the hill the Bright light was on the West side of Hwy now going South.  The way it was flashing and as Bright as it was, I decided to pull over to observe it better at a stand still.  It was almost straight across from me in the Air by the time i stopped.  It had seemed to have had pause for a few seconds, and at that moment, it was moving in a bouncing form it would go down just a little bit, back up then real fast bounce back, then right then left.  I instantly shouted did you see that to my granddaughter.  She did in fact seen it move as I did. Right then  I knew I was looking at something.  A UFO, we continued to watch it as it continued to  travel southward.  Within a few minutes it was I would say over Barnsdall, and it just stopped moving.  The Bright light stayed in one spot for 5 to 7 minutes, then started to move again going west, turning back going North Northeast until it was almost right back to where we were sitting  of Hwy.  This is when I decided to grab my cell phone and start recording, and as I was recording I could not really see anything that I was looking at, I thought that my phone would not pick bright light up.   So I Called my youngest daughter till she answered which is where I just left not 15 minutes ago from taking her back home to Barnsdall.  I screamed get outside right now, locate the Big Dipper now look to ur left just a little and Boom she had asked what is it..  Then she and her wife was lik! e Omg is that , I can hear it mom, it has a whirling deep weird sound,  They could see it turning like in a spinning way.  We all watched it until we could not see it anymore as it went into the sky where it was lighting and storming..   I got home and went to see if my phone picked any of the recording I did, and oh man did it.  You can see the bright light a few times and see how it was moving around a little, then right at the end of the video you see the triangle shape lights 3 of them.

At first I thought it may be a plane flying with its landing lights on far in the distance.  Because it looked like a central light.  As I got closer I thought no it’s a helicopter.  And it seemed to move side to side. Anyway I came into the town, Matador, Texas, and pulled off the side of the road at a fast station.  And walked inside.  The light was just southeast of town hovering about 600 to a thousand feet up.  And it was BRIGHT. I went inside and asked if their was a tower there or a helicopter field close by, but I couldn’t hear anything.  No chopper sounds.  She said no and came outside and said she didn’t know what it is. Another car with two ladies also stopped and at first thought. It was possibly the water tower (it’s not).  Then they drove closer they came back and said they thought maybe it was a helicopter, but wasn’t sure.  Because once again no sound and that the light was hovering over ranchland southeast of town. I witnessed the light for roughly 48 minutes before my work clock demanded I get back on the road.  And snapped a few pictures with my phone. There was cloud cover so it wasn’t a star or satellite.  It was airborne for to long to be a normal drone and was to silent to be a helicopter. While watching it a light shined down from whatever it was about 6 times in that 48 minutes I observed it. In the pictures. There were two other lights that couldn’t be seen due to the central light being so bright.  But they showed on the photograph.  I’ve been driving a truck since 2003 and was a scout in the army.  I’ve observed a lot of flying objects late at night that are identifiable.  This one I couldn’t. I’ve reached out to a local aerial weather group that does fly large drones in that area to see if it was maybe one of theirs or if they might know something.  But this one for now has me puzzled.

The object looked to be about 24 feet long and 3 feet wide and was glowing violet or purple along its shaft and was brighter red-orange at the end, which appeared to be slightly wider than the rest of the cylinder.  The object moved in a straight diagonal path from the Tiburon peninsula at approximately the Hilarita neighborhood at  the level of the Saint Hilary School directly over Richardson Bay toward Sausalito and the Golden Gate Bridge. As the object passed over the 2016 Kia Sorento SUV, the satellite radio cut off for a second, the dashboard lights flickered and the motor lost acceleration. The father kept watching the object as long as possible but lost sight of the object over Richardson Bay.  He then proceeded to drive south along Tiburon Boulevard through downtown to the end of the peninsula between Tiburon and Angel Island where he looked for the object but saw nothing.  He waited at the parking lot across from the Caprice Restaurant for approximately three minutes watching the bridge lights of the Golden Gate Bridge with his young son while the car remained idling and parked with the the car windows down. Suddenly, there was an extremely strong downdraft of wind that moved the trees in different directions as well as a loud whooshing sound.  The father immediately closed the car windows and drove out of the lot, returning toward Tiburon downtown.  At this point, he realized the entire town was now dark and later learned that a blackout had occurred across most of the county that lasted more than an hour.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,37.8914,-122.47280000000002

I noticed that one of the “birds” wasnt moving.  It was directly due east, at about the same height in the sky as the moon, bright white/silver and about the size of a large-sized star.  Just.. sitting there.  It was high up as well as wisps of clouds seemed to obscure it.  After watching it for about 10 minutes someone asked me what I was looking at.  I pointed it out, and he began looking at it as well.  Soon a small group of about 10 of us dads were looking at it, trying to figure out what it was. After about 15 minutes, someone said “Hey, theres another one!”  Sure enough, another white dot appeared also due east but lower towards the horizon by about 3 inches. This second object was the same size as the first but was very slowly pulsing.. fading in and out of view in about 10 second intervals.  Eventually it faded out and didnt return.  It was around for maybe 10 minutes of the sighting. The entire sighting lasted about 30 minutes. As I was creating a post on Above Top Secret urging anyone in the Dublin, CA, area to “look up”, it vanished.  I wish I could tell you if it zoomed off, blinked out, or exploded, but I can't.  I took 15 seconds to respond to someone’s reply to my post, looked up, and the object was gone.  By that time, I was the only one still watching it.  It was almost straight up (maybe 150 degrees if 180 is straight up) so it did a number on our necks as we were watching it. Can confirm this was not Venus.

At approximately 21:39 I witnessed a irregular flashing/pulsating point (sources). I was facing north; the location was within two fingers width held at arms length of Deneb ~ 3 or so degrees.  (Very roughly I think this was 18 degrees above the horizon---using the same finger approximation).  - There was no periodicity I could make out (varying between 2 seconds per pulse up to 7).  - Each pulse began appeared as a light suddenly turning on, then either: (1) immediately turning off or (2) decaying over the course of ~1 second (or longer, I did not take a precise measurement).  - The location appeared to occasionally change/jump within about 5 degrees of angular separation (estimated by three fingers width held at arms length).  - The maximum brightness was nearly that of Jupiter at the time.  - This lasted for about 1 - 2 minutes since I first witnessed it.  Other notes:  - It's central New Jersey; the direction I was facing was New York, the night was humid, there were light clouds close the source---in essence there was a ton of light pollution and visibility was mediocre.  Originally I thought the clouds moving were causing the pulsing behavior, but on further observation it was clear this was not the case.  Despite the light pollution I was able to see a couple of meteor-streaks.  - The sky was littered with planes lower on the horizon (Newark airport is extremely close), and---like any good summer night around 9pm---there were plenty of satellites (I saw ~20 over the course of an hour --- mostly east-west moving, some north-south(ish); some in the vicinity of the flash).  - Other than the ""jumping"" I described above, the source did not appear to move, even when flashing for long periods.  Granted, what I witnessed was close to the horizon so  that the apparent motion would be small, but I did not see any movement over the very long flashes, and satellites that passed through that vicinity were very visibly moving.  - Over the course of four years, I've seen two bright iridium flares in the same area on other nights---I'm pretty confident this was not that.",2019-06-20T00:00:00,40.52146102003643,-74.3571116575592

We would have thought it was a cloud if it wasn't perfectly disk shaped and gliding slowly over us but much faster than the clouds.

I told my friend it was a helicopter.  When we reached the top of the hill, we looked up and about 20 feet above us was a silver saucer shaped vehicle.  I clearly saw the undercarriage.  In the middle there looked to be red hot coals with a ""florescent"" tube surrounding it.  There was fluid rotating in the tube and it turned colors, green, blue, turquoise as it moved.  I felt a tugging on my solar plexus and realized I was looking down at my friend who was screaming and running, saying he was getting his gun.  I don't know how but I was standing inside the ship in front of a magnificent Being.  He was tall and thin, blue, enlarged head with delicate features, larger than human eyes but not huge, and he was blue.  He wore a floor length blue robe.  He was amazingly kind and I felt peaceful and unafraid in his presence.  He asked if I would like to see his ship, which I agreed to.  There was nothing in this ship.  As we continued to walk, even at my young age, I remember thinking the ship is not that big on the outside yet here I am walking what seemed to be forever.  Eventually we ended up back where we started.  I told him the snow in my boots had melted and I needed to return home.  I found myself at the end of my parent's driveway.  I walked into the house and announced to my mother I had a fun ride in a very nice blue man's ship.  I walked away from her hurtful words.

At first I thought the moon must be rising and causing that, but that was not the case.  The brightness was diffuse and I wanted to “pin it down,” so I locked my apt., which faces only east, and went outside the building to see if I could see a source in the western sky for the diffuse brightness. I immediately did see a source in the northwest quadrant of the sky.  It was a narrow strip of light, almost vertical but with a slight forward tilt of the upper portion, and a very slight curve (I believe) in the middle.  It did not seem to be moving.  It seemed to be just hanging there.  I stood and just stared at it for three or four minutes.  Then some clouds moved in front of it, and it appeared that it would be covered for quite some time.  It was chilly and late and I was alone, so I returned to my apartment and did not go outside again. Later, it occurred to me that there might be an internet site on which to report seeing something you have never seen before, so I called the phone number and spoke to a gentleman and he suggested that I submit this report.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,47.1544,-88.6471

I of course am, was, very skeptical and said (thinking she thought she saw a UFO), ""Well I don't see anything.""

Then one moved quickly in front of the other in a straight like fashion.  Then the lower circle of light disappeared, then the one above it, and then the last upper one disappeared.

I must have stayed out there for a good four hours just looking in the direction where I saw the circles of light.  It was like something out of a movie, I have never seen anything like it.  It was a feeling of fear, excitement, anxiety all rolled into one.  I went inside my house and googled anything I could find on this kind of phenomenon, then watched hundreds of youtube videos.

This all happened in Artesia, New Mexico, which is 57 miles south of Roswell New Mexico.   Another reason I was so skeptical.  I have always thought it was a humongous scam, UFO's and Aliens.

I was driving home from Wilkes-Barre to the Philadelphia area late at night, with the sighting occurring at approximately 1:15 am on Wednesday morning.  Immediately after exiting the Lehigh Tunnel, roughly in-between the Jim Thorpe/Mahoning Valley and Allentwon exists, I noticed two white lights to my right.  They appeared to be about 30 ft apart, and the left one was blinking about every other second while the right light was solid. I was engrossed in a podcast at the time I first noticed the lights, and thought oh it’s just some plane.   However after about 10 seconds past the tunnel exit, when the glare from the lights of the tunnel exit were fading away, I looked back at the object in confusion.  Why is this plane flying so low?  It was right at the tree line, less than 200 ft from the ground.  Why does this aircraft seem to be flying slow enough for me to nearly keep up with it?  Why is there only one blinking white light and while the other one was remaining solid?  As I was able to see the object more and more clearly, I noticed the two lights appeared to be at the rear corners of a silhouette of an equilateral triangle, with the tip of the triangle (again relative to the aircraft’s trajectory) having no light emanating from it.  It was bizarrely black.  Like the blackest black I’ve ever seen.  It literally blended in with the night sky almost too well for me to make out a shape.  And then I noticed in the middle of the bottom of the aircraft, there was this dim glowing dark red/orange circle (it reminded me of the glow from the last ember of a dying campfire), that looked like it had some kind of hatch over it.  At this point the craft began moving over the highway and to the left, still shockingly low in the sky, and it was beginning to slow down.  Still barley in front of me at the same height, I noticed a bright light shooting up vertically from what seemed like a random spot in the forest next to the highway.  The craft appeared to be heading for this light, as it had slowed down and then halted one it reached it.  As I passed by, trying to go slowly as acceptably possible on the highway, still seeing it hovering over the light, I lost it in my rear view mirrors after a few seconds.  It hadn’t dawned on me until a minute or two after the sighting that I thought to myself, why the heck didn’t that thing make any noise?  At its altitude, if it was any kind of traditional aircraft, it should have been VERY loud especially considering how close I was to it.  From start to finish of viewing the aircraft, it was as silent as if there was nothing there at all. I consider myself an amateur astronomer as I frequently take my telescopes out at night in my suburban Philadelphia backyard or elsewhere for viewing the night sky.  Only 30 minutes (or less depending on the time and day) from the Philadelphia International Airport, I have seen every type of passenger aircraft that frequent the airport flying to and from it, at all sorts of heights and perspectives, and I’ve never seen anything quite like this.  (I actually have seen a similar bizarrely noiseless totally black V shaped aircraft flying at low altitude a couple years ago in my backyard, but that is not what this report is about.)  I would do anything to get in touch with the one or two other cars on the turnpike near me at the time of the sighting for verification that I’m not nuts.  If you guys received any calls or anything regarding an aircraft of similar description that same night, I would really appreciate knowing.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,,

On the evening of Jul 10, 2019, at 9:38 pm, I was in my yard, watering plants.  The news forecast was predicting possible thunder storms,  so I looked up to check the sky.  That’s when I noticed the brilliant pink colors which I had never seen before.   The sun was just starting to go down. I grabbed my Samsung phone and took a total of 14 pictures of the sky with the brilliant bright pink colors.  I viewed the pictures approximately 10 minutes later as I wanted to upload the best one to Facebook.  I noticed a “mark” on one of the pictures.  When I zoomed in on the picture I knew this was not a scratch on my lens or an insect as there was a pink cloud in front of the object. At 9:55 pm I decided to send the picture through messenger to a local journalist here in Medicine Hat, Alberta. At 10:09 pm the pink sky was fading fast and the street lights were just beginning to turn on.   I thought I would take a few more pictures in the direction of where I took the first pictures.    The 4 pictures I took were a darker blue hue that still had some light pink clouds in the area where the unidentifiable object had been. When I think back,  I did not “hear” any loud noises that would have caught my attention like an airplane.  I did not physically see the object until I viewed my pictures.  It had to be going very fast though as the picture before (213806) was about 7 seconds apart from (213814).  Up to this point I had assumed the vessel was travelling SW because the dome is on the right hand side.  However, if the dome is the front of the aircraft then it could have been travelling NE in which case there may be a slight object in the picture 213806 which was taken before picture 213814.

The object was at an altitude of about 45 degrees with an azimuth of about 210 degrees (North being 0 degrees).  The most noticeable feature was the incredible luminosity radiating from the object.  There was no way anyone could of missed this thing, it stuck out like a soar thumb from the rest of the stars.  I was fixated on it for about 5 solid minutes racking my mind on what I was looking at.  Too big to be a star, much to small to be the moon.

At 01:45 hrs., I was feeding my horses, I was done with that and went beside my house, I was talking to my niece through her window and noticed a clicking sound coming from a outside automatic light that does not work, it sets almost to the apex of the house, so I was looking directly straight up.  When I did, I noticed a bright white flash, it was so bright that it was like someone flashed a flash bulb point blank in my face.  I tried to focus on that part of sky again looking in that general area and about 5 seconds later another blinding flash with a pulsing coming from the exact same light, as it was pulsing I got a pretty good view that it seemed to be cigar shaped and really super high. The pulsing stopped and then it was super hard to see because of how high it was but, I kept looking in that direction and noticed a commercial jetliner  going the same direction but I did not want to lose where I saw this object.  Then, again it flashed really bright, this time I had a little perspective as it started to pulse again and the jetliner that I saw earlier was approximately 4 miles away traveling the same direction as the object, the jet was way further than the object so the object was traveling super slow and much, much higher.  The object stopped pulsing and it was again very difficult to see. I tried to adjust my eyes to the speed that the object was travelling at and noticed it pulsing again, this time it did not flash but again travelling super slow.  Like half blimp speed if that makes any sense!  The object was moving west to east, I watched it pulsing then go dark, then pulsing, and going dark.   I watched this for approximately 8 more minutes, but I went in the house because I was having trouble seeing it anymore!  I have never seen anything like this before.  I know it wasn't any airplane, as airplanes have other colored lights that blink, this did not have any lights like that.  I know it was not a satellite because I have seen those and they shine and move fast and when they get out of the sun's light they slowly disappear.  A weather balloon while it could possibly move that slow, it could not have produced that bright white light that flashed and seriously blinded me for a couple of seconds and they do not have lights that pulse.

While driving I happened to look over to my left ( which was directly in line with McClellan AFB) and saw 3 white lights fixed in a triangle formation.  Directly after spotting the 3 white lights I realized they were attached to a black triangle craft.  It was very easy to make out the shape of the craft due to the backdrop of the sky being many shades lighter, almost a dim blueish black color, than the craft.  It was amazing how slow and low this thing was flying.  I thought for sure it must be a plane or drone of some sort but looked around in the sky and could actually see other planes flying around much further away and looked nothing like this craft in comparison.  The triangle was not very large, maybe 10-12ft wide, about the size of a king size matress or medium sized vehicle. It was moving very slowly and gracefully, almost making small S turns but at a very slow rate of speed, maybe 3 to 8 MPH.  The triangle was flying very low, only about 20-40ft off the ground, I could tell that was the altitude because it was just slightly above the light poles and building that werent much lower than it was which were only about 100 yards away from where I saw it.  As it flew slowly from Sount to North towards McClellan, one of the 3 lights slowly went out and stayed off for about 1.5 second and then started to come back on as another light started to extinguishing.  The triangle craft continued its S turns and lights alternating until it flew back behind the building that I first orginally noticed it heading north towards.  Keep in mind all this happened in a matter of 15 seconds or so, I have never seen anything odd like this in my life so the details of the peculiar nature of this craft made quite an impact on me. It's too bad I was so fixated on the craft and what it was doing that I didnt think to take a picture since this was so close and vivid in the sky, there is no way it wouldnt have shown in fairly good detail, especially with how good low light cell phone cameras have gotten.  Anyway, just thought I would share what I saw. I suppose it could of been a drone of some sort but if it was, its unlike any drone iv ever seen before or anything that I could even find after doing a little research. I dont even think a drone would be able to fly as slow and as smooth as this craft was flying. There was no jerky movement or momentum, no changes in speed or trajectory. It was like it was able to effortlessly flutter through the air as if gravity wasnt there.  Regardless, it was definitely a UFO, alien or otherwise.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,38.6681,-121.37360000000001

It was a very dark night with no moon, around 8 to 9 pm, the best I can recollect.    We had just left my friend's house when we noticed a very bright light, like a search beacon, being directed toward the ground.  We were in a very wooded area in the mountains of western Virginia.  The light came from our left, do not know the magnetic direction, and moved very slowly toward us.  The hills are very steep in that area and it was no more than 300 feet above the ground.  It was following the valley between the hills.  With the dark sky we were unable to make out a shape.   The object came very close to our location and was totally silent.  Being dumb teens, we were scared, and considered firing our guns in its direction.   We had second thoughts, as it might have had weapons as well.   We thought maybe it was a hot air balloon, but no flame was seen, and now I know that balloons don't fly at night, especially in the mountains at low altitude.   Before it was out of sight we ran back to his house and called his mother and another person there to come out and see it.  They witnessed it and were as awe struck as we were.   Eventually it passed out of sight over the next ridge.  It was moving still quite slowly.  We tried to fathom what we had just seen and figured that was the end of this experience, but it wasn't.   No more than a couple of minutes later, we looked up to see two jets following the same path streak overhead at low altitude.  I surmised it must had been Norad interceptors that had been alerted and responded.  Of course the government never announces this type of thing.    The next day on the school bus we told some people what we saw and a few said they saw it as well.  Several of the guys made fun of us, and so we never brought it up again.

It was very a dark, mainly clear, night making it very easy to see the stars.  Being an avid stargazer, I looked up to the sky to watch the stars pass by.  To the southwest from the passengers front seat I saw a strange bright orange light in the sky hovering around the moon.  I immediately noticed that this light was not a star or planet and did not seem to be any aerial craft that I am familiar with.  There was no explanation as to how this object was staying in the sky because i did not see a jet trail or fire coming from anywhere on the object.  I began to get an uneasy feeling in my stomach.  As I watched the object, the light elongated into an oblong shape, still showing the same orange light. 	I watched the object morph back and forth between the orb and the oblong shape for about 15 min in the clear sky.  Suddenly clouds appeared covering the area where the moon and the object both were.  Through the clouds you could still see the light of the object shining very brightly.  I watched the light change color from orange to white and begin blinking in and out from behind the clouds as a strobe light would.  After about 3-5 minutes the light completely disappeared followed by the dissipation of the clouds where the moon was back out but nothing was around it.  I continued to glance at the sky for the next few minutes and the object suddenly appeared again after about 5 minutes just as it had the first time. The object continued to morph back and forth between the orb and the oblong shape, shifting from side to side, while hovering. 	The craft stayed around the moon either at the same level or dipping down just a bit below the moon's level.  I watched this for about 45 minutes then more clouds showed up between my view and the object, where it repeated the same process as before, then again disappeared.  When this happened the clouds followed suit dissipating, revealing the object had vanished once again.  After a few minutes the object returned again, where I continued to watch this process repeat, until around 1230 when I fell asleep in the car.  I could still see the object very vividly during the event as I passed through towns and cities with their bright lights against the night sky.  I saw a plane in a different area of the sky but both the plane and object stayed in separate areas of each other.  Since the incident I have had technical issues with my phone working such as touch screen not registering, apps opening themselves, and my battery draining faster.  I am thoroughly convinced I saw an extraterrestrial craft in the sky that night.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,45.1534,-117.7723

I volunteered for duty- doing  temporary duty (TDY) in Central America assigned to the 8th Hospital. This was in Honduras’ Palmerola Air Base, near the town of Comayaqua. The only night I would ever do guard duty during the six months there, both Pfc. (blank) and myself observed an anomalous entity cross the night’s sky.  The “guard station” itself was a wooden structure with sandbag-reinforced walls and ceiling.  We were allowed to lay up on the roof of that bunker and stargaze for the evening-no contact was expected with others…very isolated part of the base:  “Just report back if you see or hear anything “out of the ordinary.”  So, both Pfc. (blank) & I laid up atop that makeshift bunker admiring how clear that moonless night’s sky was.  With minimal light pollution, and almost a total field of view from horizon-to-horizon, as we were in the middle of the huge Comayagua Valley. (Years later I would become a commercial sailor, so that night’s conditions were almost like being on the open ocean-optimum conditions.) Also, no clouds or water vaper or suspended ice crystals in the upper atmosphere were observed. At approx. 01:30am it appeared, rising up, above the mountain range to our West. It was a bright point of light (generic white light) several magnitudes brighter than any other celestial object observed that night. Out of the west, it arced up swiftly, reaching its apogee, almost overhead of us in less than 15 seconds. It came to an immediate stand still, resting for about 4-5 seconds, then, with no apparent “gradual”/ gradient/ exponential increase in speed, it arced downward by approx.  10-15 degrees, stopped for around 3-4 seconds, arced over to one side, stopped, performed one more arcing maneuver, stopping one last time for around 5-8 seconds. Then it shot off…arcing away, down towards the other side of the valley to our East. It appeared to have only two speeds…dead-stop…or full tilt throttle open fast.  My point is that no acceleration could be noticed from my observation…one could only guess as to the actual speed of that object. Years later I would see the International Space Station (ISS) traveling across the sky, either right before sun rise or right after sunset.  It takes more than 6 minutes for the ISS to cross the nights sky if its apogee is close to overhead…at 17,500 mph. So, what would take the ISS 3 minutes to be above us, that thing did in 15 seconds!  That’s roughly 12 times faster than the ISS, so doing the math you get a speed of approx. 210,000mph!  Depending on orbital height…  Well, that’s my story…  I always wondered if (blank) thought about that night in the years since…if he saw value or, at least, a little wonder &awe in the experience…for me the experience was like having an open-ended question bouncing around in your head…with no one to satisfy the itch it leaves behind…I find solace in the fact that just writing about the experience gives me a kind of closure…  Thanks for reading",2019-07-05T00:00:00,,

I was curious because there were no con trials behind the craft.  I have seen satellites at night and this craft was traveling about as fast.  I watched it as it approached the clouds that were pretty high in elevation and the craft went behind them.  The cloud cover went as far as I could see so I did not see the craft after going behind the clouds.  The craft did change to a darker shade just before going behind the clouds so I though maybe it was going into the earth's shadow.

I took a bunch; afterward, I returned to my home in Lancaster, California and downloaded them from my cameras. After the download was completed, I reviewed each picture for clarity, etc.  When I came to this one, it showed a “teardrop” type light in the upper portion of the photograph with a large halo surrounding it.  I didn’t notice the halo at first, I just wondered why the light was in that picture. At first, I didn’t think to much about, but as I reviewed them a second time, I began to wonder more about that light.  Initially, I thought it reflected of something, so I enlarged the picture and the halo became more evident.  I checked the area all around it, regular and enlarged, and I couldn’t see anything that would cause that light to be in the picture.  This may not be nothing at all, but it doesn’t show up in any of my other pictures. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time, but I thought maybe I should let someone know about it.

It was a clear sunny day with a few clouds on the horizon.  Air temperature was around 23 degrees Celsius.  I was facing west. I happened to glance up and noticed 2 very thin shapes on a slight angle below the sun at about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  The sun was at about 65-70 degrees from the horizon. At first I thought they were very thin clouds but then I noticed they were moving away from each other.  One going slightly higher and the other lower.  They then returned to their original position, about 10 degrees apart, one above the other and appeared to be moving backwards and forwards from each other.  Kind of oscillating. They stayed this way for a few minutes and then began to move apart, one going up, the other going down.  Then they moved back again for a few minutes.  Then the upper one began climbing towards the sun and disappeared.  Shortly later, the lower one also began climbing and then disappeared. I took a photo of the phenomena and a short video.  In the photo, I discovered a small sphere to the lower left of the lower objet. There were a few other people around but as there was a rock concert going on the park behind me, most people were looking that way with their backs to the sun.  My wife, who has no interest in any unusual phenomena did see one of the objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was already dark with no cloud cover and stars were out.   National weather service out of Missoula reported winds aloft at 60mph out of the NW over Hamilton, MT at 10:00pm mountain time.  Once I noticed the first light, I could see another traveling along a similar path as if one was following the other.  They were both equally bright and where much bigger than any object such as Jupiter or other planets or stars.  They were easily10x bigger than the biggest planet or star.  They were circular in shape, possibly slightly elongated when at their brightest.  The first one slowed and stopped directly overhead making no sound at all.  While the first one remained stationary and the second one continued towards the first, the first one dimmed and became smaller to about the size of the stars out at the time.  Then the first one vanished compl! etely. Meanwhile, the second one while still moving also dimmed down to a smal star sized object and completely vanished as well.  While all that was going on further in the distance a third object following along the same path caught my attention as well.  The third object was orange as well but different than the other in that it appeared to have an orange energy field surrounding it making it much brighter.  The main part being what seemed about the same bright orange as the first two objects, and the surrounding orb surrounding it a much lighter shade of orange.  This energy field that I call it made the third object 4-5x bigger than the main center object that it was surrounding.  The third object never came as far south as the other two so my view of it was not as close.  It may have been as far away as five miles to the NW when it reversed its direction and started traveling back in the direction from where it had come from.  Then it too faded down to a tiny orange object,  like the others and vanished as well.   Hamilton is in a valley that sits at an elevation of around 3,500ft with surrounding mountains between 8,000-10,000ft.

They were traveling in a straight line, appearing perfectly spaced from one another and traveling along the same exact path. As they traveled further and began to disappear one at a time, new lights continued to appear from over the tree line until at least 10 of them had traveled along the same exact path and disappeared. The lights had the same appearance as stars, but shone much brighter and were obviously far closer. They did not move like, or appear to be, airplanes.

They had increased the number of flights per month,, when Soviet bombers would test our early warning systems.It was not uncommon to be sent up to intercept and turn around Soviet aircraft.  During February 1990, there were an unusually high number of alerts that fighters were sent up to investigate and turn back.  But, pilots were returning and reporting they had not found any craft in the area.    One day mid February, I was one of the pilots on ready status and was scrambled to go intercept several targets.  When we located them, they were holding position, hovering.  We flew past 3 objects at approx 800 meters distance.  They looked like large barrels.  Maybe 3 times the size of a 50 gallon drum.   My wing man made a flat turn to the South with the intention of creating a separation between us I did a reversal called an Immelmann to create an altitude separation as well.  As I completed it, the objects were no longer visible.  We both continued South searching for them visually and electronically.  After half a minute the other pilot saw the objects on radar diving from extremely high altitude.  They dropped to a couple hundred meters above the ground.  Stopped instantly and held their position.  He was 5,000 ft below me, so he dove towards them.  All 3 objects shot straight up at approx. mach 6 until they went beyond our capabilities to maintain contact.  We patrolled the area for several minutes.  And we began the trip back to base.

My room, located at the rear of our house had a single window, set in an alcove approximately 2.5-3 feet deep with overhanding eaves.  Outside the window there was a large elephant ear plant, which obscured 50-60% of the total window area.  Outside the window there was a large river birch 15-15 feet from the house with a leaf canopy that was about 12 feet wide and blocked the entirety of the nigh sky from view. It was at 1:00am on that night I was in bed when I heard and felt a low electrical vibration, I sat up and turned towards the window and lareg display clock which clearly read the time.  The vibration became a hum and I experienced physical paralysis and a visual and physical change in the dimensions of the room.  The room itself appeared to expand and constrict as if it were becoming fluid. It was at this point a bright light appeared in the upper left hand corner of the window, despite the foliage outside and window blinds, the light pierced the darkness of the roomit stayed for a moment and then in less than a second filled the entire window with a bright white light.  The room was lit brighter than day with the blinding light.  During this time the hum stopped and there was a total lack of sound.  I was incapable of movement. The light stayed in the window for up to 10 seconds and then pulled back and shot away in the same angle at which it had approached.  At this point the room returned to its normal state, the normal sounds of the house (air conductor, pets etc.) returned and I was capable of moving again.  It was at this point I realized I had also been holding my breath for the duration of the event.  I looked again at the digital clock and observed the time was 1:30 and that 30 minutes at passed in what was less than a one minute event. It was the first time I experienced such an event, however I was not afraid after and from conversations wit family members I found that I was not the first to have such an experience.

After moving into my wife's house in Arlington Washington, near Arlington airport back in 2004 we witnessed something extraordinary while clearing and plowing a new garden in our backyard. Our cat suddenly started to act odd and was making strange yowling noises. She then suddenly jumped over our wood fence into the front yard in a run. That struck me as very odd. So I looked through the slits between the fence boards to see where she was going.  As I peered through the slits between the boards of the fence I saw a shadow moving down the sidewalk outside our house. At first I didn't think much of it. But then the alarms went off when I realized that shadow was showing up on the ground under the shade of a very large tree we have in our front yard. How can there be a shadow inside a very shaded area? That is when I looked again, but closer. Then I saw it. a thick very black shadow on the ground that was moving from 176th PL NE on 39th Dr NE in a south direction on the sidewalk past our house. I then noticed not only was our cat following this shadow on the ground, but a few other cats from our neighborhood were also following it. Ever seen a cat go after a laser pointer? That is exactly what all the cats were doing. Like they were trying to catch it. I know it wasn't just the shadow that attracted them because of the way our cat sensed it from the other side of the fence in our backyard. It was really weird.  Then I pulled my head over the fence to look straight at it. This thing was invisible when you looked at it straight on, you couldn't see it at all. You could only see it when looking through the small gaps between the boards of our fence. It was moving slowly. To me it looked like the shape of a guy in a space suit pulling a kids wagon. I called my wife over to look. It took her a while to see it, and it didn't register with her that it was something unusual. I had to point it out to her. I said ""It's a shadow in the shade""! Then she got it and her eyes got big. We watched it until it moved too far down the street for us to see it anymore. The last thing we could see were the cats following it because the street turns sharply just a few houses down and changes name to 175th PL NE. We decided whatever it was we didn't want to mess with it or investigate further. Especially since we couldn't see it looking straight at it.  Another caveat to this story is we had a child's wading pool full of water in our front yard. It had no leaks. I say this because it would hold water all day long. But all this same week leading up to this anomaly (shadow thing), at night the kid wading pool would get completely drained. As if something or someone was siphoning out all the water. I kept filling it back up and testing it for leaks. It would hold all day everyday, but be empty in the morning.  A few days after all this happened someone from Snohomish water conservation came to offer us ""free rain barrels making class"". She seemed very interested in striking up conversation. She was cute, blond, late 20s to early 30s. But she just stood there not saying anything after introducing herself and handing me the pamphlet about the class. But she was waiting for me to say something. It was REALLY strange and awkward. I got the distinct intuition that it was related to the shadow we witnessed and the disappearing water. Whatever that thing was, they knew about it and wanted to help us put water out for it. They knew it was taking water off of our property and they were trying to get us to provide water at that location for it. We went to the class and I did set up that rain-barrel. But I put cameras on it. Nothing ever showed up and I never noticed water missing from that rain barrel. I still get newsletters from that group at Snohomish water conservation to this! day. I never posted anything because I didn't know where to post it! And the whole thing seemed too far fetched to tell people about. Seems appropriate here among all the glowing lights people report. http://snohomishcd.org/rain-barrel-program/",2019-07-05T00:00:00,48.1853,-121.67780000000002

I never reported this incident to anybody at the time for fear that I wouldn't have been taken seriously.  After watching a program on television concerning UFO's and noting the striking similarity to what I had witnessed, I felt compelled to file this report. Although it has been more than ten years since my sighting,  Let me begin by telling you my location at the time and aproximate date of my sighting.  I definately remember that it was a Friday before Mother's Day, and somewhere between 2004-2007.  I further recall that it was late afternoon and close to dusk.  It was still light out however.  From my location at the rear of my home in Greenwood, DE., I was looking into the sky in the direction of Dover Air Force Base (about 25 mi. NNE of my location).  My attention was captured by a strange abnormality in the sky.  What appeared to be silvery white orbs were dancing about the sky.  They did not appear to be illuminated in any way. I continued to observe two objects moving erratically in the sky. Sometimes stopping completely then suddenly dancing erratically again.  Both objects moved in right angle directions at extremely high velocities. I could not believe what I was observing.  At times these objects would completely disappear and then reappear in a different spot, much like the hyperspace function in the video game Asteroids.  I continued to observe these objects for about 5 minutes.  Suddenly I heard the sound of aircraft propellers behind me.  A C-130 aircraft came from behind me and flew overhead in the direction of the sightings and Dover Air Force Base.  I found it odd that they were flying at quite a low altitude, just above treetop level and definately below 500 feet.  Then suddenly I hear a roar.  Also from behind me, two fighter jets at a higher altitude fly past the C-130 and in the direction of my sighting.  All of a sudden, the dancing orbs just simply disappeared.  I didn't know how to explain! it at the time and feared that someone would think that I was nuts or mistaken, but I know what I had witnessed.  They were indeed objects in the sky. They were indeed unidentifiable by anything I could imagine.  By my defination I would have to call them UFO's. Obviously I wasn't the only witness to this event.  The crews of both fighter jets and the crew of the C-130 had to have seen this as well.",2019-07-05T00:00:00,38.824,-75.6011

Initially, we pondered whether it could be a paper lantern as the day prior was the Fourth of July, so we thought people could be celebrating still.  We watched it, mesmerized, as it didn’t appear to change altitude over the course of several minutes.  It simply floated from the southeastern sky to the north-northwest.  As soon as I voiced that if it were a paper lantern it would have changed altitude by now, the hovering sphere stopped completely.  Suddenly, it went into (what I would call) warp-speed and darted north northwest, disappearing several miles away.   One friend, a native of Clarksville, stated that it flew right toward Fort Campbell’s air field.   My other friend, an infantryman, stated he had never seen anything like that, and that to his knowledge the military has no aircraft resembling that.  My other friend sat in disbelief.

We could see the moon to the East South East,  and it was big but not yet full. It was bright. The sky was dark blue. There were no stars visable yet ,due to the still illuminated sky.  At 8:57 I stared at the moon again, this time to see a bright star to the Right of it ( as seen in the video).  It was so bright I thought it was a planet. Not knowing my stars, I just wondered.  As I spent  a minute looking…it started to travel to the Right (south) about the same distance it was from the moon. It only took 5 seconds to cover that distance. Then it dead stopped.  It really caught my eye. My husband was now watching it. Then it moved Left , back to the original position. ( Video was taken after the movement) We decided to move inside the house at that point. At 10:25 pm we thought we could find some other stars to look at. We grabbed a white painters cloth and laid it in the backyard , I brought my strong flashlight with me. The sky was black with many stars . Within 1 minute, we again saw a bright star (among many that were visible that night) We were facing the West on a slight incline in the yard. Our heads were higher than our feet on this slope. We were facing Ball Mountain. Within a minute , we found a bright star traveling from right to left.(north to south) Then it stopped.  At this point I teased my husband and said,” hey lets call it over, maybe it can see us.” I waved the flashlight up and down and left and right about 5 times, immediately  this star started moving in our direction  (now it headed East).  It traveled quickly and directly towards our part of the sky. When it got close , it stopped. We were really frightened. I was sorry I flashed the light at it. We picked up the cloth and ran into the house. We did not go back outside. We did not speak about it. We do not know what we saw. We don’t want to know. – I do not think satellites change course like that. I don’t know if spy drones fly at night. I am unable to research this to my satisfaction.

Saturday, 8/24/19, 9:40pm EDT over the West Side of Cleveland.  I was sitting outside doing a fire pit in my back yard with one of my neighbors.  I'm in the West Park area of Cleveland, but almost in Brook Park, not far from Hopkins Airport.  My neighbor was sitting facing the right direction, ENE, to see it first. I was facing N.  She said, ""Hey, look at THAT, behind the trees!""  There was a triangular formation of 3 steady solid red lights.  I'd guess ENE at about 55 degrees on the compass, and maybe 25-30 degrees above the ground.  I think the triangle was pointing down, with the 2 lights on top, and 1 below.  Was so excited, I don't remember for sure, but definitely was a triangle.  She can't recall either. The formation finally came over the trees, but was much higher up, going WSW about 250 degrees and seemed high in the sky.  They were completely silent.  Took maybe a minute or less to transverse the sky, I don't know how high up they were. I would say the triangle was the width of 2 full moons.  The formation broke up into the lights being side by side  after being just overhead, but a little to the north, and got dimmer and somewhat translucent as it went toward the WSW.  2 more red lights came from the ENE, side by side, and went the same way, then 2 more dimmer ones the same way.  Then my neighbor then said, ""Look"", pointing slightly in the WSW direction, I couldn't see it. maybe my eyes couldn't adjust looking over the bright fire pit, but she said a round red light maybe 20X as big, she called it ""the mother ship"" but she said it was very dim and could hardly see it herself, with the other red lights surrounding it, all moving WSW and just faded as to the WSW she said.  I thought all the lights were faded and gone by the tine she seen the big dim one.  Looked to me on the ones I could see, they were going just maybe slightly north of Hopkins Airport and still high in the sky. The West Side and maybe downtown had to see it.  I tried video recording it on my phone, but my screen was pitch black, phone not good in the dark.

They were white and red/pinkish, with a brilliance unlike anything I’ve seen.  They were changing color, blinking. (You could see the lights and colors with the naked eye.  They were not at all like any plane.)

It was too high, there were no “propellers” or visible means of propulsion, and it was rotating. A passenger jet from LAX flew by and below the object. I could see the jet details clearly, and the object appeared to be higher than the jet.

I live in a high-rise building in Weehawken, New Jersey.  I woke up in the middle of the night and saw this bright object hovering in the sky above the Hudson River roughly across 86th-89th street of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  As first I thought it was a star, but as I look carefully, I notice the objective was moving and its brightness changes as it moved.   Since I don't have a telescope, I couldn't tell the exact shape of object, but it looks circular and it is bright.  After 15-20 minutes, the object began to ascend and the light got dimmer. Right before it fully disappeared, I saw another similar object appeared above the Manhattan Island, roughly around the 86th-80th street near the Upper West Side.  The object looks very similar to the other one.  It is round and it's bright.  It hovered over the area for about 10-15 minutes, then it traveled toward downtown Manhattan.  It was flying in a straight line, steady altitude, in a speed just faster than a helicopter.  I could hear any noise from where I was.   It continued to fly in the downtown direction until it has gone beyond the view of my window. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The just out of the sky, we hear this enormously loud trumpet blast, three times! (He said it sounded more like a trombone because of its timbre.)   On my piano, I found the notes were within a four-key (such as C,E,E and F - a major key signature) and were slurred (no break in-between the four-note phrase).  Each blast lasted about a second.  So loud!  We both agreed we had never heard anything like this and have no idea what could've been its source except to say that it came from the sky!  We discussed all of the options we could think of and came up with nothing that we're aware of that could emit these blasts. We are both retired Federal employees.  I am a former Public Affairs Officer for the USFS. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Actually, we are located east of Reardon and west of Spokane (just west of the ATV park just west of the Spokane River) in a coulee.  I don't think I was very accurate in my description of where we were because I was still stirred up over that noise!  If you travel Highway 2 east of Reardon, Coulee Hite Road is a left hand turn off Highway 2.  We were sitting in our little pop up camper which we have set up on our ranch property right now; it's so nice to enjoy our coffee there because it's cool (in the morning and evening) with the breezes.  I will ask our neighbors if they have heard any noises. We heard another one last night, but just a single loud blast; however, it was different from the three blasts we heard the other evening.  In fact, my husband and I are still talking about it, racking our brains for trying to remember anything similar that we've heard but so far, no luck!

Shortly after I was watching the area of interest, another ball of red light shot straight up into the air from ground level at least 4-5 miles away.  The ball of red light reached an elevation of approximately 3000-5,000 ft.  Once the ball of red light reached this altitude, it sat stationary for about 15 seconds and then took off horizontally.  The red ball of light came somewhat towards my direction and the red ball of light disappeared after about 3 miles of flying a perfect straight line.  I continued to watch and a couple more of these red flying balls did the same exact thing as the previous one I had watched 1 -2 minutes before these.  I continued watching and 4-5 more of the red balls did the exact same thing as the previous ones except without becoming stationary once they reached the same altitude.  Once the last 4-5 red balls reached altitude, they shot off horizontally, following the previous ones path and also the red lights all diminished around the 3 mile mark of coming in my direction. I did have my phone on me and tried taking a video, but it was unsuccessful due to the towns street lights being brighter then the red balls of light at a distance.

I was driving from Kent, Washington to Tacoma, Washington at about 10:45 in the morning.  I was headed south on highway 167.  I looked up into the sky to look at the clouds and I saw an airplane.  As I watched the plane, a silver sphere streaked into view traveling nearly the same direction I was (north to south).   The sphere was moving at a very high velocity, faster than a fighter jet.  As it approached the plane, it came to a complete stop.  Light was reflecting differently off of this object compared to the plane, which can be seen in the video.  At this point I had my cell phone out and began recording.  I did not record the object as it left, but I did see it as it left.  It remained stationary for around 10 seconds before shooting off to the east at the same speed it had originally approached.  It accelerated instantly.  I put my phone down and continued driving.  Around a minute later, two more objects, identical to the original appeared from the s! ame direction the first had come (north to south).  As they hit the spot where the first sphere had stopped, these two made a right angle turn at a ridiculous speed.  They did not bank, just changed direction and headed east.

Remarkably, it had no visible wings, tail, or engines; was producing no contrail; and was utterly silent.  By contrast, several ordinary commercial jets that we observed just before or after this object – were all readily audible (even when apparently farther away), had plainly visible wings and engines, and were leaving prominent contrails.  Birds that we observed flying overhead at the time had obvious heads and flapping wings, again in contrast to the object in question. If the object was the size of a medium-sized commercial airliner (hard to tell), I would estimate its distance as about two to three miles away.  The weather was clear, the sky blue with a few high cirrus patches, and visibility essentially unlimited.  The sun was still brilliantly illuminating everything in the sky, since it was more than an hour before sunset. I was viewing the object with binoculars, while my wife was viewing it directly without optical aid after I brought it to her attention.  Our sighting lasted roughly 30 seconds, from the time I first noticed it in my binoculars while idly scanning the sky until it moved out of sight to the northeast.  The object did not noticeably vary its speed or direction at any point during the sighting.  It appeared to have small dark markings at its rear and along part of the bottom.  It did not look fuzzy but had distinct outlines. The sighting overall was completely unremarkable except for the absence of any sound, contrails, or visible wings or engines.  I was left wondering whether it might possibly have been a small private jet with unusually quiet engines, flying banked so that its wings were edge-on to our perspective (and hence not observable by us), but several considerations argue against that hypothesis.  First, we should have heard engines, no matter how quiet, at its modest apparent distance and compared with other aircraft in the vicinity just before and after our sighting.  Second, it is extremely unlikely that a normal aircraft would have maintained a bank of about 30 degrees (which is what would have been required to put any wings edge-on to us, given its height in the sky from our position) continuously for half a minute in what appeared to be essentially straight and level flight.  Third, if an aircraft had been flying past in an attitude such that its wings were edge-on to us, its tail (vertical stabilizer) would have been plainly visible, contrary to what we observed.  Fourth, as noted above, conventional jets that we observed at approximately the same time were all leaving obvious contrails.  So, in conclusion, I do not know what we saw, but I’m contributing it to the database in case the information is useful.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,41.4485,-82.0186

On the evening of July 14, 2019, approximately 9:25 PM EDT,  I was driving home from dinner along Cleves Warsaw Rd, travelling west, glancing out the window to observe the conjunction of the moon with the planet Jupiter occurring that evening in the southwest sky, when I noticed a bright orange light which appeared to be moving slowly from west to east.  What I immediately notices is that this object did not have conventional aircraft navigation lights, tail beacon, or belly strobe light as you would expect to see on a conventional aircraft.  Nor am I aware of any aircraft having an orange headlamp, and having been a student pilot earlier in life, this intrigued me.  I was really trying to see what this object was. 	I continued to drive, until I was able to reach a parking lot, where I pulled in facing south, and I watched the object, travelling at a constant speed, which was relatively slow, my guess would be 30-40 knots, on a steady course towards the east, in the direction of downtown Cincinnati, OH.  The object passed slightly south of where I was parked, about 80 degrees off of vertical at my position, at an approximate altitude, my guess, of 1500 feet Above Ground Level. 	As the object flew past me, to the east, the orange light flickered out, it didn’t just shut off.  All through its flight, at every angle, the luminosity of the light had been constant.  Once the bright light was gone, I could clearly see a very large black triangular vehicle (perhaps the size equivalent of a Lear jet) continuing its flight to the east, and was able to watch it until it faded into the distance and into the darkening sky (the sun had just set, but there was still quite good light throughout this event). 	This object made no sound at all.  Its course west to eastward took it perpendicularly through the final approach glideslopes of three major runways of the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky airport.  There was no encounter with an aircraft as it moved through perpendicular to all three runway 18 glideslopes which run north to south. 	I do not know what this was, but a few days later at dinner at a friend’s home, I was told that their son and his friend also saw the same object that same night about the same time from a place that was about a mile east of where I was parked that evening, and that he had called his parents for them to go out and look at it, and his parents missed it.  At dinner that evening on July 18, there was speculation about a drone, sunlight reflecting off an aircraft, and yet to me, that doesn’t explain the lack of engine noise.

The area is mostly dark, unlit, with only a few area street/building lights. The sky was clear and there were about three puffy storm clouds nearby but all out over the Gulf or Mexico and to the South of my location.  It was a typical Florida summer night, hot and muggy with little to no wind and almost a full moon.  I had a clear view of the sky straight ahead and to my left.   To the right side of my view, the sky was mostly visible between the sparse tree branches/leaves of a 15 foot tall decorative tree.  I noticed through the foliage of the tree was a very bright fiery orange ball.  It was at approximately a 45 degree angle in the sky from my seated position.  The object was as intense as the flames typically seen coming from rockets after leaving Kennedy Space Center.  However, this was not an oblong flame, it appeared circular. The object had the same orange intensity on all sides and across the middle. It did not appear that any side was more or less lit up as it slowly moved across the sky. There was no visible trail left behind the object as it moved, no blinking lights, no change in intensity and no audible sound.  It was moving very slowly from the north to the south almost horizontal. I confirmed its movement by watching it traverse across openings between the stationary tree branches. I estimated it traveled from my view approximately one inch across the sky in twenty seconds. After watching it move for approximately five minutes, I estimated it was approximately one mile up in the sky and about a mile west of my location out over the Gulf of Mexico.  Watching the object, I walked through the open courtyard and then into the street to be in an unlit area when the object disappeared over the course of four seconds.  It went from its standard full size and brightness to half the circumference and half brightness and intense orange color. Then half of that circumference and a dimmer orange-grey color, then half of that circumference and grey, then completely non-visible. I gave the appearance that the orange sphere moved due West out of sight at a very high speed. I initially thought it was possible a storm cloud had begun to cross in front of the object obstructing the view, but the lonely storm cloud was still south of where the light disappeared. ( Total visibility time of approximately 6 minutes.)  I went inside and told the wife and kids of the weird light. I went back outside with the kids two minutes later. At 2229 hours, back in the courtyard we all see it the orange object. It was the same size, shape, color, fiery intensity and distance away as before. It was again very slowly traversing the sky from North to South.  We walked out to the dark street monitoring it. It still appeared to be about a mile out over the gulf and a mile up in the sky as we watched it for three minutes. Comparing it to the stars in the sky it appears to be 15 times the largest visible star or 20 times larger than the smaller stars. If a pencil point on a paper was a star, the eraser of the pencil was the size of the orange object.  Moving at a very slow speed horizontally from North to South, the light stopped moving for approximately two to three seconds, then changed direction and began to traverse in the complete opposite directions now from South to North at the same speed.  Nothing changed with the fiery orb during the direction change other than the direction of travel. We all quickly return to the room and enter.(Total visibility time 4 minutes)  I grabbed my camera with zoom lens and rush back outside one minute later. The light is gone and unable to be located. I walked to the beach and find no one with drones or Chinese lanterns. Returning inside I checked the weather website and determined cloud elevation was 6000 feet. When the object disappeared the first time it was half way up in height from the bottom of the storm cloud it was near so the object was possibly at 6200 feet. I estimate the object was moving at approximately 10-15 mph.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,,

We were taking part in an escape and evasion exercise on a training location in the area of Barachi where we were based, I cannot remember the exact location. We were in teams of five and had been moving across an open area at speed so stopped for a quick breather.  The sun was starting to set so the sky was a mix of black clouds and red sky. We were all stood looking west towards the setting sun when all of a sudden, what looked like a ball of light burst through the cloud in an arcing movement, then when completely motionless for a couple of seconds and then rapidly looped back through the cloud and was gone.  The object when it moved was way too fast for a plane and it did not move like a plane. It was a long way off and I would guess a hands width above the horizon.  We all turned to each other as soon as the object disappeared and said, “Did you see that?”  We all had, but none of us could identify it as it moved too fast for any normal aircraft. We carried on with our task and saw no other sightings of the object.  To this day I cannot explain what I saw and is the only unexplained thing I have ever seen.

Myself, my wife and 3 teenage sons were on our way home from Lake Tahoe, traveling south on highway 395 at approximately Noon on July 1st.  I was driving while my wife was watching a movie on her phone.  My 3 boys were either sleeping or on their phones at the time.  There was very little traffic on the highway and I had a habit of looking over to my left at the mountains, as I am a landscape artist and love to paint the area.   As I glanced towards the mountains something caught my eye. The best way I can describe it is this way.  I saw what looked like a “glitch” In The scenery.   As I looked closer I could make out a shape but could not see any details.  Because I saw the slight “glitch” I could see now that I was looking at what I can only describe as some sort of object that was shaped almost like a bird but the odd thing about it was that it was camouflaged with the mountain in the background, almost as if it were clear. I would look at the road, then look back to see it still there.  I got the feeling that I wasn’t supposed to be seeing it but because I saw what looked like a “glitch” on the front of it almost like the camouflage disappeared for a split second I could make it out every time I looked back at it. I am guessing that it was approximately 1-2 mile away from me between the highway and the mountain range.  After just a couple minutes of watching the road and looking back at it (keep in mind that I was traveling about 80mph and it was pacing me), it turned quickly and I watched it gain altitude and disappear into the sky after turning 180 degrees.  It was gone in almost a blink of an eye. Now the strange thing about it is that I got the feeling it knew I was watching it yet I wasn’t supposed to be seeing it.  Sounds odd I know but that’s how I felt. Anyway,  I didn’t tell my wife about it until tonight and I was researching sightings in the area and that’s what brought me here.

During the early evening of July 15, 2019, as dusk approached I witnessed in my backyard what I can only describe as a “hole” in the fabric of space. It was a quick event, but long enough for me to observe and mentally register the event. When I saw it, I was unnerved to the point I left the area rather quickly, but the next morning I took a photograph from the observational vantage point and doctored it in PowerPoint to capture what I saw. The Event: I had my head down, dragging a pressurized water hose out to the garden.  As I ame around the corner of the house, I looked up and observed what is shown in the image. It was about 15 to 18 ft away from me and appeared as a black hole in space, infinitely deep.  It hung there for a moment, then suddenly zipped to the right at a high rate of speed, disappearing behind the building shown in the photo.  I stood there stuned for a moment, and then quickly moved forward to look around the corner of the building.  There was nothing unusual to be seen. Description: As it moved to the right, there was a bit of optical distortion along the left edge.  That is, as it moved the edge itself remained sharp, but the view of the world adjacent to the edge was somewhat wavy, like looking through optical refraction you might see from hot air coming off a sun-baked road. It did not change size or shape as it moved and disappeared from my field of view behind the building.  There was no sound or air movement as it moved away. It was not flat in space, rather the equivalent of a twisted trapezoid sheet opening.  All of the edges were sharp and well-defined. As shown, there were a few sparkles of light in the lower right hand corner, similar to stars but bluer in color.  There were a few pinpoints of light that were brighter than those shown, but the overall size and intensity is basically correct. The image I put together is not perfect, however it is a very close, solid representation of what I saw.  Nothing however can capture the infinite depth or blackness observed through the opening.

As I pull up to my driveway, outside of the driver side window, I see what I thought was the moon with a very bright orange tent to it so I went to grab my Phone so I could take a picture that’s when I noticed that this object was not only not the moon, but that there were two of them and they were moving. I got out of my car and immediately turned my video recorder on.  They gave absolutely no sound whatsoever and couldn’t have been moving faster than 25 to 35 miles an hour.  If I had to guess I would say they were about 3000 feet off the ground.  The one in the front eventually lined up with the street that I was on and stopped.  The other one followed behind it a little slower and sort of lined up next to it.  It hesitated for a moment but then flew under the other craft and stopped for a moment making a Vertical line.  This only lasted for about 10 ! seconds before the bottom craft continued to make what would end up being a half circle and lined up again on the other side of the craft that was stationary.  Both crafts eventually flew off in the distance no faster than they had moved when I first laid eyes on them.  I was fortunate enough to be able to record the incident on my cell phone.  The footage is a little bit shaky as I am struggling to process what I’m seeing as it’s happening. These craft look to be orb shaped however it almost looks as though there was a slight tail coming off of them.  I don’t know how to describe it better than that.  Overall the craft were red but in the center there was more of a brighter orange type glow so the red coloring would’ve been more of an afterglow.  No sound was emitted from these objects during the entire duration.  In the video the only sound you hear is of me talking my cats who honestly sound a little concerned given how they were reacting my car running in the background and crickets.

Cherry Grove is a small town on the north end of Myrtle Beach.  The Cherry Grove Inlet, which is where this incident occurred, is known for paranormal/extraterrestrial activity and has been for decades. Since before I was born (I am almost 30) the locals living on or near the inlet have reported strange sightings.  At night randomly, with no consistency in pattern, numbers, or time of night, these globes of light appear in the sky.  The lights are a deep orange-red color.  The number of lights varies from 1-6 total (at least from what I've heard from the mouths of the locals and seen myself) and sometimes they appear in a ""triangular"" or ""pyramid-like pattern"".  Not every time. But sometimes.  They seem to appear more on nights when the moon is brighter, like tonight, and it is rare they behave the same way from one sighting to the next. When they appear, if you do witness their presence, they brighten and dim like theyre breathing. Brighter and brighter until theyre almost blinding, and then dimmer and dimmer until they are basically not visible anymore.  They hover for minutes sometimes, still and unwaivering, and then POOF they will disappear, only to reappear miles north/south within that same second.  In the blink of an eye. Like lighting.  Sometimes they're high above the ocean, and sometimes they are right down over the waves.  I've seen them sway and flit and zip about, much like a housefly does when in flight.  I've seen them down over the waves, just barely above the waters crest, and watched that orange-red light seemingly melt off of them and rain down into the water. I've also been right beneathe them.  When the tide is lowest on nights when the moon is bigger you can walk over a mile out from the public walkway  where the inlet starts.  And one night at around 930, back in March, my daughters and I were all the way out as far as you can go on the pointe, and they appeared.  Right above our heads. It was beyond terrifying. I couldn't make out a shape.  Just 2 orange-red lights, a few feet apart, maybe 50-75feet over our heads.  They make no sound. None at all.  Quiet as a graveyard.  And they hovered there over us, the orbs ""breathing"" like they always do.  There was no movement.  They were perfectly still.  Absolutely no waivering or swaying whatsoever.  And as we ran for our lives it seemed, I kept looking back at them to see if they followed.  They did not. Once we reached the walkway over a mile up the beach, I turned around to catch one last glimpse before the disappeared altogether. The commonality with all the reports, and all my personal sightings of them (I've seen them more than 50 times in the past 8 years), is that they only ever appear at night. Until today. I saw them. I saw the ships. In broad daylight. I have multiple pictures.  I will include them all here so you can see exactly what I mean. These are supremely advanced aircraft.  It's hard to describe the shape.  But the best way to sum it up is they have a  pyramid-like body, not super tall just triangular, with a hull the scoops upwards from the bottom, and wings that jut out and downwards from the body of the craft.  There is a light directly on top of the ship, and one on either arm/wing. It explains the triangular pattern that the lights sometimes appear in.  They are LARGE aircraft.  They were hovering at least 100 feet above the ocean, and probably a mile+ away from me over the water, yet they were clearly massive and robust in build/structure.  I'd dare to say bigger than our biggest commercial aircraft. It was a little past 8pm.  My daughters and I were walking on the Intracoastal Waterway side of the inlet. The sun was starting to set and there was a gorgeous display of neon pinks and oranges and yellows on the clouds.  The moon was bright.  The backdrop of the sky had a rainbow effect. I had my Professional grade Nikon camera with me, as well as my phone, taking photos of the sky out over the dunes towards the ocean side of the beach, when I noticed a strange steel gray/blue shape that stood out between the oranges and pinks of the clouds. Initially I thought it was a space in the clouds, and that it would move momentarily as the clouds drifted by on the wind.  It didn't move.  I locked my eyes on the shape as more of it appeared out of the clouds (again, it didn't move.  The clouds were moving at a decent rate).  That's when I realized there were 2.  The first one I noticed was closer, and far more exposed than the second, which hovered to the left and back away from the first one. They were still and unmoving.  As I wrapped my mind around what I was seeing it hit me what I was looking at.  With my eyes still locked, snapping photos as I moved, I ran through the dunes and back out onto the oceanside, never blinking or moving my gaze off these things. And once I got to the water's edge there was no denying what they were. I could see the wings, the scooped hull, the lights, the massive body and gray steel color. Aircraft like I'd never imagined before.  And they were right there in broad daylight hovering over a beach crawling with tourists. The look on my face as I stared up at them caught the attention of MANY of the other beachgoers.  Families with their children, elderly couples, another mother with her son, all tuned in and finally saw what I was seeing.  There was mild panic as many rushed off the beach, but I stayed there determined to see what these things would do. And just like that, as if they'd realized a decent amount of us had noticed them, THEY VANISHED.  To be clear, I know for a 100% fact they were still right there. They have an active camoflauge they use to blend in with the sky, like a cloak or shield, and they activated it once they realized they'd been spotted.  There is no other good explanation. Total time between when I initially spotted them, and when they finally ""vanished"", was about 12 minutes.  But I've seen these things for years. My family has seen these things since before I was alive.  And just based on what I know about them, I KNOW they were still there.  And I waited with my daughters for another hour to try and see if the lights of those ships would once again make an appearance.  They didn't. At least not while I was there. My father is the one who advised me to report this.  And here's why.   My father has been closer to one of these than I was that night the lights appeared right over us at the inlet.  But this happened at night.  My entire family and every local I've ever spoken to about these things has always said they only appear at night.  All the reddit threads and local posts I've read about these lights say they ALWAYS appear at night.  ONLY at night.  So upon telling my father that they were out and clearly visible in broad daylight he strongly encouraged me to reach out to the government BECAUSE if they went from being discreet and cautious about appearing only at night, to full blown daylight appearances over a crowded beach, SOMETHING might be about to happen.  Something bad. I've always thought, having watched them so many times throughout the years, that they were looking for something.  Why else would they stay over this 4-5 mile stretch of beach, and for decades at that?  Why else would they continuously range above the waters surface, back up into the sky, and then down again?  They have to be looking for something. Nothing else makes sense.",2019-06-20T00:00:00,,

After about 10 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated to the south for a short distance, then made a 90 degree turn towards the earth.  My house blocked further observation of the object.  The reason I am reporting this is because of the sudden acceleration and changes in direction the object made.

The objects were definitely not airplanes as they were very close and moving too slow and would have fallen from the sky. There were no wings or smoke trails.  They were not drones because the objects would get larger and then small again.  The objects seemed to appear out of nowhere.  They would randomly disappear in plain sight and reappear from nowhere.  One of the objects did take off across the same area of the sky very fast and then slow down again. The objects all moved horizontally and not vertically, not  upward nor downward.  Two of the objects seemed to fly within the particular area of the sky and stop (or disappear and then reappear) and then fly back facing the other objects in close proximity of each other.  I watched three disappear in the sky and not return to view.  The fourth one finally moved beyond the tall tree tops where I could no longer observe it.

I’d catch black figures and slight Shadows outside my windows in bushes.  I’d see a white orbs floating around that were very clearly different from the fireflys out I’d see a white light floating behind one of roses Bushes.  That night I had gone to the rest room my friend had let my dog off the back porch where she chased something that wasn’t there she proceeded to chase it til the start of the small section of woods that I had seen other Shadows had disappeared into.  When I walked out the door I heard my dog growling at something that neither of us could see at that moment my friend! looked over at me and said you have aliens walking down to her she had all the hair standing up on her body and when I gave the command to go track or find what ever.  Peering into the woods not seeing my dog or anything, we heard a shuffle in the fallen leaves then what seemed to be a high pitch screech high and louder than a jet engine would sound.  After we went inside and tried just watching some tv and hang out from then on it sounded like little pebbles or something was tapping the side of my house and windows.  About 30 minutes later I went on my back porch to put some clothes in the dryer while in the laundry room my friend standing on the back deck starts insisting we need to get inside now seeing floating orbs floating around and a distant figure standing on the edge of the woods only being able to see its shape.  We proceed to inside and from there it got even worse.  My friend got the vibe and feeling that he didn’t wanna sleep on my couch.  So I let him crash in my b! ed with me after turning out the lights and tv the whole house! seemingly started vibrating the sounds of things hitting off my house became more intense the glasses in the kitchen vibrating we can both hear them in the cabinet.  Sounds of languages and conversations that we could not understand start happening.  Bumps and bangs in the back of my house where nothing was on and locked off from my animals through the night.  My dog laying in bed with us seemed to start to growl then just stop like something calmed her.  My cat popped in for a second said hi instead of sleeping on his bed in my room he left.  After that I tried to sleep and my friend said he was going to try and mediate after that I can slighty remember not being able to move and a white light peering through my closed eyelids.  The flickering of figures filling in around until at the same time me and my friend both popped up and when the lights came on we both had looks of sensory overload like someone just hit a reset on our Brains both in a what the fuck just happened look we tried t! o go to sleep with the lights on where the same thing happened.  Until we both arose again at the same time looked at each other and said we need to get  out now.  Backing out of my driveway we both seemingly picked out a figure with some sort of owlish face standing in the woods.  We left the house for the night.  My friend went to a person who is open about this sort of things she took him to a spiritual cleanser she heard the story and said that it was out of her league.  After meeting up the day after we both seemed to have IV prick marks on our arms in the same locations.  Bruises and scratches and he had a mark on his side that looks like a medical device poked implanted something.  Just seeing what the community has to say or what might be recommended.

"Outside near midnight the sky lights up, brightly, by a tear shaped orb of light with swirling colors, then suddenly its gone.",Hardy,VA,2019-06-20T00:00:00,teardrop,1 minutes,"Occurred : 6/20/2019 00:00  (Entered as : 06/20/19 0:00) Reported: 6/28/2019 4:20:07 PM 16:20 Posted: 7/5/2019 Location: Hardy, VA Shape: Teardrop Duration:1 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/147/S147140.html,"Outside near midnight the sky lights up, brightly, by a tear shaped orb of light with swirling colors, then suddenly its gone. 	First,I am slightly embarrassed and hesitant to provide this information, but I really need to know and understand what this was I saw. 	I'm guessing near midnight, I happened to be outside heading to my car, from a friend's house to head home for the night.  When I noticed something directly above the tree line.  I was carrying a flashlight as I walked to the car.  I pointed the flashlight in the direction of the dark object in the sky, unsure as to if my eyes were playing some trick or if there really was something there.  As I pointed my flashlight at this, whatever it may be, the sky literally lit up.  It went from rather dark to quite bright, all at once. Just above the tree line, I now see a super bright something I cannot even describe.  My first thought was, what is a helicopter doing so low to the ground, and for whatever reason I started flashing my flashlight on and off as if I wanted to communicate with the helicopter.  Then I notice this helicopter is making no noise, and has no wind of any kind.  The next thing I notice is, as I started flashing my flashlight, it turned colorful.  It had colors literally swirling around and around this object, reminding me of a small helicopter completely enclosed in glass with fiber optics within, causing these colorful lights that are spinning around and around this object.  The colors seemed mostly oranges and reds, even blues and yellows but swirling around and around very fast unlike anything I have ever saw.   At this point I am yelling for people in the house to either come out or at least look my direction to see how bright the area was lit up.  Just as fast as it was there it was gone, literally in the blink of an eye. 	I do not know what I witnessed, I keep assuming some sort of military aircraft or something to that effect.  But, I need some sort of explanation.  There was no sound, no wind and I really cannot say for sure, but I swear I thought I could make out a single figure inside these lights, but I am truly uncertain on that.  The more I think on this matter, more and more questions seem to come to mind.  Now, I am scared my imagination is running wild with this.  Though, when my friend did come out to see what all the screaming and yelling was about, he can attest to how truly freaked out and uncertain I was about everything except this object was really there and not imagined. 	After having thought on this a week or so, and having looked up and read various reports on-line about FBI surveillance aircraft, and military testing I now and more uncertain than before, because that don't make much sense.  This is a very rural area near Smith Mountain Lake Virginia.  What could possibly be there that would ever need surveillance?  Again, I am uncertain as to this, but it is certainly something that my eyes and limited knowledge did not and do not recognize.  I am very hesitant to even tell anyone about this, but I would like to know if its something explainable. 	I just used a notepad on my laptop to compose this small report which does not have a spell check built in, but I have done the best that I can with this.  I hope it is enough to be taken seriously. 	Thanks for any time and effort involved in reading this.  I do give my word on my very name that this was not imagined.",2019-07-05T00:00:00,37.1759,-79.8013

The lights were bright white and in the shape of a slanted wrap around type.  One craft was higher in the sky than the other and that one appeared stationary.  The second identical set of lights was lower in the sky and closer to me...about a quarter mile from me.  The lower set of lights was moving lower and lower and then banked slightly as it came toward me.  There was no sound at all.  I had the feeling that the lower set of lights/craft saw me as I was driving  the car on the rural back road as I drove home, about 4 miles from the beach. The oddity of the wrap around bright white non blinking lights was startling against the dark empty sky and a bit frightening as they were the only lights in that otherwise dark sky. The moon was out but in a different part of the sky.  The lights were 'just th! ere' as I rounded a bend in the road.  The lower set of lights came closer to me, moving very slowly and smoothly. I could not make out the shape of either craft as that was totally black..only the lights of each was visible.  I have never seen anything like it before. The lights were over farmland and fields at that point.   I stopped my car to observe but when I saw it approaching me I continued to drive, thinking I would see them as a different point of travel.  I lost sight of them as I headed to a more residential area near Rt. 1 and Moonstone Beach Rd.  I should have stayed and observed but I was too nervous as this one craft seemed to head right for me.  I drove to my home not far away and scanned the sky but could no longer see the.  The Matunuck Beach area has been known locally as a 'hot spot' for activity.  I have seen several other UFOs in my lifetime but never anything like these two craft.  No other lights were visible on them...just the two bright 'halogen' like ligh! ts that seemed to wrap around the craft. I knew the lights were connected to the same craft because as the closer craft banked closer to the ground both light remained in the same relation to each other.  The craft came from the west and were headed east.  I hope someone else saw them and may verify my observation.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,,

After finishing washing the Jeep, my partner & I drove out behind NAL (business in town) to drive down the road & dry off the majority of the water.  I stopped the Jeep before the end of the road, under a streetlight, to get out & finishing drying it off with a towel.

At first, I figured it was an airplane or helicopter but the object was moving in too many directions for an aircraft(bobbing up & down, but moving left to right far too quickly for a plane).  I yelled for my partner to look & when he got out of the Jeep he said it was probably a drone, but I’ve never seen a drone with a hazy orb around it.  We couldn’t tell if the bright object  was very far away or somewhat close.  As I told my partner to go get his phone, to take a video  it became I creasingly brighter, & the color changed from a bright white to what almost resembled fire.  The object seemed to shoot off in a matter of seconds to the North & left a small faint trail of yellow light behind where it originally shot off.

I have never believed in aliens visiting Earth (UFOs), and to be honest, I still don’t know what we saw.  After witnessing whatever this was we were both were confused & just laughed about it.  My partners bestfriend is married to a police officer, so we called to see if he was on duty, he was, & to see if anyone else had reported this weird light in the sky.  He thought we were joking & after we explained what happened he told us that it was probably an airplane headed back to the airport or something from Scott Airforce Base.   Again I don’t know what we saw, but I know it wasn’t a drone or airplane.  Maybe it’s something else & you’re sites employees can answer what it was?  We are both scientifically minded, educated adults with good careers & don’t want people thinking we are crazy, but we have gone from confused to almost scared by what we witnessed.  We just want an answer. Ps.  We didn’t know there was a hotline until coming home & researching what happened & finding your site.",2019-09-12T00:00:00,38.6368,-88.9198

September 3, 2019 Between 6:00 - 6:30 PM  I was sitting on a park bench in North Issaquah Highland Community in a small park named “Leed Park”.  It sits directly on the north side of a “Marshalls Department Store” .  I’m sitting on one the two benches facing South.  My view is looking dead at the wall of the department store to the front, and there’s a small little forest of trees behind me.  I’m in the farmost eastern bench because I can see the southern sky above the building. I’m gazing up at the sky and I barely see way off in the distance a couple of parachutes. From where I was to where they are was about 2–3 miles away, but still in my site.  In fact, if I were to walk 50 feet to the left, I could see all the parachutes flying from my vantage point.  The actual parachuters appeared like little black dots with a colored parachutes on top of them from where I stood. As I looked at the parachutes, I noticed above them was a darker and bigger black dot.  It was above them a couple thousand feet or so.  It had wings.  It was flying in a giant circular motion like an eagle but it was flying upwards.  This was no Eagle, I thought.  It was flying in a vortex going upward.  I couldn’t believe it.  It would flap it wings looking like it was climbing in a struggle.  Like a giant sloppy bat.  This was very scary to see.  It was directly over the parachuters.  I’m watching it ascend even in greater heights.  The wing span was at least twice as large of that of the parrachuters.  I couldn’t believe my eyes.  I watched it disappear into a black flat bottom cloud.  I could still see the parrachuters but this creature went into this cloud that was coming approximately in my direction.  I followed this cloud for about 30 minutes just trying to see if it would pop out somewhere.  It was up there somewhere.  This creature was gigantic in size. All I could do was call the parachute company the next morning.  I told the owner everything I had seen.  He was very polite. The location where they parachute is called “Poo Poo” Point.  My sighting happened directly over the hot spot flying area.  Which is full of flyers.  You can see where I was on Google Map, and you can see where Poo Poo point is.",2019-09-12T00:00:00,47.51993157894737,-122.00758157894738

The lights where not blinding. The shape of this air craft is very difficult too explain because it had multiple different shapes involved as the design. It looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.  It was a about 30 to 40 feet long and 8-12 feet wide.  the fying manuevers of this aircraft is very unusual and remarkable.  It was able to fly below tree lines at a very slow speed roughly 3 mph, hovering capabilities,and raise itself over the trees. As it flew the back side of the house you can see and hear it.  I saw this flashing strobe light through the trees traveling.  I see it turn and slow down and raised over the trees as I looked back because I lost visual of the object for split second, it raises up to get visual and turns around and starts coming and speeding up and in a dog fight formation like its going too take me out, decreasing elevation and slows down and hovers over us like its survalencing us at very low elevation but below my tree heights because it had to raise itself in elevation to get over the other tree line.

I was sitting facing North looking at the back of my house, I didn't get a great view of it because I was turning to see it directly over me I was trying to grab my glasses at the same time.  It was Triangle shaped or more like a flying wing and it flew low and completely silent over me and vanished over the tree line behind me.  I had thought it might be higher in the sky and much larger but judging by the way it appeared over my roof and then vanished over the tree line I knew my inclination that it was very low was likely accurate.  It was white but glowing almost like it had a fog around it or like some sort of ghostly apparition.  I had my phone in my lap, but it happened so fast and it was so low that it came in and then out of my visual space in less than 10 seconds.  Here’s where I’ll put my though! ts about what I think but I can’t necessarily confirm size and speed.  I fly drones, so I believe the height of this thing was about 150’ high or under and from that height I’m sort of guessing but it must have been at least 20’ from wing tip to wing tip and was moving at approx. 40mph.

At first it was just a bright red-orange light headed towards earth from the East, if the projectile landed it would be a little bit North of us.  After a minute I asked “Do you see that?”.   We watched it for another minute, trying to understand what it was. My original thought was a foreign space object somehow missing a tail, but my partner’s was that it was a bomb.  She has better eyesight than me and later claimed that the thought of it being a bomb came from the way the light shone against! the surface of the object, like wrapping around its nose, “It looked like a bullet.”.  It was big, how big is hard to say, but big enough that if it did crash to earth it would destroy the city.   We got up and started to leave, but when no one else followed we questioned our decision.  “It’s still there.”  I noted, and we both watched it for a few more seconds.  From my perspective it seemed to stop and immediately change directions, now moving parallel to the horizon towards the North, away from us, but my partner believes it “slungshot back the way it came”.  It was completely gone within a second.   I posted a vague question about it on the Fire Jam Facebook event page and two others described the event as well.  I don’t know if what I saw was intelligent life, technology, or space junk, but whatever it was, it made my heart fall into my stomach, I could hardly believe what I was seeing was real.  I feared for my life.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

"Star-like two-layered triangular shaped craft flashing blue, red, and white seen flying low/slow then up and out of sight.",Bakersfield,CA,2019-09-06T23:30:00,triangle,2 minutes,"Occurred : 9/6/2019 23:30  (Entered as : 23:30) Reported: 9/7/2019 6:56:23 PM 18:56 Posted: 9/12/2019 Location: Bakersfield, CA Shape: Triangle Duration:2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/148/S148716.html,"Star-like two-layered triangular shaped craft flashing blue, red, and white seen flying low/slow then up and out of sight. Note: I am an avid night sky watcher and astronomy novice; due to this fact, before publishing this report, and directly after my sighting, I attempted to debunk what I saw, before categorizing it as an unidentified object flying (UFO). Incident:  At approximately 23:30 on September 06, 2019, I witnessed a UFO flying at a very high altitude and at a rather slow speed with a NE flight path.  When the flashing object first caught my eye, I thought I was seeing maybe a meteor or a falling star; it seemed star-like as it flew closer toward my location.  I thought this as I know the night sky during the beginning of fall brings such occurrences.  However, because I do study night skies and am aware of certain astronomical happenings, it did not seem likely a falling star or meteor.  After I realized it was no star or meteor I looked up flight plans and the flight schedule(s) of my local Meadows’ Field Airport in Bakersfield, CA, and found nothing.  The local airport was closed for the evening and by the look of the craft, I knew immediately it was no plane or jet.  The object had no “jet” stream, was flashing, the animals were stir-crazy, it flew very close to the ground without causing one thing on the ground to move from its force, as well as the fact that it did not make one sound as it passed above and then beyond my location.  These facts coupled with the shape of the craft led me to conclude it was most likely an UFO. I could not believe what I was seeing and rubbed my eyes several times all the while gasping at the closeness and vividness of my encounter.  I did not have a camera at the time, but I will describe specifically the appearance of the craft below. Description: Initially the craft looked star like in shape with white and blue lights flashing in an almost aura-like way.  As the craft stayed in continuous motion, I began to realize it was a craft of some sort with a seeming flight plan. Instead of star-like, the closer the craft got to my location; I began to see it was triangular in shape and was flashing not only white and blue but read as well.  I noticed the lights were also in the shape of a triangle seemingly lining the bottom of the craft; however, it was not until it flew directly over my head and beside me that I also noticed it had what seemed like a second craft or maybe it was the top half of the object, floating above the one below with a tethering of what seemed like a strand of lights which were not flashing but pulsating.  The object flew so low to the ground I was concerned as to what might happen as it was flying rather flying rather slow.  When the object was in my direct path, I noticed it was dead silent! and did not fly straight as it seemed to drift from side to side sometimes in a half circle and seemingly around obstructions.  Once the craft passed my line of view I watched where it would go next and it seemingly disappeared once it hit a certain point by my location.  I had a feeling I was to see more that night and I did of which I have video and will submit with my second and final sighting.",2019-09-12T00:00:00,35.34399793103448,-119.04089261083743

On the Night of August 28, 2019, there were two of us out at a cottage on Eagle Lake by Tichborne, Ontario, north of Kingston about 45 minutes.  We went out to the porch and it was between 9:45 – 10:15. As soon as we opened the front door and walked out we were looking towards the West, and immediately I noticed a bright flashing star.  I said oh look “it’s probably an iridium flare”.  (Problem is I’ve seen plenty of iridium flares over the years and to my best knowledge they travel at a steady speed and would look like a star getting very bright and then going back dim until you can’t see it and I don’t think I’ve seen them last for more than maybe 10-15 seconds). This was different, it moved from West to East and as I walked out I saw it flash so I thought that would be the end of it, but then it flashed again went dim, then flashed again and continued to do so about 5-10 times while moving (it was hard to tell if it was going in a completely straight line or if it was zig zagging as I had just got outside and my eyes were still getting adjusted).  Finally it reached directly above our location and it flashed so intensely bright my friend and I both said “WHOA” out loud and then disappeared…about 3-5 seconds later BAM it happens again and Flashed just as bright.  This time it appeared as though it left a slight trail as the light went dim and it disappeared heading still in the East direction. From the point of walking out the door to when it flashed and disappeared I would say was close to 1:30-2 minutes in duration. I have never seen an iridium flare get that bright before, nor have I seen it flash multiple times only ever once.  When I do a quick search it says that it could be something known as a tumbling rocket body.  I don’t think it was this either though. We went around back where it was darker to see if we could see the object again, and sure enough 30 minutes later we saw it two more times.  The 2nd incident it only flashed maybe 3-5 times and was still moving but again couldn’t tell if it was in a straight line or not (approx. headed East).  The flashes were nowhere near as bright as the last two we saw on the first incident.  The 3rd was similar to the second, straight overhead and only a couple of flashes before we couldn’t see it.  There was only about 5 minutes or less between the 2nd and 3rd incident.",2019-09-06T00:00:00,,

I occasionally spend time on my back deck observing space debris flyovers.  I am very well versed in observing the ISS and space debris that is in orbit, and the way it reacts to light from the sun in relation to brightness and fading.  Tonight it is a totally clear sky, so just after dark I decided to look for random space debris flyovers. While looking at approximately 275 degrees (WSW) at an elevation of approximately 75-80 degrees, I noticed what I assumed was a bright star.  It was completely stationary and after about 10-15 seconds, began to dim.  I thought this was odd since their is absolutely no clouds in my area tonight, and I could see stars all around the object..  The object regained brightness then it appeared to begin to decrease in size as if it was moving directly away from me.  Then in an instant it was gone. As I stated previously, I am well versed in observing space debris, this object was stationary and brighter than any stars in the sky, that is what drew my attention to it.  I live in a rural area without any significant lighting to interfere with viewing. On two previous occasions I observed an object that moved across the sky from north to south and then stop almost directly over my location, and remain stationary for an extended period of time until the shadow of the earth caused them to fade away.  I assumed these objects were probably satellites that were being moved to a new geosynchronous orbit, so I did not bother reporting them.  Tonight was a different deal altogether.  I have also seen Iridium flares and I am sure that this was not one of them.

They are bright white, as luminous as the brightest star in the sky, with no other lights present.  We have witnessed them passing overhead at high altitude and low, (they are completely silent).  We have also witnessed the lights stop, slow down, and accelerate in a manner not seen with 'regular aircraft. My wife and I are avid sky watchers, and as such, we are aware of the airports in the surrounding areas.  We are also familiar with satellites, and the varies commercial and military aircraft, (and how the ambient light can make them appear wingless, even distorted).  These lights are something else.  The easiest way to describe then is to picture a satellite in the night sky, then make it as bright or brighter than the brightest star, traveling at commercial airplane altitudes. Last night, (6/17/2019) we spotted what we thought was a commercial airliner heading NE, (towards Bishop International) flying so low through the late evening sky that you could almost make out its shape.  It had three incredibly bright white lights, fairly close together, but far enough apart to have a triangle shape.  As it passed us we clearly saw the back of the craft, where two small orange lights, (one on top of the other) were on its right, and a larger red light on its left.  The lights were not positioned like we are accustomed to seeing on commercial craft, and the flashing pattern was very different as well - the bottom orange light would flash, followed immediately by the large red light, then the top orange light would do a fast double flash, pause for a second, then repeat.",2019-06-20T00:00:00,42.8949,-84.0092

It was very close to the ground.  As it finally flew right over the interstate and my semi, I noticed that it was shockingly triangular to diamond shaped and had huge white beam lights on all three to four sides of the craft on, bottom facing the ground.

On November 11, 2019, at approximately 18:55.  My family and I, along with a 14 year-old neighbor kid were enjoying the evening in the back yard.  We live in Tucson, Arizona.  Our home is located about 2 miles north of the Tucson International Airport (TIA) and the Arizona Air National Guard base.  As I was conversing with my wife, our 10-year-old son said, “What kind of plane is that?”  He pointed to the west and I reluctantly looked because it is a constant question they would ask me. Just to shed some light on my background, I am a 23-year military veteran and former 10-year fire fighter, and 12-year law enforcement officer.  I am very familiar with air traffic, types of aircraft, and I also have a bit of surveillance experience on looking for aircraft using binoculars, ground radar, thermal and night vision equipment. So back to my sighting. I told my wife, come look at this!  She also watched in amazement and we could not believe what we were seeing.  This line of lights was very long and did not appear to be an aircraft of any sorts and I could see it still entering the atmosphere.  The object was very long and cruising at a very slow speed.  It was entering from the north and traveling south.  I would say, it was between the planet Saturn and the star Ras Alhague, slightly above them. As I held my hand out and measured It, it was about 5 inches in length as I looked towards the western sky. It was well above the horizon growing brighter. Each light was perfectly spaced apart, but some had distance between the middle lights. The middle lights seemed brighter, especially the one in the center. We were able to watch it for about a minute or so. It was not a meteor shower or a single meteorite. This was moving way to slow, kind of like watching a balloon float across the sky then it just disappeared out of the atmosphere as it neared just above Saturn.  We all tried to take pictures and videos using our Iphones but they could not pick up the image. I have experienced unusual things in my career but nothing ever like this.  I immediately called the Davis Monthan air force base operator and asked to be connected to Air Operations management.  I got no answer and I hung up. I called a supervisor from the U.S. Border Patrol in Three Points, Arizona, to see if any of their guys reported anything over the radio.  Of course, you can imagine I was laughed at! but I know how it is.  These are things you just don’t talk about. I hope this description can give some valuable information on what we saw.",2019-12-06T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

Once the sphere had traveled very quickly across my field of vision and at my ten o'clock position, it suddenly disappeared.  It did not fade out but just vanished.

My thought at the time was that it was an irregularly shaped object reflecting the light of the setting sun, and the intensity of the light ranged from ‘out’ to very bright.  At the same time, however, it appeared to be climbing rapidly. After about a minute my wife was able to see it as well. Again, it was a deep orange color, varied greatly in brightness, was as small as a small star (like half the size of Sirius, but visible in daylight), and rising.  I was able to see it in binoculars but only briefly.  I would believe it was well above regular aircraft altitudes, and near the height of a satellite, but again stationary and climbing.

This was not a reflection or water drop or anything else but a well measured out craft with well measured out features in even distances from each other. The picture was taken with my new iPhone In live mode so it captures a three second video combined with a still photo and when I swiped to see the picture I could see this was moving like a blue laser pen wiggling on a wall moving all over the place up down back-and-forth never in a straight line or flight path. I downloaded the app called Lifey it allows you to take these live shots and save them as a MOV file to see the video and what I saw is incredible! this craft moves all over the place like a pinball never in a straight path it moves up down backwards sideways forwards diagonal just like if you were to wiggle a laser light on a wall. In the video the craft appears from the dense clouds at ridge line of the mountain range south of Crystal Crag Lake and then it continues to rise up to a higher altitude and move around and the recedes backward towards the clouds south of the ridge line of the Eastern Sierras, At 10,364 feet, Crystal Crag is a dramatic and rugged mass of rock that is a recognizable landmark on the Mammoth Crest. The crag is a popular destination among mountaineers and climbers and sits above Lake George Mary and Crystal Lake.

I could sense a storm coming over my way so I looked up into the clouds and noticed a super bright object.  The grey clouds were out in the distance, and the shiny object was right overhead.  It caught my eye at first glance - that’s how shiny it was.  I stared at it for five minutes and realized it could not have been a star nor a plane.  It was located way too high in the sky for it to have been a plane.  I’ve seen both of those things during a sunset and neither of those were what I witnessed. I was watching the object, which looked exactly like a UFO, for 15 minutes straight.  It was a shiny silver color, and it looked horizontally elongated, like a disk.  It did not move. At about 8:50 PM, I saw the shiny object disappear into plain sight.  Again, it didn’t move or anything when I saw it fade away.  It’s like it camouflaged itself right into the color of the sky.

I estimate the distance to be several thousand feet up in the air.  A jet had passed over about 5 minutes before and was very high in the sky, unlike the object.  It was high, but not like a plane. The object was bright white, or white-translucent, or oscillating.  The shape was circular with a hollow center, like a donut.  Also, it seemed to be hanging in the air at an angle, like you would tilt a hat on your head – it wasn’t horizontal.  Direction was North, I live at the 45th parallel in what locals call ‘Northwest Lower Michigan’. The object was hanging in the air and there was no sound, and I observed it for 2 minutes when I went inside my house to get binoculars.  The binoculars revealed a closer look at the object, which I estimate to be the size of a minivan.  I watched the object, switching between unassisted eyesight and the binoculars for 5 minutes.  Towards the end of the time I observed the object, a single red light appeared on its West facing side.  I returned to my house to lay the binoculars down, and when I returned a moment later, the craft was gone. I telephoned the local Coast Guard at approximately 11:30PM the same evening, who told me “they hadn’t seen anything” and advised me to call the police.  I telephoned the police non-emergency the next morning (today) and was met with similar disinterest and doubt.

While driving southbound on the 154 at the dead top of the pass, I witnessed what at first seemed to be a meteor flying directly overhead in the same direction as I.  San Marcos pass summit is at approximately 1000 m in elevation and drops rapidly to sea level.  At the summit there is a clear view out over the Santa Barbara channel for about one half mile. The initial brightness of the object as it passed directly overhead entering my field of view through the windshield is estimated at -8, i.e. much brighter than Venus.  Within seconds the object had descended to at or below my elevation and was approximately five miles ahead of me now directly over Santa Barbara town.  The brightness of the light did not change in this period even though I now witnessed it from behind rather than below.  Within thirty seconds the white light changed to red flashing port side and green solid starboard which seemed like ""domestic"" aircraft but the lights weren't distinct and separated as normal aircraft lighting is.  Both red and green lights displayed laser-like qualities rather than incandescent or led.  Furthermore the lights seemed to blend with one another to a degree as though seen through a haze.  The flashing of the red light was not metered in any sense either as though it was randomly flashing in about one second intervals. At this point my view was obscured (and I hadn't crashed the truck (I refer to this stretch as ""the death zone"" due to the number of car wrecks here)).  Within seconds the view opened back up and the uap was now at least fifteen miles to the southeast over the channel off Port Hueneme.  The light now appeared further away but more intense which defies my understanding of the physics of light.  At this point my view was obscured.

Friady evening about 8:15 eastern time. Orlando fl. about 4 miles due north of Orlando international airport. They sky was 100% overcast-- looked to be 6 or 8,000 feet up--- as the departing jetliners at probably 4 and 5,000 were below it. I was outside making prepirations for the the approaching hurricane Dora (sic.  Dorian). Just at begining of twilight.  Stepped out of my shop to look at a virgin atlantic 747 departing for europe.  (Reckegnised it by its sound.) As I watched it go by south to north- I was facing east and it was passing above my eastern horizon and tree line in the distance.  It was about 5 miles away so I turned go inside and my eyes caught a light just over the trees as I was facing due east. At first I assumed it was some kind of plane because the sky was full of departing and approaching - both near and far.  Immediately I noticed that whatever it was appeared to be on fire.   And it was headed my way with some speed.   I thought -- if thats a plane-- he wont be flying much longer with THAT MUCH fire.  whatever it was -- it appeared to be engulfed in fire from every part of it.   I could see flames blowing out of it from all sides. I briefly thought of running away as it seemed to be heading right for me-- at least in its heading.  It seemed to be holding its altitude--- not descinding at all.  I ran to my shop door- about 20 feet away where I often keep binoculars hanging on a cabinet door-- but they were gone. I got my cheap flip phone and put it on video--- tried to center it in the screen--- and them tried to zoom it while keeping the object in the screen. By that time it was about directly overhead . I could hear NO NOISE at all.  So I rulled out a plane or a drone.  I could still see flames blowing out of it on every side - like it was a fire that was being actively fed---- I could also see NO smoke trail like a plane might have made (especially a jet- if it had burning jet fuel- which would have been very smokey---)  i believe after the video ends--- I continued to watch it untill it disappeared behind the western tree line. My mind was kind of overwhelmed trying to figure out what I had just seen-----  I stood there a moment-- and turned around and saw another one of the same thing above the easter tree line---- exactly like the first. I tried to get another video but only got a few sec. of this one.   I also watched this one approach the western tree like like the first one did.   It seemed to be engulfed in fire just like the first one.  just brfore it got down to the tree line--- I saw what appeared to be a halo appear which looked like a half sphere. It lasted about 2 or 3 sec.   ( reminded me of the umbrella shaped plume when a rocket's 2-nd stage lights at the edge of space--) It looked like I was looking at the back end of this thing- and the halo was symetrical around it--- After about 2 or 3 sec. of this halo---- all the fire abruptly ended----- I strained to look--- and I could see a distinct outline of some kind of dark object with sharply defined edges. The sky still has a little diffuse light and I could see it highlighted against it.  with only having my naked eye--- I  couldnt quite tell if its shape was square or cylindrical ro what geeometrical shape it looked like-- just that I could see sharp well defined edges---- and the fact that it seemed to be very large. Just before the fire ceased--- its position merged with that of a jetliner about 4 miles away (departing the furthet of the 4 runways) and its angular size appeared about 4 times bigger than the distant plane.  Of coarse I have no distance information-- all I know is that it was below the cloud deck.  Since the clouds were 100% -- if it had been above them I never could seen it at all.  The distant jetliners were probably 6 or 8,000 feet I woul dguess and they were below the cloud deck too.  So it had to be below that.   My first impression upon seeing the first one was that it was maybe 3000 or 4000 feet (when I thought it was a plane on fire---)  The time between the first one and 2-nd one was maybe 30 sec.  I would guess they may have taken 1 min to go from tree line to tree line.  I truely can not guess what this could have been.  It did NOT seem to resemble any UFO report I have ever heard. I checked the wind about a half an hour later.  It was out of the NE and the objects were going very close to from east to west.   The only thing I could think of was some of those rigs that people some times release that have a white paper bag with a candle below---like a hot air baloon.  However it didnt seem to be following the wind-- and if it was a paper bag that had caught on fire --THAT would have burned up within a few sec. as well as loosing its ability to remain aloft.  It would have droped like a rock.  At one point when I was watching the first object coming towards me---- I all most thought I could see a tiny faint steady point of light on each side of the fire-- like just near the outer edges of the fire. All most like a very faint wing tip light.  The only other thing I might immagine it could be ---- was some kind of upper atmosphere-near space plasma or electric discharge powered plane.  That might explain the appearance of a billowing fire--- the halo---- no noise--- an another thing.  The course these things were on -- was just about exactly the path I used to see air force planes commuting from Patric AFB (near port canaveral) to McDill AFB (Tampa).  I wonder if that --- and the fact there was a 2-nd one in trail behind the first one--- is a hint that maybe the air force was involved ????? That was what I saw !  It was very odd !",2019-09-06T00:00:00,28.519246697974758,-81.35409597886704
