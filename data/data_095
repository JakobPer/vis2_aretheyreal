I usually sleep with the curtains closed, but this time I left one side of the curtains pulled open.  (From my window I look north onto the south side of the Hollywood Hills.)   On this night, which had been clear to partly cloudy, it caught my attention that the clouds appeared to have a warm hue and I found it odd that I could make out the shapes at such a late hour.  I figured that the clouds were lower than usual and thus reflected more of the city lights.  This was the reason why I was staring out my window for about five minutes while in bed rather than trying to fall asleep.  Around 2:45am I saw what appeared to be a satellite pass into my line of sight at about 20 degrees above the horizon traveling from west to east.  About 1 second after appearing within my vision, it stopped abruptly, roughly above the North Hollywood area.  This was not a helicopter.  It was not blinking red and blue lights.   I initially thought it was a satellite but its intensity varied greatly to that of a very faint star and it mostly emitted a bluish white light.  For the next 2 or 3 minutes the light would flicker/fade in and out irregularly.  At times, I could not tell if the light was moving while it faded in and out or if there were one or two OTHER lights on either side of it also behaving in a similar manner.   The sky quickly became overcast around this time as clouds blew in from east to west.   When these clouds finally passed, I woke up my roommate, but only to point out what where obviously stars.  The strange light was nowhere to be seen. While I was looking at this object move erratically, I thought that perhaps my adrenaline and excitement were causing my eyes to shake.  I would repeatedly look away from the object to focus on the lights of buildings, street lights, and radio masts, scattered along the Hollywood Hills.  These appeared quite normal and steady. Of course, as I got back in bed after about 5 more minutes of scanning the sky, I continued to look out my window.  As I did so, I witnessed a cloud/ cloud-like object form from a small silver orb into a curved-rhombus shape and dissipate right before my eyes all within 1 minute.  I have never seen a cloud behave this way and my heart was beating incredibly hard at this point and I began to feel very disturbed.   I am hoping that other witnesses can confirm what I saw.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,40.306,-121.0058

We were nearing our house so I reached in my pocket to get my house keys.   I raised my keys up above my head so the street light would allow me to easily identify my deadbolt key. It was at this time that I noticed an orange light high in the sky to the north.  It appeared to be moving steadily from west to east with an even glow.   I asked my fiancé to look up at the light and she easily found it as it was the only light in the sky.  We continued to watch this light source move for the next few moments, all the while I kept expecting to see some sort of navigation light (red/green strobes) but it remained consistently orange.

It would fade then reappear to the left or right – bright as it flashed back on.  Knowing that eyes can make far objects appear to move, we were crosschecking our observations with each other.  The path also changed while it was jumping – it took a long hook as it went from south – north to east - west.  We were both taken back by what we saw.  This was a very high altitude event – it certainly could be compared to a satellite in terms of brightness and altitude.

As we went back on highway 28 towards Davenport to see for ourselves; we turned off onto the beginning of Scott road just barely out of Harrington.  Off to the southwest we saw a yellow light in the sky which appeared to me to be a circle at the time.  It was definitely not a farm light because of its great height in reference to the hills.   As we sat there staring at the light we saw, without warning, it expanded in size by a massive amount in under three seconds.  We couldn't accurately tell how large it was since we had not point of reference to base it upon.  The mood was frantic as everyone was trying to figure out what this possibly could have been.  Could it have been a firework?  No it couldn't as it was a solid color and last there for nearly twenty seconds in the sky.  Was it a lunar eclipse that was momentarily obscured from cloud coverage.  No; there was no eclipse that night.  And then the light started to shrink very slowly.

Number: 1 or 3 grouped together. Description: Round, hazy, red, white and yellow, bright lights with a long tail, extremely high rate of speed. I reside in a suburb located about 20 miles south of Houston, Texas.  There is quite a bit of light pollution in my area, coming from Houston to the north, and a small baseball field to the east, so star gazing is minimal.  There is a small, private airport, about 3/4 mile SW of my location.  Approximately 5 miles NE is Ellington Field, a former AFB, and still a current NASA facility.  My neighborhood is full of trees, which partially obscured my vision of what I have just seen. At 2105 hrs, I was in my front yard, speaking with a family member on my phone, facing north.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement in the sky, and turned to see what it was.   I observed a multi-colored, red, yellow and white, brightly lit object, moving at a ridiculously high rate of speed, coming from the SE, and traveling almost due NW, or right to left for me.  This object had a long tail, similar to a comet or shooting star, that was a sort of a fuzzy, faint yellow.  The lights were not blinking, bright, yet hazy, like it was surrounded by part of the front part of the tail..   The angle of elevation was somewhere between 45 and 60 degrees.  I couldn’t say if this object was at 35,000 feet, or skimming the treetops of the houses across the street.   When I first saw the object, it was NE from my house, and as I was trying to tell my family member what I had just seen, and running out into the street to get a better look, the object continued on its NW course, dis! appearing over the horizon.   This object was in my view for a very short time, somewhere between 5 and 8 seconds.   From my perspective, this object appeared to be about the size of a basketball.   There was no noise coming from the object, but every dog in the neighborhood was  barking or howling at something that I couldn’t hear. I am an active, 25 year Police Officer, and have never seen anything so strange, or move so fast.

I was flying from Chicago to Dallas-Ft. Worth at FL320.  Sky conditions were clear.  I fly for a major airline and have flown this route hundreds of times.  We were about sixty miles north of Fort Smith, Arkansas, on a heading of 210.  The time was around 2110 (9:10pm) central time.   Suddenly, I spotted an object at my 1030 position, traveling from east to west.  It was about twenty degrees above the horizon.  It was emitting a very bright white light.   As it was moving across my windscreen, I kept waiting to see a strobe or some other indication that it was an aircraft.  It was moving at a very high rate of speed.  As it moved to my 1 o’clock position it split into two bright lights.  The objects began to separate from each other and then they immediately disappeared.  The first object appeared to be the size of a tack head, if held at arm's length.  Then when they separated, they appeared to be the size of a pin. Another commercial aircraft, that had seen the same object, immediately asked Memphis Center if he was tracking an aircraft that had just flown over him.  Memphis replied that there was no traffic in his area.   At that time, I told Memphis Center that I had seen the same object.  Another commercial pilot then chimed in and said he had seen it too.   For the next five minutes, the other pilots and I gave a brief description to Memphis Center what we had seen.  All had observed the exact same thing. I must reiterate that the object or objects did not have a tail streaking behind or moving up or down.  They were moving in a straight line from east to west.  The bright white light emitted by the objects was more intense then I have ever seen. In all my years as a pilot, I have seen weather balloons, falling stars, meteors and comets.

This thing hovered at same level for about 12 to 15 mins.  It had flashing lights all around which started off red and blue.  It seemed to be spinning or it was the effect of the lights flashing in sequence all around.  There was no sound ever heard from the object.   I went back in the camp woke the other 4 which all witnessed this flying object.   I came back out with powerful flashlight and flashed my beam of light in its direction.  As soon as I started flashing flashlight the object went from a horizontal position to a vertical one, and the lights changed color to green and yellow.  I was begged to stop because my friend's wife was absolutely terrified and was scared that this object would land and or do us harm..  Two of us remained outside observing this until, this is the most bizarre part of story.  We just remember looking up at the sky but nothing was there anymore, as if we lost a bit of time or something.  We remember looking at this thing and then nothing.  We looked at each other and don't remember this thing leaving.   The following week, the local newspaper (l'Echo Abitibien) reported of this event stating that a object was reported seen by persons and if my memory is correct it had been reported to police by a few people.   This object was sighted about 15 miles north of Val-d'Or towards the town of Barraute, it was observed in the Southwesterly direction..  I know it's a long time ago, but this I will never forget..",2014-08-22T00:00:00,48.1002,-77.7828

You might find this interesting.  It may have been a hallucination.  This is more factual than a dream of aliens in the woods or the moon shining through the trees and waking up in the leaves. I believe this occurred when I was in Junior High.  When I living in Simsbury, I was going to a family friends swim meet (I believe in New Britain or Bristol) maybe in October,  we were driving and it was getting dark in the sky.  I should have been sitting next to a rear window because when I looked out the window I could see a rectangular sized football field sized ship in the sky moving very slowly yet probably really high in the sky. I remember it having very dark red lights or some sort of light source - I could view this clear enough within site.  It appeared to be the bottom carrier of some sort of massive ship.  I thought I was imagining this.  I checked with my friends family and they saw it too - we were all from the Simsbury area.  I believe they might have been ""playing-along"" with my hallucination and or imagination because it may have sounded quiet crazy to them - a media culture crazed dream separate from reality that some how seems to have manifested itself in my own personal delusions.  These fantasies of my own may have jumped out from my mind into the social consciousness of the car ride for reasons probably best forgotten if it was indeed a dream that I would not accept as merely fancy and nothing more. The other passengers agreed that they had indeed seen it as well, though to this day I still believe they were simply playing along to not embarrass the situation.  I still can see it in my mind till this day - slowly moving high up in the evening sky, practically dark except for this dark red glowing ""mother-ship"".  I only saw it for about 5 minutes I think until it was out of view.  Maybe the invisibility shield which would make such a craft hard to see and or undetectable was being reset for mechanics or energy consumption. I never really thought anything more of it.  It was just too breathless to contemplate  whatever it was.  It felt like floating time.  I don't even now if this could have been photographed.  These instances seem to happen at odd intervals on some sort of schedule. I remember we were travelling in a van.  On the return trip after the swim meet it did not happen again.  This was so long ago.  I remember playing Super Mario. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2014-08-22T00:00:00,41.67601576576577,-72.78116171171172

They were travelling rather slowly and did not have any other flashing lights like you would normally see from an airplane so it struck me as odd.  They made no sound and moved very slowly.  I then noticed 4 more of the same lights coming behind them from the same direction.  I quickly ran in to the house to grab my two kids so they could see them too.  When we got back outside there was another group of 3 coming up from behind the second group. My view in that direction is partially blocked by some tall pine trees so I was only able to see the lights through the breaks in the trees as they moved toward us.  I moved my position to get a different angle so I could see them better after they passed the trees, but they never appeared on the other side.  I then went back to my original spot where I could then see another small group approaching but the first few groups were nowhere to be found.  I followed the lead light in that group to try and see where they were going and it basically seemed like it made a slow hard left turn, travelling away from my vantage point, until it faded from view and the others followed. In total I saw 5 or more groups totaling approximately 16 or more lights.  All were in groups of 2 to 4 and traveled in a similar path in what looked like a loose formation of sorts.  I have never seen anything like this before and in hindsight I wish I had thought to count exactly how many I saw.  I was so surprised at what I was seeing that it never crossed my mind to count how many lights or groups I was seeing.  Each of the lights looked very similar to what an ignited flare looks like, just more orange in color than the vibrant red of a road flare.

One had just passed overhead when it stopped and made a hairpin turn and faded out almost directly overhead.  Another flared at one point, and we thought maybe it was a meteor, but then it resumed its normal star-like state and continued on its paced trajectory. Another abruptly turned on a very bright light that seemed to shine down toward us for a second or two, then abruptly turned it off.  (We were pretty sure at this point they were not satellites.)  As we watched the lights travelling overhead, we both saw, peripherally, a very bright white light to the north-east, traveling vertically, down.

It felt very uneasy.   The dogs started going berserk in the neighborhood just before the power came back on.   The lights lasted for about 15 of the 45 minutes that the power was out.  Very strange.   If it WAS an explosion, there was no sound and no damage that an ""explosion"" that could be viewed from all sides of the city would have made.

They could have been more than just a few feet but I do not believe they were small aircraft size.

Then the lead object seemed to slow, or the other speed up as they joined up at a point in the sky.  Not conjoined or linked, just close to each other in formation. They then changed direction and moved West in close proximity to each other and we lost sight of them as they passed our house and I had to move from the back porch to the front.

I did not see a second, nor did I try to follow the flight of the blacked-out object.

Driving home from Kennewick, WA, to Richland, WA, at about 21:20 (9:20pm) my wife and I witnessed a UFO flying over Richland and Kennewick, WA. At first sight I noticed a bright white light in the sky that appeared to be a bright star. As we continued driving down the highway the light clearly was getting larger, brighter, and looked as if it were getting closer to the car.  At this time now (10-15 seconds) it went from looking like a bright star to possibly a light to a plane of some sort. Having never seen a plane light look like what I was observing,  I then asked my wife, ""what is that in the sky?"".  The light was brighter than any plane light I had ever seen, and stayed on like a headlight rather than blinking like most planes I see do. My wife responded, ""I don't know, maybe a plane?"".  I then said, ""I've never seen a plane light like that"". The light then continued to grow in size and now was getting much closer our car. As we continued driving down the road, both watching the light, it then started to change color. The light now was getting very close to our car and was clearly hovering much lower than any plane would be flying.  The bright white light had turned to a more dim version of its previous self. The entire time this was happening the light was clearly visible through our front windshield as we were driving down the highway. Now, after maybe 30 seconds, the more dim light was almost directly over our car.  It was hovering, not moving like a plane or helicopter would be doing, and was only about 50-60 feet above our car.  It was almost directly above our vehicle, being slightly on the passenger side of our car. I was sitting on the passenger side of the car and was completely in awe of what my wife and I were witnessing.  I rolled my window down so that I could get a clear view of what was now above us.  I could see through the dim orb of light a metal looking craft of some sort. I could see the craft was horizontal and got larger on both ends.  Similar to a traditional dog bone shape.  The metal looking craft also had lines running vertically up and down the sides.  Once again the color started to change as we were passing the UFO. My wife and I had now just passed the UFO and I continued to watch it from out my rolled down window.  The whole time, even with the window down, the UFO was silent, producing no noticeable noise.  The light has now changed to a deep bright red color similar to a traffic light in color.  The craft was no longer visible due to the brightness of the light. The red light stayed on and the craft hovered on over Kennewick, WA, as we continued towards Richland. As we were watching the orb of light, now behind us, the light would completely shut off and it would then turn back on.  The light continued to blink on and off for the next 60 seconds or so until it was no longer in our line of sight. This was our first experience with any UFO.  I have always been somewhat of a sceptic, but now know for certain that UFO's do exist.  Having been so intrigued and wrapped up in the moment by what we were witnessing, neither my wife or I thought about using our smart phones to try and take a video.  We hope that this post is helpful, and encourage anyone else driving on Highway 240 last night around 9:20 to also post what you have seen.",2014-08-29T00:00:00,,

The nearest firework display had been cancelled because of flooding to confirm that it was not a remnant of a firework show.  It flew horizontally across the sky, at a steady, but fast pace. It was too fast to be a plane, and did not dissipate like a firework would.  The next day, July 5, my family and I went out on a sunset boat cruise around the lake.  The sunset was spectacular, reflecting against the clouds and as anyone would, we were in awe at the sight.  I was first to notice a strange, almost black sphere floating between some clouds.

It behaved in the exact same manner as the object the night before, but did not appear to have any visible lights against the intense sunset.

Between 21:00-21:30   LOCATION: Leander, Texas.  (RM.1431 between Trails End Road & Anderson Mill Road)  SKY CONDITION: Clear Skies.  Good Visibility.  It was not yet dark and the Sky was fairly well Lit. The ""SUPER"" MOON was above the horizon but low in the sky.  The Sun was gone from view, but its light still present.  It was not yet dark and    MY POSITION: Driving East on RM 1431.  Traveling ~55mph.  This is a route I commonly take 4-5x per week. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Driving east on RM.1431, the SuperMoon was directly ahead of me and I was admiring the incredible view.  Suddenly, this ROUND, WHITE BALL of LIGHT came streaking out of the Southern Sky to the North at an Altitude of approx. 700'-900' at a Distance of ~100'-150' in front of my vehicle. This BALL OF WHITE LIGHT (which I will call an ORB) moved so fast, I feared a plane was about to crash, but I could tell it was NOT a plane.  No plane moves at this kind of speed.  The ORB moved more like a shooting star, only its path was horizontal to Earth and gravity didn't seem to be affecting the movement of this ORB. As it streaked North, I had to look out my left window to follow it and as I looked North I expected to see this ORB already beyond the Northern Horizon.  What I saw next clearly confirmed this was NO Shooting Star!  As the ORB passed over me streaking North, I followed it by turning my head to look out my driver's side window.  At the speed the ORB was traveling, I expected by the time I reacted and turned my head left that it would have been well beyond the Northern horizon. Once I located the actual position of the ORB, I was astonished to see that it had not shot out of view, but had stopped accelerating just after it crossed over RM.1431.  But that's not all.....The Hi-Speed, Low Altitude ORB I witnessed had now become 2 ORBs and were in a 'wild dance' in the sky about 100'-150' to the north of RM.1431. As if the 2 ORBs were putting on a show for me, the lights went into a highly energetic, highly reactive state of movement that looked like a couple of Tasmanian Devils do the Tango.  The 2 ORBs spun around each other, twisted, tied and twirled in a relatively tight area with one another for about 2 seconds and disappeared.  I did not see how the 1 ORB became 2 ORBs.  It could have split into 2, or perhaps paired up with another ORB not in my awareness... This is the best description I can offer of what I witnessed. SIDE NOTES:  One final statement...I am a musician.  For about 30 mins prior to my ORB sighting, I was trying to perfect the cadence of each syllable so that every word fit the music just right.  I played my recording over & over singing these lyrics..... It's by Intelligent Design We're on this Rock Spinning through Space Spinning through Time Where Material overlaps  The Paranormal that overlaps  With the Divine That's what we find  This is a song about our Universe and how this Physical world overlaps with the Paranormal world, which also overlaps with God's Infinite Divinity.  We are connected in ways unseen to these other dimensions. I hope this doesn't sound crazy, but it's the truth....I heard on Coast to Coast AM that some people have invited ETs into their awareness and In the last week or two, I had actually made a few conscious requests for contact to see if anything would happen.

On May 23, 2013, Thursday, about 11pm., I was sitting looking into the west sky.  At a 45 degree angle and 1.5 miles due west was an red orange orb.  It moved north slowly, stop and move again.  Sometimes it  would just hang there and the light would go out and come back on.  It moved slowly.  No sound heard. After 15 mins. the lights went out and it was gone.  The height was just below the wisp cloud deck.  It wasn't a helicopter, no lights, just red orange orb.  Not a plane, no lights and would have fallen out of  the sky because it moved slow.  This caught my attention. On Sunday May 26, 2013, I went outside at 10:50pm.  Due north from me about 3 to 3.5 miles out was the same red orange orb in the sky.  It was heading due north slowly, farther away for about 2 mins.  I said to myself, darn I wish it would change direction, do a 180 degree and head towards me.  About 1 min. later it stopped, hung in the sky and started due south from a north position. It did not turn around.  It stopped and started slowly directly towards me, south.  It was about 4 miles out moving 10-15mph at me. I quickly sharpened all my senses because I wanted every detail of what this was.  About 1 mile from me the orb changed to white. I don't know if the color changed or it appeared to change because the angle of view changed, but it was a white orb now, heading directly over me, just below the light cloud deck.  At half mile from me the orb went from white to a very dim dull Grey orb about 10mph. just below the cloud deck.  I had to bend me neck to look straight up at it.  There isn't a light bulb on it, the air around it glows or is ionized. No light bulbs just glowing air, surrounding a circular craft inside this orb of light.  From  the center of this craft to the arc of the circle is perhaps a door. It is not lit up.  It was dark, the rest was lit.  It was 200 to 250 feet directly above me, at 10mph. There was a layer of air  unlit between the craft and the lit air around it.  I was able to see this clearly because the cloud it  was under was very white which made details stand out.  There was no smell in the air and it was silent, moving due south. No sound at all. It moved slowly  over the ridge of  oak trees and I lost sight of it.  It stayed a dull Grey as it moved away and never increased speed and never made a sound. My eyes were seeing what they were seeing, but my brain was having trouble filing info like this because it was something it never was dealt before. From a distance I viewed it 5 more times over the next 2 weeks.  Never close up.  Sometimes it was red orange sometimes white.  It often moved behind a cloud when I view it. Then I didn't see it again. A guy on YouTube videos it  off in the distance. He stopped his motorcycle to use his phone to capture it.  Same thing I saw, but on May 26, 2013, I got an up close and personal view, right over head.

We were sitting  looking at the stars facing west when I was first to see a huge round object coming across the sky from northeast to west.  It  was a gigantic fireball crossing the sky.  I was watching it and alerted my friend to turn and see as well. At first, it appeared to be low in the sky, thinking we were to witness a  huge plane about to crash.  Then we realized  no sound was coming from it and the scale of its size and speed came into perspective. It had to be very high in  the stratosphere.  Total time elapsed was 15- 20 seconds observing it travel. Comparing it to the size of the moon in full phase, it would be  approximately 10 percent of the size of a full moon, based on the half moon that night.  Gigantic sheets of flame were coming off it and speed was exeptionally high, guessing 6-8 times faster than any stratospheric jet speed.   I saw it first  and then drew attention my buddy""s attention to it.   This was huge and we thought as it crossed out  of view aver the mountain  we would see an explosion perhaps. We are wondering whether we saw an asteroid not pubicized, but a close call no  mentioned. Possibly space craft coming out of orbit? No mention any were todate and unsettling.

I ran out into the yard to see if I could spot it again so he followed me still saying I was crazy.  All the sudden the look on his face changed and I knew he had spotted it.  Out of nowhere the fireball was back moving slowly and soundless above the tree in our yard.  It kept in a straight line moving across the sky and away from us.

Meteor: sighting had none of the characteristics of a meteor: slow movement, no trail. Delayed reporting this until I was reasonably satisfied that it was not a satellite or an aircraft.

I am hesitant to report this feeling people might be critical being that its is so soon after my first report.  Anyways, this anomaly happened as I was looking at the stars in the Peabody, Massachusetts, sky.   The stars were very vibrant that night with minimal forecast. at approximately 20:30 hours I observed 2 star-like objects moving at high speeds (as fast as a plane would observed 300 ft up)  These object were moving in unison together high up as stars would be and never moved away from one another.  The objects were moving from the Peabody sky towards Danvers which is from South to North.   Approximately 3-4 minutes later an additional star-like object was flying at the same speed and in the same direction.  Then oddly enough I witnessed a both object this object flying the same speed, but in a completely different direction from Peabody to Salem which is West to East.   These objects could be mistaken as stars if it wasn't for their high moving speeds but not as fast as a shooting star.  These objects were moving is steady as a flight would be but the distance from myself seemed to show that these objects were flying at astonishing speeds. I looked at the Satellite and Space Station travel path of this day which does not match these times and flight direction.   Completely odd.

Both were reddish in color and maybe a couple to several hundred feet up in the air moving in tandem across the sky at about the same altitude and speed and at about the same distance apart.  There was no noticable sound, and it was moving to fast to be a set of hot air ballons and too slowly for an airplane either assending or desending.  We could not see wings in the dark showing any type of aircraft.  We could not see any fuselage that was attached to the either of the lights.  And, we don't think it was a helicopter, as we've never seen lights on any aircraft that resembled what we saw.  The lights appeared too far apart to be lights on a big plane.  They were just moving across the sky at about the same spee! d together. We pulled over to the shoulder of the road to watch the two tandem lights moving across the skyline, and a few seconds later, there was another sphere of bright light several hundred feet up moving from the east to the west after the other ones.  This ball of light, was even bigger than the first two, but  was alone and at about the same altitude as the first two spheres.   The third light was also reddish/orange in color very noticeable and not like anything we'd ever seen quite extraordinary and unique.    It moved in the same direction about 10-15 seconds after the first two that were seen in tandem together. We continued to watch as all three light spheres drifted and moved west out of our view of site.   This only lasted about 60-90 seconds total.

I was at a bonfire on Sand Lake beach when I among up to 5 or so other people i was with saw, and I even recorded video on my vx2100 video camera, UFO's.  There were 5 in the beginning. Sand Lake is a small lake near kearney in Northern Ontario. I was visiting a family friend and my dad.  It is about a 7 hour drive from Montreal Canada where i live, on the west side of Algonquin park I believe.  And it is some distance north of Huntsville.  The beach i saw it from was just off of the address 3660 Highway 518.  And the UFO's we were looking at were in the slightly North East direction in the air over the woods across the lake, past the east side of the lake.  So sometime between 11pm and 12am, I along with a young couple from a house nearby witnessed 5 UFO's. other witnesses came (another young couple i believe and younger 30 something cousin of my Dad's friend). There were 5 lights that had a redish and some white glow on them.  They disappeared and came back,  only 3-4 came back.   I ran to wake up my Dad and his freind who were sleeping together, they didn't want to come since they were sleeping so i also grabbed my vx2100 sony mini dv video camera which is very good in low light and ran to the beach.  I caught on Camera only 3 that came back i believe, and they were moving in motions that were very shifty and changing directions going higher or lower.  A really strange thing that was also occurring, were green flashes coming from the woods in the areas below and near to them, like lighting flashes but that were coming from the forest as the forest would light up green, and there were no clouds it was a clear night.  I'm happy i managed to capture 2-4 of those green flashes on camera also.  Though most people with me were in shock and amusement, one suggested maybe they could be drones, but he wasn't sure.  But that didn't explain the g! reen flashes below.  They disappeared for the second and perhaps last time, i didn't stick around much longer than another 20 minutes to see if the came back.  I was happy to capture that, perhaps i should send/sell the footage to a documentary on UFO's or Tv station? or as a last resort put it on youtube if that's not possible. An interesting sidenote: a friend of my sister's who i happen to tell this to also saw objects that had a red glow on the same night as me at roughly the same time,  he said he was in Northern Quebec when he saw them perhaps a 5 hour drive from where i was.",2014-08-22T00:00:00,,

On Saturday evening, July 5th, 2014, at 22:05 hrs. (measured; + or – 60 seconds) (Pacific Daylight Time), I was seated in a lawn chair on a neighbor’s front yard patio in Harrington, Washington, (Lincoln County), facing generally to the southeast.  Also present on the patio, at the time, were three other adults. As I gazed at the mostly cloud-covered sky (estimated 70-90 percent coverage), I suddenly became aware of a single white light, approximately the size and luminosity of Jupiter or Venus, moving across the sky from my right to left, i.e. to the northeast.  No red navigation light was evident, which would have been the case, had the object been a conventional aircraft flying legally at night. Within a few seconds of first sighting the object, I opened my cell phone, and noted the time to be 22:05 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time).  I called out the time to the other three witnesses present. The light immediately caught my attention because of its quite noticeable luminosity, and because of its relatively high (angular) velocity, an estimated 2-4 degrees per second.  I am quite familiar with the appearance of the International Space Station, as it orbits overhead, having witnessed it hundreds of times.  The angular velocity of the light I witnessed was noticeably greater than that of the ISS. The light was moving from my right to left, moving generally to the north and east.  Because of parallax, I am unable to estimate the object’s ground-track more accurately than to say it appeared to be coursing generally northeast.  It was at approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizontal plane, and it appeared to be moving across the sky approximately parallel to an imaginary horizontal line. The light passed in and out of the clouds two or three times during the sighting.  My distinct impression was that the light was “embedded” in the clouds, rather than beyond them (from my view), and that was the same impression that the three other witnesses had.  However, my recollection is that the object did not seem to illuminate to a noticeable degree the clouds when it flew either near, or in, them, although my recollection on this point may be flawed. All four of the witnesses watched the object for approximately 8-10 seconds, commenting the whole while on how unusual and incongruous the light appeared to be. The light entered a cloud, and the four witnesses continued watching that area of the sky, expecting to see it again.  However, it did not re-appear. At the time of the sighting, the witnesses were located approximately 30-40 miles to the west of both Spokane International Airport and Fairchild AFB, so they all frequently witness both commercial and military aircraft of many types, in the course of a typical day.  The witnesses agreed that the object they had just witnessed was inconsistent with any type of aircraft that they are familiar with. I plan to contact the local National Weather Service office, or FAA Flight Service Station, hoping to be able to obtain the altitude of bases and tops of clouds in the area, for the time and date of the sighting.  That information may allow triangulation, to establish maximum altitude, distance, and velocity of the object, as well as an estimate of its size.  I will append those data to this report, as soon as they are obtained. I have held a commercial pilot’s license for almost forty years, and have held an instructor’s rating for ten of those years.  I was raised in an airline family, and I lived with a U. S. Air Force family for one year.  Consequently, I am quite skilled, I believe, in being able to identify most private, commercial, and military types of aircraft. My vision, recently tested by an optometrist, is correctable to 20/20, or better, and I have no color perception deficit. I had a somewhat similar sighting from approximately the same location on October 17, 2011. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS, PETER DAVENPORT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER)) Data for the altitude of the bases of the clouds was obtained, courtesy of the National Weather Service in Airway Heights, Washington.  They reported that the bases were at between 14,000 and 16,000 feet (above ground level).  Using trigonomentry, assuming the object was at approximately 30 degrees angle of elevation above the horizontal plane, it was approximately 5.7 statute miles in distance from the witnesses.  If it traversed an estimated 30 degrees, then it covered approximately 2.8 statute miles in 8-10 seconds…  These are very approximate numbers, which depend on the accuracy of the measurements taken by the witnesses.

Then run back in and yell that I have to come back out and see this it is a UFO,  I turn back on phone, before I go out front door. (Driveway faces South west) As I walk out, I see a very right light up in the sky start record, then watch most of the sighting with my eyes, checking the screen to make sure I had it centered correctly,   What I saw is the light go up, come back down, the strange clouds had disapated, above and below the object, then as it made a slow descent I saw 2 separate lights above a lower disc shaped color of a dark royal blue or purple, almost a blacklight color but brighter.   The 2 light above it which took up 70% of it were very large and bright, with a definate separation of the 2 in the middle. This can be seen on a large screen Hi Def TV.

We were just out of the door when my sister said, “George…look!”, while pointing upward. There, north of where we stood, against a dark sky filled with stars, was a formation of red (fiery but dull red) objects (12-15) arrayed in a filled in equilateral triangle traveling across the sky.  I was transfixed and rapid-fire questions were zipping through my mind.  Geese?  Aircraft?  Sun reflection?  What is altitude?  Speed?  Why are they making no noise?  They traveled north to south in roughly 15-20 seconds.  I noticed slight changes in position between objects as they flew.  That observation told me that they were individual objects. Both my sister and I were very savvy science oriented kids.  These objects simply didn’t meet any criteria that related to “normal.”  Can you imagine standing there dumbfounded while examining every possible source in your arsenal of “normal”.  No noise, not cloud reflection, simply doesn’t fit within experiential normal.  I had seen B52’s flying at altitude.  They appeared to move slowly across the sky.  I had the impression that these objects were at a high altitude and traveling very fast. In retrospect, I think the “red” color was frictional heating.  We ran in the house hysterical telling our mother that we had just seen UFOs.  She eventually believed us and called the local newspaper the next day.  An article appeared in the Perry (Iowa) Daily Chief concerning our sighting.  I suffered endless harassment at school because I didn’t know how to recognize…Geese, B52’s, fighter aircraft, balloons…blah, blah, blah.  The same crap every UFO experience receives.

The witness, who was told to keep quiet about the event, recently decided to come forward in order to let the public know that an unidentified object hovered and moved about the plant for two hours in the middle of the night and was witnessed by at least 13 people. The primary witness, age 22 at the time, was living in Independence, Missouri and working as a civilian contractor at Lake City.  Lake City Army Ammunition Plant is a 3,935-acre U.S. government owned, contractor-operated facility located in eastern Independence near 7 Highway and 28 Highway.  The plant manufactures ammunition for the military for the U.S. Army.  In addition, Lake City performs small caliber ammunition stockpile reliability testing and has ammunition and weapon testing responsibilities as the NATO National and Regional Test Center. The witness worked the night shift from midnight to eight O’clock A.M. in the printing shop.  On a hot August night in 1969 the electricity for the entire plant and all buildings suddenly went out, so the crew of seven in his department went outside to cool down.  That is when they noticed a UFO. A bright chrome spherical object hovered just over a building which was located four buildings away from the men’s position.  The object was so bright it was blinding.  The object then slowly moved over another building across the road and hovered, then continued to zig-zag back and forth across the road from building to building for approximately two hours.  The seven men on the crew with the witness talked amongst themselves while watching the UFO.  At the same time, several jeeps with MP’s were driving to and from the area very quickly, which is something the men had never witnessed before. From their vantage point on the dock they could not see other people on the property at other buildings, but believe that everyone working there must have been outside since there were no fans running and the temperature was over 100 degrees that night. The unidentified object then left the area by shooting up into the sky at a 30 degree angle at an incredible speed. Raymond said that it was gone in ½ of a second, and that solidified the fact that the men were looking at a real UFO and not a military craft of any type. Just as the UFO exited, the electricity came back on. The next morning, two men arrived at the office that no one working there had seen before. One was dressed in a gray suit and the other in black.  One of the men said to everyone “Remember that you have all signed a security clearance and you did not see anything.”  The men then turned and left.  They did not introduce themselves or show any identification.  The message was clear, and the witness kept his mouth shut for 45 years.  But after seeing an episode of Hangar 1 in which Missouri and the Kansas City area were featured as a UFO Hot Spot he decided to come forward with the story.

It was a Friday evening, my wife and I were going out to eat.  It was a Lil after 8.  As i turned on the Hwy I can see this bright object in the sky.  At first I thought, maybe it could a star, since the sun was beginning to go down it was not unusual to see the stars at this time. But as I continued to watch this object, I realized it was way to bright and sitting way too low. About that time my wife yelled at me to pay attention to the road and wanted to know what the hell I was staring at.  I pointed up to the bright object.  She immediately said, ""it's a plane, pay attention to the road.""  As she continued to look at the object she said that maybe it was a star.  As I started to tell her that it was too low in the sky to be a star, she screamed out, ""Two separate lights fell out of it, two lights just came out of it and are circling around it!""  I stole another glance at it just as the two other light sources sped away from the first object.  One of the smaller objects passed over head. It seemed to reach us in no time. The lights flashed differently than a normal plane, blinked a lot faster and looked like chasing lights around it almost glittery. As quickly as it passed overhead, it was gone and now, so was the first object we seen.  I couldn't wait to get home to tell my son(since he is skeptical bout things like this).  For the next few days, I caught myself looking for that object again.  I did see it again about a week later. I was at home and it was about 9 at night. I went inside and told my son. We both sat outside and watched.  As we watched, we observed several objects in the sky.  Some could be accounted for regular airplanes but others were different.  We can hear the airplanes as they passed overhead, but the other objects(some looking like planes but light colors were orange and green) we could not hear. We stayed watching for awhile, then we seen one that was lower and much bigger. I ran inside got my binoculars.  When i looked up through my binoculars, I clearly saw three lights in the shape of a triangle.  I could also see from the lights glowing off the bottom of it, that it was dark in color and smoothed.  I showed my son and as we watched, there was a huge ball of orange light that engulfed the front of the triangle.  The ball of light came on like an explosion at first(like not there on second then the entire front of triangle was surrounded with this light).  When the light faded out, it was no longer a triangle shape.  It now had the appearance of a regular airplane.  The lights moved and started flashing(although they were orange light), it now had wings.  It actually looked like an airplane. My son and I watched it as it passed overhead without it making any sounds.  Both of us didn't know what to make of it. I am not saying what i saw was a ship from another world, but I do know, that whatever it was that we saw, was something neither one of us have ever seen before outside of sci-fi movies.",2014-06-24T00:00:00,30.236800000000002,-90.7975

After about 45 seconds, it disappeared.   Then about 20 seconds later a blinding neon light was coming straight at us.  At first, it looked like headlights.  But it was so bright that it lit up everything like looking through infrared glasses.  It was greenish blue waves that looked hot.  Like how the highway looks on a extremely hot day- kinda wavy.  This light shot straight through my car and passed by the passenger side window.   When I turned to look, everything in the background - the field - the trees were lit up.  And then it was gone.  It happened so fast that I didn't realize I had slammed on my brakes.  An 18 wheeler must have seen it too because he was stopped dead still on the highway too.

She was looking up at the stars over the airport when she yelled at me to pull over.  I did, and she then pointed out a blue light in the sky over the tree-line.  The light was small at this distance, it hovered in place for a few seconds, then moved right, and immediately reversed direction.  She started filming on her iPhone. I then decided to try and get closer to where it seemed to be hovering.  I sped down a few streets trying to narrow down its location.  We ended up near the Norfolk ice rink, where we found other people filming this light. We pulled over behind one car with two guys filming the light, and there was also a guy out of his van which he left in the middle of the road.  There were 5 of us standing there watching this light hover directly above us, slowly moving towards the woods.  The light was constantly changing direction above us.  After about 3 minutes of filming, the light moved towards the woods and that was last we saw of it. 	We could not make out the shape of the object due to the night sky being the only point of reference behind the light.  We could make out four bright lights that seemed to be on the bottom of the object.  Two were blue and two were red, giving off a purplish hue in between.  The lights were in a square formation.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  Due to all of these factors and attributes, we could not determine the size or distance of the object.  It could have been large and far away, or small and up close.  The whole encounter lasted approximately 15 minutes, with roughly 3 minutes of recorded video.",2014-08-29T00:00:00,42.1162,-71.3306

The following sightings were observed by two individuals between 11:30 Est and 11:45 EST over Lexington, KY.  Four identical and unrecognized lights, amber-red in color and roughly diamond shaped, with the weight of the diamond pointing downward, appeared from the east, on a low approach, less than 90 seconds apart. These light configurations, shape, and behaviors were unlike anything either of the observers had previously seen.  The lights were at least three times the height of typical commercial air liner lights relative to the apparent altitude and distance, were only made up of one color, amber-red, and did not have any obvious flashing patterns.  We live less than 3 miles from LEX airport and are very familiar with mundane commercial aircraft, helicopter, and private general aviation light patterns, color, and flight paths in this area. All four diamond lights followed the same flight path.  The flight path approached Lexington from the east-south east and at a low angle over the tree line.  In all four instances, the lights seemed to move slowly over the north-east portion of the city before turning to the due north.  They followed the same accent, flying at an approximate 30 degree angle upward, relative to their approach angle.  All four diamond lights disappeared in succession, 30 seconds apart and in about one third of their approach time. In each case, and at a similar point over the city, a small red flash was seen to drop away from the parent lights.  These occurred in the same fashion with each parent light, with the exception of the last and fourth light. The Last and fourth light followed the same path and dropped a similar flash from the parent light and at the same location as the previous three, except, the fourth diamond shape dropped two additional small lights approximately 15 seconds apart for a total of 3 dropped infant lights before turning to the north and disappearing in the same fashion and direction as the previous three. The infant lights from all four sightings had a visible duration of less than two seconds before disappearing from view.  Each infant light was of the same or similar color and brightness as the parent lights, but about one-one hundredth the size.  All infant lights had the same angle of drop which was 90 degrees straight down relative to the earth. Approximately two minutes after these sightings, a commercial air liner made an approach to the Lexington Airport from the east-southeast.  This approach seemed  unusual, relative to the average airline approach, in that the airliner's approach was unusually shallow. Additional high level air traffic was observed for several minutes after, moving north-easterly from the south-west, due east from the west, and north-westerly from the south-east respectively, several minutes after the initial sightings.

We were very surprised because it didn't behave like anything we had ever seen in the sky before.  It was moving faster than a plane.  It seemed close; under 10,000 feet.  The quality of the light was warm like fire and it twinkled slightly.  There was also a low hum that accompanied it.  It seemed to be traveling very smoothly and gaining altitude slightly as it moved out of our view.  It then disppeared into what looked like a very black dot; an area much darker than the surrounding night sky.  About 20 min later it appeared again, this time stationary in the sky.  It expanded slightly and again disappeared into a black dot.  Only I saw it the second time.  The rest of the group had already left.

At times the objects would just completely disappear from sight and then reappear in a completely different location to far away for any normal aircraft to achieve with known technology.  At times they would travel in a straight vertical motion in a way that only a rocket would be able to move and move directly at one another one coming down and the other going up and then meeting in the middle.

UFO Sighting near Bowmanville, ON, Friday, August 15, 2014.   I was driving towards Bowmanville, along Hwy 2, at 10:25 pm, to pick up my wife from work.  I was talking on the phone (speaker) with a friend, when I told him I saw a strange light hovering to the NE of me, near Holt Rd.  I told him I thought it was a UFO, and it looked like the top of a tower, even though I knew there was no tower there.  It was about 300 ft up.  About 10 other cars would have seen this too.  I spotted it right after I passed Rundle Rd.. I kept my eye on it and could tell I was getting closer and closer to it.  I could tell it was right over Holt Rd., as I was now just beside it.  I knew if I turned north on Holt, I could get out to see it, as I was now basically right below it.   I was still talking to my friend and told him not to hang up.  I found a place to park just north of the group mail boxes right across from Bob's towing, a junk yard and a car dealership.  From the time I turned at the traffic lights to park there, took approx. 10 seconds.   I got out and immediately looked up, but the object had just flown off in an easterly direction towards Bowmanville (3 kms away).  I could see it moving away and then out of sight.  To have moved that fast from Holt Rd to over Bowmanville would require a speed of 300 kms per hr I am guessing.  I have yet to do the math.  I had no time to use my phone to get a photo.  I would have if it had not taken off.  If I had had a gun I would have shot it down just so I could prove what i! t was.  I may never know. At first I was hoping it was a Chinese lantern as it would explain things.  I had seen these lit and flown, last year at my sister's wedding.  But of course they don't sit stationary in one spot and then dart off at unimaginable speeds.  The object was round and a fiery orange colour that glowed and I was close enough that I could actually see the glow shimmering.  Because it would have appeared as the light on top of a tower, I am judging that it was 300 feet up, and that it was from between 5-20 feet in diameter.  There is no way it was more than 600 feet up.  There was no sound that I could hear either.  This is the typical type of sighting that others have reported since the 1960s. A friend thought it might have been a drone.  My questions are: do drones hover?  Do they look circular and fiery orange at night?  And can they travel at phenomenal speeds?   I am not a believer in paranormal events like ghosts or alien abductions, but I know what I experienced and I will label it as a UFO.  My family and I also saw one back in around 1980 at Gravenhurst, ON, but that one has already been reported.",2014-08-22T00:00:00,43.95761489361702,-78.70425744680851

We were at DIA catching a flight to Boston.  Our flight had been delayed for several hours due to mechanical errors and then poor weather conditions, so we were on the runway waiting to depart along with several other airplanes that were also delayed.  Our plane was just sitting on the runway waiting for other planes to lift off.  I was looking out the window watching how many planes were just sitting there as it was a really weird to see 8-10 planes lined up like that. It was then that I noticed a small bright light becoming larger and brighter at around 3000 ft and about a ¼ of a mile away from our plane.  I think we were looking towards the South, but I don’t know that for sure.  It was too low to be a planet or star and it was most definitely not a plane or helicopter as it sat stationary.  I asked my friend sitting next to me what she thought it was and she said she thought it was a satellite.  I laughed and said that there was no way it could be a satellite as it was just sitting there and the fact that it was so low and bright, that no satellite could do that, so I kept watching.  This is where it got really weird. It first appeared as a small white-yellowish light that became larger and brighter right in front of my eyes.  Then it became about the size of a dime (a little smaller actually) at arm’s length. It sat there for about 45-60 seconds, moved a little to the left, and then it disappeared. I pointed out to my friend that it just disappeared and she said, “Well, that’s not a satellite then!”  I kept looking to see if it would come back and it did!  This time, it did the exact same thing as before, starting out as small, got bigger and brighter, stayed put for a bit, and then moved to the left, and then it disappeared again.  But this time, my friend saw it come back and watched it do exactly what I described the first time.  We were blown away as it seemed to be observing all the aircrafts lined up waiting to take off. As we were complaining about just sitting on the runway with no movement, it came back a 3rd time and made itself known in the exact same fashion as the previous events.  This time I took a picture of it with my new phone.  I haven’t figured out a way to make the picture bigger or clearer yet, but I’m excited to see what it’ll look like once I do. Also, the following night in Cape Cod, I and 2 other friends had another sighting that just blew our minds!

Two friends and I were standing outside in the front yard having a smoke at this vacation rental property in Chatham (Cape Cod) at around 9:30 pm or 10:00 pm.  I glanced upward at one of the trees in the yard and through the branches; I noticed a bright white light flying in the sky at a fairly high rate of speed. At first I didn’t think it was unusual because I could only see it partially through the branches and it didn’t seem like a big deal, but then it picked up speed and changed direction a bit and started flying towards us.  I told my friends to look at it and tell me what it was. Well, both of them immediately said, “Holy crap!”  We knew it wasn’t a plane, satellite, helicopter or anything else manmade because this thing was HUGE and it was moving faster than any aircraft known to us.  We were watching it for about 60 seconds with a very clear view of it when all the sudden, it disappeared right in front of our eyes. My friends have never seen a UFO before and quite frankly, they think I might be a little crazy because I’ve seen so many of them over the years.  But all three of us knew that what we just saw didn’t have a reasonable explanation as it was definitely unidentifiable!!!  We told the other four people in the house about it and they of course thought we were crazy and they didn’t take it seriously at all. Also, about 11:30 pm, we went into the backyard to have one last smoke before bed and I noticed a very small white-greenish light flying about 15ft above us through the trees.

I backed back down the driveway (it is on a hill), to get a better view.  Realized it was nothing familiar so ran into the house and told my sister to get onto the deck quickly to see this thing.  She has good distance vision, I am near sighted. We moved to the deck on the lake side of the house where we could still see it as it moved away from us to the west over the lake.  My sister immediately said that it was triangular and that the orange lights almost looked like fluorescent tube lights around the edges.  It just continued moving at the same pace and with the same trajectory.  Not a sound was heard and it was a quiet, still night. We have tried to estimate the altitude of whatever it was and can only say with certainty that it was low enough for her to be able to see some detail, no where near the altitude of the typical jets we occasionally see overhead.  It was in no danger of hitting tree tops or even cell towers but still close enough to see well. We have not heard of anyone else reporting this object however, I know people are outside @ night and I am certain that other people would have seen it.  The thing was very bright orange and looked very large going across the sky. I did not take the time to find cameras.

I was sitting around a campfire with a neighbor, when we saw something moving across the sky heading west from east.  It had weird movements, as it would have semicircle movements at some points, straight line at others.  Once it got close to directly overhead, it had a habit of just staying in place.  It seemed like any of the stars, with nothing remarkable.  I tried to record it with my iPhone, but not even the campfire was showing on the trees(light from the campfire.  Trees were not on fire. Just making sure). We were dumbstruck on what it could be.  I tried to rationalize it every way I could.  I'm an avid amateur astronomer and a total fan of physics in all it's forms.  I could not find an explanation. I tried to think as it moved, if it could be a satellite.  But to my knowledge, a satellite does not have sudden stops in movement.  I then tried to think weather balloon.  But a weather balloon wouldn't be visible even at the maximum height it could achieve at that time of night.  I then figured maybe a weird hyper-velocity star.  But to no avail, I could not rationalize anything about it. I tried blurring my eyes to pin-point what kind of light source.  At one point, I could pick out a total of three light sources from the one source of light.  At one point, seemed as a light source came from it and faded away.  Then another light source(one west and one SSW[being the second one]) came into view.  Once the second one was visible, both came to a sort of full stop.  They made movements, but never left the spot.  They stayed there up until I grew tired of watching them (23:15), and are probably still there since I came inside.   The movements even when they were relatively in one spot just seemed weird.  It'd be weird semicircles and full circles, but not covering much distance.  Sometimes would move different directions, but same area. I've seen a couple of strange things in the past, but this is a new pattern I saw.  Usually they disappear after a certain point.  I've never seen anything move so fast and cover so much space, to just stay at one point.  I have no explanation for what I saw.",2014-08-29T00:00:00,45.65808015267176,-122.58490839694656

We saw a cluster of between three to five very bright white lights.  The cluster formed a sort of circle, but it changed formation.  The cluster flew erratically over an area relatively low to the ground—this was an area of undeveloped land for the most part.  It would move around, dip down towards the ground, then move upward very fast, then move around again in a formation, kind of dipping and shooting up and making sudden turns, all fairly low to the ground in ways that no plane or helicopter or other flying thing I know of could do.  Certainly nothing of this size. The lights on this were incredibly bright.  My husband asked if we should turn around at the 76 exit and go back to try and see it again once we passed it.

There was a lightning storm in the distance when I noticed two balls of light on the edge of the storm which I initially thought to be ball lightning. Upon closer inspection the balls of light were acting strange, they maintained a consistent size/shape/flying formation before flying around the front of the storm and around to the back.  (They were on the right side then came around the front and disappeared around the left side) 	 Maybe 30 seconds later the lights came back to the front but this time there were 4 of them in a diamond shape. They stopped along the right side and rearranged themselves when the storm really started to light up on the same side. 	The lights all went single file around the back for a little bit before 6-8 in a cluster came back out to the front right arranged themselves into a V or check mark shape and disappeared up into the clouds.  Around this time the car made a weird noise and kind of flickered for a second but it’s an older car so it may or may not have been related.  	The balls of light were all the same size and color, bright white with a slight electric blue tinge. They were above treetop level and below cloud level but I’m not to great at guessing altitude so I don’t know exactly how high they were.  They were about the size of a small airplane in diameter each. (like if you drew a circle around the plane, that size) They were just way to consistent and precise to be ball lightning, they moved with a purpose.  	I watched for about 10 minutes but they were already there when I started watching so they were probably there longer.

Moving southwest to northeast in a straight line I was surprised to see what appeared to be a bright red rectangular shaped object with a bright white light in the middle.  The shape was something like a sport skydiver might use, except this rectangular object was moving lengthwise.  I know it wasn't a helicopter (saw & heard the police chopper flying earlier before & after the fireworks show), it didn't look like a plane and I never heard any sounds.   I moved to the front yard to get a longer view of it and saw my neighbor (retired military, worked on helicopters) so I called him over to look at it.  He was as surprised and puzzled as I was.  He didn't hear anything and saw the same rectangular shape and colors as it was moving away from us.

There were two people in the vehicle.  We looked over to the right (Southwest) and saw a big bright yellow light that was indistinguishable in shape. It was at approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and looked like a smashed circle.  To its left there were two smaller white lights that we could tell were not stars because they were too big. None of the lights moved, they were all still. 	After maintaining constant eye contact with the object for approximately two minutes, the yellow light began to shrink and in about ten seconds it looked exactly like the other white lights in shape and color.  Still none of the lights moved.  Within one minute, the previously yellow light (now a small white light) disappeared from the sky in one second.  The other two remained at their positions.  About three minutes later, all of the lights disappeared.  The area of the sky where the lights had been seen remained lit up, for no apparent reason, while the rest of the sky was cloudy and dark. 	Five minutes later, the yellow light had shown up again as a small dot in the sky and in about three seconds it expanded into its previously larger size.  The other white lights never showed up again.  As we reached Harrington we went back to the house to grab a camera and we returned to the Highway 28 with two other passengers. We turned left onto the beginning of Scott Road and parked to observe the UFO.  At that point, the light had shrunk again to the size of a small yellow dot of light, and that time it had lowered to approximately 3 degrees above the horizon.  After about two minutes sitting in the car observing the light, it began to expand again, and in about three seconds it had expanded to its larger size to which we had seen before. We attempted to photograph the object but the picture turned out somewhat blurry and distorted. 	In an attempt to get closer to the light we continued driving on Highway 28 towards Odessa.  The hills blocked our view of the UFO so we decided to drive back to Scott Road and park there again.  There we did not see the big yellow light, but we saw a small yellow pulsing light.  We observed it for about four minutes and determined that it might not have been the same light.  At about 12:49 A.M. we returned home.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,47.67499999999999,-118.19779999999999

I noticed a light that would be similar to the brightness of Venus directly overhead, but at about 85 degrees, slightly to the west.  I asked my wife if she could see it and she said that she did.  No other lights were visable in the sky and 30 minutes later in the same spot where we witnessed this, there are still no other lights in the sky, including and stars or planets. The light was stationary as far as we could tell.  At one point I picked up my daughter and leaned her back and asked her if she could see it.  She pointed to the light.   After 10 minutes, the sun had set over the horizon or behind clouds to the northwest.  The light was no longer there but my wife said that she could still see it.  I could not but as I tried, two aircraft in the area allowed my eyes to focus back on the object.   At that moment my wife said that there were now 3 objects.  I noticed that the main object appeared doughnut shaped and the other two appeared as smaller dots.  To me it looked like one of the dots shot out of  the larger doughnut.   After only about a minute of looking at this strange cluster of objects, they disappeared.   These objects were far higher than the altitude of the commercial airplane traffic that was in the area.

About 1 minute after I had first seen it, the object just disappeared.  It didn't seem to have turned or changed altitude, it was just suddenly gone. I was not able to see any auxiliary lights or blinking lights either when the light was visible OR in the area it had been after it disappeared, leading me to believe it was not an aircraft of any kind.  There was also enough daylight left that if it were a helicopter they would have no use for a spotlight as it wouldn't illuminate the ground any more than the ambient light was, especially from the height it was at. About 5 minutes after the object disappeared, I noticed that some stars were starting to be barely visible, so I'm positive that what we saw wasn't a star, nor was it a reflection off of any object as the sun was setting.

Tuesday night, at about 9:45 PM, July 15, 2014, in Southeast Portland, Oregon, as stars and satellites began twinkling, I saw a bright white light race across the sky from west to east. The brightness was like an Iridium flare from a satellite, only it was much larger in radius that a satellite appears to our eyes.  I do not think it was a satellite because it was moving so fast and because the glow was so much larger than satellite.  I do not think it was an airplane or helicopter either, because the speed was way too fast, there were no other lights besides the consistent glow, and the single white light was larger than any light I've seen on an airplane at night.   Also there was no sound. If it had been in aircraft and if it had been flying that fast and presumably low enough to produce a light that large, then I expect I would've heard some noise but there was none.   The flight path was west to east over highway 26 in Southeast Portland (Powell Blvd.)  Many local aircraft fly this route but none fly it as fast as this: approximately 8 seconds from west horizon to east horizon.

What we (my best friend and I) witnessed:   We walked out on the beach and stood by the water and immediately saw 3 bright orbs of light.. what I originally tried to explain to my friend as Mars, Jupiter or Venus.. one of them, further off in the distance to the right started moving to the right.   I watched to see if it was a plane or chopper (The ENTIRE 3 hours there were no sounds of any type of craft – only the sound of the beach break )and then noticed it’s unearthly/unrecognizable gliding/ propulsion/velocity.   We then noticed that it had a random wave of flashing lights amidst the bright white light.  It was scouting/scanning an area of what appeared to be about a 2 miles or so left to right – sometimes making erratic motions.. but mostly hovering at times and then accelerating rapidly – immediately from the point of motionless – to the left or right/ then smoothly and rapidly moving in horizontal directions. We stood – mouths agape – for about 20 minutes staring at this floating object .. and then it occurred to me to observe the other bright lights that were in the sky – because I know that ships have been spotted in clusters – and to my astonishment  - I saw the very same thing off to the right in the sky – closer and more above our heads – closer to the coastline.  I exclaimed “look!  There’s another one!! “and then looked off to the left where we had originally seen what I had thought to be Venus and Jupiter or Mars.  They were closer to each other than the other ones were.  They also, were both moving – side to side – left to right in their respective areas.  Each UFO was in their own area.  Each one was scouting/scanning/moving in their different width of the sky.  The third one we spotted and also the first one we noticed  moving  – had the largest scope of movement. It appeared to cover 2 or 3 miles left to right in the sky. Whilst the second we saw off to the right and closer to the shoreline was more like a mile or so to the left and right and sometimes moved in an oval shape.  Then the other two (the first two originally seen) I studied next.  They were also moving in what appeared to be their own individual parts of the sky (much closer together than the others)…with a back and forth / left to right/ sometimes oval movement.  I would like to note also that they all appeared at some time or another to move diagonally through the sky and then horizontally – immediately after moving diagonally!!  They all made movements of a nature that I have never before seen in my life. There were also extremely bizarre cloud formations to the left.  Not a cloud or star elsewhere in the sky.  Except for massive/ massive clouds that appeared strikingly as an angel / kneeling /head bent / holding an open book.  Very distinct crisp cloud formation – as if a large picture drawn.  The massive “wings “of the angel were a different type of cloud.    This cloud formation hovered for an hour in one spot over the sky.  People brought chairs out to sit and watch it.  Surfers stood and pointed at it. Seven of these orbs were spotted in all.   There was a bright light over our heads and it was moving in the same fashion as the other ones.  It was the only one that appeared to move – back and forth – in a very small space of the sky…whilst one off over the water moved back and forth in a large area.  That one rippled with colors – almost like the phosphorescence that underwater creatures have.  What appeared to be an odd form of twinkling we believe to be a fading and rippling effect.   These orbs all disappeared gradually at different times.  They would just disappear.  Their brightness and intensity did not seem to be hindered or fade away as the sun rose.  They just vanished one by one. The last one ever seen was the one we had noticed movement from originally (the third one spotted).  It seemed to be more active – color wise for some reason – than the others.  Maybe it was closer to us than the others.  The ones directly over the shoreline- over our heads - just appeared to be bright white light…whilst said orb over the ocean was bright white but with waving colors. All of these seemed to be about a mile and a half to two miles high in the sky.  Four of the orbs appeared to be in a diamond formation.",2014-08-22T00:00:00,34.23837495219885,-77.87846768642447

On Saturday August 16, 2014, at approximately 9:00PM (EST), I was returning home to Northridge Village (Townhouse Community) in Phoenixville, PA, with my girlfriend when we observed my neighbor walking two dogs and standing in the middle of the street/lane that led to my driveway.  She appeared to be shocked by something and had forgotten about the dogs until I slowed almost to a stop; she then reined the dogs in to give my car room to pass by.  I drove into my garage and then my neighbor called me over to show me something in the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a large, very bright orange fireball object moving in a straight line away from our position heading North-Northeast.  My girlfriend then came out to meet us and observed the object as well. My neighbor stated the object had come from the South directly towards her at a very low altitude.  She stated that right when I was turning in to pass her, the object changed direction just as it was above my neighbor’s house which is directly behind mine.  She repeatedly commented on how low the object was flying towards her (I later asked her if it was as high as a commercial plane flying at approximately 5,000 feet that was very distinguishable and she said the object had been much lower).  I asked her if she could make any features out on the object before it changed direction and she stated that it was circular. We watched the fireball object continue on its flight path for approximately 20-30 seconds until it appeared to gain significant altitude and eventually appear like other stars in the sky before finally winking out of view.  I estimate the object’s distance to us at the closest point of approach to have been approximately 3-5 miles away.  There were a few commercial aircraft visible during the flight of the fireball object and immediately after it disappeared.  Regardless of altitude, all of the commercial aircraft displayed lights and a few of them could be heard.  The orange fireball object displayed no lights and made no sound despite the high velocity at which it appeared to be traveling across the sky (I would estimate at least 4-5 times the speed that you would observe a commercial airline pass overhead).  It also did not have any type of visible tail or vapor trail despite its high rate of speed. Approximately a minute after the orange object disappeared, my girlfriend was discussing the object with my neighbor when I observed a blue and white light approximately 600-700 yards away, above the wooded area adjacent to our community.  It was bright (it reminded me of a firework) and falling towards the ground.  It was visible for about 2-3 seconds before it disappeared.  We discussed the fireball object and what it possibly could have been with my neighbor for a few minutes and then went home. At approximately 10:00PM (EST), I stepped out onto my deck to watch the sky to see if I would see anything else.  After about five minutes, I saw another bright object traveling from the south toward my position (it was nowhere near as close as the first object so I could not discern any additional characteristics).  I could immediately tell it was not a typical commercial aircraft so I called out to my girlfriend to come look and we both grabbed our iPhones in case it approached close enough to try to record it.  The object appeared to be approximately 12-15 miles away and had not yet reached Phoenixville.  As my girlfriend was trying to ready her iPhone to record video, her flash came on for a few seconds.  At the same time the object changed its flight path approximately 110 degrees to its starboard and flew due east.  It remained visible for only a few more seconds before disappearing. We then turned and looked back towards the direction the original object had traveled in and observed what was possibly a third object on the horizon above the wooded area adjacent to our community.  It was too far away and only visible for about 5 seconds, making it impossible to determine what it might have been. I then went inside to conduct some research and confirmed that the Perseids meteor shower had been most active between August 9th-14th; however, these meteors were supposed to appear to come from the constellation Perseus which was North of my house at the time of incident and not from the South like we observed.  Additionally, most Perseids are estimated to disappear in the Earth’s atmosphere at heights above 50 miles.  The object we observed with my neighbor was significantly lower.  The object also did not leave a tail as one might expect if it were a meteor.  I also have never heard of a meteor that suddenly changed directions, let alone one that gained altitude until it disappeared. I next came across a similar incident that had occurred in the vicinity of Maisfield Road in Phoenixville, PA.  The recollections of that person’s observations were eerily similar to what we saw.  That incident occurred on December 23, 2013.  I did not find anything to indicate there was any type of meteor shower or other phenomena during that time frame.  If anyone is interested in my account, I would strongly advise you to read about this incident as well as it appears to possibly be the same type of object. We also discussed the possibility of the object being some type of rocket, but again there was no visible tail and no sound despite the high rate of speed.  Additionally, my girlfriend and I had observed the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) probe launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia from our house on September 6, 2013 and it was a totally different experience than the fireball object we observed.  The NASA rocket launch had a clearly defined tail and was without a doubt much, much farther away.  I do not know of any rockets that would fly so low, yet leave no vapor trails and make no sound. A third theory was discussed of the object possibly being a Chinese lantern or some other balloon type object.  My opinion is the object was too large and bright to be either and that the sheer speed that it moved at (4-5 times faster than the visible planes in the sky) would preclude it from being such an object. Lastly we discussed the possibility of the object being some type of drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), possibly out of Willow Grove Naval Air Station (NAS).  I have never seen a drone in flight, but I do not believe it would be bright orange at night to attract unwanted attention, nor that it would not make any noise if breaking the sound barrier.  According to local media reporting, Willow Grove NAS does not physically launch/recover any drones; the base is used only as a remote controlled command location.  The object we observed at close range was circular and did not resemble any known types of UAVs. I have 13 years of military/law enforcement experience and have worked in environments where I have observed numerous types of military aircraft in operation.  I have also spent many nights out on the open ocean thousands of miles from any land observing the night sky and constellations.  I have never seen anything like the bright orange fireball that I saw on the 16th and I cannot at this point even venture a guess as to what it might have been.",2014-08-22T00:00:00,40.1246,-75.5385

It was heading ESE bearing approximately 122 degrees.  After it passed me, a small, solid, bright white lit; was ahead, slightly above, and a little to the south of the helicopter. I focused on the light, and all the sudden at 3 o'clock a red strobe light came on.  About 2 seconds after that at 10 o'clock, a second red strobe light came on. None of these lights were comparable to the helicopter, which had several white and red strobe lights that cycle much fast than the other lights.  Even though the helicopter was closer, the size of the three lights were about 10 times larger (assuming it was one object). I could not tell the distance between the object. The reason I feel like it was one craft is because after the red strobe lights came on, they never wavered in distance from the solid white light and the orientation around the center never changed.  I would estimate the visual contacted lasted 15-20 seconds until I lost it behind the trees. I looked around, but no other witnesses.

Hi ufocenter,   I drive a truck in Alberta and Saskatchewan.  I was heading South on highway 2 between Edmonton and Calgary, near Olds, when I noticed a bright light out my drivers side window, East, very close to 1:25 AM.   It travelled North to South.  It was the shape of a kidney bean or unshelled peanut.  I thought it was a meteor or something hitting the outer atmosphere, but is was too big for that, too close.   It streaked across the sky for a short distance, maybe about a 1/5 of the total width of the sky.  It then just stopped and disappeared in a kind of glow.  My impression is that it skipped off the atmosphere and headed back out to space.  It was too big, too close though. When it streaked through the sky it did not leave a trail like a comet does.  A very little bit of spark kind of stuff, mostly glow.  It glowed green, blue, red, mostly brilliant orange.  It only lasted about 25 seconds, at the most. The company I work for has 4 trucks.  One of the other drivers was at Olds at the same time, but he didn’t see anything. But talking to one of the other drivers, he did notice a flash in the sky, but did not see it.  He was near Suffield, Ab., close to the Sk. Border, and attributed it to something from the military base at Suffield.   Shortly after that, our 4th driver texted him ‘did you see that?’  What he saw and where he was, I don’t know yet.  But I suspect he was between Calgary and Medicine Hat.  That was the route for the night. I think it was a meteorite or whatever its called.  It is very curious though how big it seemed and so close.  But it wasn’t.  The other driver’s were quite East and saw it to the East also. Thank you for your time and website for reporting. Dennis",2014-08-08T00:00:00,51.7834,-114.102

At one point I found myself looking way up above me whilst on a narrow road surrounded by trees on both sides of me.  There were these blue lights gliding across the sky.  I was unable to stop because there was another car behind me.  It appeared that the lights came from a hovering craft that spun - causing the lights to look like they were blinking.  It was such a spectacular blue.  A glowing blue.  Because I could not take my eyes off the road just to completely stare at it..  from a distance when I looked up next it had disappeared curving west and into the lefthand side of the trees.,2014-08-08T00:00:00,35.71733365853658,-78.8808643902439

I was outside on my back porch having a cigarette and some coffee early that morning while it was still dark and noticed a formation of whitish blue colored star like objects in a formation moving left across the night sky.  Some of them would push in closer to the other or move up higher.   I also noticed to my right another whitish blue object that was actually bigger than the other objects to the left and it seemed to be moving upwards in the sky and would dim it's lights and then become faint then glow really bright. I think that particular light was originally lower in the sky and when i looked at it through my binoculars it seemed to be shaped like a spherical galaxy or what you would call a saucer.   The most eerie aspect of these sightings was the last object i saw not far from that one which was a yellow light that was the same size as the blue whitish one and it was also moving across the sky even farther right to the last one.  It was a yellow color but! it flickered red at first as if it had rotating orb like lights on it and i thought i noticed it rotating as i looked at it through my binoculars but it was hard to say for certain from that distance. Upon closer inspection it seemed as though it may have been shaped like a cone or and upside down pyramid of sorts.  The light rays coming from it even bent like it had a very different shape than any average type of aircraft upside down boomerang.  I thought it looked strange.  It seemed to change it's direction a lot.  It would continue its path to the right yet it would simultaneously be going up but then seem to go towards the left.   My brother also saw this as he was with me at the time and we were talking out on the back porch when i pointed it out to him.  One last thing that i noticed while this was happening was a sudden flash of blue light that radiated out like a perfect circle from a very small circular point in the sky and it was in between the objects that were seper! ated by distance. It also happened to be in the middle of clou! ds.  I ca n rule out thunder or lightning because it never followed suit with more flashes or any thunder or rain.  The sky was clear save for a few clouds and the flash was a circular shape and very bright.

I would not necessarily have thought UFO, but several things struck me as odd:  Firstly the size.   The UFO appeared to be HUGE.  I have no standard of comparison for something in the sky, however, this was much bigger than any plane or helicopter that I've seen in my experience.  The only other conclusion I could come to is that it was flying low, but even still that wouldn't explain the sound, the hushed blowing sound that accompanied it.  There was barely any sound to it, like when you run a clothes dryer with a load of towels.  (Sorry, just using things I can compare it to here!)  I looked up videos of B2s at night and flight shows just in case I may have seen one of those for some reason and the lighting doesn't resemble what the videos show, although the shape is similar.

Prior to the weather announcements they always show a live screenshot of the city in the background.   What we saw looked like 2 orbs fly into the picture.  The anomaly on top comes into the screen in a downwards motion and then begins to zig zag and then flies off and disappears.   The anomaly that is on the lower area of the screen continues in almost a straightforward pattern and then disappears.  I've shown this video to several family and friends and they've all been astonished.   I am submitting the video to you in hopes that you can shed some expertise on what you think I have on video.   The recording you are viewing is from my Samsung S4 phone and it is a short clip but you can easily see these anomalies come into the picture.  Please contact me if you have any further questions.

As I pointed the first object out to my son and as the first object seemed to fade behind clouds to the north the second object appeared to the south.   My son stepped into the house to tell my wife what we were seeing and as he did a third object appeared.  As he returned to the deck the fouth appeared and we proceeded to watch a fifth and six object arrive.  All six objects appeared to be on an identical trajectory.  They all seemed to slow at a point when we were looking at them towards the east.  Having been in the Navy they had more of an appearance of missles inflight.   No noise, no vapor trails.  One did appear to eject a lighted objected at the end of it's run and another appear to be somewhat elongated with lights down the side.   From time spotted in the southern sky to their burn out or disappearnce to the north took about two minutes each.

I said outloud, ""What is that?"" While thoughts were processing in my mind, is it a helicopter?  A firework?  My husband said, ""What, where?""  I said, ""Out there in the sky, what is that?!""  He yelled, ""I don't know.""  He put the four ways on and the truck into park. Another vehicle came up behind us, my husband motioned the guy to go around.  The guy stopped, my husband and I got out of our truck, and said to the guy, ""What is that?""  He looked out his passenger window, and said, ""I don't know man, could be a firework.""

I grabbed the binoculars and looked, the ""thing"" was cone shaped with what looked liked fire spinning around it...very slow moving, very orange and very bright.  Resembled the search light of a helicopter, it's the only example I can logically give.  But I've never seen an orange spot light on any aircraft.  This is bizarre, I gave the binoculars to my husband and he saw the exact same thing.  It definitely appeared to on fire, spinning, very bright orange, and a cone shape.  I don't know if it appeared as a cone, so much so that it was spinning and the core of it gave off a triangular appearance or what.  It was like nothing we had ever seen.  And the fact that not a single other person gave it any thought, no one else stopped to get out and observe this bizarre sight.   We are clueless, was it a meteor?  No firework would drift or move so slow and burn so bright after explosion.  None that we'd ever seen. It literally went over top of us. As it moved on, we got back into the truck and followed it, eventually in minutes in completely disappeared.  We wonder did it burn out?

Tonight my boyfriend was present to assure I wasn't crazy!  Tonight I seen it first as a bright colorful flashing star, which my boyfriend always claimed as satilites in the sky.  But this flashing light soon turned into a bright white light and then it ends up turning into a crescent shape and then back to a bright star then disappeared.  All the sightings last about 30 mins but randomly in the early AM, sometimes higher sometimes just a over beachside Ormond.   Thanks to the last sighting my bf believes me finally!

I told him he had to get up, because he would never believe me.  He did, and we watched it fly over the house together.   I ran into the front yard to continue watching it.  I was a little frightened and hid under some trees in case it was watching me.  I cannot tell you its size, maybe 1/6 size of the moon and later the size of a large star.

First and foremost, I don't believe in outer space aliens or UFOs.  There is a logical explaination for what I saw.  Problem is, I can't explain it so I'm in search of an explanation. Last night, Wednesday, July 16, 2014 around 21:30 I was smoking on my back deck when is saw an aircraft come over the tree line from the north east headed in a southwesterly direction, about 220 degrees.  The aircraft was soon followed by a second, a third, forth and finally a fifth.  All five aircrafts were traveling in the same direction in a straight line formation and at the same distance apart.  What caught my eye was that all 5 aircrafts each admitted one flashing beacon light and all five beacon lights were flashing in unison. Before having children, I spent 5 years working at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.  I've spent enough time around airplanes that I can identify them in the sky.  Even at night I can recognise the navigation lights on the tail and wings and even see the lights coming from the passenger cabin. I know that the five aircrafts I saw were flying too close to be passenger commercial aircraft so the could have been mitary.  Only problem is, even military aircrafts have navigation lights on the wings and tail, these aircrafts didn't have any.  The beacon lights flashed very bright as if LED and the intemitance lasted about one second in between flashes.  It was dark enough out that when the lights were in between flashes, no objects were visible from the ground.  Also, no noise was heard, but we don't normally hear noise from aircrafts traveling at 30,000 feet.  But, as stated before, the big thing that caught my eye was the fact that all five aircraft's beacon lights were flashing in unison.  To my knowledge, it would be very difficult and time consuming to sincronise call five beacon lights on all five aircrafts. In disbelief at what I was seeing, I stepped inside and pulled my wife out to see these for herself.  My wife currently works in the ground control tower at CLT and has nearly 20 years experience in aviation.  Even she couldn't explain what we were seeing.  She even called our 16 year old daughter outside for a look as well.  She was immediately frightened and ran back inside, but she's a nieve child.  We sat outside for over 5 minutes watching these flashing lights move across the sky.  These aircrafts never changed formation, never changed speed or direction.  I know that they were moving too fast and were too low to be stars or satellites, however they seemed to move slower than most commercial aircrafts do at cruising altitude    Please help me to identify what I saw.",2014-07-20T00:00:00,35.1137,-80.6083

Tokachidake (an active volcano in the northern part of Japan), which has been famous for UFO sightings for decades.  Near the bottom left corner of the video, you can see two lights showing zigzag motions, keeping the same distance between them.  In the past, during the daytime around this area, my friend witnessed a strange oval object with two lights, one each on the left and the right edges, so I suppose that would be the reason for these two lights keeping the same distance.  I fixed my camera position and did not follow the lights, so the zigzag motion of the object was not because of camera shake. Although the lights were moving around a lower part of the sky, it does not mean they were close to the ground because I was standing on the plateau looking down the wild forest and valley below.  The site was a kind of dangerous area where wild bears often appeared, so no one could fly an LED night kite or anything else in the wild forest or valley in the middle of the night.  The site was at an altitude of 1200 meters and the temperature was very low at night.

As mentioned, I was with two other friends who saw the same thing so I know it wasn't the trick of the eye. and if I was alone, I believe no one would believe me anyway. My friends don't even want to talk about it as they have no answers. I have been looking up at the sky ever since hoping to see more things.

It was low to the ground and didn't make any sound; the light was to bright to see any defining features.  Like I said, the light was bright but the concentration of the light moved around the circumference of the circle in a pattern of four inner circles. It moved to slow to be a plane but it also moved to fast to be any type of balloon. It couldn't have been a helicopter either.  THERE WAS NO SOUND AND IT WAS (excuse my language) ((obscenity deleted)) There was a meteor shower that night also.  It couldn't have been a meteor either because those fall between 25,000-150,000 mph.  The worst part is I tried explaining this to people but no one believed me.  They all said that it was a meteor because of the meteor shower we had had earlier. Or they said that it was a Chinese lantern or weather balloon.  We have a military base not to far off from Lenexa and people even said it could be one of their planes or some new technology they were testing. I had decided to follow it because it was ""hovering."" Followed it through the twists and turns of the neighborhood.  I was speeding, going about 35 mph in a 25 mph zone. Not to safe seeing as I was hardly watching the road. It moved with precision and slowed considerably over some houses but never came to a full stop.  The streets of course wouldn't allow me to follow its every move but it was high enough to where I could keep it in sight and navigate to another street that would allow me to do the same.  After about 5 minutes of following it I lost it in the treeline and taller houses of the neighborhood I was in.  The whole time I followed it I expected to see it slow and then have massive acceleration until it disappeared into the night sky.  But no, it was just gone. Maybe it did do that and I just somehow missed it. After about another 2-3 minutes of looking for it and making my way back onto the main road I gave up and decided I needed to do something.   I called 911 and they hadn't had any reports of a sighting which seemed extremely weird to me because I never saw the UFO appear and I followed it for 5 minutes in a residential area where people would most likely be outside trying to spot the last of the meteor shower even though it was ""over"" anyways.   So probably about 10 minutes had passed since I first saw it, and in a suburb where many people were outside not long before.  The dispatcher I talked to told me to call the F.A.A. but didn't have the number.  I had some difficulty finding the number online with my phone.  The slow browser didn't help but I thought a number like that would be easy to find using Google.   So I called and recanted the same story I had told the dispatcher, probably about 20-22 minutes after I first saw it.  The man seemed very angry and dismissive.  He kept saying that there were no planes over that area at the time and that there were no downed planes.  I kept saying that it wasn't a plane but he just kept saying the same thing until I got frustrated and hung up.  It was like he couldn't say U.F.O. or even call me crazy.  I just got the same sigh and the same response ranging from dull to angry. I never talk about this to anyone anymore because I learned my lesson.  Everyone is going to think I am talking about an alien, but apparently people don't know the definition of a U.F.O. I always have believed that there are aliens (but was skeptical that travel to our planet was possible because there doesn't seem to be any proof made public) and since this night it has been strengthened.  But it might possibly be a man-made aircraft.  I try not to believe in something when there are no answers or proof, just like any religion.  But at this point it is almost hard not to believe, but I still need solid proof.  It would be awesome to meet a different intelligent life form, even if they were superior to us.  So much could be learned. The reason I am just posting this now is because I watched a movie on aliens and after watching it, I got to searching the web and I found this site and found a few sighting in and around my area.  I knew I had a story to tell and that this site seemed more legitimate than several of the like I had come across.  Also, I am glad to see that I am not the only one who has had a sighting in my area.",2014-08-15T00:00:00,38.95079716535433,-94.75379165354332

So It was not an insect. UFO with zigzag motion at a high speed – June, 2014.  This video was taken at 23:26 p.m. on June 24, 2014, at the camping site near Mt. Tokachidake (an active volcano in the northern part of Japan), which has been famous for UFO sightings for decades. You can see a bright object soaring up from the bottom right corner of the video screen, but in reality, my camera was facing the zenith, and the object was moving horizontally across the sky from the east to the south. I fixed my camera position and did not follow the object, so the zigzag motion of the object was not because of camera shake. I was the only one looking up the sky and other people (mountain climbers) were already sleeping in their tents. Since the site was at an altitude of 1200 meters and the temperature was very low at night, there were no insects flying, and the fireflies (lightning bugs) do not exist in the area (the fireflies do not fly at such a high speed in the first place and my camera cannot catch such dim lights). The site was completely dark and there were no outdoor lights nearby (and it was a dark moonless night). I could see many stars in the sky with the naked eyes, but my small digital camera (CASIO EX-H10) could not catch any starlight. So you can guess how bright that object actually was. About one and half hours before I saw UFO, I was surprised by a small mechanical sound that I heard from my left side (no more than two feet from where I was standing in the camping site), and I saw a long-haired young woman in white clothes. As I mentioned,the site was almost completely dark and I could not even see my shoes very well, so I could narrowly recognized that woman but could not see her face. Then I saw a small and round red light in front of her chest or her solar plexus. I supposed she would be fixing her camera to a tripod to take pictures of beautiful starry sky (but I did not actually see any camera or tripod) . That slender lady was about 5 feet and 7 inches tall and had black hair. Although I wondered why she was working in the darkness without any lights, I stepped back silently because she did not seem to have noticed that I was standing so close to her,and I did not want to surpise a young woman in the darkness. After that I kept standing for a while at some distance from her, but the next time I found that she was gone - disappeared without making any sounds of walking. In the camping site,I could hear footsteps very well even if they were more than 20 meters away. I wondered where she had gone because I did not hear any sounds of car. It was too dangerous for anyone to leave the site on foot because there were wild bears often appear in that area. She was not looking up overhead but straight ahead to the east where the Tokachidake mountains rises-and it was the very direction where the UFO appeard about one and half hours later. Although there is no certain links between that mysterious lady and the UFO, I have to say that I had seen another mysterious yong gentleman who suddenly disappeard before another UFO appeared in the sky when I was waiting for the chance to videotaple UFO on the beach of Kamakura on February 25 in 2014.  At that time,I saw a large disk-shaped green UFO that circled over my head and flew away.  I was so surprised to see the UFO at a such close range that I momentarily forgot about taking its picture even though I had my camra at hand. Having had such similar two experiences, I came to believe that the mysterious lady and the gentleman may have somthing to do with the UFOs that appeared after these mysterious people disappered.",2014-08-15T00:00:00,,

I kept track of it for about 20 minutes- it’s possible that it moved a tiny bit, but when you are staring at something like that you can be fooled, so I don’t know.  It also seemed to maybe have some periodic flickering colors on the right side. For those 20 minutes it did not change course.  When I went to bed it was still there, same place. It was south from here, very small.  San Francisco is 50 miles from here, and I supposed it could be in that direction.  I don’t know if I could actually see that far, but it was a dark cloudless night and the object, although very small, was bright.   I figured the angle was about 50 degrees up from the ground where I was. Now here is a funny thing. My sister lives about 50 miles south of San Francisco in the area of San Jose.  I never mentioned this siting to her (I actually pretty much forgot about it). About two weeks ago we were talking and, guess what, she saw the same thing! But hers was a few weeks after my siting. I did not say anything as she was relating it to me; I put my hand over my mouth and let her finish talking about it, and then told her. What a shock!  She saw hers later than mine, more about 11:00pm. And hers was somewhere over the Lockheed area (I think a little east from her). She watched hers for about 10 minutes- it did not move. Other than the time and date, and a little more east from her place, it was exactly the same description! Today we were talking about this and I decided to write you. We decided it must be a drone. Do you know?? I don’t like the idea of drones lurking in the sky any more than an ET.",2014-08-15T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

Me and a friend were on our way back from spending the day in Florida.It was very late (3:30 am), and my friend was sleeping deeply.  I too was so tired that my eyes were getting to heavy to hold open.  I had the radio turned very loud and singing trying to stay awake.  I was only 15 minutes from home.  Driving through a community called Carolina just outside Andalusia I thought I saw lighting in the clouds but no signs of rain in the area.  I assumed it was just another scattered shower with flickering lighting.  No big deal. I drove on and there is a house on the left side of the road that had a bright blue light in the front yard.  I thought it was a bug lamp in a new color.  I was driving by so the blue light seemed to be moving and not connected to anything, but since I was moving in my car I just thought it was me and my eyes were playing games on me since I was so sleepy.  I keep driving when I noticed something else a little odd.  Above the tree tops was alot of flickering light. My thoughts were, ""What crazy contruction crew would be working at 3:30 in the morning"".  It was bright and flickering continously.  Within a few seconds I realized that the lights were moving ajacent with me and then consider it to be a helicopter with a ultra bright light possibly looking for something (I assumed a drug force looking for possible drug related plants or vegetation.)  It was the most logical thing I could think of at the time.  I was more focused to get home til I realized I started to feel like I was being followed by this. Here is where I had a rude awakening..... I realize this ""helicopter"" is getting ahead of me due to it speeding up slightly, and I am slowing down alittle because I'm getting curious.  It was just out of my direct vision.  Then it came out from behind the trees over the road.  I could see a bright white light coming from the bottom and it is about the length of a football field ahead of me.  It still seems to be a helicopter........ til I saw it tip to the side with the bottom toward me.  That is when I realized this thing is not anything my logic can assume or suggest.  It was, in fact, a small round saucer shaped craft.  The most common form that is seen on tv.  I start hitting, pushing, and shaking my friend to get her up and she is waking up so slowing even though I am in a clear panic.  See,  this thing is over the road.  I driving toward this thing..... under this thing.  Behind me is a hour before any town.  Andalusia is ahead... 8 minutes away.  I'm going home. I never turned down the radio so I can't tell you if there was any sound coming from it.  I can tell you that I drove under this thing without blinking and it was very beautiful.  It had a primary light source on the bottom center of the craft, there were smaller lights around the sides and it rotated quickly causing the flickering.  I remember that the light felt unusual on my eyes and the brightness didn't seem to hurt my eyes.  At this time I'm in a full blown panic and floored my gas and drove going 70 to 75 mph home.  I did not want to go too fast I lost control of the car.  My friend never saw what I saw.  She does remember seeing the flickering light in the back windshield and always assumed it was an elabrate hoax I pulled. However, at the moment of my passing under the craft, there was a small orangy red car on the road heading in the opposite direction. I know this car saw it to, because it slowed way down and looked like they were debating going under it.  I don't know what happen to the craft or the car.  All that happened almost directly under the craft and I was under a panic and just could not believe what I just saw. I made it home.  I could not sleep despite my exhaustion.  My friend drove herself home still convinced I'm lieing.  The next afternoon, I told my husband about every detail and he believed me.  I am a believer in God and the Bible.  This seems to have no place in reality of a Christian faith.  So, my husband knows I would not make this up.  My reply to this whole experience:  Even the truth about God is against logic but not reasoning.  God has absolute knowledge and I believe it is not in us to understand things that we cannot relate to therefore we disregard it. I cannot disregard it since see is believeing, but I know we're are not alone.  I can't say that gives me peace.  Actually, I have alway loved traveling at night with no traffic.  Since the experience I don't travel past city limits at night. I would like to be able to talk to someone about this in a serious conversation and maybe have a better understanding of it all.  Please contact me through mail.  I don't give out my phone number.",2014-08-15T00:00:00,31.26791764705882,-86.55498529411764

About 9:05 pm on 7/31/14, I left my home & was traveling in a southeasterly direction to run an errand, when I saw two bright almost oval orange lights in the sky.  These lights were not really high in the sky, nor directly over me, more like in the sky in front of me. I stopped my vehicle to look more closely, thinking it may be a meteorite falling from the sky.  However, the orange lights did not blink or fall from the sky.  They were moving through the sky almost horizontally.  They were fairly close together, like military planes in formation, but the lights were bright & much larger, similar to the little red blinking light on an airplane...maybe as much as 5-10x the size. I opened my window on my vehicle, to ascertain whether I could hear any sound of an engine.  I heard nothing but some traffic from a nearby intersection.  Then I noticed a third identical light following the first two, though the distance between the last two was 3x the distance between the first two lights.  I thought it was strange but after sitting in my vehicle looking up for ~1-2 minutes decided to continue to my destination a 1/4 mile away to see if I could still see them.  I came to a red traffic light intersection where there were street lights.  I stopped at the red light.   At this time, I thought ""Oh shoot, I should try & take a photo with my cell phone"".   The lights were farther away at this point & didn't appear as large, but I did snap a photo anyway.  However, I thought it probably didn't turn out due to the glare of traffic & street lights. In addition, the orange non-blinking lights were much farther away by this time, & appeared more the size of the! red blinking lights on an airplane flying high in the sky, though they were still not blinking.   I kept looking around to see if anyone in the other cars saw them & when a car coming the opposite way ran the red light, I believed they too might be pulling into the CVS parking lot to stop & look up at the sky.  But they didn't. I pulled into the parking lot & turned away from the store & got out of my car to try & take another photo.  This time, I saw 4 lights, though the one that had been first in line was so far away, it no longer appeared orange & not as bright as the other & were going northeast.   I do not believe more than 4-5 minutes passed from the time I saw the first two orange lights until I took the 2nd & final photo. I went into the store to pick up my items & when I came out about 5-8 min later, I saw nothing in sky but a sliver of a moon in the opposite direction.  I returned home  & at this point, I told my husband that I saw strange bright orange lights in the sky, but was really confused as to what they could have been.  This was the first time I looked at the photos I took.   Surprisingly, the photos did not show the orange lights I saw with the naked eye but rather crescent shaped lights.",2014-08-08T00:00:00,40.2229,-75.3988

Note: I previously made a single report of three separate events.  This is a slightly extended report of the most important event.  Originally, I reported a 2-4 minute sighting, but it was certainly closer to 2 minutes. On a dark night, I saw a massive black triangular object creeping silently across the sky, from east to west.  This triangle may have been equilateral, but I can't say for sure.  One thing I can say for sure is that I could clearly see three defined edges through the darkness. It emitted no light and seemed to be flying low, perhaps the altitude of a helicopter searching for a spot to land.  I watched it until it disappeared past the tree line, maybe a football field in total.  This is the most amazing sight I have ever seen. As anyone else would have done, I did some searching on the internet afterward. I was relieved to find out that - after sifting through the garbage - similar sightings are not rare.  It is often noted that there is a military base located nearby, and it just so happens that Camp Swift is about 12 miles southeast of my sighting.  There is one major difference in my experience, however.  Almost all black triangle sightings that I have read about include lights at the corners and sometimes a large red light in the center, but what I saw was completely devoid of light.",2014-08-15T00:00:00,,

The light then began to shine in through my door from our hallway inside, so I knew something had opened our house's front door because that was the only reason the light would be filling the inside of our house too.  My door then began to open, and my memory of what happened next isn't there.  I have no memory of what happened after my door opened or what opened it. The next thing I remember is waking up in the most intense, raw terror I have ever experienced.  I was in a very deep sleep, and suddenly woke up out of it instantly sort of like waking up from a nightmare, only more intense and I had not been dreaming.  I sat up immediately when awakening in fear, and had ""sleep"" in my eyes that I began to rub out of my eyes as I noticed two figures standing by my door. This all happened within a second or so as I was awakening. I saw immediately the two figures were inhumanly tall, a bit taller than my door frame actually, so that they would have to duck to go through it.  They were about three to six inches taller than my door frame, which is average height. I couldn't see clearly immediately as I was awakening/ sitting up which is why I was rubbing the sleep out of my eyes, and to my absolute horror I realized standing by my door face to face were two beings people call aliens or greys.  I couldn't believe it because I was a fundamentalist Christian and did not believe aliens or greys were real. The two greys seemed to have been standing in my room to make sure I didn't wake up and interrupt something else other greys were doing somewhere else in the house or outside.  They seemed to have been standing at my door face to face as if they were having a conversation like people, but I observed no noise nor did their necks seem nearly thick enough to contain vocal organs of any kind.  I did notice one make a gesture with its hand towards the other, which seemed to be somewhat like gestures people make to each other while talking, but I am not sure if that's what it was or not. I do think the two greys were communicating when I woke up, but I think they were communicating without using vocal organs to make noise like we do. I think it was some other form of communication, perhaps done through technological implants, eye lenses, or something like that.  I would find it hard to believe they have any kind of psychic telepathic communication abilities though like some people might start to think about when hearing the idea of non-verbal communication. Their appearance shocked me because I would have expected greys to be grey-green or green, but they were grey-blue.  They actually had a very bluish appearance to them. They had some sort of glow around them which was also blue.  The only way I know to describe it is a ""light fog"" that looked like ""curving light.""  They didn't seem to have any clothes on but it might have just been hard to tell since there was some somewhat translucent light around them, and they could have been wearing something that kind of blended in with their bodies and skin. I tend to think they probably did have something on since I noticed no sexual organs or holes in general, aside from nostrils and mouths.  I saw no ears or holes similar to ears. They were hairless, or extremely close to being hairless, earless, and had very small, insignificant mouths with no lips or extremely small lips. They didn't really have noses, just kind of a very small nose-like nostril structure on their face kind of like how greys are usually depicted. Their eyes were gigantic, and the usual almond shape. I would say their eyes were a bit bigger than dinner plates. They were solid black, although I suspect the solid black might have been some kind of advanced lens they wear over their eyes. They had no eyelids, eyebrows, or bony indentation ridge like we have over our eyes. The eyes were rounded towards the top right corner of their heads, with the points of their eyes coming together near their nostrils. Their chins were pointed. Their heads were about two to three times larger than our heads, but the overwhelming majority of their heads is taken up by their huge eyes I would guess because that's at least how they look externally. Their ! eyes are so big that I don't think their brains could be much bigger than our brains actually. They were disturbingly thin. They were so thin in fact that I wondered how their tiny necks, probably about the size of a human wrist or forearm, could hold up their huge heads. I think balancing their heads probably helps their small necks to deal with the weight. Their arms and legs were also extremely thin, much thinner than human arms and legs. Despite them being two to three feet taller than humans, I would think it's possible they probably weigh around the same as the average human because they're so much thinner than us. Their torsos were not very big either, nor very muscular. They seemed to have extremely little muscle compared to humans. Or very little organs in general. They seemed to have a rib cage structure and backbone structure, along with hips, a pelvis, knees, etc.., similar to us. It seems like it could be somewhat different, but not dramatically different. They move in similar ways to us, like elbows and knees bend the same ways for example. The bone structure in their neck is definitely in the back just like ours. They have a skull in their head just like us. They have shoulders and a clavicle like us. They might have 6 fingers and 6 toes, but I'm not really sure. Their fingers were longer in proportion to their bodies than ours, so it kind of made them hard to distinguish from each other, making seeing the number of them more difficult. I'm not sure if I saw 6 fingers or just 5 long very thin fingers. Their skin seemed different than ours. It's hard to describe exactly though. It seemed greyish-bluish in color, and perhaps to excrete more than our skin, but at the same time more ""rubbery"" than our skin. Their mannerisms were just like machines or robots, which was one of the most terrifying and disturbing aspects about them and the experience. I would expect about as much mercy, feeling, caring, or compassion from them as I would from a machine; none. However, they also have an extreme intelligence that made me feel like a bug around a human, which makes me think that while they may not have emotion like we do, they're probably likely to be smart enough to make the right decisions. They actually turned and walked single file one behind the other just to walk over to me when I woke and sat up in my bed. As soon as I sat up in my bed they somehow instantly paralyzed me, which was insanely and indescribably terrifying. It was like they were jamming my nervous system remotely  by will somehow, which is why I think they have technological implants inside their nervous system or brain, or something like that. I tried with all my might to scream for help, but my voice was paralyzed too. It felt like my throat was so dry that I couldn't make any noise. I also tried as hard as I could to move my legs and arms, but the best I could do was get some of my fingertips to barely drag across my bed sheets... a feeling I will never forget. Since I couldn't move or scream, when the one in front got close enough to me to reach towards me, I blacked out. I don't know if it made me black out or if I passed out from terror. That was all I remembered from the experience, just the beginning with my door opening, and waking up after they had placed me back in my bed, which was an accident, showing they aren't perfect any more than humans are. I also have a strong feeling that they messed up something and hurt me during the time I can't remember, which caused me to have the intense terror that woke me back up. They also messed up by not erasing my memory of waking up before they left which makes me think they had taken me somewhere else, and could only do that where ever they had taken me. But they probably should have done that again to erase my memory of seeing them, yet they didn't showing they do make mistakes and screw up. I was only 13 years old when this happened, and I was so traumatized from the experience that I had to sleep with a glass of water by my bed and my light on for at least several months afterwards.  The trauma and terror of the experience is truly indescribable because nothing else in this world can produce the same kind of trauma and terror. It isn't just like you're seeing a strange looking person or animal, it's like you're in the presence of something far more powerful than yourself.  Even though the two greys didn't really do much of anything during what I can actually remember, I could sense their extreme power and intelligence for some reason. I'm unsure if they're hostile or friendly or neutral, but I tend to think they're probably neutral towards people, and probably just need something from us that we don't understand right now. They probably have no interest in disclosing their presence to us, and even if they did they're beyond our level right now so we wouldn't really be able to fully grasp them yet anyway. There wouldn't be much accomplished by them disclosing themselves to us except maybe some people would begin idolizing, obsessing over, worshiping, or studying them. And none of that would actually accomplish much because an ant might see a human, but it can never hope to understand a human really, at least with the way ants currently are.",2014-06-20T00:00:00,34.021,-78.9098

Today's date:  31/7/2014  Date of sighting: around the second week of July, 2012   Note: This occurred two years ago, so my memory of the event is a little spotty.  I apologize for the convenience. My name is ((name deleted)).  I am now fourteen years old and about to start my freshman year of high school, but at the time of the event, I was twelve and about to start seventh grade. I was attending summer camp at Camp Menno Haven near Tiskilwa, Illinois, back in 2012.  It was Night Adventure Camp, so we had a slightly later curfew than the standard Trailblazer Camp.  It's a Mennonite camp, and is very outdoorsy (unlike me).  It's woody area, with a few clearings.  More information about the camp is available at <mennohaven.com>, but a warning, it's not the best designed website. Although I don't know the exact date, camp took place around the second week of July, and lasted five days. I have no idea which of the five days the event occurred on. My counselor (or maybe assistant counselor), several of my cabin mates, and I were headed back from campfire (it might not have been campfire, but I guess it's not very important) somewhere from 9–11 o'clock at night. and going to our cabin, Hickory. We were on one of the big main paths that cut through the camp.  If I remember correctly, not all of Hickory Cabin was with us, as some were either still at campfire or already at the cabin. We were just talking about something or other when we saw this weird craft we referred to as a plane.  It flew fairly low (significantly higher than a crop duster, but much, much lower than a commercial jet.  Think around twice the altitude of a crop duster, give or take) and was completely silent.  It moved in a straight line across the night sky.  The outline was somewhat difficult to make out in the dim light, but there was a very distinct pattern of lights on the bottom of the craft. There were four orange lights on the bottom of the craft, with three forming a triangle and one in the center.  This struck us as odd, and none of us had ever seen anything like it.  The craft moved at a moderate, fairly normal pace, and seemed to glide, as it moved very smoothly. After it passed out of view, our counselor/assistant counselor/whatever told us how he saw it at the previous camp the week before (I believe it was Trailblazer Camp), and his previous cabin thought it was weird as well.  We exchange various theories, and eventually our conversation turned to whether or not the Bible agrees with the thought of extraterrestrial life. We came to the consensus that surely there must be other life out there, and the Bible  doesn't seem to explicitly disagree. Time passed, and after awhile the encounter faded to a distant memory.  Jump forward two years to about two weeks ago, and a new Matthew Santoro video came out.  I am subscribed to him on YouTube, and I enjoy watching his videos soon after they are posted. The video was “The 10 Most MYSTERIOUS UFO Sightings of All Time!”  Here's a link to the video:  http://youtu.be/2Ifs0bPRIPk   It appeared on the YouTube widget on my Asus Google Nexus 7.  I taped the icon, and the video started.  At 5:45 in the video, I noticed something: the picture in the corner showing the triangular UFO sighting was eerily identical to the craft I had seen at camp two years before.  This led me to do a little research. After reading several articles about these “black triangle UFOs”, I found that my sighting matched up perfectly with the other eyewitness reports and photos.  I decided to post my sighting here.

UFO = Balloon  ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite eloquent, and serious-minded.  We suspect he is a very good witness.  We still do not know what the object was, despite the multiple witness reports from people who observed it.  It does not make sense to us that a high-altitude balloon would stay in one part of the sky for many hours.  The winds aloft are usually constant, and would have caused a balloon to drift with the wind.  PD)) On Saturday May 24, 2014, between 1600 and 1800 hrs. I saw a UFO.  I was in the driveway in front of my house in Plumas County, California.  I noticed a hang-glider overhead with a large whitish wing.  It was refracting the sunlight and almost glowed.  I got my little 10 x 21 binoculars for a closer look.  Perhaps it was a new type of fabric, polyethylene?  It looked cool. Then I noticed a small white dot in the sky off to the North, at a bearing of about 10 degrees and an elevation of about 40 degrees.  Was it another hang-glider way off in the distance?  No, this thing was above the commercial jets that frequently fly over here.  So it must be a Balloon!  It looked spherical in the binoculars, maybe a little doughnut shaped.  It must be at least 50,000 ft. altitude and slowly moving West. I called my brother who lives ¼ mile N of me so he could confirm the sighting.  He got his binoculars and saw the same thing.  He suggested I get out my old 4.5 inch reflector telescope with a 28mm eyepiece.  It needs the mirror recoated, so it doesn’t get out much, but despite the dust it worked pretty well. Oh My God!  I wish I had a picture of what I saw.  It was a balloon alright, a very large, maybe 500 ft. diameter balloon with lots of pleats and a payload.  Was it Google?  I called Chico Municipal Airport (50 miles SW of here) to see if Google was in town.  He did not know of any balloons in the area, but did go out to take a look, without success.  Google had used Chico for test flights of balloons for the Loon project.  Loon balloons are about 50 ft. diameter. T his was no Loon this was a Condor!  The balloon was pumpkin shaped with lots of gores and load tapes, perhaps 80 or 100?  It looks like a super [pressure type, probably flying at around 100,000 ft.  Brilliant white where it got direct sun, and some greyish areas, shadows.  The payload was dark (photovoltaic panels), suspended by lots of load tapes, and quite small compared to the massive envelope.  The underside of the balloon looked different, greyer and wavy, perhaps the gathered fabric of the payload recovery parachute.  The gores were quite curved on the top, billowed out, maybe semi-circular.  It also appeared to be rotating counter clockwise, but I am not sure about that. At about 1800 hours, it went behind the large pine/fir trees to the NW at a bearing of 279 deg. and an elevation of 38 deg.  I cannot take pictures through the telescope properly, but I do have a photo of the small white dot and an attempt to use macro focus through the eyepiece.  There may be an opportunity to scale the object using digital technology.  I am 60 and not too computer savvy but I will try to email the photos to you.  I have looked at hundreds of balloon photos on line but I have not seen anything quite like what I saw. I called your UFO Hotline on the 24th and left a message.  Then I called Google and talked to a man riding his bike in Florida he claimed the big balloon was theirs and as far as he knew I was the only one who has seen it, interesting.  He then said let’s call the UFO Reporting Center and we did.  He left a message, that I am on also, stating that we need an investigator to come out to interview me.  Wow I didn’t expect that, so they want people to know about this thing?  We talked for over an hour, like the game 20 questions.  Some of what he said I do not necessarily believe; like the “Mother Ship” may be 2 miles in diameter, that it uses solar powered thrusters, that it comes down to pick up water to ionize, that it works with HARP, that they are looking for coltan (among other things) which occurs in my area, do I want to sell my property?  I had given him my address.  Really?  So we know it was a balloon, but is it really Googles?  How big is it?  What are its capabilities?  I look forward to figuring this out and very much appreciate having your organization to work with.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,,

I drove further up the street and lost it momentarily because of a large group of trees and then stopped at a large clearing and had an open view of the sky to the north.  Nothing was in sight.

May 24th, around 9:30pm, I was sitting outside on my front patio.  The sun was just begining to set. My Neighbor's daughter was playing two doors down and something in my head had told me to look up towards the horizon.  I'm in a partially vegitated area with large trees, so if I were to just lok in that direction, trying to look for a specific object, chances are that I would not have been able to spot what I saw. I was smoking a cigarette at that time, and as I said, ""Something in my brain had told me to focus in that specific direction as if I was being told so.""  As I looked up, my neighbor's child said, at the same time I saw it and said, ""Mommy! Mommy! Mommy, come here quick!  Look at pretty green light in the sky!  What is it?""   She came out and immediately started to panic and thats when I said, ""Am I really Seeing this? Am I crazy or are you seeing this too!""  There was a very bright, pulsating chartruess spherical object, moving at a high speed, and very low altitude.  It was a very bright neon like color sphere and it made not one sound.  I cannot tell you how big it was but, it was literally pulsating with light.   At first I thought it was an airplane since I live just down the road about 10 miles from a small airport.  The name of the airportis, Hillsboro Aviation.  (So if you need to call them to see if they picked up anything on radar, you have te name.)  When it went over us, there was absolutely zero sound.  I even tuned into background noise to make sure there was a jet exhaust sound.  Absolutely zero noise!  And the strange thing was, being so close to an airport, theres constant air traffic.  When this approached, there was not one aircraft in the sky.  So we would have heard it.   I ran out to the to a clearing and watched it continue from it going northbound.  I contined observe to se if I could make out any form of object.  It immediately came to a hault in mid air.  By that time, it was very close to the airport and then it began to flash and get brighter. It sat there for a good two minutes.   At that time, I decided to make a run for my phone to snap a shot.  As I came back out and was fumbling with my camera,  I looked up, and it made slight turn and began to move, then it took off at a blink of an eye.   This is the second time I've seen these spheres.  I've seen blue ones in the Tillamook National Forest coming home from Salmon fishing.  And they were in the forest, then bolted out into a meadow.  They moved so fast that the trees swayed as they exited the forest and were spinning around the sky, then disapeared into orbit.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

My first initial thought was, wow a constellation - but this only lasted a millisecond because these were no stars for sure.  There were 5-7 objects, bright, round, with a definite orange/red glow to them.  They were obviously very far away from us and I could't guess at their altitude quite honestly.   I want to say the best way to think of these would be to imagine seeing the constellation Orion in the sky, but the stars were bright and orange.  Of course it wasn't this exact shape but there were something like two lights, left to right, then below another two, and then on the bottom of the formation at least two more.   They were headed west, southwest and we were basically at Timberlake (the lake, not the city) Virginia.  I looked at a map and I'd guess the lights would be somewhere close to Smith Mt. Lake or between that and us.   We sat there in the car watching them and I was really flustered and didn't know what to look for.  Had this been a regular occurrence I would have paid more attention to the details.  I can say that there was some movement among the individual objects, but very slight.   We watched them for at least five minutes.  They kind of just faded away one by one and there was a large cloud formation they seemed to get lost behind.   My wife and I drove in the general direction as best as the roads would allow but we never did see them again.  Definitely a very intense few minutes and I only wish I could see them again.

This sighting may not technically be classified as ""UFO"", since the objects were not actually flying, but it came on the heels of (1) a sighting of the typical orange orbs and flashing white lights frequently seen over the ocean, and (2) a sighting of a strange aircraft which I believe was a military drone.  I am reporting those sightings separately. On the night of June 20, my husband and I were vacationing with his family at an ocean-front home on Oak Island about 1/2 mile east of Ocean Crest Pier.  At about 10:30 a thunderstorm began to roll in, and by about 11:00 the storm was in full force.  My husband, his brother, my daughter and I were out on the porch facing the ocean, watching the lightning.  My daughter, who is 22 years old, suddenly said ""what is THAT?"" and pointed to the right (west) toward the beach. We saw a glowing, blue ball.  At first we assumed someone was walking on the beach with a light, although it was a torrential downpour and there was lighting flashing every 10 seconds or so.  However, when the lightning would flash we could clearly see that the ball was floating in the surf, probably in about 4 feet of water, and it was moving in a straight, steady line up the shore toward the east. Based on its location, it appeared to be at least 2 feet in diameter.  We then noticed a glowing red ball following the blue ball by about 200 feet, and following that was a second red ball which also appeared to be about 200 feet behind the first red ball. We stood and watched the balls moving through the surf.  They were not being blown or pushed by the waves, and they were not bobbing.  The blue ball appeared to the larger than the red balls. They moved in a steady, straight line past our house.  My daughter tried to get a video on her phone, but her camera wouldn't focus because of the heavy rainfall.  About that time a young woman in the house next door came out onto her porch and saw the balls as well.  She asked if we knew what they were, but we could only shake our heads in bewilderment. As we watched, the first red ball suddenly seemed to roll or be blown out of the water and went up into the dune.  As soon as that occurred, the other balls seemed to just disappear.  The following morning,  I walked along the dunes to see if there was any sign of the red ball, but found nothing.   I am completely baffled.",2014-06-24T00:00:00,33.9083,-78.0785

I had gone outside several times in the last 2 hours beforehand, but this time I chose to get a flash light and check it out.  I went to the rear left side of my home where I could see my dog was acting very strange, because he was obsessed with a frog that he could not reach.   I began noticing a mechanical sound, I have a pool and was standing next to the filtration system so at first I did not realize it was anything irregular.  It was at that time when I noticed the sound was different so I looked up and I could see an object in the sky  appeared to be hovering above my neighbors home that lives across the street from the front of my home. It was not fuzzy at all, it was as clear as it can get it was; a bright sphere or saucer shaped object that had two distinct lights that were red and green.  It was hovering for what I would say was 2 minutes when I realized that I needed to run insid! e and get my phone to try and capture an image.  I then ran inside and grabbed my I phone and placed it on camera mode and I tried to take a photo several times, but the phone stinks and it just was not looking good, so I took my flashlight and tried shining it toward the UFO so I could get a better picture, but it didn't work.  It was like I drew the objects attention when I flashed the light it finally moved toward the back of my yard directly over me, but 2 homes over the right from my front yard.  I switched my phone to video, because it began to fly around doing very fast change of direction movements, which I was able to take several videos showing the object moving. I felt as if it wanted me to see the object, then it shot back to the front. I have a wife and a 11 month old girl and they were in bed sleeping. I ran upstairs, because I knew someone else had to see the object or I would regret it. I woke my wife and she was startled so it woke up our baby (that was not gr! eat), but I had to do it. My wife was not happy, but I told he! re what I had seen and to run outside to see it. She went to try and see it from the windows, because she was indisposed, but could not see it, so I reiterated you have to see this, go outside. The baby began crying so I grabbed her and we went outside to the front porch to try and find it, but we did not have to search, it was hovering very low in front of our home this time and we stared at the object while I held the baby, they went back inside to go back to sleep and I ran back up to the bedroom to get the phone so I could get a shot of the object from my daughters room, since it was now so low and being upstairs I could get closer. I still had the phone on video so I began to film instead and I am glad I did, because as soon as I started again, a few seconds later it just vanished before my eyes.  It felt as if it knew we were observing it and helped us see it and then it vanished so I had no way of doubting what it was.  For the record, I am a Navy veteran and a Minister in a Church, I have never believed in anything like aliens or UFOs, so this experience is definitely, not being written lightly. I am hoping that someone else saw what we experienced last night and that I could have someone analyze the phone footage to verify the proof.  I am so glad I woke up my wife and anyone who has a 11 month old baby that does not sleep or has been there knows, that waking them up was not done lightly,  My wife told me she was very glad I did this morning, because she would have believed me, but seeing it as clearly as she did, that was clearly unexplainable and obviously not easily mistakable for anything that we know exists.  I am hoping it comes back and I will be keeping my eye out for it tonight and whenever I can.  I will also note that around 2 AM I heard helicopters flying around my home later, this made me wonder if it had been reported.",2014-06-24T00:00:00,33.19502279411765,-97.11429981617647

I got the binoculars and saw it had flashing lights, red, white and an occasional blue  or green.  A few times a bright beam of pinkish light shot out to the side.  The light stayed in one spot except that it occasionally moved a hair sideways and back, or in a small circle.  I couldn't get the binoculars to focus sharply on it, although I can focus on the craters of the moon or a jet at 35,000 feet.  After a while watching I sort of decided that it was in a triangular shape and was rotating. I walked down the street to get a better look.  At the top of the beach i noticed another light, same deal, out over the lake.  This was not like any of the lights I've seen out there.  When I had a clear view of the sky I saw that there was another one low in the northwest, like over toward Toronto. About 11:15 all three were suddenly gone.  They didn't move away, they went out. I came in the house and was heading into bed when there were five bright flashes in the southern sky, like a flash going off. There was never any noise from any of this.

I looked up and noticed 2 small bright orange orbs which were near each other and kind of floating around.  I estimated their altitude to be maybe around 3000 feet.   They were kind of hovering near each other and the distance between them increased and decreased and back again intermittently.   I decided I had to have a better look at these things, so I stopped at the St. Bonaventure Church on Mt. Royal Boulevard.  I noticed the orange orbs again almost directly overhead but slightly south.   After a few seconds one orb started moving steadily but not too quickly to the northeast at a bearing of perhaps 60 degrees.   The second orb started following that orb in that direction, and both orbs moved at identical speeds.   The second orb passed behind the clouds a few times before disappearing totally, and it was then that I realized how high it was.   The clouds were actually somewhat low to begin, but I still estimate the altitude of the orbs to be at several thousand feet.   Then suddenly I noticed a third orb identical to the first approaching from the opposite direction to join the first two, and it was slowly cathing up.   All three orbs quickly disappeared as they flew northeast, probably because of the low clouds.  As the orbs glowed, the glow they emitted had an almost ""flaming"" quality. The orbs didn't display any of the normal ""running lights"" that ordinary aircraft do, such as red or green strobes. The orbs simply glowed orange and that was it. I drove around for about 20 minutes trying to see them again but the didn't appear again.  It's worth noting that several miles to the south, there was a summer fireworks show taking place, and in fact the orbs did seem to approach from that direction although still quite removed from it. My first thought was that the orbs were embers from pyrotechnic display. After I saw their deliberate straight-line movements I knew this was not the case. I occurred to me that maybe the pyrotechnic display was deliberately being used as a cover for whoever was controlling the orbs. Obviously if someone said they saw a UFO, someone else could say ""Oh, there were Fireworks in the next town over that night."" I concede, that much is true. But what I saw was not Fireworks nor burning embers blowing in the breeze. I estimate their speed to have been maybe 200 - 300 mph once they started moving east. Not extreme for many aircraft, but still definately not Fireworks. I'm curious if any other reports will be made.  I made a video with my Android phone of the objects, but the quality is really bad and doesn't prove anything as far I'm concerned. I will still share upon request, however. I may have heard a very low rumble while witnessing the orbs, but it was not very loud.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,,

No sound, despite seemingly low altitude. At approximately 10:30 PM EST, on 7/16/2014, I looked up to witness a 'line' of flashing lights in the sky.  My view was not obscured by any trees or other objects, and the sky was clear.   The lights were not flashing in a synchronized fashion, but seemed to be blinking on and off independently of one another, with each doing so at fairly regular intervals of every two seconds or so.  The lights seemed to be close to the ground, but - sans a point of reference to judge distance by - I only say that because of how large and bright they were.  There were perhaps eight to ten lights that I could see all at once, stretching from a point directly overhead, from north to south, until the roof of my apartment building blocked my view.   I watched this go on for around fifteen seconds, then realized that the number of lights seemed to be decreasing; it did not look as if they were ascending, or flying away outside of my field of vision, but rather that every few 'blinks', one of the lights would not light up again. At that point I ran inside to get my fiance.   When we got back outside, we went directly to the rear (south) of our apartment building. Since the 'line' stretched in that direction, and presumably beyond my line of sight, I assumed we would have a better view of whatever lights remained from that vantage.  This turned out to be the case, as we BOTH still saw four or five of the lights - as well as a single plane flying east to west at a higher altitude than the lights were when I originally saw them - flashing on and off.  Only, by this time, they were much further away from our location, and seemed to be at a higher altitude. Our view was also obscured at that point by a number of trees.  My fiance still definitely saw them as well, though I wish she could have seen them as I originally had.

There were around six or seven lights in the sky that remained in the same area for the two hours we (four males, early-mid twenties) observed them, from around 21:00 to 23:00 on 17 July 2014. The lights kept fading in and out, as they rearranged themselves into different triangular patterns in the sky.  They would intensify in brightness, then fade to darkness before reappearing in the same area.  One of the lights was much higher and farther west than the group doing formations.  This phenomena occurred for over one hour. At approximately 22:15 a low flying military jet aircraft, with the delta wings clearly visible, flew northbound over the West Haven beach, made a sharp left turn (right over our heads) and traveled westbound toward the lights seen over Long Island, following the CT coastline. A few minutes after the jet had disappeared beyond our line of sight, two red lights appearing to be attached to a single projectile materialized out of the lone light that was higher than the group.  At first it appeared to be an air-to-ground missile or a plane crashing into the sea.  The object was traveling extremely quickly downwards and to the left in a straight line at a 45° angle from the lone light.  It was traveling at a speed much higher than freefall speed, and in a trajectory that can not be explained by something falling.  It disappeared when it reached our visible horizon.  There were no sounds or visuals indicating any explosion or impact.  The projectile appeared for only a few seconds. After witnessing the air-to-surface projectile, the orbs of light in the sky began to travel eastbound as a group and the lone light traveled in the opposite direction.  The lights faded, disappeared, and did not reappear.  We left the beach at 23:00.",2014-07-20T00:00:00,41.273,-72.9574

I walked out of the garage, facing due south, and immediately heard the deep loud sound of a large helicopter.  Looking up, I saw two stationary objects.  One obviously a large helicopter (what I assumed to be military) facing east referencing the position of its navigation lights (no head or search lamps apparent ).  The other was a large round ball of light reminding me of the color of amber jewelry or a head lamp from a sixties automobile.  These were separated by some space, as the dark sky was visible between them.  No sound was heard from the Light Ball however the helicopter was very loud.  I watched for ten minutes with no movement but did observe the Light Ball seemed to pulse from the outside in becoming less bright toward the middle.   Once, I thought I could see three balls of light forming the big ball but I am not certain.  The helicopter moved forward and seemed to become one with the Light Ball but I am thinking the light intensity of the obscured the helicopter as I could still here it.   I took my iPhone 5s from my pocket (will attach photos) and snapped a couple of pictures with flash.  Immediately the Light Ball/not visible helicopter began to move north on a western angle in my direction.  I became uneasy and crossed the street to hide under a tree and as I was doing so the combined objects changed direction more towards the tree.   I noticed the phone was still lighted so I clicked it off and stayed in the shadows observing the Light Ball between the leaves.  I may have been there for a few minutes and saw my next door neighbor (two ladies) pull in their drive way and get out of their Tahoe phones in hand taking pictures.  I walked over to talk with them (their comment was they were wigged out) and turning to look,   I saw the Light Ball and helicopter as two separate objects again with the Light Ball west of the helicopter and both were stationary and hovering.  The neighbors went inside as I observed The Light Ball slowly start to move west/slightly southwest and the helicopter followed.  I watched until they were completely out of sight.  Suddenly, I heard the same helicopter sound again and looking up and left, I saw exactly what I just witnessed disappear in the western sky.  The Light Ball was east of the helicopter and the helicopter seemed to be facing east.  Both objects were stationary and hovering but the helicopter sound was not as loud and no sound was heard from the Light Ball.  I did observe they seemed to be on the same latitude as the others were but further east.  I watched for approximately five minutes and took a flash picture.  The Light Ball moved toward my direction followed by the helicopter.  They stopped after some north/west directional movement and hovered again.   Suddenly the Light Ball headed southeast (North Scottsdale) with at a must faster rate of speed than the first sightings.  The helicopter seemed to not keep pace and I watched until they were out of sight, but the Light Ball was out of sight much sooner than the helicopter.  This was my first UFO experience and what was most unnerving was the possible military involvement along with the objects movement seemingly in response to my camera flash.  I sent a text with picture to a friend just in case there was a Men in Black visit.  This text was sent at 20:40 hours so this occurred over forty minutes.

On June 22, 2014, I was sitting on my private outdoor rooftop in Brooklyn, NY, (Williamsburg) with a friend of mine.  I watch the sky every night - I can usually find Mars if it is visible, can identify numerous constellations, know the difference between a satellite and an airplane, and just love to stare out into space.   At about 10:17 PM, I was looking at the sky as I always do, but it wasn't a very clear night and very few stars were visible due to the massive light pollution created by the New York City lights.   Out of the corner of my eye I noticed an orange glowing orb of light.  After doing a quick double-take, I saw there were actually three orbs of light moving across the sky in a way I have NEVER seen any craft or airplane or satellite move - ever.  It was completely silent and seemed to float through the air.  I instantly knew I was seeing a UFO; I had absolutely no doubt in my mind. In the midst of my excitement/awe/disbelief, I grabbed my iPhone and tried to record as much as I could (I knew that if I didn't capture this experience no one would ever believe me).  The orbs of light moved across the sky and I took my first video but to the blind eye and without the technology needed to slow down the video, all I could see was the black night sky.  I had a feeling that nothing was on that video and quickly tried to take another one before it was too late.  Fortunately,  I was able to switch the camera on in time and record what I did.  For two weeks I didn't think I had captured anythng, until I decided to watch the videos on my computer.  There is not person who I've showed this to who can come up with any plausible explanation for what I saw and recorded. The three orbs of light were moving Northeast and started very low - pretty close to some of the taller buildings.  As it moved across the sky (in a pretty slow and stable pace) it began to rise in elevation before hovering for about 20 seconds almost directly above the building across the street from me.  As it hovered there the lights remained solid and then out of nowhere the 3 lights moved rapidly throughout that area of the sky - not side to side but in terms of elevation. It was hard to determine at first whether the three orbs were all one object or if they were in fact three seperate crafts.   After watching the orbs move as they did here, both in unison and independant paths, it was clear that this was one entity.  It then descended at an extremely rapid pace and then just vanished.   I immediately fell to the ground with tears streaming out of my eyes.  I knew what I had just witnessed and was overwhlem with shock, happiness, confimation, fear, confusion, etc.  I've always known that other life existed and that UFOs regularly visit the Earth, but I never in a million years thought I would be lucky enough to witness such an encounter, let alone capture it on video.",2014-08-01T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The one nearest, which was still at a high altitude, was brighter.  The other one appeared smaller, and was some distance back from the first one.  I observed them for about 30 seconds, and then they were gone. July 25, (2014), I was about five minutes from home, when again, I saw some the same type of lights.  I pulled into a parking lot, and counted 7 of them.  They were at a fairly low altitude, coming out of the northwest heading southeast.  I almost couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  But there they were.  So, I came home, went out in my backyard with my Brother, and they were still there, moving fairly slow. We counted about the 9 this time.  The last one that appeared was bright red, then was orange.  About that time, we an aircraft coming from North to South.  It was probably at about 35,000 feet.  It looked quite distant relative to the strange lights.  After that I did a little research online, and saw similar accounts of the same type of lights.  I would not make something like this up.  I have nothing to gain from it.  I just wanted to report it, and would like to know if there were any other accounts on the objects I saw.

While driving down the Chemin-Saint Bernard road on my way to the store I saw, in the distance, what appeared to me to be Police sirens (on the right side side of the road (opposite the train bridge).  I slowed down figuring that there must be Police up ahead, maybe an accident etc... as I approached the two bridges and slowed down (both are full sized but only one allows for cars the other one is part of a walking path) I noticed that there were three people all dressed in tight black clothing leaning on the rail of the bridge looking at whatever it was that the Police were doing.  I put on my hazards and pulled over to the side. I got out of the car and approached the onlookers. I took a look myself and didn't see anything except the flashing lights directly ahead, which appeared to me now a little less like ""flashing lights"" and more akin to ""pulsing lights.""  I turned to the man on my left and asked him ""what happened?"" the man turned, looked at me, said nothing and then turned his head back to it's original position.  (Note 1: They all had dark hair and eyes)  I then leaned forward to see if one of the other two would answer my question and, nothing. One member of the trio was a female and she had shoulder length dark hair. It was also then that I noticed that the skin of their faces was a little odd. It reminded me of what a woman looks like when she puts on a little too much foundation. I didn't think much of it at the time, I was much more curious as to what the Police were doing down there.  (Note 2: There were two males and one female. The two males appeared like Caucasian men and the woman looked like a South-East Asian. Maybe even Mulatto. Another thing I didn't really notice at the time was that their chins were a little bit more 'pointy' than usual and all of them had the same chin.)  (Note 3: Their clothing was, in retrospect, very... VERY tight,  it was almost as if their clothing was 'painted on' rather than being actual clothing. Their pants were like tight cargo pants but had three big pockets across the length of the leg rather than one. The males and Female both dressed alike.)  I wanted to get a better look so I left them and headed to the other bridge via the walking path. When I looked down from the second bridge I saw a Delta shaped object that was ""pulsing"" red and blue light. The craft itself looked black and very smooth/shiny.  This is when I started to breath a little heavy ... slowly starting to take in what I may be looking at. I have never seen anything like it. The craft itself was about the length of an average tow-truck and about 30 ft wide at the widest area. The craft was silent and made no noise. It also didn't seem to have much impact on the water it was floating above (probably hovering at 2-4 ft tops).  While I was looking at this thing I heard some rattle and rocks being moved around. I looked to my left and saw one of the ""people"" coming down from the other 'path' (this path is to the left of where I was and is not as clean cut) I shouted to him ""You have to see this!"" he didn't even acknowledge me and kept walking to the other side and down towards the shore.  (Note 4: These ""people"" were not aggressive. They seemed not only to not acknowledge me except for a brief look, but, did not even seem the slight bit concerned that I was looking at whatever I was looking at. They walked very calmly. Even when it was obvious that I was about to put two and two together. It was like they did not care.)  A few moments later the other two started walking the same path and very calmly headed towards the shore. When they were all assembled below the bridge they started walking towards the craft, female first, and then walking INTO the craft. No doors (at least that I could see/hear) they walked into the craft as if walking through a wall.  The pulsing lights stopped. The craft then started moving (it also began to emit a faint buzzing sound that was somewhat... hypnotic).  The craft then switched on a pale blue light underneath it and then started to accelerate slowly to about 35 KM/H towards the Saint-Lawrence.  I started to panic! I had been within a foot of whatever they were. Maybe they would come back for me? Maybe there were others on the way!?  I ran back through the path that I had came through, got into my car, jumped into the seat and after a few tries finally got the key into the ignition and took off down the road (turning into Rene-Levesque street). About 5 minutes later... Still breathing hard with a heart that still felt like it was going to burst from out of my chest I got off the road and parked in a parking lot. I took my cellphone from the hand-rest ... I wanted to call a buddy of mine and tell him what had just happened, maybe meet up for coffee... I just really didn't want to go back home!  (Note 5: I don't remember turning my engine off when I pulled over, but I might have.)  Anyways I looked at the lock screen and it read ""1:57 A.M."" That was IMPOSSIBLE, the whole experience only lasted at max 15-20 minutes! I looked at my watch (digital) which said that it was 11:08 P.M, I toggled my cars display and the car also said the same (it actually read 11:09 P.M)  I drove to Tim Horton's and their clock said 2:05 A.M  *If 3 hours really did pass I have no recollection of what happened during that time.  *I do not believe that I was abducted. I have no memories, no physical scars and no headaches etc. I feel perfectly fine, a little shook I guess, but, fine.",2014-06-20T00:00:00,45.36097241379311,-73.72629482758622

I told my husband to follow me outside there’s a light in the sky, he followed and saw the light, quickly deciding it was a helicopter. I ran and got my camera, however being the evening the two short videos I shot I don’t think are very helpful.  The light moved fairly slowly, at one point seemed to hover for a few seconds, and move slightly up and then back to the original line of travel.  It wasn’t moving very quickly, so it seemed feasible that it may be a helicopter.  However I saw no red or green navigation lights, or strobe lights of any kind, which I have always associated with helicopters or airplanes.  I have seen spotlights on helicopters and remember them being a very bright white…not this orange color.  I heard no sound that seemed to originate from it.  I thought I heard a helicopter but it was very faint and off to the west where there is a hospital with a helicopter pad here in town.   This light was almost directly over the house and helicopters that have flown over us at that altitude in the past make a lot more noise than what I was hearing.  The color was solid orangish-yellow, with no blinking.  It was not perfectly round or orb like, it had a “flame like” appearance, similar to a hot air balloon flame.   It was just under the cloud cover.  I went to a weather website after the sighting and it said there were a few clouds at 12, 000 feet.

"Four lights were observed over Minooka, IL, exhibiting abnormal flight characteristics and lack of standard navigation illumination.",Minooka,IL,2014-06-21T21:45:00,light,5 minutes,"Occurred : 6/21/2014 21:45  (Entered as : 06/21/14 21:45) Reported: 6/21/2014 9:37:06 PM 21:37 Posted: 6/24/2014 Location: Minooka, IL Shape: Light Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110491.html,"Four lights were observed over Minooka, IL exhibiting abnormal flight characteristics and lack of standard navigation illumination. From a patio in a suburban neighborhood, the primary witness observed a small, bright red light rising from the horizon in the WSW direction.  The direction corresponded approximately with that regularly observed for commercial airlines/cargo aircraft on approach to MDW or ORD.  The light approached from WSW, heading NE at an apparent velocity at least 4-5 times the apparent velocity of a typical commercial aircraft seen on approach from that direction.  At first, the primary witness considered that the light was a low aircraft without standard landing or navigational illumination.  There seemed to be a faint hiss from the light as it approached.  As it reached between 30 and 45 degrees in elevation above the horizon, the light instantly decreased in apparent velocity and changed heading N.  The light then continued on at the reduced velocity until it reached a position to the NW of the observation position (still at similar angle of elevation) and appeared ! to hover. As the light began to hover, the witness observed two more identical lights in close formation with each other follow the same approach and pattern at similar velocity.  The faint hissing sound also seemed to emanate from these.  As the pair of lights approached the apparent waypoint for change to a N heading, the witness observed a commercial aircraft at typical approach altitude from the SSE, flying directly overhead, presumably on approach to MDW, and with standard landing and navigation lights.  This commercial aircraft should have had clear observation of the pair of lights, and likely the fourth light.  The dull roar of the commercial aircraft was clearly audible and was vastly different than the faint sound heard from the lights by the primary witness.  The witness also noticed that the first light had apparently disappeared as the pair of lights progressed along the same N heading.  As the pair of lights began to hover in the same NW location as the first light had, ! a fourth light appeared from the same location along the horizon, proceeded along the same route, and at similar velocity to the first three. At this point, the primary witness called a second witness from the residence to confirm what was being observed.  The second witness observed the two lights in formation appear to hover in the same location that the primary witness had observed the first light hover.  The secondary witness did not observe the entire approach of the fourth light from the horizon, but did observe its change in heading to follow the pair of lights N.  Both observers witnessed the pair of lights either reduce in illumination, or proceed at increased velocity N, until they disappeared.  The secondary witness returned to the inside of the residence as the fourth light progressed along the path N.  The primary witness then observed the fourth light appear to hover in the same location as the first light and the pair of lights had hovered.  For 1-2 minutes, the light seemingly hovered in place, with slight random movement.  After hovering, the light began to diminish as the pair had, again either e! xtinguishing or moving off at rapid velocity directly away from the observer, to the N. The witness also observed another, presumably commercial (based on apparent landing and navigation lights), aircraft in the distance.  This second commercial aircraft appeared in the NNW and appeared to be following an E heading, possibly on approach to ORD.  From the point of observation, this aircraft and the fourth light appeared to have intersecting paths.  As the fourth light faded from view completely, there was approximately 3-5 degrees of angle between it and the commercial aircraft, with the commercial aircraft still to the W of the fourth light.  For approximately 5 minutes following the event, the primary witness continued to scan for additional lights, but none appeared.  As the fourth light was moving off to the N, a third commercial aircraft appeared on the horizon from the same location as the four lights, to the WSW of the observation position.  At the closest approach (as each light changed heading N), the red lights appeared in size equal to landing lights on a commercial aircraft at standard to low approach.  The red lights did not blink and no strobe or steady lights of any color appeared to accompany the lights.  The intensities (though not the color) of the lights were similar to a commercial aircraft landing light on low approach and did not appreciably vary, except with distance as they approached from the WSW and appeared to depart to the N. The primary witness wears prescription eyeglasses for distance correction and had them on for the entire event.  The secondary witness wears contact lenses for distance correction and had them in for the entire event.  The secondary witness did not indicate noticing the faint hissing sound with any of the lights that the primary witness heard.  Neither witness was under the influence of an intoxicant during the event.  Over the course of the event, the primary witness observed cloud-to-cloud lightning strokes at altitude far to the SSW.  The distance was great enough that thunder did not perceptibly report at the observation location from the strokes.  Fireworks had been launched in the vicinity of the observation location during the course of the evening, though the primary witness does not recall hearing the report of mortars at any time during the event and each of the lights lasted far longer than any pyrotechnic device the primary and secondary witnesses have previously! observed and did not wax or wane appreciably in intensity.  There is no doubt by the primary and secondary witnesses that the lights were some type of aircraft, and not a pyrotechnic effect. In contrast to standard aircraft, the lights displayed the ability to move at high velocity and make rapid changes in velocity.  The ability to, apparently, hover is not common among fixed-wing aircraft, yet the apparent velocity seemed to the primary witness to be too great for a rotor aircraft.  If the lights were at low altitude (to explain the high velocity from the horizon), they did not emit a loud noise as would be expected from a rotor or fixed-wing aircraft.  The primary and secondary witnesses are familiar with military helicopters that operate periodically in the local airspace.  These aircraft (Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks) have always been readily audible both during the day and at night.  If the lights were aircraft with STOL/VTOL capabilities, they did not emit the expected sound of a jet turbine engine.",2014-06-24T00:00:00,41.4878,-88.3254

At that time, I observed a steady light, which appeared to be a star.  The star was stationary.  While observing the Big Dipper, this particular star started moving.  The star like object had no flashing lights and stayed luminescent the entire time myself and my daughter were observing it.   As i continued to watch, it seemed to move faster.  The lit object was traveling in an east, southeast direction.  There was no noise associated with this object. Myself and my daughter continued watching this object in flight.  In my opinion, and i have seen thousands of planes at night and the speed in which they move....this object traveled at a speed unknown to my eyes and probably 8 to 10 times faster than anything we have in our current military.   I could not guess the altitude in which the object was traveling.  But, it did appear at what some would call a possible normal cruising altitude for a commercial airliner.  As the object traveled about halfway across the sky, all of a sudden it emitted the brightest, most concentrated light i have ever seen in the sky, brighter than any full moon.  The light started as a concentrated beam, then it was as if it gazed directly down on my daughter and myself, then aimed away and off in roughly about 2 seconds.  The object then traveled on in an easterly, southeast direction.   It crossed the majority of the sky that I can see from my house in roughly a 15 second time frame.  The angle of travel I would guess, would be about 160 degrees to 170 degrees.  Almost a straight line from the North-Northwest, to the South-Southwest.

It was dark out, so it was hard to tell which direction it was travelling.  No noise, no trail left behind.  It appeared to be going away from me at a diagonal direction I had to get up and stand back in the room to watch where it was going. After a short time (a minute??) I noticed things that looked like sparks come down only from the bottom of the fireball.  At that point I thought it was likely some type of firework or flare.  It appeared to disappear behind some trees behind a main road near my house where there is a wooded area. In a few minutes, another similar thing came by and did the exact same trajectory, disappearing behind the trees.  I am thinking it's a firework (??).

Two Sightings (Jul 4th/Jul 17th) Sighting 1) July 4th, 2014, (22:45mt)   At aprox 22:45 we were enjoying the neighborhood fireworks.  When I noticed what looked like orange ""street lamp colored"" sparks, from an aerial ""mortar type"" firework drifting in the wind.  It quickly became apparent they were actually flying objects. One flew by, followed by two in perfect formation.  They were traveling in an Easterly direction, rather slowly.  I turned and asked the other adults if they were seeing the same thing, all agreed they did.  As minutes past it hit me we should be taking video.  We were able to get a short video, but the ""orbs"" were too far away by that time, and it barely showed up. The orbs were visible for close to five minutes, then faded out one by one.  They were very bright streetlight orange at first, then faded with distance.  But also faded in and out randomly.  They made zero noise, and had no other navigational type lights. Sighting 2)  July 17th, 2014, (23:30mt)   At aprox. 11:30pm while. driving South on Happy Valley Rd and Amity roundabout, noticed three bright very clear orange orbs over the S East horizon.  The orbs were flying in perfectly spaced formation.  As we came down the small hill, a fourth and fifth appeared in the formation. We followed them East Then South on Greenhurst/Black Cat about 5 miles.  We then turned west on Kuna Rd and pulled to the shoulder as the Orbs very slowly descended towards ground level.  I was able to shoot a small amount of video.  We drove a few miles West then South, but lost the orbs among the yard lights in the distance.  Driving home with windows down, we noticed a heavy burnt electrical smell in the air. We absolutely have no doubt both ""sightings""were the same type of object.  I have an above average knowledge of civil/mil aviation, and can say these were not aircraft, balloons, or lanterns.  Nor were they afterburners or flares from local mil fighters.  With no navigational lights, or noise associated with most aircraft. And though these appear similar to yard/street lights.  Being brighter, well above the horizon, and moving!

Last night me, my girlfriend, and my parents all saw something ""unconventional"".   After seeing what I saw, I wanted to see if anyone else in the area had seen anything unusual, and that's when I saw an article by a local reporter on WTMJ about lights over Waukesha. Let me tell you our story:  Last night, Aug 17th, I'd say around 9:30ish, didn't look at the clock but somewhere between 9 and 10, me and my girlfriend were out in front of my parents’ house letting the dogs out.  I happened to look up at the night sky and it was such a clear night and so many stars.  As I was looking up, something bright and moving fairly fast towards the Southeast caught my attention. At first I was positive it was a satellite as I have seen them time and time before whenever I camp.  I ran inside and told my parents to come outside quick to see the satellite moving across the sky.  We went out in the backyard, meanwhile my girlfriend was in the front yard watching the same thing. When we went out on the back patio, I was surprised that the ""Satellite"" wasn't further to the east because of the speed it was travelling before.  In fact, it was still moving but it was as if this thing got real close to us.  At first it was a small little dot, just like how a satellite appears.  But this thing was getting closer to us because the size got bigger and that light was so bright. At this point, we knew it wasn't a satellite because satellites are orbiting around the earth and don't really change their depth level, at least that I know of.  It wasn't any plane we've ever seen because there were no blinking lights, nothing that you see on planes.  In fact, there was no sound at all.  If it were a plane, it would have definitely been low enough for us to hear the plane roar.  Then it changed course from a straight line, curved just slightly, turned smaller and morphed into a red light as it was passing us and disappeared.  There were no clouds for any plane to have hid behind, ruling out that this was a plane.   It wasn't a meteor or anything like that because there was no tail, or trail of debris behind this thing.  It was an object, very, very, bright.  In fact it was so bright, you could almost see the light beams emitting from it.   And I can’t be positive, but it almost looked like it was a bunch of little lights all making up one big bright light. ! I can't say I am 100% on that though because it was far away.   I am 100% sure though that this was a first that any of us had ever seen.  There was also a shooting star that passed right in front of this thing only going south west.  This bright object was moving south east. Anyway, I just thought it was really, for lack of a more captivating word ""interesting"". Have a nice day and thanks for your time",2014-08-22T00:00:00,43.06068902439025,-88.12388597560977

Cannot guarantee this was an actual sighting, but it was absolutely NOT a plane or a typical aircraft.  Very interesting and unusual situation.

Two years ago in August, I took position in my lawn on a deckchair at 10:00 in the night to observe the shooting stars of Perséides. At 11:00, after some small tracks, I see over my head two orange halo flying close together and pretty quickly and leaving my horizon after some seconds. Since this event, as often as possible when the sky is clear and if I have free time, I take position in my lawn between 10:30 and 11:30 in the night. Since there, I have seen 7 time this phenomenon: lights flying north to south or south to north. Some time, one object is present, some time two and one time three in triangle. When the lights were in triangle, the formation was very constant like if three lights were soldered together. But, suddenly, one light made a left turn leaving the formation. But the three lights stayed in my field of view of my glass (40X10). After some seconds and just before leaving my horizon, the three lights return in they original formation. My last observation was 17 August at 10:45 in the night. Two objects were present. In resume: Observation of 1 or two or three orange lights like out of focus. Time from horizon to horizon 20 seconds approximatively Track North to South or South to North No speed change   Estimation:  It seems they are flying above aircrafts.  I estimate flying altitude 60.000fts. A small computation says that they are flying at Mach 6 to 10 and have a size larger than a football field!!!  It is really an unusual phenomenon!!!

I witnessed the craft positioned above a factory named pang at the time of the sighting it was circular in appearance just a solid red glow.  It was disc shaped but slightly rounder than the typical disc you would see on one of those cliche tv programs that's so streamlined.   All I can say from the sighting is that the duration was approximately 15-20 seconds and what I witnessed I wouldn't describe as extra-terrestrial or a man made craft because at the end of the day who knows. all I know is what my eyes witnessed.  What I saw what the craft/disc shaped light I saw hover from a stationery position for about 5-10 seconds above the factory and then accelerate from a standstill to what I can only estimate as to be into the 1000's of mph's instantaneously without a whisper and then the craft disappeared behind cloud cover.  Like a bullet fired from a rifle, the velocity of the craft was astounding.   My dad still mentions it to people to this day 10-11 years later as if it's a joke and kind of makes me feel uneasy and embaressed by what I'd seen.  If I could only guess at the speed of which I'm no expert I would assume to be 8-10000+ mph silently, instantly.  I live near Lakenheath & Mildenhall airbases's and see the harrier's on a regular basis and know they make a lot of noise when they accelerate.

I was walking south-east on 7th street in San Francisco, about 1 block north of the I-80 overpass.  It was sometime between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM.  I was returning to my office after spending the evening with some friends (I was not intoxicated). I was looking up to see what stars were visible through the light pollution, as it was a clear night.  I had grown up in more rural areas of the Midwest, and enjoyed stargazing, although I had never taken the time to learn more than a handful of star and constellation names. As I looked south, over a low (2-3-story) building across the street, I noticed very distant/faint light moving at a steady velocity against the stars in the background.  The movement was about two-thirds of the way up from the horizon to the zenith.  It was so faint that I would easily have missed it had I not been looking intently in its general direction. As I focused on this movement, I realized that it was three very faint lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were close together, perhaps one-third to one-half the diameter of a full moon overhead.  These lights were moving from a southerly direction to a northerly direction.  Because of the perceived distance, if it had been a single light, I would have assumed it was a satellite and thought nothing more of it.  I did assume it was a high-altitude aircraft, but I was intrigued by the fact that the lights were solid, when I expected to see flashing lights. As I watched, I realized that the formation of lights passed in front of a star, and I could clearly see the star between the lights.  This happened with other stars, leading me to realize that the lights were not on a solid object, but rather moving together in a formation. I watched more intently to see if the formation shifted.  It seemed to be locked very rigidly, and I saw no evidence of the lights moving relative to one another.  I also realized that there was no sound from the craft(s).  (There was little traffic on the overpass that time of night, so I would have heard a small plane, helicopter or jet.)  I don't recall a rotational motion, but it's possible they were rotating around a central point very slowly.  Otherwise, they moved in a straight line, southerly to northerly, just to the north-west of the zenith.  I do not recall if they moved with one light in the lead. I stopped watching the lights after they moved to the north side of the street.  I do not recall if they were no longer visible, or if I just lost interest (after a few minutes, they exhibited no new behavior).

One morning in June of 2004, I was out in the back yard having a cigarette and I happened to look up  at the sky.  I was admiring how nice of a day it would be, then I noticed something just above the tree line.  It looked black and shiny, I saw the sun reflect off of it.  Something about the way it was moving seemed odd, it seemed to be going too slow to be a plane.   So I went into the garage and got my binoculars and took a look at it. At first I thought I was looking at a group of balloons that got away.  I thought this because  through the binoculars I could see that it didn't keep a consistent shape.  Then I had to dismiss that idea because when I looked at it without the binoculars I could see that it was going in a straight horizontal line, not rising or falling, and there was hardly any breeze at the time.  It was moving from west to east and looked like it was about 300 to 400 feet off the ground.   By my estimation it was out over the Boise airport.  I watched it untill I lost it in the background of the mountains east of Boise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

My family and I have been here since 1995.  I came to your website to see if it was listed and did not see it.  The date was October 17, 1973.  It is listed in Brown's Guide on this page, and this is the article:  http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/weird-georgia-warner-robins-ufos-1973/   First hundreds of observers, largely law enforcement personnel, were treated to intriguing lights which maneuvered across the sky, then two unidentifiable objects impacted spectacularly with the ground, and that was followed by a diving craft which drove two military policemen off the road.  It was only later that the really weird stuff started to happen as reports of aliens were received from across the state.  It was autumn, 1973, and the most intense wave of UFO sightings in American history had begun in Georgia.  The massive UFO “flap” reached Warner Robins on the night of October 17 when two substantial UFO reports were received.  The two incidents were separate, but occurred within thirty minutes and one mile of each other.  At nine p.m.  Lawrence Smith, Peggy Stepp, and her daughter Kathy spotted a large, cigar shaped object about 100 feet above the ground. They followed it down Dunbar and Bateman roads and when they got closer, “I was petrified,” Smith said, for suddenly “! there were two of them. And then they started getting close, and we started getting scared.” The UFOs were heard to emit humming sounds. Stepp began to scream and Smith raced toward a more inhabited area. The craft was ‘about the size of a house,” he said, and “had red, green, and blue lights.” “The UFOs began to close in,” Stepp said, and then, “my God, there was one right behind us. My daughter screamed hysterically, and the thing stopped right above us and put this bright light on the car.” “It was so bright,” Smith added. “I thought it was going to blind me. I have never seen a light like that.” The two adults agreed that the multi-colored lights grew in intensity as the airship approached. “It just hovered there like a helicopter making the humming noise,” Smith said, “and then, it was gone in a flash.” Smith called the Houston County Sheriff’s Department to report the incident at 9:30. Meanwhile, Corporal Bobby Fisher was dispatched to investigate a UFO sighting near ! Elberta and Dunbar roads. He reached the old Houston County Fa! irground s, an elevated area with a good view of the surrounding countryside, at 9:57, and apparently saw the same object reported by Smith and Stepp, hovering above the trees. ”It approached a clear field,” he reported, “and then took off in a westerly direction. It was huge with red, blue, and green lights. I chased it when it zoomed over me. It made a humming noise, sort of like electricity going through a wire.” Fisher, who described his UFO as being “big as a building,” bravely pursued the craft and overtook it on Dunbar Road a mile east of Houston Lake Road. “It stopped there right over me, and I got out of the car,” he continued. “I took my flashlight and pointed it at the thing. Hell, it was only about 100 feet above me. I couldn’t see anything for the bright light. I think I got some type of reflection off of it when I pointed my flashlight at it. That’s how close it was. I thought that damn thing was going to land right there in that field. “I stayed on the radio trying to ! get someone else out there. I didn’t want anyone to think I was crazy. The UFO began moving slowly, then raced away “extremely fast.” “If that thing would have landed,” Fisher declared, “I think I would have walked over to it.” Lawrence Smith said that his UFO “sounds exactly the same as the one the deputy saw.” Jim Cosey, executive editor of the Warner Robins Daily Sun, believed that Smith, Stepp, and Fisher “saw something. They sounded sincere and nearly hysterical on the phone.” Cosey rousted three reporters out of bed and joined them on a nocturnal tour around the city that produced no aerial anomalies. Around the time of these incidents, tens of thousands of central Georgia residents reported UFOs that were easily explained. Two weather balloons were launched by the National Weather Service from Texas and Alabama. Measuring 150 feet in diameter, the balloons drifted over at 55,000 feet, high enough to reflect sunlight long after the sun had set. At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida two rockets were launched which released clouds of glowing red, green, and yellow gases at an altitude of six miles. These sightings were spectacular, but they were not UFOs, nor did they explain the reports filed by Smith, Stepp, and Fisher.  And on this page: http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/weird-georgia-alien-invasion-the-ufos-of-1973-part-10-gas-bags-and-gaseous/  Most of the residents of Warner Robins are either military personnel or civilian workers at Robins Air Force Base, which is central Georgia’s largest employer, and they habitually watch the skies. Thousands of people crowded the streets on October 17, staring skyward at the spectacle, and the Warner Robins Police Department logged over 400 calls reporting UFOs. All but perhaps two sightings were explained by the weather balloons, but those were substantial reports from four persons, including a law enforcement officer, who chased and were chased by mammoth aircraft. Also, for the record, those sightings occurred an hour after the weather balloons had cleared the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When I got to him he told me he thought he saw a UFO that was following him and was shooting sparks.   At that time I did not see anything and thought maybe he saw a shooting star or something but he was sure it was not (he is 10).  I left and about a minute later he called me again and this time when I came I “did” see it.  It was to the right of where he saw it the first time and the coloring was a reddish orange glow and looked round.       As we watched it, it was moving through the sky in a curve (not straight), and as it went around the curve the lights went out.   We then went back to the spot where my son saw it the first time and after a minute or so we saw it again.  That time, I “did” see it shoot sparks but it was not white sparks like I thought he meant.  It was reddish flare looking sparks.  It (shot) about 2 of them, about a second or so apart and after moving a few feet, it did it again.  The sparks didn’t go far into the sky, only a few feet.  They shot down at an angle from left to right.   Then as it rounded the corner again, the lights went out.    I do not believe it was a plane because you can still see the physical body of the plane at night from all the lights on it.  And planes fly straight.   I do not think it was a helicopter because you can also still see the body of a helicopter from the lights and you can typically hear the sound of one.  And, why would a plane or a helicopter shoot sparks??  In addition, this object was flying higher than a plane or helicopter would and the object looked round.  However it didn’t move super fast, but seemed to be about the same speed as a plane or helicopter but a little faster.   I went back to get my binoculars and although we couldn’t see the object as clear as I hoped, you could better see that it was round and you could see more of the actual lights going around it. My son did try to take a picture from his cell phone and you can't really see it but just in case you can ""expand"" it, I asked that he keep it. I am not for sure saying it was a UFO but what could it have been??  That is the answer I am seeking. Thank you!",2014-08-15T00:00:00,28.8939,-81.3194

She did, and it appeared to her as a hat shaped object with rounded corners, but just barely discernible - perhaps only a millimeter or two in size if held at arm’s length. This object was pretty much due NE (45 degrees true North) from our position, and approximately 40 degrees up from the horizon. She handed the binoculars to me (I could not find nor see the object with my naked eye) and instructed me to follow a certain cloud pattern upwards to find the object. I did, and watched it for several minutes, until my arms got tired.  It did not move at all,  appearing to hover motionless in the sky above the lake below.

The sighting:  The video shows two 'blobs' of light separately.  They then move rapidly towards each other in a flash and join in one huge flash and disappear.

The two objects (where flying at high altitude) was shining, thanks to the reflection of the sun on them.  Available in 30-40 seconds remained visible in the visual field of the researcher.   Those seconds the unknown object was moving parallel to the plane, then began to overtake them and in the ends flies in front of the nose of the airplane at a greater distance, until it lost both skyline.  At the time of the photographs, dozens of people around began to realize what was happening and looked up in the sky observing and commenting on the paradox of the case. Analyzing the incident, Harris said about the identity of shiny objects:  ""There is no known conventional military aircraft to fly with such speed, to reflect sunlight and it not after exhaust!

On Friday, July 25, 2014, at 1020 pm local time (Central time zone), in Minnesota,  I was walking home with my digital camera.  I was shooting wildlife pictures earlier when there was light, but when it got to dark, I just put the lens cap on and turn off the camera.  I then went for a 4 mile walk.   About a block from my house, I looked up in the pitch black sky and saw a strange orange light – sort of like an “orange moon” color when the moon is low on the horizon.  This was just a very small sliver of orange light, so I was thinking it must be a slice of the moon low on the horizon.  As I watched this light, it was approaching me, and now it looked like an object that was on fire flying though the air.  I was thinking this was an airplane on fire and would be falling to the ground.   This orange light was bright, it looked like a campfire type of orange – like it was on fire.  I suddenly realized I had my camera with me and by the time I got the lens cap off, camera, turn on the object was directly overhead.  I had the camera in full auto mode, so my first shots the flash was on and the auto-focus could not operate properly due to low light – the shutter stayed open because it was expecting the flash to expose the object – so the first shots were just light moving while shutter open.   I quickly switched modes on the camera.  The object appeared to about 2,000 feet high about the level that helicopter fly at, but it could have just appeared to low elevation due the brightness of the light.  This object made no sound – it was completely silent. I snapped off several photos of this object as it was now moving away from me.  Its speed appeared to be that of a rescue helicopters (flight for life) that often fly over during the night – my guess about 200 to 300 mph.  It was out of range in about 15 seconds.    I snapped off 17 photos, but all you can see is the orange light in a pitch black sky.  These are 18 mega pixel photos so they can be blow ! up to view better.  However, the actual object size, shape, etc. cannot be determined – I am assuming that this orange light was some sort of engine or propulsion system.  It was traveling Northeast about 90% north and 10% east coming from the Southwest in a straight line.  There was nothing fancy – no sudden movements or exotic speeds – straight line flight about 300 mph. 	Years ago, I was in the Air Force and stationed at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas.  The “Top Gun” school for the Air Force is station their and it is called Red Flag.  When Red Flag is going you can watch all sorts of aircraft taking off and flying at night.  I know what afterburners look like and what jet engines look like.  I also know what aircraft landing lights look like as well as the other light on the planes wings.  Stealth aircraft do not have engine exhaust that is visible from the ground.  The orange light did not look like anything I had ever seen before.

I knew I never saw something similar like this before and I decided to rush upstairs (I live in the 14th floor) and try to take a picture if they were still around (I don’t have a great camera with a big zoom).   It took me about 30 seconds to spot one of them above the ocean, and one of them going along the shore in opposite direction (later in the poicture, I could spot a very bright light on the sky and a black shadow Notice that they were really small.  From my terrace, they were no longer bright but yellow and orange shaped as a blimp and were now going very slow. I could not hear a sound.   There was no one at the beach at that time that I could see.  (I thought about remote control toys but no one was there controlling them and I also, later on, did a research about remote control toys that are similar to the ones I saw.  I could not find any)  Suddenly I lost one of them and the one I took a picture, was flying very close to the water horizontally.

I myself am an amateur astronomer and my friends both have credible backgrounds.  1 military and 1 works at an international airport as a plane mechanic.  So all and all we are all pretty familiar with what can be seen in the sky collectively.  I also usually do a fireworks display every year.  We all confirmed at the altitude, lack of sound (0 sound being emitted from the object) and speed that this object was nothing that we had ever seen.  We watched the object from from west to east then turn towards the city of Philadelphia.   As it passed over us, it went from its almost floating speed to a fast dart at which point it vanished out of view in a matter of seconds.   Before we could even comment on what we just saw another object same size, altitude, speed, and flight path as the previous one.  We instantly were in awe and had no idea what we just saw after the second one.   We were able to rule out a plane do the fact a plane flew overhead during the occurrence and the altitude of these objects were much higher despite how bright they were. I was able to rule out any kind of meteor or firework.  We were left baffled.  I informed my cousin of the occurrence and he was intrigued by it which led to him calling me 3 months later as he was driving down the PA turnpike and witnessed the same thing only with more objects which he promptly pulled over and recorded it on his Nikon dslr.   He even followed down the highway and continued filming which was interesting at one point because the object while he was driving moved so fast he couldn't keep it in frame when it stopped and changed directions completely.

While getting fire started, I was along outside.   After the fire got going, I sat down to relax.  After about ten minutes, I had the strangest sensation that someone was looking at me.  I looked to my right and I saw this orb which was white in color, the same color as a star.  I would say their size was about the size of a softball, maybe as big as a basketball.  Hard to tell.  However, this orb wasn't a celestial body as it was maybe only 100 feet above my trees running down the property line.   The object was static for approx. 30 seconds as I initially observed it.  While looking at it, I was trying to figure out what it could have been.  Then after half a minute, the object started pulsing (bright, gone, bright, gone) and began moving erratically over my property, changing altitude, direction, and velocity.  It emitted no sound at all that was perceivable to me.   At this point, I ran in the house and got my friends to come outside and observe.  We could not identify the phenomenon, however, one friend offered  up that they could be fireflies. This was the closest explanation, however it failed to explain the color (object(s) were bright white, not greenish-yellow), nor the speed at which they were able to traverse the sky (very quickly as to meandering around).   We  then began seeing other orbs spontaneously appearing in the night sky, and they began to fly in formation.  The maneuvers would then break off in different directions and start kind of behaving randomly again.  An orb would appear in a place in the sky, disappear, then pop up in another location.   The pulsing of the light was not static either.  Sometimes they would strobe faster, other times they would appear to flicker.   We tried to photograph them, but they did not appear in the digital photographs, which  was odd because they were much more luminous than the regular celestial objects appearing in the night sky.  In total there were four of us obs! erving. I was also using binoculars to see them upclose, however, I was unable to make out any shape or physical form as the light they emitted was intense and not translucent.  At one point, I believe I heard a helicopter nearby, and wondered if they were seeing this.  There was also a jet aircraft moving quite fast and flying low which came out of nowhere and was traveling in the direction that the orbs were present.   Several of them shot up vertically to the flight's altitude and got very close to the aircraft.  Immediately proceeding this event, the sky seemed to be brimming with these objects flying in formation in groups of two's or three's, disappearing, and then emerging way across the sky in the same flight path in another location.  It seemed to me that they were ""jumping"" almost.  Very weird.   When the phenomena had stopped for about an hour, I was outside and had this thought to myself that was something like, ""Wow, I wish I could see them one more time, it was so cool"" and immediately, as if on cue, one was literally at the tree tops in my back yard right above my head.  The object seemed to persist until I finally called it a night and went back inside.   No further sightings since.  My friend said that the color at times appeared slightly orangish, but I can say that I definitely did not see any orange, or any other color, except pure white.",2014-06-20T00:00:00,35.49536666666667,-80.63160877192982

The balcony faces to the northeast and overlooks the Elizabeth River, which was host to the Harbor Fest Celebration on the night of June 7, 2014.   The fireworks were due to start at 21:00, so we decided to get the best view from the balcony.  The barges which sat in the river that launched the fireworks were in our clear sight.  The fireworks would only come from the barges in the Elizabeth River.  At approximately 21:45, I spotted an object slowly crossing the Elizabeth River in the sky above us.   The object moved at a cruising speed along a deliberate flight path.  The object composed of a burning flame in what we considered its ‘front’, given that it traveled in the direction of the burning flame.  The flame itself was large, and similar to that of a burning candle wick in that the flame burned strongest at the bottom, and flickered as it trailed vertically upward.   Directly behind the flame was a translucent white orb, which kept a fixed shape as it traveled intact with the flame.  My two friends also noticed the object, and we deliberated as to what it could be.   The object flew overhead approximately 200-300 feet above us, making it difficult to gauge the object’s dimensions.  That said, I would estimate the object to be of similar size to that of a small hot air balloon.  A hot air balloon this was not.  There was no basket, there were no wires or visible passengers.   The flame at one point appeared to be under the translucent orb, but only because the object passed overhead.  Even so, there was no mechanism that could be seen connecting the two. The object moved soundlessly as well.  It continued west toward Effingham Street.  When it passed over the balcony of the loft, we lost sight.  The fireworks started some 20 minutes later. This was no rogue firework that malfunctioned in flight, this was no hot-air balloon, this was not an aerial unmanned drone.  This was not a meteorite. I will not disclose our branches of service, but I will come forward with the fact that all three witnesses are active members of the U.S. military.

It was a night with no precipitation and some stars were visible and the moon looked small and faint as if maybe behind a few thin high clouds in the Eastern sky.   As I neared the top of Culler Road, before reaching where Montgomery Avenue meets Culler Road, I looked out my driver’s side window because some very obvious and strange lights were visible in the sky way over top of the roofs of the houses that line Culler Road on my left. The lights were very bright and light-orange in color.  They were spherical in shape and hovered in the sky lined up in a horizontal pattern and separated from each other with some spacing between them.  They did not appear to blink or flash upon looking at them with just my eyes.   I was so astonished at the sight of these lights that I sped up my car to get to the intersection of Palm Drive and Culler Road so I could pull off on the side of the road on Palm Drive to get a better look at these lights.  Culler Road had no berm to pull over onto so I had to get onto Palm Drive.  Within about a minute I was on Culler Road and I pulled my car off the road and parked into a cleared area on the right side of the road and I got out of my car. The lights were extremely bright and obvious in the sky.  I had never seen such lights in the sky before.  They did not appear to be airplanes as they continued to hover and move very slowly in the Eastern sky moving from my Right to my Left which would be moving in the Eastern sky from South to North.   What amazed me so much was that they kept a controlled distance from one another the entire time and they moved in unison and formed, the majority of the time, a straight horizontal line, but at one time I saw some of the lights form almost a right angle with some lights appearing more in a slanted vertical line and others in a horizontal line.  In another instance I remember thinking they almost look like a “Big Dipper” pattern but with maybe one or two “lights” missing from that familiar pattern. As they slowly moved from Right to Left in the sky, the lights in the far-most left would eventually grow dimmer and eventually fade away while additional lights, one at a time, would rise up from the horizon toward my right in the eastern sky and continue to join the trail in the right-to-left movement pattern as the other ones had followed.  They did not move fast.  They moved at a pace between “hovering” and “very slow” and the distance between each light remained almost constant (some did not catch up to others or surpass others…all lights followed the one or ones that were in front of them that were more to the left and moving northward).  All lights moved from south to north (my right to my left) and none stayed stationary or backtracked in the opposite direction.   I took out my iPhone 5 and opened the camera app and took a few still shots and then decided I should set it on video but was unsure if my phone’s camera would pick up what I saw.  I was able to get a few stil! ls and one short video. In looking back on this experience, I should have tried to count them or call the police or someone else to document what I was seeing because I was alone with I witnessed this.  My estimation was that I saw at least 20 or more individual lights total.  I don’t know how many more might have been in the sky before I was driving up Culler Road where they caught my visual attention that night.  I thought perhaps it might be something from the Pittsburgh Airport or the Air Force base which are both in the direction of where I was looking that night from Palm Drive.  The airport is approximately 20 minutes by car from Weirton and it is northeast from Weirton. I called the police 2 days later and also the news station in Steubenville, Ohio which is the city across the Ohio River from Weirton and both said they did not receive any reports of these lights.  I was frustrated because what I saw was definitely something I had never seen before in my entire life.   I am a 62-year-old male with a master’s degree in a profession.  I am not any “UFO nut” and am really not sure if extraterrestrial beings or vehicles exist.  I felt maybe these could be some experimental drones or something that the military could be testing at night.  Whatever they were, they were controlled and by no means did they randomly travel across the sky.  They were organized and lined up and spaced themselves as if controlled by some source or intelligence intentionally.  They made no noise or sound in the sky. I called the National UFO Reporting Center in the State of Washington after doing a Google search of where to report UFOs because the local police and news station treated my verbal report with no interest or concern.  I spoke directly with Peter Davenport who told me he is the director of this organization, and he advised me on how to submit a report and, to keep it “clean,” without bias or contamination, to not read other reports on that website until after I complete my report.  I will complete a report to this UFO Reporting organization and will also submit my still photos and my short video taken from my iPhone 5 on the night of June 7, 2014.

Just north of my location and about a half mile away was a hill.  To the south of me and another half mile away was another hill opening up a geological saddle.   About 15 degrees up from ground level, without being able to determine altitude, distance or speed, I noticed what appeared to be 3 points of light in a triangular formation, emerging from behind the northern hill.  The lights were yellow to orange in color moving (again depending on distance and altitude) quickly in a southerly direction.   Another two lights emerged immediately following the first three, then another three in the same general formation as the first.   They were all moving in a southerly direction.  The second group of three broke from the overall formation and headed either east or down.  The two “connecting” the two groups of three faded away.   The original three dipped lower then rose, moving independently, yet staying in a general triangular formation.   After about 10 minutes, the first three faded to points and then disappeared. There was no way of knowing if there was noise associated with the movement of these lights as the ocean waves were quite loud.

From my vantage point, it looked to be slightly in front of the plane and a short distance away on the left side of the plane (the side I was sitting on).  It was hard to gauge the distance being that it was partly cloudy and flying at night.   I was able to observe the light/orb for about 30-40 minutes.  The object would move farther away and then back, which was observable by seeing it fly through the clouds and then back into the open nearer the plane.  Every so often, it would make quick movements moving up and down, like almost mocking the plane and yet flying with us at the same time.

The day was Sunday, May 25th, 2014.   After touring the top deck and interior I made my way down the stairs to the adjacent dock area.  There were already multiple news and tour helicopters making their way up the Hudson River, while a US Coast Guard MH-65 was performing a Search and Rescue Demo (for NY Fleet Week) over the waterfront so naturally I had my eyes towards the sky, at just after noon (anywhere between 12:00 and 12:30) I noticed a small object at high altitude over the Hudson.   At first I suspected it to be merely a balloon, however after examining the object for a few seconds I noticed it appeared to be considerably larger than a normal balloon and it was hovering in place as if not affected by the present winds which a balloon would be.  Its coloration was also interesting, it appeared to mostly be a metallic grey or silver on the! surface.  I pointed it out to my father who quickly dismissed it as probably being a balloon (although he said he couldn't see it very well).  I began snapping photos of the object with my IPhone 5. I estimated the objects altitude to be around 4,000-5,000 feet because it was a lot higher than the helicopters flying up the Hudson but much lower than the occasional passing commercial airliner out of JFK airport, I had no way of guessing the objects size due to its distance and lack of anything close enough to it to compare it with, though it did appear to be larger than a balloon.   After a few minutes the object began a slow flight path moving diagonally but remaining at the same altitude, I began backing up to keep the object in view while taking pictures but it soon passed over the deck of the Intrepid and out of sight.  Although I didn't run into any other witnesses I think it is unlikely that I was the only one who saw it due to the sheer number of people in the area.   Upon uploading and reviewing the photos on my computer the following day, I noticed several things that I didn't notice while viewing the object,  The first few pictures showed exactly what I saw, a small rounded shiny metallic object hovering.  However, as I looked through the pictures I noticed the object had a darker, shaded edge in some pictures giving it more of a definitive shape (this may have been due to the sun reflecting from the other side of the object) while in other photos the object appeared to be very bright and shiny.  One of the photos the object is completely dark except for a small ring of light in the center that appears to be generated by the object, the rest of the object appears much more like a structured craft here with less of a circular shape and two corners on one side.  The final photos show the object again to be metallic and silver with the upper half being brighter (almost a whitish blue) and the lower half being a darker grey, there are also several dark patches on the edges of the object.  I have always been intrigued by the UFO phenomenon but have mostly remained a skeptic however I am questioning it now.  All I can say is that while knowing a lot about aviation and can easily identify most airplanes or helicopters, this object I witnessed and photographed did not move like or resemble any normal aircraft that I have seen in my life.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The object just appeared and didn’t seem to originate from any direction.  It was a white yellowish in color and was brighter in appearance of other aircraft in the sky.   At first I thought it was a piece of trash or a balloon in the sky as it slowly drifted east towards my direction.  I went inside and got my Sony A330 DLSR with Sony 75-300mm lens and was able to get one good pictures due to forgetting my memory card in my computer.  Getting my camera out was just to see if I could zoom in and see what it really was.   At the same time I told my wife there was something in the sky but thought it was a plastic bag but made the offer to come out and take a look.  The drift was almost like a sudden wobble and pause motion as it moved east.  In Northern Las Vegas it’s pretty common to see a plastic bag or balloon caught in the wind.   What made this different was how bright it was at the same time I could see the direction of the wind due to the dust in the air with my sun glasses and it was traveling against the wind.   Once the bright object slowly made its way over Nellis AFB.  It accelerated at amazing high rate of speed to the south and the object vanished.  Faster than any known aircraft I know of and rivals shooting stars and satellites.  There was an aircraft taking off from McCarran International Airport which was near in location of the object but the two were probably greatly separated by altitude and distance. I am in the United States Air Force and living on Nellis AFB and I can watch aircraft from Nellis AFB coming and going, as well as the air traffic lanes for takeoff and landing from North Las Vegas Airport and McCarran International Airport are great reference.  All there is a commercial air traffic route over Las Vegas as well so I get to see a lot of different aircraft at different altitudes and speeds.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857
