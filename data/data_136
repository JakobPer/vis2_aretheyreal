A bright blue/white 'star-like' light appeared for a few moments where there was nothing but a clear sky seconds before, it then moved up/right through the sky unlike a plane. The light is all we saw as it overtook whatever object was making the light. It also seemed to move without any light trails or tracers, nor did the light ever blink. It stayed steady, and seemed to have no effect of inertia as it moved. It then stopped, and quickly faded away as if it was a light bulb dimming out. My grandmother was just as shocked and instantly said: ""I'm gonna forget I saw that"", even after reminding her of what we just saw in broad daylight with clear vision and a sober mind. It freaked her out and she ! wanted no more part in talking about it, but I was amazed and inspired to share this story. We are not alone, whatever that may mean. For a light that glowed as bright as a star during the day to have moved, appeared, and vanished the way it did makes me 100% believe that it was not a plane. I lived next to Tinker AFB my whole life, it was entirely different. To all reading, thank you for your time. I would love to hear more from others, especially fellow Oklahomans.

JACKSONVILLE, FL - On September 6, 2021 - (Labor Day), I was traveling on a Jet Blue flight from Boston, MA to Jacksonville, FL. Our plane departed Logan Airport on time at 10am....scheduled to land in Jacksonville, FL at 12:50pm. The weather was clear blue skies for the entire flight. In full disclosure, I have been a licensed private pilot for 24 years, and a licensed drone pilot for 6 years. Typically when I fly commercially, I tend to book a window seat...on an exit row. On this flight, I was sitting in Row 12, window seat – exit row, on the left side of the aircraft. The jet configuration was two seats on the left, an aisle, and two seats on the right. At approximately 12:35pm, we had just entered the “pattern” for landing at Jacksonville International Airport. The Jet was on a downwind leg (paralleling the runway). The Jet was heading due West, at approximately 2,800 feet in the air, traveling at roughly 240mph. I clearing saw JAX airport out of the left window. Everything at the airport was very clear. The runways, the jets, the terminal, control tower, etc. I pressed my face against window looking west to see/gage when the pilot might turn left on the base leg of the pattern. Yes, I know it’s weird. As a pilot I tend to do that. Flying over this part of the pattern is a thick, heavy forest. In August, the leaves on the trees are very dark green. As I looked out the window, facing west, I saw three bright white objects flying in the opposite direction. I didn’t know what they were. Big white birds, three drones, no way, but I couldn’t tell. As they got closer, they were three long cylindrical objects. They were in a triangle pattern. They were roughly 75 feet to 150 feet above the tree line. I was above the objects. I was completely stunned what I saw. It was crystal clear and their white fuselage stuck out against the dark tree line. I could clearly see these “aircraft”. They were all white, I am guessing about the size of 2 or 3 cars (20 to 25 feet long)....maybe a bit longer. The width was about as wide as a car. They clearly had a rounded front fuselage, and a rounded rear – everything looked completely smooth. All three were the exact same size – and they were flying in a perfect triangle. These three had NO wings, NO rotors (blades), and absolutely NO exhaust. I could not see any windows. The entire encounter lasted 10-15 seconds. As they passed our Jet Blue flight, the left wing blocked my view for a second. As they flew past the wing, I looked to the rear and followed them until they were out of sight. I was completely stunned! After the flight, the captain of our plane was standing in the aisle outside of the cockpit. I stopped and asked him if he noticed anything on radar right before he turned the base leg. He said he did not notice anything. As I got into my vehicle, I was so upset that I pulled over and contacted the Jacksonville Control Tower. They took my information, and took a report. I told two people in the control tower what I saw. They probably thought I was nuts. When I got home, I also contact Naval Station Mayport. Since it was Labor Day, they had a skeleton crew working. I did leave 2 messages, one with a Lieutenant of Air Operations. To say that I am upset with what I saw is an understatement. Aeronautically speaking, what I observed is not possible. BUT I SAW IT! I hope I’m not cracking up. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with the witness, and consider him to be exceptionally capable, and credible.

I'm very familiar with the patterns that they take, when they take off from Boise and when they land.... We are also near the small airport in Nampa, and we see the smaller craft and have always noticed those flight patterns as well. I stood there a moment and noticed what I thought was a plane coming toward me from directly east headed straight west. I was immediately struck by the thought that I had never seen a plane come straight west that way before and I have lived here several years. That's what caught my attention first. The light pattern was different than I had ever seen before, and as an astronomy enthusiast I am always looking up, and I am always looking at planes. These lights were very golden yellow, very muted....it made me think of an old cars six volt lighting system. The lights were steady and there were many of them. They spanned the width of my index and middle finger held at arm's length against the night sky. I had nothing for reference so I really don't know how far away it was but it didn't seem to be that far, but perhaps that was because I expected it to be a small craft. There were two main lights, like a cars head lights, which were larger than the rest,  and three flanking ea! ch of those to the left and right, and two small ones between the two larger and a row of smaller lights directly beneath the two larger lights. All the lights were aligned horizontally. I watched it for a moment as it was coming toward me at a even rate of speed, not very fast, which made me think it must be a small airplane, but I believe it was also fairly low, coming across the fields from the direction of Boise. I came in the house and I got my phone and clicked on Flight Radar and while it loaded I watched this craft approaching at a steady rate of speed. I heard no noise, there were no flashing lights, only the golden yellow pattern of lights. I walked out to the front deck to call the cat and expected this plane to go over my head, despite  never showing up on Flight Radar, but there have been planes that don't show up on the app for whatever reasons, but I still should have been able to see and hear it by now.

If you saw how big Saturn was during the Great Conjunction two months ago...this flash was easily four or five times bigger. I fumbled with my phone to get a decent shot and video in, but I'm not very good at that. Then, the light suddenly disappeared, like, burnt out, to reveal what at first appeared to be a regular Earthly aircraft, with flashing red lights. But looking more closely, it was also a strange-looking aircraft, weirdly elongated, the red light looked long as well, as opposed to a pinpoint of light. But what really got me was how painstakingly slow it moved, almost lingering. Veeerrrryy weird.

I live alone. I turned my live feed doorbell on and saw a light beam and solid part of something hovering. This is the second time I've seen such a beam and heard noises. I began recording the image from my cell doorbell app which has night vision. On both occasions, I can see the beam on my night vision but not if I look directly out the window with my eyes looking at it. Last week I also had something with a light glowing that wasn't actually outside but in a different location between my side neighbors and my house. Tonight it is across the street as it was back in the summer. I make regular video checks since the first time as I didn't like the feeling and I am always now on guard. Tonight and last week I made several video's and realize that you have a limit and length minimum. Tonight I was upset with it and was yelling at it to go away and w! at a point felt like I had something inside my home that I cannot see, which I still actually feel with even air or light wind blowing as I am typing this and likely why I didn't want to get off the phone with a real person. The light beam is now gone but the circular thing is still there and although the moon is out tonight and bright, the image is NOT our moon as our moon is actually right above my house and not visible by my doorbell camera. I have lived on this road since 1970. As a child I lived 3 houses away. My mother still lives there. As a child I saw 3 tall beings in the summer of 1976 outside that spoke in their minds to me and told me to go back to bed. I also have had numerous strange things happen my entire life here including hearing a growl and my daughter being scratched when she was a teenager. I know there is some connection to my land as this summer my homes electric was reading 1248-1258 OHMS and it took 80 feet of copper to fix. A normal home is 25 ohm! s or less. That cost me a fortune to fix but I feel it is high! again a nd the reason for all the activity. All my electronics are constantly going berserk and I frequently make lengthy calls to Verizon Fios and HP to have my computer/printer and router repaired. I've been told that I am ""one of them electric people"" by a computer repairman. I had not ever heard the term SLIder till last summer after I was told this.  I could go on and on and on about strange things over the last 50 years of my life here but that would be much too long. The bottom line is that they are here and it is my belief they want access to a portal or wormhole that is based in my basement. I told them no. They wont use my land for this. I am well aware that there is a massive influx of them and this land is like Grand Central Station. Thank you for answering the phone tonight.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,42.7051,-73.8994

Now this thing looked like a four legged bug laying on top water like it was floating it was very flat looking. Low enough that I could make out the shape very well. Traveling SW from a Northern line It was like watching a plane that had been flipped around but was still flying forward as the propulsion seemed to be coming from the to back fins which were large wide flat wings with what looked like to tiny tube cylinders on each end of those fins. The fuselage was thin small like the structure of a bugs figure compared with its wings in some species. It was very … like a pencil but better yet a slick white pen. The two front fins looked flat and petite compared to the whole size; possibly pushing air down? I mean this construct blew my mind.. the Star Wars uhh the jet that has the X propelling it forward. It had a very low sound like a plane. It’s about to be fleet week so maybe it’s just a prototype of some sort but it wasn’t flying towards NYC. Okay then the other sighting that happened moments later and that invisible looking plane was def flying towards the east at a really high altitude. If it was the dudes flying that cool prototype the sun totally gave them up as good as that tech was on it. I guess human tech still glitters? It was cool watching something I could barely make out and if it weren’t for the other thing I saw I would never have noticed it. But I guess any random person would’ve seen the glitter on the vessel. I always have my eye to the sky.. when I’m outside anyway I always see crazy stuff on this mountain. what used to be woods and a Quarry.. It’s a great location for Ariel Phenom.

When I turned my attention I saw a multipointed star shaped object, symetrically bulging in the middle, black in color and intermittently reflecting the sunlight. The object was perhaps 50-75 feet below a small Cessna type single engine aircraft flying northwest. The size was roughly 1/3 of the length of the plane above it.  At first I assumed this was an object being towed under the aircraft as its speed ans direction appeared to match.  What happened next surprised me though as the object deviated towards due north along the waterway and the plane continued on its path.  I then observed the object continuing northward and maintaining relatively level flight. I watched it into the distance and lost visual contact as it appeared to go over the buildings of downtown Fort Lauderdale approximately 9 miles to the north, passing just east of the fort Lauderdale airport.  The entire episode lasted less than 15 seconds. I did not perceive any noise from the object above the background street and plane noise. There was no contrail, visible means of propulsion or anything I would associate with a control surface. I would have thought it was some sort of balloon if not for the speed, horizontal orientation and level flight.

I stargaze often & I keep a pair of small binoculars on my nightstand to see deeper into the night sky. I noticed what appeared to be a satellite crossing my field of vision. Watching the light, it began to curve in an upward direction, circled back counterclockwise, & then settled motionless in the sky, seemingly appearing as just another star.  I immediately grabbed my binoculars for a closer look. Inspecting the light/object, it shined in a manner that the nearby stars did not. The light seemed to curve & as I looked at it, I noted that it ""twisted"" its light in a very peculiar fashion. It was as if a dark serpentine tether was flailing around the object.  I watched it remain stationary for another few minutes with no further light anomalies. I resigned that it was simply a drone & that, perhaps, police or military were testing out their technologies in the air space just offshore as they often do.  2 — This is where things get weird.  Approximately 5-15 minutes after I observed this object in the night sky, I was again sitting on my bed, listening to the book on tape, with only my nightstand quartz lamp lighting my room.  Suddenly, I had a strong intuition that something was about to happen. It was a feeling similar to the onset of deja vu. This feeling was followed by my room being LIT UP with a gridwork of white shining light. Imagine 10 strobe lights going off at once, but contained to a very geometrical grid that roughly spanned a 10' x 10' space across my bedroom. The grid FLASHED twice & vanished.  I was completely stunned. Not necessarily in shock, but just stunned. These were not car lights. This was not like anything I've ever laid eyes on in my life. Yet my initial instinct was not in fear, but curiosity.  I removed my headphones & again it happened, maybe 10-15 seconds after the initial flash. Except this time I noticed a small ball of light (roughly the size of your fist) tumble through the closed window on the far corner of the room prior to my bedroom again FLASHING with this same grid pattern of pulsing light, again two times, but in a slightly different location of my room. This time I additionally noticed three peculiar elements: 1) the air briefly ""sizzled,"" 2) the pattern of the grid was aesthetically fashioned, as though I was looking at a holographic projection of an ancient temple, & 3) this light wasn't exactly light.  Within the span of those second two pulses, the ""light"" appeared to slide & gather against the wall ABOVE the window through which the ball of light came tumbling through. It was almost as if this brightness was more of a substance than a light.  I then entered something of an altered state of consciousness (markedly different from the initial deja vu feeling), although this too was very brief. I can't exactly pinpoint the sensation, but there was a certain heaviness, like gravity got a little thicker for that moment, & my ears slightly popped, as though I was surfacing from deep water.  After the moment passed, it felt like all the air came flooding back into my room & I was left with this highly uncanny feeling & a deep silence. I couldn't explain what happened & I didn't know how to feel about it. I am certain I did not experience a seizure or any sort of otherwise momentary mental health break.  3 — That same night I had a dream, or what I perceived to be a dream, that was also particularly unusual.  I saw multiple UFO crafts outside my same bedside window. From high above in the night sky, I watched them trickle down in a motion that resembled falling leaves. I recall 5 crafts in total: 2 hovering & 3 falling in this tumbling, spiraling leaf pattern. They were all a slate blue grey in color, isosceles triangular in shape, with rounded grooves at the bottom of the crafts. There were pale yellow circular lights adorning their frames.  Why I say I perceived this to be a dream is because I woke up looking outside the window. I was standing up with my hands gripping the windowsill & my head leaning in for a better view. As I came to a fully waking state, I seemed to shake out of this dream trance & laid back down in my bed. I checked the time on my phone & it was shortly after 3am.  As I lay in bed, I replayed the falling motion of these crafts again & again in my head. It sounds strange, but I simply couldn't get the movement in which these crafts fell out of my mind's eye.

We put the boat in at the Swan Valley Bridge ramp and floated Sunday down to the Rattlesnake Point Campground. The lat/long for this campground is 43°36'12.1""N 111°30'12.8""W or 43.603361, -111.503556. This is an unimproved campground on a remote section of the river. There was no one around us for at least one mile. There was mild smoke in the air from forest fires on the West Coast. We chose the campground because it would be a Dark Sky area with open sky above the river canyon.  We setup camp with our tents about fifty yards apart since we both snore loudly. My tent is mostly screen without the rainfly, ideal for sky watching from your sleeping bag. I woke around 02:30 MDT and was watching the Perseid meteor shower.  About an hour later, as I was falling asleep, I noticed a weird light near my brother’s tent. Thinking he was just relieving himself, I went back to sleep. About five minutes later, I noticed the light was there but it had drifted southwest across a meadow of thistles. This lead me to realize it was not my brother because you can’t walk through thistles.  The light continued drifting about and then seemed to climb the south canyon wall, which was several hundred feet high. This caught my attention so I sat up and watched intently to figure out what I was seeing. My first though was a drone, but there was no noise, so I eliminated that possibility.  I thought maybe a Sky Lantern candle balloon, but they don’t move that erratically and the air was calm. It was moving too swiftly to be a Search and Rescue Team.  Then, the light drifted towards me off the cliff and into the river canyon. It hovered behind some trees that I could vaguely see in the starlight. The moon was not visible. Brighter stars and metors were visible above through the smokey air but none behind the light. The moving light was below the canyon wall from my vantage point so there were no stars around it.  At this point, I decided to grab my Samsung S10+ cellphone and attempt to get a photograph to enlarge for identification. As I took photos, the spherical light started bouncing around up and down and zigzagging back and forth. I switched to video mode and shot some videos. I’ve emailed everything to ufocntr@nwlink.com.  Around half an hour into the event, I decided to wake my brother to let him see it. I crept over to his tent using a red night vision headlamp. I woke him and it took him a couple of minutes to throw on some close and get his tent unzipped. We were unable to see the anomaly. We did see Jupiter higher in the sky just NW of where I’d seen the light moving.  I am sure that what I witnessed wasn’t Jupiter. Jupiter appeared as a solid white bright round object. The roving light was not a solid color and was fuzzy-looking, not solid.  The moving light that I saw was down in the river valley and was below the top of the cliff. In my sightings, I could vaguely see two tall conifer trees that the light was behind. I am hoping my photos or videos can be enhanced to show those trees as evidence that the light was below the canyon wall and, therefore, not a planet seen through the light smoke.  As I was filming, I was sitting on the ground with my elbows on my knees, trying to steady the camera. In the videos, there are a couple of places where I zoomed in. This shows sort of a permanent enlargement of the light. In other places, the light itself changes sizes back and forth or blinks out entirely for a second or two. It also changes shape and color a few times.  In attempting to keep the object in the viewfinder, I moved the camera a few times, which could have resulted in some of the motion seen. Mostly the camera was held still.  It appeared to me to be between the size of a very large beach ball and an RV. It was difficult to size because of the lack of depth perspective.  In appearance, it was a glowing sphere with hazy, fuzzy edges. I never perceived a defined edge to it.",2021-08-20T00:00:00,43.49949999999999,-111.5892

I left my bedroom at that point and really didn’t think anything of it.

I spotted it pretty quickly from red and green lights but it was so far away that it was easy to miss. I watched it slowly move towards the northeast. It was moving up and down and side to side.

The tracks dissipated in about 10 seconds. This time I’m not sure what I saw because i got to observe it for so long. I can tell you I’ve never seen anything like it though.

"Large low flying craft over Seattle just barely visible to the eye due to light pollution that did not look, move, or sound normal",Seattle,WA,2020-02-21T01:35:00,oval,1-2 minutes,"Occurred : 2/21/2020 01:35  (Entered as : 02/21/20 1:35) Reported: 2/21/2020 12:32:47 PM 12:32 Posted: 2/25/2020 Location: Seattle, WA Shape: Oval Duration:1-2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/153/S153497.html,"Large low flying craft over Seattle just barely visible to the eye due to light pollution that did not look, move, or sound normal I have never done anything like this, but this experience was so crazy that I can’t stop thinking about it and I need to have some kind of solid documentation for what I saw.  I went to bed last night (Feb 20, 2020) at 1:00am (so I guess Feb 21, 2020 to be exact). I am 100% certain on the time because I remember thinking to myself “wow it’s exactly 1:00am” when I looked at my phone and decided to then go to bed. I fell asleep pretty fast, quicker than usual, although that part makes sense because I had to get up early that day and I also went to the gym so I was very tired. At this point, I need to describe my room for this story to make sense.  My bed is in the corner of my room against two windows.  The top of my head faces the larger window (the direction the sun usually comes from in the morning), and either my face or my back (depending on which direction I lay) faces the other smaller window. There is a small piece of wall where these two windows meet in the corner. I included a drawing for reference. The next thing I remember after falling asleep was that my eyes flew open and I sat up. This also isn’t too uncommon for me - it happens because something wakes me up, usually the sun coming over the mountain and directly into my open window onto my face. However, I was surprised to look out my window and see that it was still very dark out, though I was sure it must have been at least 5am. This is when I saw that something was off. I noticed the outline of a structure in the sky, and when I saw it I also found that it had several very faint lights on the bottom. Normally when you hear about UFOs you hear about lights and stuff, and I always imagined them to be very bright, but it was as if they had a dimmer switch and were just barely visible if you were looking very hard. The craft was oddly shaped, it had smooth and cubic edges and sides, and was mostly in an oval shape. It was moving by pretty slowly, but by the time I recognized what I was seeing it had flown upwards an! d disappeared. If it had been any darker, or if the craft had been flying any higher, I wouldn't have seen anything at all. It was just BARELY visible. Honestly the only reason I saw it at all was because there is so much light pollution in Seattle where I was. It also appeared to be MASSIVE showing that it was lowflying. I should also note that I live directly under a flight path, so I see planes and other aircrafts all day long, but NOTHING like this. It also made absolutely no sound, which anyone living under a flightpath knows is highly unusual. The size, oddness in shape and movement, as well as lack of sound all show to me that this either was not human, or if it was it is something that is kept away from the public. I also want to note that when I first saw it, I thought that maybe my window was reflecting something (combined with my post sleep haze) that made it look as if I was seeing an aircraft. However, to make sure what I was seeing was truly possible, I moved ! my head around to make sure the lights stayed in the correct p! osition and continued to move, and I also looked out both windows and saw the craft pass from one to the other behind the section of my wall between them: in conclusion, I wasn’t seeing things, or if I was my imagination in vividly detailed. The final description I want to give is that when it disappeared, the night seemed to swallow it, as if it was moving into fog. Again, it was already just barely visible if you looked very hard, so when it moved upwards just slightly it instantly was too dark to see it. I really wish I was able to get a picture, but it took me so long to register what I was seeing that by the time I thought about pulling out my phone it had gone. I feel kind of dumb because I always joke about how people can never document werid stuff like this, but now I understand. Oh and when I checked the time immediately after so that I could remember when it happened, it was 1:37am, so only a half an hour had passed from when I fell asleep, even though I felt like hours ha! d passed. I’m not really sure what to do with this info, hence why I'm posting it here. But maybe someone else also had a similar experience?",2020-02-25T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

On Thursday at 10 am I was out in my garden in Altadena and looked up to see two extremely bright objects hovering in the sky. One was small while the second object that was much larger, elongated, glowing brightly and looked like an electric blue cigar with orange light at one end. I estimate the small object was around 2-3’ in diameter and did not appear to hold a consistent form. Sometimes it looked like a cube, sometimes a triangle, sometimes a cylinder, sometimes it would appear to light up and split into two orbs, one going up and one going down. Sometimes it’s profile was reduced to a straight black line. Very hard to describe but always between two and six feet wide. The elongated object was much larger and appeared to be higher up but was so brilliant that is was impossible to determine its position or size. I’m disappointed that it disappeared before I could grab my phone. The small object remained and began to move slowly to the west and disappeared after 20 minut! es. My girlfriend who is a teacher and happened to be between classes managed to see it when it as it left our view over the horizon in the area of JPL.  I was not expecting to see another noiseless shape changing object on Friday but it was back at 8 am in the exact same place, though I did not see the cigar from Thursday. The wind had increased overnight as the Santa Ana winds began to move in and it was a gusty morning. The object was lower to the ground, this time moving in a more northward direction towards Mt. Lowe. From a side profile the shape of the object became less spherical, more geometric and appeared to be rotating.  On Saturday while my girlfriend and I were in the garden during the afternoon, the object reappeared in airspace above Wilson observatory for the better part of twenty minutes. This time there was a stationary object pulsing and glowing as brightly as a star and not moving. There also a mix of propeller and jet powered aircraft in the vicinity. As the object remained fixed in the air one of the jets made several passes by the object, approaching it from the west. This jet appeared to be military, judging by its movement, short fuselage and triangular-shaped wings. The stationary object appeared to become brighter as the aircraft would begin its approach towards it. After several more passes by the aircraft (around 20-25 minutes) the object began to move northward and possibly gain altitude as its brightness began to fade. I took video of the events and upon further examination and slowing things down frame-by frame it is possible to see that there was not just one stationary! object but multiple objects. These others were the same size and luminous qualities as the stationary object, moving in and out of view at very high speed, present for only 3-4 frames at a time- many times faster than any of the aircraft in view and making no sound.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,34.200388659793816,-118.13614845360826

The ends were dark, middle silver, and there was a small box or something hanging off but it's hard to point out what it is. It was moving much like a mylar balloon would, it was rotating in the sky, first doing a vertical flip and then precisely changing to a horizontal flip position and back and forth. I was almost positive it was a mylar balloon until I saw it's abrupt motion in between flips, something moves it, it does not follow the wind and is much to repetitive to be the wind picking something up, it's more methodical than that.

It was probably around 400-500ft in the sky when I spotted it and would go up and down roughly 1000-2000 ft or so.

The video does such a better job at explaining it.

This UFO was elongated and oval in shape hovering at an altitude I would guess to be between 500 to 1000 feet. From this altitude, the object would have to have been much larger than a Boeing 777 aircraft due to the size it present in the sky. It moved downward as well as from side to side. It didn't move erratically or in jerky motions. Instead, it moved very slowly as though it was watching something or was doing some type of reconnaissance.

The iPhone did place a square in my view finder which indicated that it did detect an object though.

Flight Instructor and Student Pilot experiences a near miss with a UFO.

Approximately 50 ft. from wing. My student and I were performing a long cross country IFR flight. We departed our home airport, French Valley, to Santa Barbara airport. The type of aircraft we were flying is a Piper Archer. Estimated time of event was 16:15 Pacific time. Indicated altitude was approximately 6,100 ft MSL (Mean Sea Level). Indicated Airspeed was 105 KTS. Approximate position was over Van Nuys Airport/ Burbank Airport, 2 – 5 miles West of VNY VOR, on the V186. Heading 280 degrees, North West bound.  Preceding the event, I remember ATC (Air Traffic Control) informing us of various aircraft around our present position. I was looking down at my iPad to look for any incoming traffic to maintain separation. As I looked at our position on the screen, there were multiple targets around our position that did not seem to be a factor as they were pretty far from our location.  The alarming and confusing matter was that the Garmin 430’s TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) was going off giving me a collision alert. It was depicting a target -100 ft from our position at our 12 o’clock, and it was moving fast towards us, opposite direction. I began to panic as this is very close.  My student pilot in the left seat yelled, “Oh My God”, and jerked the aircraft controls. From my point of view, I was sitting in the right seat, as I looked outside to search for this fast aircraft 100 ft below us I saw a dark gray metallic figure dip low and pass right underneath our left wing. It looked like it made that it made a last-minute maneuver to avoid us. visually it seemed closer to being within 50 ft. I was able to quickly glance at the object as it was to my left.  This UFO looked closely like an oval, teardrop, or a tight dish-like shape, and very aerodynamic like. To me it looked like a mix between a fossilized trilobite with a smooth carapace, or flying manta-ray/turtle. The size of the object was approximately the size of a small jet like a Honda Jet or a very wide sports car. From my memory the top side of the object appeared to be made of metal as I saw metal plates that resembled closely to the top side of B2 bomber or a F-35 aircraft. I knew it was metal as I was able to see the sun reflecting it’s shine from the top of the object into my eyes. This event lasted less than 2 seconds and happened quickly. The object maneuvered incredibly fast.  After the event, my student was terrified as she was asking me what had almost collided with our plane. I gave her my description of what I saw and she confirmed and said it looked more like a flying saucer. She was able have a closer look as she was closer to the object and had a better view of it.  I look back down to my iPad to verify if it was still close by and the G430 and it was gone.  My thoughts: The weird thing is that if this was a UFO made by a sophisticated intelligent life form outside of our known planet, it should not have a transponder or a signal that our technology should pick up. The other contradictory factor is that why would a military aircraft operate in close vicinity of congested airspace. The other factor is that a flying object like that with our present technology shouldn’t be capable of cruising at those high speeds. Even fast-moving large aircraft, such as B747, would appear to be moving slowly from the ground or in air.  Did we feel the wake turbulence? No because we were above the UFO, and wing tip vortices sink towards the ground. It couldn’t have been a bird either or balloon either as the size was just far too large to match the profile of what we experience.  We did not report our experience to ATC as we were very shocked from the event.  Looking back at my track logs of Foreflight, there appears to be a good 3 minutes of my flight data missing during the approximate time of the event. ((NUFOC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be serious-minded.  We suspect he is an excellent witness, and highly reliable.  We are expecting to receive a supplementary report from the student pilot, as well.  PD))",2021-03-02T00:00:00,34.151642662632376,-118.31696066565809

I was lying in my bed, looking out a window, when I saw a bright object in the sky. I had yet to go to sleep, so this wasn't a hallucination after waking up in the middle of the night .  The roofline of our house is such that the northern side peaks in the middle about 18 ft high internally and the southern peaks about 15 ft high in the middle. (We haven't actually measured, so this is a rough estimate.) This allows for south-facing windows that are about 13 ft up the wall in our central hallway. Not easy to look out, unless you happen to be in the master bedroom, the ceiling of which is vaulted with the northern roof and has passthrough windows about 12 ft high that provide obnoxious light during some moonlit nights. The house is on a hill in a forested neighborhood with minimal light pollution, so bright objects in the sky are very easily discerned. All of this is to provide context that, from my bed, I can clearly see the part of southern sky that would overlook Camden, AR.  I wondered if it was one of the Starlink satellites, but it was moving back and forth in a small (from my PoV) area for at least a minute.  The UFO was emitting a bright white light, and there might have been a bit of green, like planes or small personal boats have for determining movement path. I'm not sure the green light wasn't just a glare.  Because I don't have a telescope or binoculars, I couldn't determine the shape or size of the craft. When it moved about in different directions, an aura glare made me think the shape was triangular. I would not stage my life upon that guess, however.  If I had to guess, the UFO was several thousand feet in the air over Camden, AR, or further south of Camden.  I am a married, white 30-year-old female. I have never taken recreational drugs. I might have one alcoholic beverage a month at the most. There is no history of mental illness in my family. I have a B.S. from Texas Tech. I had my eyes checked in May of 2020 and had 20/20 vision; I've never had corrective surgery upon my eyes. I'm a night owl, so it isn't unusual for me to be awake in the early hours of the night.

We saw what we initially thought were three different planes flying in the sky, one small, privately owned plane low flying, and two commercial planes that appeared to be at cruising altitude. We quickly realized that one of the ""commercial planes"" did not look like a plane at all. It wasn't shaped like a plane, and it wasn't moving in a normal, uniform way. It also came from a very high elevation, to a much lower elevation, in an unusually short amount of time. I ran in to grab binoculars, and through the binoculars, I saw something that was unusually shaped (possibly diamond/triangular/pentagonal shaped), and there appeared to be 4-6 lights/engines/something glowing, eminating from the shape, but we didn't see anything that looked like a heat signature, or any other signs of propulsion. It appeared to be a silver/metallic shiny object. One of us thought the shape had a haze around it.  When I gaVe the binoculars to the other person, and I looked back, the shape/craft/thing was gone.  We only saw the single object, but the sky also seemed to have silver flashes occurring while we saw the object, but that could have just been glare from the sun. It was a perfectly clear sky, and the sun was still shining. The two people that saw this object are both college educated, and have professional occupations.

I was admiring how low the moon was, and the size of it, as well as the bright orange color of it, as it was in the west by northwest sky. After a few minutes of studying the moon, I noticed what came from nowhere, a straight line of what I thought was stars, they appeared to look just like the stars in the western sky. These stars however, were in a perfectly straight line, and were spaced as I would describe as Morse code (there were 3 equally spaced, then a gap, then 3 more equally spaced, and another gap, then 2 equally spaced, then a gap then 1, then a gap, and so on).  I could not count how many there were but I was so shocked by what I was seeing, that I opened the window to the bedroom where my wife was sleeping, and yelled to her to wake up, come look at this , hurry, this is crazy!!!. she came running outside to see what I was seeing.  When my wife saw it she was just as shocked as I was, and then we noticed that on the left side of the line of stars(south) was three more stars in a triangular pattern, then we noticed they were all moving. The long line of stars was moving in an easterly direction, and the 3 others were moving in the opposite direction, and they were all moving very fast.  After about one minute, all were out of view, my wife ran into the apartment and looking out the east facing windows, could not see any of it. We both estimate seeing probably about 75 to 85 of these “stars” My wife was as amazed as I was with what we saw, so she got online and started searching UFO´s and trying to find information, and she came across a photo and story from Austria 2020, that showed almost exactly the same type of formation of lights.  I told people at work about it and was told  “Ahhh, it´s just Elon Musk and his star link program”.  My wife and I are still questioning what it was that we saw.

I noticed something very different about this one. It appeared that a tube or cylinder was just underneath the fuselage.  Both were grey in color. 'Plane' was about 5k feet in the air,  flying due north from the ocean in the south and was about 2 miles from me. I took off my sunglasses to take another look and it looked the same. Some kind of cylinder was either attached or flying just under the plane. The plane flew  somewhat faster than the C130s usually do at low altitude. I watched it closely until it was out of sight . No noise was heard, no lights seen. It  was cold out and my windows were up. I've seen the C130s many times but this looked different...almost like a double image.

Suddenly we saw bright flash of light like a bright LED bulb shined and followed by other such lights one after the other in a straight line covering a distance of about 4 feet in the sky. as if the lights were placed an straight panel. The lights glowed 4 to 5 times in over at least 8-10 seconds. But we are very clear that the light from wherever it was cumming from the source was stable and was not moving across the sky. The source must have been very very far, beyond the comprehensible limits since we could not see any Object or any shape as such, especially since we could see a couple of planes flying much further but still could make the shape of the aircraft. But the light were pretty well coordinated and one after the other in a straight line. This 'thing' was placed in north! eastern direction and directly in a straight line opposite from the constellation of Roman Soldier's waist knife. when these lights were glowing a similar light band was at the same time displaying similar pattern and was near to the head of the constellation of the Roman soldier, placed almost in the 'true' east direction. This was also behaving almost similarly to the light in the northeast direction. But after about 8-10 second of the display no further happening, though we kept watching for another hour and spotted a few aircrafts and a couple of satellites passing by, but no such happenings. We initially thought maybe it was some sort of meteor shower but the perfect coordination of the lights in a straight line covering 3-4 feet in sky, at the very same spot and the simultaneous lights from two different places, a simple natural phenomenon dosn't seem likely.... still wondering what is that we say.",2020-02-25T00:00:00,,

It was at the level close to what the medical helicopters fly, however it was not on the normal flight path and was flying from a rural area that does not have regular flights.

I dont know how to estimate the altitude it was traveling at, but I got the impression it was higher than the commercial flights we see often.

That just lasted again for a moment or two, then it went back to its original size and brightness, and continued North, until it was out of our view.  It should be noted that I was anticipating the International Space Station to fly over. I have an app that alerts me when it will be approaching, and what its trajectory would be. The ISS was to fly over about 10 minutes after we saw the last object, and according to my app, it would have been traveling from east to west , much lower in the sky.

At first I told myself maybe it was just the moon, as it took kind of like a crescent shape from my perspective, however the moon was in a completely different area of the sky, and the crescent shape of the moon should have been facing another way if that was the case. I kept staring at it, the light was way too big to be any kind of plane or helicopter. Maybe 15 more seconds went by, and I watched the light slowly fade and dim. Not like the object had flown away... more like someone had turned off the light, and it slowly faded out. After the light turned off I was no longer able to see the outline of the object like I could before the light had come on.  I think whatever it was turned off it’s light first and then decided to take off very quickly.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,33.57603490701001,-112.19439241773964

It was a clear starry morning. I glanced up and saw what could’ve been a satellite (60% brightness from zero to Venus). Then a second one 2.5 inches behind the first at arm’s length. But then I noticed a third, fourth, fifth; all moving in a precise straight lined procession  due East. I woke up feeling quite groggy about a half hour before and thought I might just be feeling dizzy or something. I glanced toward the Eastern Horizon and could then see that the procession continued moving in a steady traffic in a perfect straight line. I swept my eyes in disbelief from the horizon to the edge of the roof above me. Heading from West directly East ,yet more continued at uniform speed in varying sizes and brightness. The flight trajectory of each light stayed on precise course but each individual unblinking silent star-like light wobbled slightly. More and more continued.At a single sweeping glance one could take in up to t! wenty five to thirty lights at once from my rooftop to the horizon. As they proceeded forward , mostly in single file but occasionally with a smaller light or lights keeping pace and flanking a single file larger light. The brightest lights were at 80% of what one would see looking at Venus. From the edge of my porch roof looking up at the steady stream coming from the West , a  minimum , at conservative estimate , of ten to twelve newly appearing lights would appear per minute . I went inside feeling rather confused...I wanted to wake everyone up. I grabbed a terrible quality cell phone /video device and started whispering into it as I focused the video camera up at the procession for about two to three minutes but stopped because I felt it was not picking up the star-like lights in the dark predawn sky. The Eastern sky was starting to show the lightened approach of sunrise. I went inside after literally seeing 150 ; minimum within a fifteen minute period. I felt that this! was a spectacular event and so I went inside, turned on the m! odem ,an d my computer and then went back out on the back porch. The procession continued in its precise straight line showing the brightest lights still as they approached directly into the brightening Eastern sky. At that time I watched the last in line following the long trail of moving lights. No more continued. I went back inside expecting perhaps to see others posting reaction or even news headlines about this event. It was truly a spectacular procession like some mass exodus out over the sea from a “Star Wars” movie. With decades of experience closely watching many other jets , airplanes , satellites , natural phenomena I could estimate from the perspective and speed of the straight lined procession that the lights were less than ten miles up. It was truly a spectacular display.Had it been going on all night ? I only caught it in mid progress after an unknown amount of time since commencement. There could have easily been eight hundred visible lights ( who knows how many very ! small ones only viewable through binoculars?) per hour all in that perfect straight line travelling due Eastout to sea if they had been as uniformly spaced and paced within my fifteen minute count ( overall viewing approx. half hour ).",2020-02-25T00:00:00,44.42349999999999,-73.0854

I was a clear evening with a high ceiling of cloud.   The cloud ceiling was probably around 500-1000 m high.  I was driving along the Trans Canada Highway No. 1 and passed over Scott Hill.  When the sighting started there was a bit of twilight left in the sky but by the time the sighting was over it was completely dark.  I was driving around the speed limit which is around 110 km/hr.  As I was descending Scott Hill, (Coordinates: 51°08'17.1""N 114°42'44.1""W) I noticed some unusual lights in the north east.  From my vantage point the lights looked to be hovering over the Shell Jumping Pound Gas Plant (Coordinates 51°08'08.4""N 114°34'59.0""W).   However, as I drove further east my vantage point changed and I realized the objects were located further east.  When I first saw the object it was more than 15 km away.  When I last saw the object it was less than 5 km w! hen the object departed.  What I saw was a sphere with a band of light that changed color around its widest circumference.  It was changing colour from blue, to orange, to green to yellow and back again.  The order of color does not matter I just remember that it did change color.  What really caught my attention was colored balls dropping from the sphere.  A blue ball would drop, then a yellow ball, then a green one and a orange one and so one.  The balls would drop at precise regular intervals.  The balls would drop for a few hundred meters and then disappear.  You could see around 3 to 4 balls dropping at any one time.  The balls would drop perfectly straight down with no deviation in path due to wind.  What I also noticed was that the sphere was situated below overhead cloud cover.  Light from the sphere and dropping balls would be reflected off the overhead cloud cover.  This illuminated could cover made the spectacle easier to see and notice not to mention impressive.  I continued to observe the sphere dropping those colored balls for around 10 minutes as I was driving east of the Highway No. 1.  It might have stopped and started dropping the balls again.  As I approached the interchange of Highway 1 and 22X the sphere was more to my left.  More north east whereas when I first saw it was north east-east.  The object was much closer and larger, and I could see that it was a sphere.  At this point the sphere stopped dropping those colored balls and headed straight up through the cloud cover.  It took only a second or two for the sphere to penetrate the could cover and it was gone.  What I noticed about the sphere’s upward movement was that it again straight with no deviation.  Movement was fast but I could not gauge how fast as the sphere disappeared above the clouds.  The approximate location of the last sighting was here:  Coordinates: 51°05'12.5""N 114°29'03.1""W  Date: The sighting happened sometime between 2001-2003.  I cannot remember the exact year.  I happened sometime during the late summer or fall.  Given the time that passed I entered the data as 2002 above.  Time:  The time of the sighting was sometime between 19:00 and 21:00.

It was so low you thought you could touch it with a ladder At around 7:30 PM in the year 2017 I had gotten together with a family friend to talk to her about life and a personal situation. Right when she came to pick me up and take her to her place I thought I had saw something. I lived near Denbigh when this occurred and so I see this light, and typically planes fly in, in the area so it isn’t uncommon. However, what made me want to go check it out was how low the lights were and how big they were too. It was like a big circular blob of light above a house that was just sitting there. So - being a science geek who loves the weather and studying stars and meteors I thought: “Okay, let’s go check this out! I wanna know if there’s a meteor or some rocket launch that I don’t know about over there!”  So we drive down the street at a low speed of 15-20mph and then we get to the school across from this. That’s when she tells me, “It’s not a star! It’s some plane!” We started to freak out at that point because it was so low like it was on top of trees and it wasn’t moving so right when we pulled up it started to move and I took note of every detail because I was so eager to take a picture that I dropped my phone.  Triangular like shape, black, round belly with 3 white lights going in a straight line, white lights forming a triangle, tiny red lights in between - too many lights to be a plane. Turned all of its lights off when we chased it and disappeared. Has been bothering us ever since! Please don’t discredit this information: I live in a military affiliated area - very heavily - and I really thought it was strange how low it was flying, the fact that there weren’t any jets getting it. It practically landed on top of a house, and from the side it was about 2 houses long - almost like it could be a house. There weren’t any wings on it. Chased it all the way to Warwick before it disappeared because it KNEW we were chasing it  When we tried to turn after seeing it the car stalled out which wasn’t normal either because the car was new",2020-02-13T00:00:00,37.09237713097713,-76.4911945945946

My step-son was outside with me at approximately 7:45 when we both saw 4 lights traveling very slowly (to us) in a row.  As the lights got closer they got larger.  They were red on the bottom and orangey-red on the top.  They made no sound whatever.  For help in your understanding,  I’m going to number them 1, 2, 3 and 4. 	My step-son ran into the house to get my dad and my husband to come out and see this, and they did.  The lights came from what I perceive as the north-west, going in a southerly direction.  Numbers 1 and 2 stopped and numbers 3 and 4 flew sideways and caught up with the first two, forming a perfect square and hovered there for about 20 seconds.  By this time they appeared about the size of a saucer that is put under a cup.  There was absolutely no sound coming from them.  After hovering there, number 1 raised up and flew west. Number 2 raised up and flew west also, but in a more northerly direction. The other two raised up and disappeared. I would estimate that all four had disappeared from view within 3 seconds.

They were circular in shape and appeared to be white or light gray in color. They also appeared to be three levels high, with each level represented by its own row of lights.   There was a white row with a red row in the middle and another white row on the bottom. They also had two very large lights in the center that almost looked like eyes in the sky. When they were hovering overhead, they remained lit the entire time. But when they started to get into the triangle and pyramid formations, the lights on the objects became much brighter. At one point, one of the objects was hovering less than 1000 feet above us. My friend got about four different videos. One of the videos shows the distance between one of the objects and the ground very well. The last video link I will list also shows a closeup of the objects extremely well.

I was typing at my computer, which is on the second floor rear of our house.  Something must have caught my eye because I turned my head to look out the window and saw a very strange object.  The object was about 8 feet  off the ground .  It was white and appeared translucent with sort of a mottled or other than just a solid white color face.  It was about the size of my palm and VERTICAL to the ground.  I could not see any propellers or anything else about the shape except that where about eleven o’clock on the face of a clock,  the edge was sort of bent inwards. I saw no propellers, nor depth to the object and it always seemed to have its face to me. (like a standing small plate on edge on a shelf)  The object first appeared from the right (west), at  the head of our driveway.   At that point the object moved up and down and side by side.  It then continued east but got hung up on the wisteria branches atop the pergola.  I thought, if this thing extricates itself, I know this is something, it did do that by backing up slightly then continued flying east.  I would say the time elapsed was 20 - 30 seconds.  But the disc was the same appearance at all times.  Everybody except the operations manager at the airport here, basically blew me off suggesting that it was a drone some kid made.  I guess it could be,  but my husband flies drones and I know they can be very small and it is possible this was a drone some kid made   (which I truly doubt) but operating in this area would have been tricky because it would have been almost next to impossible to have it in sight considering the closeness and density of this neighborhood.  I have never believed in UFO's although I have read and heard many stories.  I do not know what to believe now, except that the responses to those I have spoken to, (before this contact)  were actually rather insulting.  I feel relieved that I have done everything I can do with the contact to you.  I am an 85 year old female in good health mentally and physically.  I am a college graduate and have been tested at about 22 years of age and told  I have a ""very superior intelligence""  I am not particularly interested in science or technology, leaning more to the arts and history.",2020-02-13T00:00:00,43.5932,-70.2382

When I went out to my 16th floor balcony I could see two small white lights moving in semi circle patterns. The did not seem to be airplanes..as they lacked any other lighting..and were high up.  I believe that jets were chasing these lights...which were very fast.

I noticed two orbs of white light to my 2 o'clock position at approximately 20 degrees above the horizon  closely circling each other, falling rapidly to the ground, then rising again. When the two light orbs rose again to approximately 20 degrees above the horizon again, the objects merged into a single, larger light orb. Object was visible in same position for approximately 5 seconds, then the light disappeared, but the outline of dark cylindrical object was in its place. The object was approximately 50-100 feet in width approximately 1/2 mile away from my position.  The object slowly moved towards the ground, at this time into the slightly lower, landscape East of Interstate 25. Object again illuminated on the ground for approximately 10 seconds, this time with two, smaller circular orbs circling around the main orb light. These objects rose to a point around 30 degrees above the horizon, but still about 1/2 mile away from my position.  The object was in front of light cloud cover dotting the valley floor. The two, smaller orbs then merged with the larger main orb and shifted into only two orbs of light.  The two objects then moved quickly in relative position to my 3 o'clock position, being again 20 degrees above my position. The two objects then merged into a single orb, and again moved rapidly to a 2 o'clock position  and 30 degree position relative to my vehicle.  At this time I photographed the single orb using my cellular phone. Orb then separated into two distinct orbs adjacent to one another.  At this time, too, I photographed the two, adjacent orbs.  The two orbs merged into a single light orb.  This was visible for ten seconds before light disappeared and one dark circular orb was seen in its place. Dark circular orb then became two distinct lit rectangles, with a small lit orb circling it.  The small lit orb became a lit rectangle, as well.  I was able to photograph this, as well. The lit orbs, subsequent merging, elevation and movement, and shape altering continued intermittently.  Orbs and rectangles would appear and disappear. Relative activity was now more to my three and four o'clock position at 20 degrees.  At this time I could no longer continue to safely drive and take photographs, and switched to my cellular phone video camera, trying to aim it in general area so I could drive. I continued recording as I drove Northbound Interstate 25 to the US Highway 380 San Antonio-Carizozzo Exit.  I pulled my vehicle over at the end of this exit off ramp and exited the vehicle. Two lit orbs were still visible to the South by approximately one to two miles at approximately 10 degrees above ground, relative to my 11 o'clock position.  I captured very poor and brief video of this, then these orbs disappeared from view.",2020-02-13T00:00:00,33.8974,-107.02609999999999

Just then, we saw them shifting, moving, arranging themselves into a triangle up on the sky; then one by one they flashed a light. Flash, flash, flash.  Then and almost impressible light kept them connected to one another.  Like one of those laser sables from Star Wars.  It was there, but you almost couldn’t see it.  They were still there, when we walked back to our camp a few minutes later.",2020-02-13T00:00:00,34.15266052631579,-116.41924999999999

Well as I'm watching this object that only I can make out is a single white light, it is joined by up to 10 other similar lights/objects? they were all moving off to the south from the north I lost count of them as the first ones I viewed were going out of my view but more were coming in from the north all in! a single file they all appeared to be equally spaced apart they made no noise or at least I couldn't hear any noises coming from them, there were no other colored lights, only a single white light.

We turned our attention back to the singular bright light, as it appeared to change from it's original blue color to a flash of red, shooting small bits of light from it. On the western horizon, two crafts appeared, flashing very quickly and brightly. They flew together at the same speed(which was extremely fast), then slowed, and again flew very quickly. These two flew directly in the path of the singular craft, then crossed the sky to the second formation of crafts. At this point I became uneasy, realizing that there was an army of crafts flying above us, and unsure of their intentions. I went inside and begged my husband to follow. We were both in shock and trying to process what we just witnessed. When I came in I looked at the clock and found that nearly 3 hours had passed by, feeling like minutes. A few minutes later he stepped back out, and called for me to come. The singular light had now traversed almost completely across the horizon, and was sinking low, right around Mt. Konocti. It was unbelievable. I have been searching for other reports of this activity, as it was extremely visible and bright on a clear calm night.",2020-02-13T00:00:00,38.9678,-122.6477

It was way larger than a star and at 1st,  I thought of the possibility of it being the planet Venus, since it does come close to our planet around this time and is visible, however out of curiosity I decided to sit there and observe it and the 1st odd thing I noticed was how it had some sort of glowing iridescence from its upper right side.  As I kept watching, I noticed these weird ""spikes"" came out of it and they would pop in out of it.  The color of these spikes was like light colored except for some spikes that were yellowish.  I saw a passenger plane fly underneath it, although in reference, it was obvious that this UFO was at a much higher altitude.  I pulled out my phone-camera and held it in my hands so that it be completely still and as I was doing this, from my eyesight(which is 20/20), this thing seemed stationary, yet when applied the infinite zoom on my phone, this thing came on my screen that was whizzing around in circles...it was very odd. I was right the grocery store and went and finished my shopping and when I came out the grocery it was still there but had moved a little to the northwest.  I dropped off my groceries and tried to relax from a weird excitement I felt and decided to go back out see if I could spot it again. I went up a couple blocks and looked up and at 1st I saw a constellation of stars and then to the left of those stars I saw this thing again with those weird spikes and you could see how much bigger it looked in reference to the stars nearby, except this time, it was mobile and was circling in weave type patterns.",2020-02-13T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

I was driving south on Harmony Town Hall road between Rotamer and Wilcox roads approximately 3 miles northeast of Janesville, Wisconsin.  The sky was dark and clear, visibility was unlimited and the stars were shining brightly.  My wife and I both noticed two groups of bright lights in the sky which appeared to be similar to aircraft flying in formation.  The unusual thing was the color, all 5 objects were round and solid orange in color.  I am a pilot and very familiar with aircraft lighting, there were no visible navigation lights (red or green) nor any white strobe lights.  I pulled over to the side and stopped near the Wilcox road intersection. Despite the temperature being around 20 degrees (F) we opened the front seat windows and moon roof window to reduce internal light reflection in order to see clearly.  One group of 3 lights was at our 2 o’clock position moving to the left (eastbound).  The other group of 2 lights were at our 1 o’clock position moving in the same direction.  At arm’s length I probably would relate all of the lights size to that of a BB that was bright orange.  The two orange lights at our 1 o’clock position maneuvered unlike any flight formation would.  The trailing light, which was to the right following the lead light, sped up and appeared to either pass through or around the other and it became the lead light still heading east.  As they continued eastbound, the lights dimmed until they disappeared.  The following group of three, continued moving east and two of the three lights dimmed in intensity and disappeared, leaving one light visible which by now was just about over the top of our ! van.  With the moon roof open, we could not hear any sound from the light.  As it passed over, it accelerated to an incredible speed and disappeared towards the east horizon in a matter of two or three seconds. I could not guess what the exact altitude might have been of any of the objects, but my guess would be based on the angle in relation to the horizon when we first noticed them, I would say maybe around 3,000 feet.  The distance that last one covered would probably have taken a commercial airliner at altitude probably 5 minutes or more to cover.   I am a licensed private pilot and worked for 4 years as an air traffic control specialist (tower) at one time.  I since have retired from many years in manufacturing management.

Two friends and I had snuck out during a sleep over and were at a park, just after midnight, in central Jefferson County, Colorado. We noticed a Stationary bright light At about 15-20 degrees south of vertical. At the time it appeared to me as an aircraft coming toward us - as it had no lateral movement but was much brighter than anything in the sky. It kept this position for several minutes. As we began to walk back toward the house we were staying at we felt like it was moving with us (with my current knowledge, that can be explained as parallax). Then, from a stationary position, the light moved at a high rate of speed to the East and disappeared over the horizon in a few seconds without leaving any sort of trail. The horizon line from our vantage point was maybe 50 mi! les and depending on the “craft’s” altitude, could mean several hundred miles of travel for it pass beyond. There was little or no acceleration period to get to speed - it went from stationary to really fast almost immediately. Although young, I understood that what I saw wasn’t possible. I remember it vividly. Just never thought about reporting it until now. I truly hope it coincides with other data the UFO Center may have. It’s stuck with me throughout my life and, as an engineer, remains the only unexplainable thing I’ve witnessed.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

Possible large craft sighting. I woke up at approximately 4:30 am on April 19, 2020. I was staying with my family in rural, Alberta approx. 50km south of Camrose. I decided to look at the stars while I was up. I looked into the southeast sky. In the sky, quite high up, I noticed a light. It looked about the same size, shape, and colour, of a typical star—small and white. It was travelling in a smooth, gentle arc to the east. Behind this light was another light, following maybe 4 seconds behind. This second light followed the first taking the exact same trajectory and maintaining the exact same speed. A third light then followed.  At this point I left the window to wake up my father. When I returned to the window, small lights were still travelling in the same manner, making no deviations to speed or trajectory. I counted at least 12 lights. The lights all came into my view, or materialized, at the same point in the sky and then passed out of my view. I only saw three of these small lights in the sky at any given time before the east most light left my field of vision. The lights gave off no noise and all travelled in the same, perfect, trajectory at the same speed. This uniformity seems impossible to have been obtained by human aircraft. Additionally, travelling restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 crisis make so many planes travelling at once unlikely.  When the last travelling light left my view, I noticed three lights in the sky where the travelling lights had materialized. The two lights closer to the horizon moved erratically towards and away from each other in jerking motions entirely different from the smooth movements of the travelling lights. The third light, which formed an approximate equilateral triangle with the two lights below it, occasionally moved but primarily stayed stationary and blinked in no specific pattern  After watching these lights for a few minutes, I observed a large object travelling through the sky. I believe it also materialized from the same point in the sky as the others. This object had three large yellow lights on it’s bottom and flew from higher up in the sky to just above the tree line before leaving my sight. The object flew silently.  The next morning I google searched UFO sightings in Alberta and noticed a report on the National UFO reporting centre from an engineer in his 50’s living near Calgary, Alberta. This individual, 2 months earlier, appears to have witnessed travelling lights similar to, if not exactly the same as, the travelling lights I observed. He was able to ascertain, through his work, that no satellites were present at the location of his sighting.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

It was an incredibly dark night, with only the brightest stars and planets being visible during our trip. This is what first caught our attention when we saw a large, circular, bright white light moving across the sky.  It was around 2:30am pacific standard time when we saw the event. The object we saw was comparable to the size of a full moon. Just as round and bright, except no shadows, no moments where it blinked, not one blink or dimming moment from the time we started to observe it.  In comparison to the planets and stars speckled in the sky around it, it was probably 40x larger. The object was directly north from where we were seated. Our camping location was about two stories up on a lockout spot facing a mountain. The mountain is anywhere from 4,000-5000 ft in elevation. The flat side of the mountain took up 8/10ths of our view- with the night sky peering over the last 2/10th. Had we not had our fire facing that direction, and such little sky to observe, I'm not sure we would have noticed the object. The trajectory of the object started north of us from the other side of the mountain, seemed to be moving a bit to the west when it first caught our eye and then south towards where we were seated by the fire. We set out on a process of elimination for what it could be as we observed it. The speed, lack of any dimming or blinking, and size compared to the few items visible in the sky ruled out planet or star. Far too close in altitude and with no blinking indicators to be a satellite, no distinguishing plane lights, and zero sound or wind disturbance to indicate a helicopter. As we tracked it, the object appeared to move directly towards before hovering directly above our campfire. When it moved above us I had to tilt my head back to see between the trees. There was a single bay laurel tree near us and the object was directly above it, way in the sky.  The circumference of the flat white object didn't appear much larger than it did when observing it above the mountains, which leads me to believe its attitude hadn't changed, just direction. From there we didn't see it again. It appeared as if it moved east and out of sight but we had lost it.  At no point did the object dip below the horizon line during the time that we observed it.  Total observation time was roughly a minute- minute and 30 seconds tops. Not once in the minute or so from our initial spotting, to it moving overhead, did we hear a single sound. Not a single sound or ruffled tree.  We live in Los Angeles and have many helicopters and military plans flying day and night.  This was certainly not that.  No sounds, no blinking, no wind in the dead of night in the mountainside. Our camping location was above the east fork of the San Gabriel River, southeast from the Bridge to Nowhere. If you were following the east fork river to the Bridge to Nowhere this would have taken place on the east side of the bank above the closest mountain clusters. Generally this area is known as Sheep mountain.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,34.1748,-117.8751

Though he stopped me from doing just that...it was that close. It was about the same size as a minivan, maybe a bit bigger, it was more or less triangular BUT it featured an odd shape on one side that made it appear lopsided, like an additional lobe if you will, port-side, front was facing to my left. Hovering still we stood beneath it for maybe 7 minutes or so chatting about how strange it was that it made no sound and yet hung above us flashing its lights. Within minutes, something happened that absolut! ely convinced me it was man-made and not necessarily alien as ! it 1.exh ibited NO outlandish physical behavior apart from being quiet and hovering, which for some reason in itself didn't strike me as odd. 2. what really sold us was when it finally did show some life...the 'front' suddenly lit up not unlike the old hideaway headlamps on old american 70s cars? imagine that same idea..so, that seam that runs the complete rectangle that 'hides' the lamps? that lit up and there was a space between the fuselage and lamp 'area' where i could see the still rear facing now LIT UP lamps from under the craft, like a 6 inch gap where i could see inside the headlight area...then they 'flipped open' like a 74 corvette!  lol was so funny and so NOT high tech AT ALL. TWO huge floodlights now shown straight ahead of this vehicle. It then turned slooooowly on its axis..and headed away from us at a pace of maybe 2 miles an hour until it was out of sight..never gained altitude just drifted away over the trees and flashing its lights. I dunno, to me it was totally military...i felt like as we were joking aloud about being watched by the good ole Air force like a sick voyeur would, the lights popp! ed on and it took off real slow. Was cool to see though....something that looked to weigh tons just floating weightlessly right above you for minutes, quiet as a church mouse too.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,40.7752,-74.6824

At the time my GF and I were sharing a car. We were living in Glens Falls NY, and I was working in Wilton, NY (just north of Saratoga).  My shift ended shortly after 9pm and my GF picked me up. We drove to I-87 and took the Exit 15 on-ramp north, toward Glens Falls.  We spoke and I was playing with my phone. Shortly after passing the area where we had our accident a year before, we were in a lull in the conversation and my gf said:  ""what the f*ck is that?""  She was looking up out through the windshield and at the sky.     This is my Facebook post from immediately after:  ""(GF) and I just saw a UFO over the northway. Just below 16. Large. Low. Outline of lights that didn't blink. Triangular. Moved straight then hard banked quick.""   I wrote that post quickly, attempting to get all the important details recorded.  ""The Northway"" is the local name for that stretch of I-87, and ""Just below 16"" means exit 16.  To my memory (an important factor, momentarily) the event happened like this:  GF said ""what the f*ck is that?"". I looked up at her, then to where she was looking out the windshield.  Above us, just above the dim treeline, was a large black triangle. If I were to approximate a guess at size, I would say each side ran 250 to 300 feet, based on the approximate distance above the trees. The bottom of the triangle was faintly illuminated by greenish lights, one on each point and smaller ones (though my memory is hazy the more I think about it) along the edges. The faint glow of the lights revealed what I would describe (definitely inaccurately) as gridwork. The bottom was not smooth, but made up of parts.  The craft then banked to the right quickly and flew quick enough away to the south east that I would nearly describe it as disappearing.  The entire event took place over the span of less that 10 seconds.  Now, as I said, memory is an important factor here, and the more I consider this event, the hazier it becomes. I have trouble reconciling it with reality, and I often question if it ever happened. I know it did. I have a memory, though hazy. I have this Facebook post from immediately after. My mind just does not want to accept it.  Also, interesting notes regarding my gf; While spending time with friends and retelling this story recently, my gf mentioned that she never saw it. However, I watched her looking at it. I spoke with her in depth about it. We both saw it. She also expressed to me on multiple occasions how before seeing it, she was suddenly ""compelled"" to look up at that moment. On an ""instinctual"" level. However, since she has for whatever reason wiped the sighting from her memory, she now believes that she was compelled to ask me to look up, as if she was unable.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,43.0535,-73.7517

Entire event took no more than 15 seconds I live on the hillside in Ventura, California, so my view is all the way from the hillside to the Conejo Grade (101 Frwy), out to Pt Mugu, the Santa Clara Islands and all the way up to Santa Barbara. On Nov 27th around 2:45 am, I was in my Living room with my son when this light appeared.  The light, rather flat beam came down vertically it looked like a very wide flat beam of light.  The beam covered quite a large area; I would say half up to the entire length of the runway at the airport.  When the tight touched the ground (within a few seconds) the entire night sky lit up brighter than anything I have ever seen. It was very white and bright. My son was facing the window, I had my back to the window and noticed the room light up, so I turned and saw this huge, wide flat beam of light from the sky to the ground over the Camarillo Airport. The light became very bright almost white, then the lights in the house started flickering and surging. At that time, I turned away from the light and looked down my hall to see if the house was shaking, thinking that it might have been a earthquake. Frankly I am very surprised it didn’t blow the power, or at least the transformers, because you could tell that the surge was not a normal flicker lights power outage kind of event. Something was taxing the power. The entire event lasted less than 15 seconds. There was no sound from this at all. The sky was cloudy with rain, so when we went outside to look up there was nothing that we could see because of the cloud cover. The light was so bright, and it must have covered a good 10 – 15-mile radius. My son felt like the light was maybe from an explosion or bomb, and in fact for a split second felt as if the windows would blow out, but there was no sound. No thunder and lighting, no explosion, nothing, completely silent. At that point we waited to see if there were any police or fire department lighted cars or trucks going in the direction of the airport nothing. Got on social media (twitter, Instagram), to see if anyone saw it….nothing. turned on the local news ….nothing. Our cat was completely puffed up, as he does when he sense’s danger, or another animal around. As I type this a good 24 hours have passed, and we have not found anyone besides my son who saw this, which is even more baffling.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,34.29657455830389,-119.23991625441697

I noticed two orbs of white light to my 2 o'clock position at approximately 20 degrees above the horizon  closely circling each other, falling rapidly to the ground, then rising again.  When the two light orbs rose again to approximately 20 degrees above the horizon again, the objects merged into a single, larger light orb.  Object was visible in same position for approximately 5 seconds, then the light disappeared, but the outline of dark cylindrical object was in its place.  The object was approximately 50-100 feet in width approximately 1/2 mile away from my position. The object slowly moved towards the ground, at this time into the slightly lower, landscape East of Interstate 25.  Object again illuminated on the ground for approximately 10 seconds, this time with two, smaller circular orbs circling around the main orb light.  These objects rose to a point around 30 degrees above the horizon, but still about 1/2 mile away from my position. The object was in front of light cloud cover dotting the valley floor.  The two, smaller orbs then merged with the larger main orb and shifted into only two orbs of light. The two objects then moved quickly in relative position to my 3 o'clock position, being again 20 degrees above my position.  The two objects then merged into a single orb, and again moved rapidly to a 2 o'clock position  and 30 degree position relative to my vehicle. At this time I photographed the single orb using my cellular phone.  Orb then separated into two distinct orbs adjacent to one another. At this time, too, I photographed the two, adjacent orbs. The two orbs merged into a single light orb. This was visible for ten seconds before light disappeared and one dark circular orb was seen in its place.  Dark circular orb then became two distinct lit rectangles, with a small lit orb circling it. The small lit orb became a lit rectangle, as well. I was able to photograph this, as well.  The lit orbs, subsequent merging, elevation and movement, and shape altering continued intermittently. Orbs and rectangles would appear and disappear.  Relative activity was now more to my three and four o'clock position at 20 degrees. At this time I could no longer continue to safely drive and take photographs, and switched to my cellular phone video camera, trying to aim it in general area so I could drive.  I continued recording as I drove Northbound Interstate 25 to the US Highway 380 San Antonio-Carizozzo Exit. I pulled my vehicle over at the end of this exit off ramp and exited the vehicle.  Two lit orbs were still visible to the South by approximately one to two miles at approximately 10 degrees above ground, relative to my 11 o'clock position.

So I drive towards the light without GPS only following the Light. I drove for about 45 minutes. It turns out that the light was strawberry greenhouses. It was 3 AM I just arrived to this destination 302 Rue Water, Danville, QC J0A 1A0 only to take a brake. 1 minute before I arrived & stopped the car, I saw from my left side something bright appear in the sky making zigzag movements, so I started filming. As soon as I started filming, the UFO quickly went out of my field of view behind an electric pole. I started the car to try looking from another angle, and it was gone, or at least not bright anymore. I slowly went back home after this experience, it was my first encounter but surely not my first ! unexplained phenomena that happened to me.  I have a witness for my other strange thing that happened to me back in 2013-2014 before my father died. To make it simple, 2 perfect apples cleaner than any apples we can find and tastier appeared from I don't know where. There were to attach to the branches or a simple bush we had in our driveway. Every day, we pass by, and from one the to the other, 2 perfect red apples are there. When we showed to the parents they didn't believe, of course. If you, reading this can help me in any way I'm still looking for the reason and the meaning behind this. And we ate both apples as you can guess.  This is even more out of context, but I had very special dreams and experiences through my life. I will stop there, this is to report UFO'S, sorry if my English is not on point, I'm French. The phone I used from Apple in the period of time of the event is no longer in my possession, and I tried to connect myself to iCloud, but I can't. Which mean I no longer have the video, but anyway I was not even able to play the video! It was the only video on my cell phone that wouldn't read. All I had was a miniature of the video. If getting hands on that video is really important, I call Apple. Please note that I can only make and receive call within Quebec province. You can E-mail-me or text me or call me if you're close enough!",2021-05-20T00:00:00,45.7897,-72.0173

I did not notice the object until I reviewed the videos that I had collected on the sd card in my drone. I was flying my DJI drone over the green belt behind my house when my low battery indicator came on so I lowered the gimbal to look straight down while descending to the takeoff point. The drone was at 300 ft when it captured the fast moving object that looks like white slightly stretched ball although that could be motion blur. The object is only visible in three frames of the 30 FPS I was shooting in. The object is moving much faster then any bird or insect I have captured in hd. I recently watched a show called contact on the discovery network witch aired a segment of a very similar incident. A drone pilot was capturing b roll when he also captures a fast moving object. He also noticed it later when reviewing the vid. I believe have the same thing stored on my laptop and sd card.,2021-05-20T00:00:00,47.29995649484537,-122.18088288659793

The object was a straight line of attached lights and it was moving in our direction. The flying object looked to be made up of over 40 white lights and appeared to be about a mile long. As it came towards our direction, I took a photograph on my Iphone. The object appeared to stall as it moved closer and the lights could not be seen as well.

I was filming the sky doing my UFO studies when I witnessed a white light coming down from the sky.  So I gripped my camera and I ran looking to see where this light went.  One second it was in front of me, the next it was over my head.  Then the next thing I knew it was just hovering left to right it was a dome shaped and changed into a saucer shape and it just took off in one second and disappeared right before my eyes.   Right after that I saw a black helicopter fly over head like it was looking for something, and then I saw airplanes flying over the area in pairs of threes, like they were looking for something.   I believe that there is something out there and the world needs to know the truth.  Ask yourself in the middle of all this war why are they still sending stuff out into space that tells me that they are looking for something, and that they know the truth.  The Bible says in Revelations 4:11 (NKJV) you are worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they exist and were created.

On a summer night in 2008, my boyfriend called me at around 2:30 am crying and asking me to please pick him up because his mother was kicking him out of the house, again.  I told him I would be right there.  I was not asleep, nor was I sleepy.  I am usually awake until 3-4 am any ways (I am a nocturnal person).   I parked my car in the next alley, ran to their alley, and crept to their window to spy. I saw nothing, but could hear them loud and clear arguing, again.  I noticed my boyfriend's sister's car parked there, and I hated her, so I let the air out of her rear tires.   I got bored waiting for them to finish arguing, so I out of the alley, and around to the front house. I stood on the very right side of the front chain link fence, and I could kind of see through to the back yard's back house's t! iny kitchen window.  I got frustrated that I was not able to successfully spy.  So I got off the fence and, in boredom, looked up at the night sky.  And I saw a UFO floating perfectly in the sky!  It wasn't too close and not at all far away.  It was about the altitude that a police helicopter would be at if it were searching for a suspect, that should give you an idea.  The UFO was metallic silver, shaped like a disc but it had a flat bottom.  There were no windows, lines, bolts, it was clean.  I saw it immediately, and I remember saying ""OOh myy GOD!""  And it turned on: two red lights appeared on the tail, and a giant flash appeared in front of it, and the UFO immediately went through the flash at the speed of light.  All that was left was two red lines of disappearing light left over from the speed.  They faded away, and I was in shock for maybe several seconds, and I started freaking out, in a good way, jumping and running around yelling, ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!""  And I looked around to see if anyone else was around to see it.!  No one was. I looked at my cell phone and it was 3:15 am, and no one else saw it because everyone was asleep. I will never forget it.

The focal length was 24mm, which necessitates viewing the video in full screen and preferably in HD.  Two sections of the video totaling 46 seconds were extracted showing an object or light.  Other than that, no other alteration was made.  The original media is still intact.  A strong possibility is that it's a laser.

This is a correction to my submission last night.  There were 2 witnesses (1 partial) and 1 craft, instead of 1 witness and 2 craft. I've also included my email address this time around. I was sitting in a lawn chair looking up in the night sky not long after dark, when I spotted what I thought was a satellite to the east of me.  I noted that it was about the same brightness as the surrounding stars except that it was moving across the sky at the speed of the usual satellite in a SW direction.  When it was aligned in front of and above me, at about 95-100 degrees, it appeared to suddenly shoot straight down towards me at a high rate of speed growing larger and brighter (bright white) the closer it came, maybe to about 10x the size it had been, not any larger than a dime. I thought to myself that if it continued in that direction it might hit me.  Then about ½ way down it suddenly reversed direction and went back up to the approximate altitude that it had been, continuing on its course in approximately the same SW direction.  The up and down trajectory lasted not more than a second or two.  A friend of mine was walking towards me, from behind, when I exclaimed, Wh! oa! in regard to the object coming towards me.  He did not see the object until I pointed it out after the fact.  So what he saw looked like a normal satellite traveling across the night sky.  We watched the object as it continued SW with no more unusual activity.  So what was the object: a military hologram, an ET spacecraft, something going on with my eyes (doubtful), or what?

My first impression was that the sunlight was reflecting off this ""thing"" as to why I looked up. So as I was on the phone, I started to look where the sun was located. The sun was located over my right shoulder and house. However it wasn't a constant reflection. It seemed as if it was rotating sideways and every time it rotated, it would reflect or flash. I cut my conversation short with my Dad and told him that I needed to record something that was happening right before my eyes. They looked like 3D objects.  As I am making sure my eyes were not deceiving me and that something that I really can't explain was occurring.  Due to the fact that this happened about 6 yrs ago, same place, I wasn't prepared at th! at time because it was hard for me to record through my phone.  Those objects were white and it looked like a box with a circle on top but it was connected.  Those objects stayed on a smooth path across the sky, very low. My wife and daughter saw it with me.  So this time I wanted to make sure.  Once I figured out what I was seeing was real and unexplainable, I ran inside and told my wife. She was in the bathroom and we started watching the objects from the bathroom window. I then said, I have to record this! I then went back on my steps and thats where my footage starts.  We were just watching what these 2 things were doing and I was making sure to point out every movement to her to make sure we were on the same page. There were 2 objects kind of like floating and rotating kind of slow emulating each others movement to the best of ability to describe it.  Every time it looked as if it made a full rotation, it was either reflecting the sun rays or flashing.  All of sudden, one of the objects just floated up and disappeared leaving the other ! one look ing like a transparent circle, or sphere with a hole in the middle of it. As I am recording, you can see it move, blink, flash, disappear, reappear. At one point, a plane flew in view of the recording very close to this object. It looked as if the object took cover or hid in a jet stream that they were flying around.  As soon as the plane passes by, the object went into the clouds and stopped blinking.  After that, the object just stayed in that area and after awhile, it vanished within the cloud.",2016-09-02T00:00:00,40.550250322580645,-74.46203032258065

It then flew (or continued to fly) northeast across the western sky out of view.

I was watching for meteors directly above in the Milkyway, since it was a clear night.  The flash was so bright, I saw it out of the corner of my eye—a big ball of white light.  It immediately grabbed my attention.   I traced the object across the sky for over 10 minutes.  It moved in an irregular pathway at an inconsistent speed, flashing at irregular intervals.  Sometimes it appeared to stay in one place for a few seconds.  Some flashes were very bright—brighter than a satellite or planet, some flashes were very faint, and many of the flashes were brighter than the stars and comparable with a planet or satellite.  All the flashes were white light and of varying durations, the longest being about half a second.   The flashing object moved in an unpredictable, zig-zag pathway across the sky, moving from the Northeast towards the West/Northwest.   After about 10 to 15 minutes, I lost it through the trees.  The object had to be very high in the atmosphere, if not outside the Earth’s atmosphere. At one point, I witnessed a jet airliner fly directly under the object as it flashed, so it was much higher than an airplane. It made no noise that I could discern, but the heavy amounts of background noise could have drowned it out (diesel generators). It’s irregular speed and pathway rules out the possibility of it being an orbiting satellite or high flying aircraft. No civilian aircraft or space craft could fly like that. I do not believe it was any space debris falling back down to earth, as it would have left a trail and been a consistent glow. I suppose it could have been some piece of highly-reflective material being tossed around in the upper atmosphere (but what and how did it get there?). There’s no way it was a coincidental set of meteors.  Something that is also possibly related. Around 9:30 PM, my cat went completely nuts. Chasing none existent beings around the room like she went crazy. As soon as I opened the door to go outside and look for meteors, she abruptly burst outside and ran around the yard. A few minutes after I had lost sight of the object, she ran up to the door perfectly normal again. I am a person of science, but I cannot logically explain what I saw to any degree of certainty.  The entire event freaked me out, along with two other co-witnesses.  None of my colleagues have believed my account of what I saw.  I know what I saw, and I know it was not normal or something that will be easy to throw aside.  I know that this was in the most literal sense:  an Unidentified Flying Object.

I was returning home from work and I stopped at the end of the driveway to get the mail. As I was walking back to my vehicle a bright light caught my attention.  The light was stationary and straight east of me.  The only way I can describe the size of the orb is like a golf ball and the stars were pin pricks.  It’s like when the full moon is higher in sky instead of when it just comes up as it appears much more larger.  I was not scared so I stood and watched for a few moments.  It was a large white orb with a glowing halo around it. That night was a bit cloudy and the orb lit up the lowest clouds.  It was just barely above them. I could see the different shades of grey in them.  It finally dawned on me to get my phone. I tried to record it a couple of times but it would not work.  I don’t understand why it didn’t work. I have recorded eclipse’s of the moon before with good results.  Once I started trying to record, it began to move north.  There wasn’t any noise what so ever.  I walked to the front of my pickup which is facing the north.  I didn’t realize how close it was to being above me because as I looked down the length of the road it almost was perfectly in line with me.  As I watched it get further away I heard a familiar sound. The noise was coming from the northwest. I turned to look and it was a jet. I could see the red flashing light and it traveled at “normal” jet speed headed southeast.  I turned back to the north and just glimpsed the orb disappear over the tree line.  I wondered if anyone on the plane was seeing what I was seeing.  I calmly got into my pickup and drove up to my house. I posted on Facebook asking if anyone else had seen it but no one said they did.  I tried to look up my post to see what time I posted it but it did not say.  It seemed later than it should have been but I can’t be certain.  That night my 2 dogs kept barking and growling all night. Some of co-workers also said their animals were agitated that night.  The next day or so later I noticed a mark on my arm like I had blood drawn.  But that could have caused by a number of things I guess.  Of course this happened when my husband and son were out of town working which they very rarely ever do.  If they would have been home at least my experience maybe would have been validated by someone even if no one else believed us. The above paragraph is the second unexplained sighting I have had. It was quite a long time ago so I don’t remember the exact details, time, or the year.  I could possibly find out the year as I was not alone. My step-father, my younger sister and myself were returning from a basketball game where my step-was a janitor.  My sister and I stayed after sometimes to help him clean up the gym.  We turned on the road that brings us to our house and then we seen it. It was the classic disc shaped UFO with lights that went blinking around the edge.  I don’t recall the color of the lights but I know they were colored.  My stepdad and I looked at each other and he asked me should we follow it.  I said of course.  I remember being mesmerized and couldn’t take my eyes from it.  We followed it for about 3 miles.  I remember my sister being scared, crying and telling us to turn around.  She was very upset.  All of a sudden it just zoomed away.  It was so fast that it was almost like it was there and then it wasn’t.  My best guess as to when this happened is around 1987.  It had to be early winter as it was basketball season.  It must have been about 11 p.m. because that would put us in the right time frame after cleaning up the gym.  My stepdad told his co-workers about what happened and we received a lot of teasing.  But least we had each other and we knew it was real. Thank you for reading my story.  It feels good to tell about my experiences without someone looking at me like I suddenly grew 3 heads.",2017-09-21T00:00:00,,
White flashing light moving irregularly through sky.  ((anonymous report)),Mount Pleasant,OH,2017-08-12T22:30:00,flash,12 minutes,"Occurred : 8/12/2017 22:30  (Entered as : 08/12/17 22:30) Reported: 9/3/2017 9:36:48 PM 21:36 Posted: 9/5/2017 Location: Mount Pleasant, OH Shape: Flash Duration:12 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/136/S136028.html,"White flashing light moving irregularly through sky. I witnessed a bright flash in the Northeastern sky, followed by a second bright flash a few seconds later.  I was watching for meteors directly above in the Milkyway, since it was a clear night.  The flash was so bright, I saw it out of the corner of my eye—a big ball of white light. It immediately grabbed my attention.  I traced the object across the sky for over 10 minutes.  It moved in an irregular pathway at an inconsistent speed, flashing at irregular intervals.  Sometimes it appeared to stay in one place for a few seconds.  Some flashes were very bright—brighter than a satellite or planet, some flashes were very faint, and many of the flashes were brighter than the stars and comparable with a planet or satellite.  All the flashes were white light and of varying durations, the longest being about half a second.  The flashing object moved in an unpredictable, zig-zag pathway across the sky, moving from the Northeast towards the West/Northwest.  After about 10 t! o 15 minutes, I lost it through the trees. The object had to be very high in the atmosphere, if not outside the Earth’s atmosphere.  At one point, I witnessed a jet airliner fly directly under the object as it flashed, so it was much higher than an airplane.  It made no noise that I could discern, but the heavy amounts of background noise could have drowned it out (diesel generators).  Its irregular speed and pathway rules out the possibility of it being an orbiting satellite or high flying aircraft.  No civilian aircraft or space craft could fly like that.  I do not believe it was any space debris falling back down to earth, as it would have left a trail and been a consistent glow.  I suppose it could have been some piece of highly-reflective material being tossed around in the upper atmosphere (but what and how did it get there?).  There’s no way it was a coincidental set of meteors. Something that is also possibly related.  Around 9:30 PM, my cat went completely nuts.  Chasing none existent beings around the room like she went crazy.  As soon as I opened the door to go outside and look for meteors, she abruptly burst outside and ran around the yard.  A few minutes after I had lost sight of the object, she ran up to the door perfectly normal again. I am a person of science, but I cannot logically explain what I saw to any degree of certainty.  The entire event freaked me out, along with two other co-witnesses.  None of my colleagues have believed my account of what I saw.  I know what I saw, and I know it was not normal or something that will be easy to throw aside.  I know that this was in the most literal sense: an Unidentified Flying Object.

On January 4th, 2018 my husband and I were on a private jet flying from Seattle, Washington to Lakeland, Florida.  There were four people on the flight, the pilot, the co-pilot, my husband and myself.  There were multiple small screens in the cabin that showed a map of the U.S., the planes location, flight path, altitude and air speed.  About 1:00 pm we were flying over Wyoming.  Our altitude was 45,000 ft and air speed was around 520 mph.  The sky was a crystal clear blue and we were the only thing in the sky that was visible.  I was sitting in my seat on the left hand side of the plane looking out of the window when something to my upper left hand side field of vision caught my eye.  Sitting there, just as plain as day, was an absolutely enormous craft of some kind.   It was a dark dull grey in color, disc shaped with a dome on top and underneath.  The domes were almost as tall as the craft was wide.  I remember thinking that it looked rather “clumsy”.  It appeare! d to be motionless with no apparent lights, exhaust or gasses.   Again, I want to emphasize the size of the thing.  Allowing for a distance of 3 to 4 miles from us it must have been at least 2 football fields wide and almost the same in height. Once again, I must emphasize how completely out of place it looked!  Beautiful light blue sky all the way to the horizon and then this “thing” just hanging there in the sky.  Try to imagine if you tied two battleships together, squished them into the shape I described, and hung it up in the middle of the sky at 55,000 feet!   I called my husband to hurry over and have a look.  We both stared at it speechless for about a minute absolutely transfixed.   He then rushed up to the flight deck and told the pilot and co-pilot to come and look.  There we all were, dumbstruck looking out of the plane’s windows at something that looked totally foreign and out of place.  We asked if they knew what it might be or if they had ever seen anything remotely like it before.  Keep in mind, these were two seasoned, experienced, pilots who had flown for a very respectable company for many years.  They said they had absolutely no idea what it was and that they had never seen anything like it before.   We all continued to watch it as our plane passed underneath it and eventually left it behind.  The rest of the flight was uneventful.   Oh, we did ask the pilots if they were going to report seeing the craft, and they said absolutely not.  More than their jobs were worth, I guess.",2018-08-10T00:00:00,,

We have spoken with the father and son, but have not received a report, or other related material, from the son.  PD)) On July 2nd I received a text from my son who had just been found by AZ state trooper responding to a report of a dead body in a car in the middle of the Freeway 40 near Flagstaff AZ.  He was found unconscience with his feet sticking out of the passenger door window.  The trooper stripped him to his boxers and hosed him off to fight off obvious heat stroke.  When he came to, the trooper asked him how he got there and my son explained that he was chasing a UFO the previous evening about 35 miles south of the #40.  The trooper offered him a drink from his vehicle and told him that he would soon be throwing up red stuff (?).  He also told him that in the ten months working the area he had similar situation with travelers along that road about 50 times!  The officer never suspected drugs or alcohol involvement and stayed while my son began throwing up what he charactorized as red jello which felt like a softball in his stomach.    My sons dog was franticly snif! fing him and the officer stayed and washed away the red stuff so the dog wouldn't try to eat it.  The trooper personally paid for a tow truck for my son and drove him to a shaded area and returned later to check on his health as he was still throwing up, even when he first texted me.  He gave my son his badge number, name and phone number!  I've personally run into a few very nice officers over the years but I've never heard of anything like what this trooper did for my son.  And how did he know about the ""red jello"" stuff he was going to throw up??? The officer found my son about 8 hours after my son was chasing a bright, larger than 60 foot neon blue object that stayed just ahead of him as he tried to catch it with his camera going 100mph.  He said the object bounced around, left to right, up and down before rising high in the air and falling quickly near the road in what my son called a white explosion.  This occured at least 35 miles south of the freeway on the #290 (Lake Mary Rd.) and was the last thing he remembers when he woke up 8 hours later with the trooper dragging him out of the car in the middle of the freeway (@ 0945). After he was towed and left at a Petro station with shade he finally texted me and was still throwing up a bit until it cleared.  He was still too confused to drive but did manage to get to kingman much later in the day where he called me and told the story and answered my questions.  In my view, the most interesting thing is this officer immediatly knowing what the situation was, how to deal with it, and admitting he had dealt with similar things 50 times this year! My son managed to take a picture up the road toward the object but he initially thought nothing had showed up.  What is in the picture is what appears to be three different colored objects up the road just above the ground. He looked closer and said they did not look like what he was trying to photograph but the objects are annomolous in that they appear to be one object caught at three positions in the same shot; one red, one blue, and one yellow.  I have the pic and will find out if he has more. Once my son OK's this report I will have him edit the report if needed.  It may be the case that the trooper may talk but you know how that goes.  For now his identity should be protected for obvious reasons.   I'll try to see if he would be willing to talk if his identity is protected.  It may also be the case that the dead body report is on the website of the state troopers in the Flagstaff area.",2018-07-13T00:00:00,35.2633131147541,-111.52902404371584

It is now midnight as i write this and i am in Monmouth, Oregon. At about 10 PM, two hours ago, I saw three red flashing lights streak across the night sky. They were silent, as I was sure they were close enough, roughly an eighth of a mile away, and if they were a plane or a helicopter, I would have heard something.  There is a small airport in Independence (sister town to monmouth) where Cessna type planes fly from and around Independence and Monmouth all the time, especially in the summer, so I am well aware of at what distance I should hear something.  Over all, these lights just had a strange feel to them.  They also seemed to be moving at a relative speed as to what a Cessna would fly at.  Their lights flashed in a way that had a sort of Christmas light, simultaneous pattern to it.  If guessing, i would say they were about 50 feet apart and were all flying at the same speed.  I don't assume to know if they were anything out of this world, but what proceeded next makes me wonder if they had something to do with it and to be honest, briefly,  I felt as if a war was starting to happen or something. While the lights were almost out of my line of sight, after heading west, toward the east a sort of Thunderous sound started rumbling in the sky from the direction the three red lights just came from.  After approximately 5 minutes of the rumbling, with an occasional boom, I noticed a helicopter flying back from where the three lights had just flown.  As the helicopter approached from a distance I couldnt yet hear it, but as it got closer and at about the same distance I saw the three lights, I started to hear the ""choppers.""  All the while it switches from a regular white light to a constant red light and proceeds toward the east, towards the rumbling sounds.  At this time, the rumbling started getting a little more constant, with the bigger booms happening every 5 seconds or so.  This is all occurring while I am speaking with a friend on the phone relaying the experience, and on the other line he is hearing my phone cut out with static that seemed to correlate to the ! thunderous sounds but with a delay.  I could almost dismiss it as thunder, but it was and has been absolutely clear of any clouds today and also there was no mention of any thunderstorm on any news outlets so I personally am ruling that out.  The sounds persisted for a good 15-25 minutes and had a little ""grand finale"" and then all the sudden stopped.  That then left me with wondering if there was any firework show nearby but as I look online I can't find anything and am at this point just dumfounded. Wonder if anyone else experienced this and comes across and reads this.  Hopefully you post about it as well so I can read your perspective.  Cheers!",2018-06-28T00:00:00,44.7841,-123.3377

My “UFO” ground based sighting occurred on the early morning of September 18, 1991, while on Jekyll Island, Georgia, in an Atlantic oceanfront motel room by myself.  I was there as an employee of the United States Customs Service, attending a supervisors' training class with a co-worker.   On the morning of Sept. 18, 1991, at 3:00 a.m.,  I woke up sitting bolt upright in bed wide awake.  This was highly unusual for me as I have no problem sleeping...  I went out on the balcony overlooking the ocean.  The sky was partly cloudy with moonlight illuminating the clouds and waves.  I didn’t see the moon, as it likely was on the other side of the building, out of my view.  The hotel building or my room was situated so the at ocean view was looking south down the beach not directly viewing the ocean.  Within a minute standing there on the balcony, I saw a very fast flying whitish (same shade as the moon would be) oval shaped light about the size of a 1/4 full moon (LARGE) - flying overhead over the hotel building from north to south down the coast (disappearing within 4-5 seconds).  It didn't make any noise that I could hear.  About a minute later I saw another one exactly the same flying the same trajectory.  Then about another minute later I saw another one (or at the time I was thinking it might just be a satellite going around the Earth, but it was too big and too fast from other satellites I’ve seen...).  Then I saw two of these light flying side by side in formation and knew it wasn't the same one I had been seeing, then one zig - zagged and others flying slightly different trajectories, all from north to south, down the ocean coast.  All were the same size and brightness, going the same speed and making no noise at all.  In those 15 minutes between 3:00 and 3:15,   I saw 10 of these ""lights"".  I remember not being very excited by it all and was able to go back into bed and sleep the rest of the night.  I never saw anything in the newspaper! or on TV about what I saw and then as time went on didn’t think about it much.  Years later when the Internet was available, I learned that the Space Shuttle STS-48 was supposed to land at the Kennedy Space Center at 3:30 a.m on Sept. 18th, but NASA aborted or redirected the landing to Edwards AFB in California instead, citing bad weather in Florida.  Jekyll Island is only 180 miles from the Kennedy Space Center and the weather certainly wasn’t bad at all.  Years later, someone discovered a STS-48 NASA TV footage recorded on TV (from the STS-48 Space Shuttle cargo bay camera televised on the NASA channel) that was apparently recorded on Sept. 15, 1991, showing really interesting ""lights"" in what appears being fired upon from a ground based laser beam!  I wonder if what I saw three days later was related to that incident?  NASA called the lights in that video ""ice crystals"".   Why would we be using ground to space based laser beams (President Ronald Regan’s SDI program?) to shoot ""ice crystals"" in space?  Check out the ! STS-48 UFO videos.  What did NASA see on that same morning, which caused them to abort and redirect the planned KSC landing over to Edwards AFB instead?  My theory is the bottom of the “crafts” were being illuminated by the sun beams which had not yet made it to the east coast and if someone could model that, the size and distance and speed of the crafts could be calculated.  These things were not man-made… they were too big and far too fast for humans to have created them.",2019-01-17T00:00:00,31.0671,-81.4206

There we no other stars or planets in the sky because the sky was still too bright.  I thought it was a supernova!  I ran to our shed and got my telescope which is per-assembled and is covered only by a garbage bag making it always ready to go.

All three objects could be seen with the naked eye. As I was scanning the area near the white ball with my telescope, I saw another object that looked somewhat similar to a Harrier jet.  It was stationary and was facing me nearly head-on with one bright white light in the middle of each wing.  It seemed to be fairly close to the white ball.  We could not see the jet-shaped object without the telescope.  I have no way to tell how large or how far away they were.  After about a minute or two, the jet-shaped object and the big white ball instantly disappeared leaving the two smaller orange balls.  They would alternate between being bright and dim.  The orange balls remained flying around in the same area of the western sky for about thirty seconds before fading from view.  This whole event seems to me to have lasted only about 3 or 4 minutes.

Going left , then right as if searching for something, hovering in the sky.  When it did not get anything in that area it suddenly got speed and left a red trail behind for approx 3 seconds. The light now shifted to another area.  It was heading up towards a tower and continued to beep after every second.  The beep I refer is the continued disappearance and reappearance of light. Now it changed its colour to white for at least 5-6 seconds  and then again blue.  As it got near a tower, it stayed there for a while approximately 6-7 seconds and then it started to faint.  The light got dim and completely disappeared. The event, by my approximation happened a mile away.  There was no sound that came to me. This event just freaked me out.  Also this is not a joke or a hoax to be ignored.  Also I can well distinguish between a mysteriously flying object or some laser light. Wishing for your support.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,,

After watching them for about 20 to 30 seconds they merged together then shot straight out over the ocean at an impossible speed.  The light  abruptly stopped then split back into two separate lights before shooting into opposite directions, one going north, and the other going south at the same impossible speed.  Thinking the event was over we both looked at each other and said, “What the hell did we just see?”  Seconds after reciting that sentence I caught something out of my right side peripheral view, like a white see-through blur.  And the reason I marked three objects, is because now I was pointing out (to our right, north of us) a slow moving, silent triangle shape with three lights  (one on each tip) that now seemed to be about 700 to 1,000 feet from us.  Visually it looked completely different from the first two lights, but due to the blur that caught my eye, I believe we were still in the mist of the original event only now it was much much closer.  The only way to describe the movement of the triangle is that it looked to be slowly tumbling or rolling in the sky.

The object(s) do not move but occasionally you can see a small white rapidly blinking(pulsating?) light depart from under the main object(s) and ""shoot"" out in different directions, I have concluded that they may be some sort of probe?  We also see these rapid pulsating ""lights"" return to under the object(s).  This has been going on now every night for the past two months!  The main object(s) seem to be located at different positions in the sky from night to night but they are their! I purchased a pair of Russian Night Vision Binoculars on Ebay, when I looked through them you can see the shape of the object(s) which are circular.  You can also see the light source pulsating but of course with night vision goggles the lights are green but take on a ""glow"" around the object(s).  We do not know what is going on but this not normal.  We have thought about contacting the authorities but in fear of being ridiculed we have decided against it.

Which really shocked and excited me that he did, because I am usually alone when I see strange things in the sky, or people I am with just don't ever see what I do, most likely because they aren't paying attention, and as for me, my eyes are always in the sky! Even this time my friend wasn't really paying attention and kept looking at his phone but this object was so bright and low to the ground that it caught his eye.  I'd say it was at around the hight of the Mall of America.  Which would be illegally low for a plane to be flying. The object made no noise at all and I'm not sure how to explain the shape of it with one word but it looked semi-long, cylinder shaped with round edges in the front and back. Idk if you call that cigar shaped or what. It was VERY bright and glowing a neon green and blue-ish like meshing together.  Looked like something that glows in the dark but brighter than any glow in the dark toy thing I've ever seen. It was traveling north, the same direction I was and it came about very fast, seemingly out of no where. It was like its cloaking mode malfunctioned or noticed we saw them at which point it did not get far at all ahead of my car before it just vanished right in front of us, just dissapeared so I don't mean it vanished out of view. It just plain old vanished right before our eyes!  About a month after that event, I saw the same exact looking object do the very same thing, and also not too far away from the first time, but I was driving alone. So a few weeks go by and just last night I was at work (which is with-in just a few miles of the other events) and I hear my co worker talking to someone explaining what she had seen fly right above her while she was standing outside our work having a smoke and that the thing had vanished right before her eyes, right before looking like it was going to fly right into these apartments, and she described it looking exactly as what my friend and I saw. So needless to say I hopped in that conversation real quick haha.  These 3 events all happened in the same area within 5 miles of eachother. It is right near the Minneapolis-St Paul airport but we know what planes look like and this thing was most definetely no plane I have ever seen. I'm sure I will see it again sometime.

I live in the outside city limits of Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The area I live in has always had some strange things going on there.  Lots of old pioneer days history made there etc.  Lots of very old 1700's cemetery's too.  Anyway, I first want to guarantee you that my story is as true and accurate as I can possibly make it.  These sightings are absolutely real, and just begun lately.  I have seen several UFO's during my long life, and I know beyond any doubt they are real.  Yes, I have seen the proof too.  I work for the U.S. Government.  Around April of this year I began to hear a roaring-howling sound that seems to go over my home and then all of a sudden stop.  I thought it could be the city airport and such, so I let it slide.  I have never heard a sound like it either.  Then I woke up a night or so later around 2:00 AM, fully awake, and was just looking around inside the house.  Then I saw ""Them!""  Four Alien entities of some sort standing in my kitchen.  I could clearly see their reflections from the kitchen in my living room television window.  At first I saw a claw like hand, very long, and very black.  Two of the entities were very tall and skinny with very long hands, and solid black.  Their heads were round and very large with golden-colored slanted eyes.  They looked right at me and we had a stare-off.  I was too amazed to do very much.  Their arms were long and skinny.  I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing.  I've seen UFO's before, and now possibly their occupants!  The other two entities were solid white, shorter, and they were walking down my hallway to the bedrooms so I could only see them from behind.  They seemed to be wearing uniforms of some sort.  Solid white and humanoid!  I continued to look at the tall black Aliens and it was clear they were trying to contact me-let me know they were there.  After about 10 minutes they walked away through the walls!  They have returned two more times! so far since that first night, and I don't fear them for some! reason or another.  After 10-15 minutes they are gone.  They just stare at me with those big yellow eyes.  I could see no mouths or ears on these creatures because they were solid charcoal black.  Also, I keep the kitchen light on at night so I know they are coming there.  As a Christian man, this proves that there are things we just don't understand.  I was a probable ""Abductee"" during my early childhood years in 1968, but that's another true story.  Where these Alien creatures came from, and why to my house I cannot understand.  Maybe they know I am a believer!  I wish to remain totally anonymous for my own protection since I still work for the U.S. Government.",2019-03-14T00:00:00,37.0327077294686,-86.41964444444444

I was driving my girlfriend to her doctor's appointment.  Our sighting lasted about one minute or less. While slowing to exit from one interstate highway to another I noticed what appeared to be a metallic saucer-shaped craft high in the air.  The craft was north of our position at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I estimate the altitude may have been 10,000-15,000 feet (higher than a light prop plane, but lower than a cruising airliner).  At the time there was a sunny clear-blue sky to the north without clouds and unlimited visibility.  There were clouds to the south but they were not a factor.  I watched the craft trying to determine whether it might be an airplane but there was absolutely no discernible movement, nor were there any FAA lights, markings, noise or! vapor trails.  The disc was hovering and reflecting the sunlight.  I'm 58 years old, BS with honors, am familiar with military and civilian spacecraft and aircraft, meteorology, astronomy, and relatives from NASA, NSA, and Army helicopters.  This craft did not appear to be one of ""ours.""   After deciding for myself that the craft in question might very well be an extraterrestrial vehicle, rather than a man-made aircraft, I pointed it out to my girlfriend.  She observed the shiny hovering disc for about 15 seconds and came to the same conclusion.  My girlfriend also is mature, college degreed, and the owner/operator of an online store.  We both watched the disc hover, seemingly motionless, reflecting the sun, and then it appeared to vanish into thin air without a trace.  We scanned the clear-blue sky but the ""saucer"" apparently cloaked itself, raced off in the blink of an eye, and/or perhaps disappeared into another dimension of time/space.  We did not see or hear a! ny man-made aircraft in the sky in that direction at the time ! of our disc sighting.  Only the shiny metallic saucer-shaped craft. No clouds, airplanes or helicopters.  However, both of us heard a military jet fighter roar over our house at approximately 10 a.m. the same day, about four hours before we saw the UFO disc.  We live in rural King William County about 30 minutes northeast of where we saw the disc.  We have seen many black unmarked helicopters over our property, and occasional jets, especially in conjunction with other resident's UFO reports, but I believe this was the first jet fighter in a few months and we found it noteworthy since the fighter plane was monitoring our area a few hours before we saw the UFO.  Just a ""coincidence""?  There is an Army base with heliports and airstrips controlled by the NSA, including ""secret"" underground tunnels, about 30 minutes northwest of our home but the aforementioned chopper and jet-fighter flights are not routine and nearly always coincide with MUFON/NUFORC reports by other local! witnesses.  My girlfriend and I believe the ETs are mostly benign and it's the ""shadow government"" and military/industrial/intelligence complex that people should be concerned about. We believe the ETs probably monitor the shadow government facilities and vice versa.  We believe the latter information and opinion is relevant and should be considered in conjunction with our possible extraterrestrial disc sighting because of the unusual jet fighter roaring over our house the same day.  Note: Our shiny, reflective UFO disc sighting outside Richmond, VA, occurred on the afternoon of July 9, 2018 and I reported it to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) on the morning of July 10, 2018 (MUFON case 93248).  Then on the morning of July 15, 2018, I discovered a NUFORC case from Springfield, VA, about a shiny, reflective possible UFO disc seen in the daytime on July 8, 2018 but posted to NUFORC on July 13, 2018.  The NUFORC case reminded me of our Richmond sighting first reported to MUFON.  Bottom line:  Someone in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C, saw a possible UFO disc during the day on July 8 and then my girlfriend and I saw a possible UFO disc during the day outside Richmond (120 miles south of D.C.) on July 9, and a military fighter jet made an unusual pass over our rural home on July 9 about four hours before we saw the disc-shaped UFO.  All just a ""coincidence""?",2019-03-14T00:00:00,37.558607538635506,-77.50798002261591

My mom went out for the night and I was home with only my uncle who slept in the other room.  At some point during the night I woke up and was encompased by a tube of swirling light with little flashing sparkling particles moving around me.  I was being carried up through the roof and I was trying to reach for the blowing curtains or anything I could grab to keep me from going.  When I reached the ceiling I blacked out 'till the next morning.  When I woke up I could tell that something was still there, and I was afraid to open my eyes.  When it walked I could hear static foot steps as they walked.  Then there was nothing.  I finally had enough courage to open my eyes and I saw my mom so I looked around and was amazed.  I have never made my bed. My bed was not made when I went to sleep.  When I looked down, my bed was PERFECTLY made around me.  I asked my mom and uncle if they made my bed around me to cover me up, they said they had not. That is how I know I wasn't dreaming.  That day after, people at our pool and I saw a UFO being chased by 4 black military helecopters.  That is the only recollection I have, but my mom said we were both picked up together another time, and the day after I told her, ""They showed me music.""  The only thing I can figure is whatever writing they showed me looked like musical notes, because that is what I was learning in school around that time.  This is all true, I would be interested in going under hypnosis to recall more of what had happened.   I am a born again Christian and don't necessarily believe in aliens per say, but I know what happened to me was real, I would like to understand. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This unusual craft was brought to my attention by a person passing by.  I observed this craft with other witnesses.  I captured this on my tablet but it’s difficult to make out.  It appeared to be metallic, circular in shape, no sound, it had what appeared to be white lights on the bottom of the craft that would illuminate the under airfoil – the lights looked like the large LED lights you see on the big screen TV in stadiums for say a hockey game, and it seemed to be moving incredibly slowly. This craft had no navigational lights (red & green), no tail, no wings, no visible landing gear, no visible windows. Their were other aircrafts in the area that we could identify and see that they were from Harbor Air & they were fixed wing float planes that appeared to be diverting from the area. At or around 1504 the craft just disappeared. I have raw video in HD.  Some people who witnessed this event made all kinds of conjecture, saying it could be drones, could be “demonic” or “inter dimensional."" It sure didn’t look like a helicopter & it didn’t have any wings, no markings (identifiable call sign, company logo), no sound & the other aircrafts turned the other way, literally!  I am former student pilot from CZBB and I have experienced “unusual traffic” before but never have attempted to capture the event. Just happened to have my tablet available.  *In the videos the craft appears to be this flashing white circular small objet. It’s hard to see in the video but in person it was much larger & more visible. In the still images it’s hard to see but it too looks like a small white bright circular object.

About 16 years ago, I was with my mom, my stepdad (at the time),  my  grandma, and my sister, at a family orientation weekend put together by SUNY Delhi. My brother was going to be starting his first year of college there.  Our whole family stayed in a motel for the weekend somewhere between Delhi NY, and Walton NY, along route 10. On our way to the motel, about 10-15 minute down route 10 we saw a very clear, and very close, self contained, basketball sized, orb of light. It floated across route 10 right in front of our car. It came out of the woods on the left side of the road, about 30-40 yards ahead of us. It floated approximately 5 ft above the ground the entire time, moving across the road in a horizontal movement, keeping it's height, and speed, consistent to about 5 mph, or a brisk walking pace. It was dark outside so it was fully illuminated by our headlights, and clearly visible.  Since we were driving towards it as it crossed the road, it arrived a! t the treeline on the right side of the road as we were parallel to it in passing. I was in the back seat and watched it float off into the woods about 40 more yards before we were too far to see it anymore through the thick foliage of the Catskill region. Everyone in the car saw it, and we are all still extremely mystified by it to this day. It's nice to have had others see it also, but it's hard to convince people who haven't seen it for themselves. I also admit that I am particularly skeptical of orbs seen in the sky, or caught on cameras, and in photographs, even after having seen one within 10-20 yards, with my own eyes.  This is in part due to there being far more potential for misidentification with something so far away, and mixed in with other bright lights like stars, and planes. But this was as clear as day, up close, with the naked eye, and with 4 witnesses. We could, and would all pass a lie detector test with flying colors if asked about what we saw on that am! azing night. And to be totally clear, there is absolutely no d! oubt beh ind what we all saw that night. No optical illusion, reflections, flashlights, or pranksters. I still have hope that there will be some resolution to this mystery, even though it has been 16 years. I regret not coming forward about that amazing experience sooner!

They appeared as bright points of light, brighter than any star in the sky at their closest proximity to our position. They came as dim points of light from the north, grew amazingly bright on near approach, and dimmed fairly quickly after passing, maintaining a steady high altitude throughout...they dimmed to nothingness at altitude, not disappearing behind tree line nor mountaintop...therefore I’m thinking they surely must have been traversing at least in the upper atmosphere, perhaps at near-earth satellite altitude. The event took place in 20 seconds, no more than 30. Their speed? Impressive, is all I can say.  My first thought was that what we witnessed was a SpaceX satellite array.

The objects flew along the coastline north to south. From our vantage point on the cliff I’d estimate their path approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon. They appeared as bright points of light, brighter than any star in the sky at their closest proximity to our position. They came as dim points of light from the north, grew amazingly bright on near approach, and dimmed fairly quickly after passing, maintaining a steady high altitude throughout...they dimmed to nothingness at altitude, not disappearing behind tree line nor mountaintop...therefore I’m thinking they surely must have been traversing at least in the upper atmosphere, perhaps at near-earth satellite altitude. The event took place in 20 seconds, no more than 30. Their speed? Impressive, is all I can say.  My first thought was that what we witnessed was a SpaceX satellite array. But after some Googling I’m not sure:  Satellite arrays appear to travel in single file...it appears I’m going to need a little more research!  My wife and I are middle-aged professionals; sober star-gazers...but certainly not trained observers of aerial phenomena. I have tried to portray the gist of what we observed as clearly and succinctly as possible. I hope it is useful. We will check back with this website in the near future to see if perhaps others had a similar sighting. This was my first potential UFO sighting and first visit to site...thanks for the hard work and for being here!",2020-12-23T00:00:00,44.8129,-124.0568
"Two glowing blue objects with pulsing tangerine lights below, suspended absolutely still, in close view; dog agitated","Lake Kinderhook, Niverville Hamlet",NY,2020-10-03T04:00:00,rectangle,15 minutes,"Occurred : 10/3/2020 04:00  (Entered as : 10/03/2020 4:00) Reported: 12/20/2020 4:42:49 AM 04:42 Posted: 12/23/2020 Location: Lake Kinderhook, Niverville Hamlet, NY Shape: Rectangle Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/161/S161243.html,"Two glowing blue objects with pulsing tangerine lights below, suspended absolutely still, in close view; dog agitated I live on Lake Kinderhook, New York, in Columbia County. On the night of October 3, 2020, it was cool, so I built a fire in the living room. It was cozy and though a couple of lamps were still burning, I fell asleep on the living room couch. My Shih Tzu Tucker also fell asleep, at my feet.  At 4 a.m. (I checked the time on my laptop computer, which I hadn’t turned off), I was still sound asleep. Tucker woke up and started barking furiously. He only barks when someone comes to the front door…a squirrel on the roof, for example, doesn’t alarm him. He kept barking and ran around the living room and into the sun room, very agitated. I got up and turned the lights out. If someone were in the yard, I didn’t want them to be able to look in and see me. I then moved to the sun room and peered into the front lawn. I saw nobody. Nothing seemed out of place. However, Tucker was still racing around, barking.  I then moved back into the living room and peered outside windows on the left and right of the room. Again, I saw and heard nothing.  Tucker was still barking and acting upset, so I moved into the bathroom adjacent to the living room and peered  through the window into my front yard. From that vantage, across the expanse of my yard, in front of a white garage shed on the next door property, which I also own, there were two identical objects suspended at a height of about 12-14 feet, just under the shed’s roof line. They were small and rectangular, each about 5 feet in length, I’d estimate. They made no noise and were suspended in ""straight line"" formation, exactly parallel. They were eerily still and quiet. The tops of the objects were like very thick bars with very slightly rounded corners. They were a glowing, extremely beautiful blue. I had never seen such a beautiful blue before, Underneath each of the thick blue bars was a row of small circular “thumbprint” lights, a brilliant, also very beautiful, tangerine color. Those lights were pulsing gently, dim-bright, dim-bright.  Tucker was still barking and I was terrified. I was trained in critical thinking, and quickly, I went through a series of possible explanations. I didn’t think they were drones because they were completely still and besides, it was 4 a.m. in a rural area. Who would be operating drones at that time, in our small hamlet? Then I thought of a possible laser projection, but these seemed like solid matter, not holographic, and again, the complete stillness of the suspended objects seemed wrong for a laser projection. Someone would have had to hold a projector; wouldn’t there be at least a slight tremble? Also, someone would have had to project them from someplace on my property, and there was no one there.  I ran into the living room and turned my cellphone on, hoping to take a photo. This takes a couple of minutes, so I left the phone on a coffee table and raced back to the window. The glowing, suspended objects were still there. I did not hear any sounds, but both the dog and I felt hyper-alert at that moment, the way you do when you sense an intruder. I watched them in the dark, then retreated to the living room to get my cellphone. Before I tried to put it on camera setting to take a picture, I made a quick call to our local Troopers and asked them to do a drive-by if they were in the area. I did not want to go into detail and risk being perceived as crazy; all I told the dispatcher was that there were some blue lights on the next door property, my dog was very agitated, and that someone involved in low-level drug activity had once lived on the property and might have returned to search for something. The New Lebanon Barracks said they would send a car.  I went back to the bathroom window then, with my cellphone to take a photo. But the two glowing, suspended objects were no longer there. I did not hear any sound of their leaving. They were just gone. My dog had quit barking, but afterwards he stayed unnaturally close to me, clearly spooked.  When the Troopers came, we walked around the property together and saw nothing.  That would have been the end of it, but a few weeks later, the charge officer of the New Lebanon Barracks called to ask about my report. I had put the event out of my mind, but quickly recalled the events of that night. She asked, “Is there anything else you want to tell us about the blue lights?” When I reported the conversation to my adult daughter, she had the sense that there probably had been other sightings. I just told the officer her troopers had been very professional and thanked her for their trouble. I did not choose to tell her the extent of what I’d seen.  In late November, my daughter visited me from Manhattan. She also paid a visit to her college friend Kait, who lives in a cottage on my lane. Kait told my daughter that she had had an identical sighting a week or two later—but she had seen the still, suspended craft above a field off Route 9 as she was returning home from her teaching job. It was near a local landmark, Period Picks Antiques. The time must have been around 5 p.m.; in New York in November, it gets dark quite early. Kait had pulled off the road and watched the objects for several minutes. Then she drove home. When I talked to her later, she said the objects were the most beautiful glowing shade of blue she had ever seen. That was satisfactory verification, to me, that she had seen the same objects I had. Nine weeks later, I have not seen them again. If my dog had not barked and run around, I would have slept through the whole thing.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

It was so large that you almost could feel it’s movement, imagine looking up and seeing a blue whale flying over your head through the bottom of an aquarium. But it was invisible.

It appeared to be so massive. This is difficult to describe but I will attempt to paint a clear picture. I couldn’t tell if it was a wing shape, or if it was like a bell on its side, or like the USPS logo. It was invisible but you could see it. Imagine looking up at the sky, seeing stars everywhere, now cut out the shape of some sort of wing-bell-wedge shape and move it across the sky. It had stars on its surface. Bright stars. It’s like there was a television in the sky with a camera behind it showing me the stars. As the television moves the camera shows the stars behind the television. But for whatever reason the television stopped working and the stars were frozen in place on the surface of whatever i! t was. Does that make sense? It was like it had moving camouflage but the camouflage stopped moving. It was so massive that its movement was absolutely apparent. it look like someone took a photo of the sky, with stars, and wrapped it around an airplane.  It was too close. It wasn’t an accident, it wasn’t like a crash or something. It was right where it wanted to be and it was moving right above us and headed to my right. It was totally silent.  It wasn’t something like you see on television, it wasn’t a far away dot or a trash can floating two miles away. It was a car, a house, or a cruise ship sized object. It was so large that you almost could feel it’s movement, imagine looking up and seeing a blue whale flying over your head through the bottom of an aquarium. But it was invisible. You could see the stars through it but for some reason the stars on its surface froze or stopped moving  and when they did it exposed this massive hulking monolithic vague shape of moving stars crushing just over head.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,39.01482293577982,-94.28685825688073

Much higher than any aircraft. It was moving rapidly from the northeast to directly overhead. My first thought was a satellite. My second thought said it was traveling much too fast and deliberate to be a satellite. As I continued to follow it, suddenly a second small white dot appeared, in my binoculars field of view, coming from the exact opposite horizon, the southwest, and was traveling at what appeared to be the exact same rate of speed as the other white dot.  I then was remarkably able to view both white dots, traveling at the same rate of speed, directly opposing each other and on what appeared to be a collision course. I then had an odd thought that they were aware of each other and weirdly I fe! lt connected.  Very strange feeling.  They continued along a direct collision course and at the moment they reached each other they very quickly (literally in a moment) looped around each other in extremely close proximity as if they were playing and then each white dot preceded back in the opposite direction that it came from. I was able to watch both and as one disappeared from my binoculars field of view I continued to follow and watch the original one as far as I could until it disappeared over the Northeast horizon.  This entire viewing only lasted between 30 and 45 seconds.  Amazing to me is out of all the stars present in this clear night sky during this event, these two small specs appeared crystal clear to me and as though they were communicating to me.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,47.8988,-119.9986

The formation was by no means sloppy but I did notice it was somewhat fluid, as the objects did not remain perfectly equidistant among themselves in the “V” flight pattern, as say a precision team of fighter pilots at an air show would, nor did they maintain perfect symmetry in the two individual leading lines of the “v” formation, as a few individual members of the formation drifted ever so slightly ahead of their flanks. This fluidity made it obvious that what we witnessed was not one large “V” shaped craft with 20 to 25 lights, but indeed a formation composed of 20 to 25 individual members. Their appearance and passing was completely and utterly silent. The event occurred approximately 2 hours after a fairly low tide and the night was still, ! so there was no crashing surf nor wind, and therefore no ambient natural sounds to drown out the sounds of jet engines or sonic booms - - this event, and these objects, were completely silent.  The objects flew along the coastline north to south. From our vantage point on the cliff I’d estimate their path approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon. They appeared as bright points of light, brighter than any star in the sky at their closest proximity to our position. They came as dim points of light from the north, grew amazingly bright on near approach, and dimmed fairly quickly after passing, maintaining a steady high altitude throughout...they dimmed to nothingness at altitude, not disappearing behind tree line nor mountaintop...therefore I’m thinking they surely must have been traversing at least in the upper atmosphere, perhaps at near-earth satellite altitude. The event took place in 20 seconds, no more than 30. Their speed? Impressive, is all I can say.  My first thought was that what we witnessed was a SpaceX satellite array. But after some Googling I’m not sure:  Satellite arrays appear to travel in single file...it appears I’m going to need a little more research!  My wife and I are middle-aged professionals; sober star-gazers...but certainly not trained observers of aerial phenomena. I have tried to portray the gist of what we observed as clearly and succinctly as possible. I hope it is useful.

I then went down the street to the closest patch of grass to throw some in the air to check wind direction. The wind was blowing southwest and these UFO’s were headed northeast.

It was one week ago today, Friday 8/7/20 at 4:30 am that I witnessed what I believe to be my first ever UFO sighting. I got out of bed at this early hour to check on my girlfriend who sometimes stays up late and falls asleep on the couch in the living room. I saw her standing at the dining room window peering outside with her cell phone in hand. I thought this was strange and said, “Honey, what are you doing?” She replied, “I’m looking at this ‘thing’ in the sky.” I was still half asleep and did not think much about it but obviously she was extremely interested in trying to find this thing as it disappeared behind a large tree. When asked to describe what she had seen she stated that she got up to go to bed and a bright light was visible in the sky outside the window. She said she thought it was the recent comet that attracted so much attention but soon found out that it was an airplane light as it slowly turned to reveal itself a few miles away. That is when she said she noticed the object in the sky off to the left of the aircraft. We both stood watching the dark sky to see if we could catch a glimpse of something. After a minute or so a long, cigar shaped object appeared in the sky from the tree which it had passed behind. It was silver in color and somewhat hard to see if you did not know what part of the sky to look. Against the dark, overcast sky we could both clearly see the silver object with the naked eye although it was very difficult to detect through the phone to get video. I estimated the object to be at least the length of a football field, maybe longer. It resembled many of the cylinder or cigar shaped craft that I later Googled online from other reports over the years. It was simply a long tube-length craft without a single light upon it moving very slowly across the sky from west to east in the Scappoose, OR sky. It was not particularly high in the sky, maybe 1,000 ft and when viewed from our residence I estimate it to be not quite a 45-degree angle at approximately 2-3 miles away. At this point I was wide awake and running through possibilities in my head of what this object could be: a blimp? A flock of geese? Not even close. This was not like anything I had ever witnessed, and I have been around aircraft and interested in aviation my entire life, been to countless airshows and very much interested in military aviation. Again, this was like nothing I had ever witnessed. As it moved across the sky the leading part of the craft began to go nose-down much like a helicopter taking off, but the craft did not descend or gain altitude. It remained at a constant altitude and this was not a helicopter. Apart from the appearance and behavior of the object what struck me as the most peculiar was that it had no visible lights to it whatsoever. Nothing. I thought, “What aircraft is flying in the sky that has no discernable lights to alert anyone that there is an aircraft flying in that sector?” None. That is what I kept coming back to that the long cigar shaped d! esign. We both looked at each other and said as it passed into the hazy overcast from view, “I think we just saw a UFO!” I estimate that the total time we observed this object was approximately 2-3minutes.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,45.8002,-122.9735

I looked up, and I start shaking I have never in my life seen something so enormous & clear. It looked like it was out of a movie, it took me a while to start taking because I was so nervous, so the camera footage is when we had moved some distance away. It was foggy & windy, but so clearly the shape was an upper circular dome and a lower circular dome then a huge flat circular disk around it. There was lights around the entire disk and then a bright one on the top of the upper dome. The bottom dome had a red light that was explosive & twice the bottom seemed to explode with red light and a strong fat light beam would shoot from the bottom then suck itself back in. Almost like a huge smoke cloud explosion that shoots in a straight beam then back in as if someone was rewinding it back in. It’s! so hard to explain. And it traveled very level with me the whole time I taped and eventually we kept driving it drifted into the fog. The shape, size, light activity, structure, beam are nothing I have ever seen in my entire lift!!!

I’m showing off my astronomy skills so my girlfriend asks “what is that star?” I look at it and it’s really really high up to be a plane or a helicopter. It was whiteish with seemingly red flashes. I must have been staring at it for ten straight minutes and it begins dancing in the sky! It still look like a star at this point but the movements were totally unnatural, up, down, left, sideways, diaganol, and the speeds it must have been moving at weren’t possible.  That’s when it happened. As we’re staring at the first UFO, a second UFO appears hovering maybe two streets behind our house, at a height of a 4 story building. We got an incredible view of it because it has flown so close. My best description would be that it looked Roomba (robot vacuum cleaner) hovering in the air. It was too dark to accurately report a color. Looked darker and metallic maybe. It was circular and seemingly to totally flat! on top and bottom. I would guesstimate that it wasn’t very large, maybe the size of a small circular coffee table.  It wasn’t rotating at all. I could tell because it had this bright blinking red light like a security camera and some dimmer white lights built in, but the lights weren’t spinning and the red flashing light was aimed right at us the entire time. This creeped us out because it almost looked like it knew we were looking and was looking back at us. Moving so so slow through the sky. At first I thought a neighbor kid might have a drone, but as it did a fly by, I quickly realized no drone would look like that. There were no propellor, a very light whooshhhhhhhhh sound was made, and it glided through the air but so so slowly. Felt like 5 mph. This part of the experience last 2 minutes or so, but it was enough to scare us to go inside. I looked over at my girlfriend and we (sane and rational intellectuals) both sat there trying to grasp what we just witnessed. It re! ally didn’t feel real. After a few minutes, a collection of ab! out 3 mo re star looking lights appeared in the sky. Again, very high in the sky, red/white in color, variations of different movements but mostly stationary.  Background: Me: Male, 28, Pennsylvania.

The formation was by no means sloppy but I did notice it was somewhat fluid, as the objects did not remain perfectly equidistant among themselves in the “V” flight pattern, as say a precision team of fighter pilots at an air show would, nor did they maintain perfect symmetry in the two individual leading lines of the “v” formation, as a few individual members of the formation drifted ever so slightly ahead of their flanks. This fluidity made it obvious that what we witnessed was not one large “V” shaped craft with 20 to 25 lights, but indeed a formation composed of 20 to 25 individual members. Their appearance and passing was completely and utterly silent. The event occurred approximately 2 hours after a fairly low tide and the night was still, ! so there was no crashing surf nor wind, and therefore no ambient natural sounds to drown out the sounds of jet engines or sonic booms - - this event, and these objects, were completely silent.  The objects flew along the coastline north to south. From our vantage point on the cliff I’d estimate their path approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon. They appeared as bright points of light, brighter than any star in the sky at their closest proximity to our position. They came as dim points of light from the north, grew amazingly bright on near approach, and dimmed fairly quickly after passing, maintaining a steady high altitude throughout...they dimmed to nothingness at altitude, not disappearing behind tree line nor mountaintop...therefore I’m thinking they surely must have been traversing at least in the upper atmosphere, perhaps at near-earth satellite altitude. The event took place in 20 seconds, no more than 30. Their speed? Impressive, is all I can say.  My first thought was that what we witnessed was a SpaceX satellite array. But after some Googling I’m not sure:  Satellite arrays appear to travel in single file...it appears I’m going to need a little more research!  My wife and I are middle-aged professionals; sober star-gazers...but certainly not trained observers of aerial phenomena. I have tried to portray the gist of what we observed as clearly and succinctly as possible. I hope it is useful.

The oblong spherical object was glowing white with seemingly its own energy force circulating within it.  No sound, no colo! red lights, no vapor trail.  You could see through it in the energy ripple.  It then began to travel North.  We watched it for about 20 minutes, and then it moved skyward as last we saw it.  It was not threatening.  It had to be massive for us to be able to see it that well from such a long distance.  Occasionally it moved quickly, and I have no doubt it could have departed from our sight, but wanted to be seen.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,37.2983,-86.0835

The sky was very clear and the stars were easily identified. My daughter was the first to see the light in the sky. She began pointing to the sky and yelling ""moon, mommy, moon""! When I looked up, at first I thought she was right... but this big  bright white object above was cruising towards us. It was a circle shaped, bright white light moving quickly through the sky above us. Occasionally, I could see colors flash around it that would illuminate the entire circle... green, and then in an orangish-red.  Occasionally, it looked like a white streak or 2 separate white lights but it would change in the blink of an eye. Immediately I took out my phone and began filming.  The dog I was walking is a well trained Belgian Malinois. I commanded him to sit prior to recording. He did, but it was brief and he began to pull me during the video. He never does this. He was not comfortable sitting still during these moments and I could fully sense it.  I watched, and recorded,the object for a little over a minute, until I had to put the phone down in order to tend to my dog.  When I looked up seconds later, the object was gone. It came from the NW and was flying SW.  It flew quickly, but steadily.  It was close enough that I could immediately rule out a plane, helicopter, etc. The video I took is shaky at times, with my dog pulling, but there is also some great footage that, when stopped and cropped, leaves no doubt for me that what I witnessed was a UFO.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,39.79513762886598,-89.66251786941581

It looked to be over the area of Mopang Lake, north of route 9 in Beddington.  It moved up and down, left to right at pretty fast speeds. It was able to change opposite directions at max speed.  It would move north eventually disappearing from sight, only to come back a few minutes later.  The family was terrified and wanted to go back to the camp but I insisted on staying to watch.  After about 15 minutes of observing, my fiancé and son announced seeing another object to the East.  It was a little bigger which I think means it was probably closer.  It also appeared to have an orangish color to it.  It too would zig zag around almost as if it were surveying an area.  Both objects eventually moved off in the distance.  Also during this sighting a large and intense white flash was seen in the sky above us.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,,

We looked down toward the ground and didn't see it but a woman who rented a home from him witnessed the single  red ball coming from his house crossing the road in front of her car. She called him immediately and asked him what  was going on at his house and described the red ball. The next day dad saw a skinny figure with big eyes aprox 2 ft tall standing at the end of his couch. It vanished when he looked directly at it. He was embarrassed  to report it. He told family and a few others. He also a similar red ball near Mineral Springs Middle school in Ellerbe moving in a popping motion along the side of the road then crossed over the road moving southward. He has had other strange sightings and actually thinks he was picked on the shoulder while he was lying on his couch. My stepmom told him she hadn't poked him( tapped his shoulder).

On the night of August 20th, 2020 my girlfriend and I were leaving my house to her apartment around 9:15 or so.  As we left my house, which is on top of a hill, I noticed a long string of lights flashing in odd patterns sitting in the sky.  As we noticed it, we stopped my car on top of the hill and watched it.  It continually changed the pattern in which it flashed its light, it almost looked as if it was communicating in morse code or something like that. Eventually, the object slowly lowered and disappeared.  We did not see it again. We kept driving to see if we could find it again but it was gone…  However, as we did keep driving my girlfriend noticed two more solid colored bright lights sitting in the air. They sat near each other motionless except for slight rotation.  Slowly one drifted away from the other toward the right and we could make out a box looking shape with two flashing lights on opposing corners and two solid lights on the other two.  This object! made no noise and disappeared behind a building.  Simultaneously, the other object remained perfectly still in its original location until it seemed to slowly rise and start hovering ever so slowly toward us. We watched it come closer and take the form of a disc with two large lights in the middle and two smaller lights on the edges. It continued to approach us noiseless until it came right over our heads. At this point, I could see it was no longer a disc but a boomerang shape with one light in the center and another two lights, one on each point. It made no noise at all. As it hovered over me, still noiseless, it maintained its boomerang shape and then suddenly I saw a tail and it was a plane. The essence of it was eerie almost like it changed its shape upon approachment. My take on this scenario is that either this was a plane and it was after the original UFO, it was a UFO with shape shifting capabilities, or the US government has antigravity technology as this object/p! lane hovered over one spot for over 10 minutes before hovering! slowly and noiselessly.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,29.488865917141535,-98.4752404435546

Every sphere resembled a soap bubble, except they were all perfectly uniform, perfectly sphere, crystal clear.  As the swarm rose higher, the group of about 30 orbs began to form two seperate clusters.  They then became either much more reflective of the sun at a higher altitude, or, they possibly began to emit their own bioluminescence or possibly mechanical light; as they became much brighter as opposed to translucent.  Once they had achieved an altitude at about twice the height a drone would fly, the objects then began doing 'maneuvers', and forming geometric shapes and patterns such as triangles, 90°angles etc. By the time myself and a second witness ran inside to grab a better camera and return, the sighting was over.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

We had been outside for several hours.  We were looking over a large clearing in the valley of two large mountains when all at once we both witnessed a orb of light come over the mountains and drop into the valley about a mile away-directly in front of us. Within a second it flashed directly in front of us about thirty yards away. Within another second or two it passed our position before turning back to us. It hesitated directly in front of us again about twenty yards away before zipping directly opposite our position and back over the mountain.  The event lasted about 6-8 seconds and it was over. It reminded me of watch fire flies in the back yard. Only these orbs were larger and coveri! ng large distances between flashes. They were about the size of a golf ball. They would flash in one spot and then flash again within a second somewhere else Covering large areas at a time. You could see a slight tail of light behind it giving the eye a sense of direction when it flashed as it was traveling. Other than the slight tail, it was basically a flash of light in the shape of a round ball. The color was about the same color as the stars; a light blueish-white color. We were both surprised and amazed at what just happened in front of our eyes. The size is somewhat confusing because it is hard to place its size to scale. That’s because the country behind it was so big, and the distance it was coving was so large. He is fourteen years old and I know it made a huge impact on his life.. At the time of the encounter, we  were having a conversation about the stars, life in outer space, and religion.

The area I live in has always had some strange things going on there.  Lots of old pioneer days history made there etc.  Lots of very old 1700's cemetery's too.  Anyway, I first want to guarantee you that my story is as true and accurate as I can possibly make it.  These sightings are absolutely real, and just begun lately.  I have seen several UFO's during my long life, and I know beyond any doubt they are real.  Yes, I have seen the proof too.  I work for the U.S. Government.  Around April of this year I began to hear a roaring-howling sound that seems to go over my home and then all of a sudden stop.  I thought it could be the city airport and such, so I let it slide.  I have never heard a sound like it either.  Then I woke up a night or so later around 2:00 AM, fully awake, and was just looking around inside the house.  Then I saw ""Them!""  Four Alien entities of some sort standing in my kitchen.  I could clearly see their reflections from the kitchen in my living room television window.  At first I saw a claw like hand, very long, and very black.  Two of the entities were very tall and skinny with very long hands, and solid black.  Their heads were round and very large with golden-colored slanted eyes.  They looked right at me and we had a stare-off.  I was too amazed to do very much.  Their arms were long and skinny.  I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing.  I've seen UFO's before, and now possibly their occupants!  The other two entities were solid white, shorter, and they were walking down my hallway to the bedrooms so I could only see them from behind.  They seemed to be wearing uniforms of some sort.  Solid white and humanoid!  I continued to look at the tall black Aliens and it was clear they were trying to contact me-let me know they were there.  After about 10 minutes they walked away through the walls!  They have returned two more times! so far since that first night, and I don't fear them for some! reason or another.   After 10-15 minutes they are gone.  They just stare at me with those big yellow eyes.  I could see no mouths or ears on these creatures because they were solid charcoal black.  Also, I keep the kitchen light on at night so I know they are coming there.  As a Christian man, this proves that there are things we just don't understand.  I was a probable ""Abductee"" during my early childhood years in 1968, but that's another true story.  Where these Alien creatures came from, and why to my house I cannot understand.  Maybe they know I am a believer!  I wish to remain totally anonymous for my own protection since I still work for the U.S. Government.",2019-09-06T00:00:00,37.0327077294686,-86.41964444444444

The object was first noticed at the zenith.  The first flash was of approximately -6 magnitude brightness and lasted 3 seconds.  So far this seemed normal for a rotating solar paneled satellite.  Every 22 seconds the object flashed at a consistent magnitude until it disappeared over the northern horizon.  The odd thing is the flashing was consistent brightness as though the light was radiating all directions. Normal rotating satellites will flash at most twice before the change in orbital position relative to the observer makes the solar panels flash to a single spot on the earths surface.

Littleton, CO 80128 At approximately 10:02pm on Monday, July 21st, 2020, I was reminded by the local news to take a look outside as the Neowise comet may be visible.  I didn’t see the comet, but knowing that the ISS was also supposed to be visible from my location around that time. I immediately spotted a slowly blinking light moving from west to east.  Its direction suddenly changed to the south and slowly made it towards my community.  As it got closer, I noticed to trailing lights that were just a bit dimmer.  Looking closely, it was obvious this was a triangular arrangement of lights that were now hovering over my townhome complex and making no sound. On a couple of separate occasions, the “trailing” lights got slightly brighter which allowed for more illumination of the overall craft; it was indeed triangular. It was then that I noticed other moving lights in the area. Some with a faint red glow and others that appeared to be smaller versions of this particular craft. At one point one of the smaller crafts flew under the larger, original triangle and completely illuminated the underside of this object. The shadowing that the smaller craft cast provided a brief glimpse of texture to the underside of the larger craft. Think 4 very distinct “ribs;” like you’d see on a leather car seat. The object would also occasionally shift as if to redirect its course while not actually going anywhere. Originally, the brightest light was facing south, but after about 30 minutes of observation, it was apparent it was now facing west. At this point I asked my daughter to come outside and tell me what she thought she was looking at. At first she said some planes, but I had to remind her that planes don’t hover; and they are not generally silent. She then said, “Dad, what’s that,” and point in the direction of northeast sky. It appeared that there was a larger version of the original triangular-shaped object just a few miles to north of us. This one had all of its lights illuminated so that any observer could make out its outline – triangular but twice as large and with what may have been a tail, like a stingray. It then emitted a streak of white light to the northwest that left the atmosphere within a split second. This was the first of three instances that I saw streaking white lights heading in that direction. I could not verify any other sources however. Then the drones started flying. This was clearly a man-made object that flew from the north just along the top of some trees, took position just south of the object and flew up to an elevation of about 300 feet. It stayed right there for at least 3 hours. By 1:30am on Tuesday, there were at least 5 drones surrounding the object(s). I Invited some friends over to have a look and also met my neighbor in the parking lot; they all confirmed exactly was I have described. In fact, once they went home, they could actually track that at least two small triangles had migrated slowly to the west. The drones moved accordingly. At this point I was too tired to stay up and just accepted that there are things out there that I may never understand.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,39.56792218259629,-105.0102302425107

I became concerned that maybe it was a drone.  We live extremely remotely, and he often runs around the farm in various forms of undress.  Could someone on the next mountain over have been watching us?  It had come closer by this time; East to West, so Jim went to grab his monocular scope.  We couldn’t believe what we were seeing!  The sky had cleared to a bright blue at this time.  Purple Martins began to fly in circles by the dozens between us and the object.  The oblong spherical object was glowing white with seemingly its own energy force circulating within it. No sound, no colo! red lights, no vapor trail.  You could see through it in the energy ripple.  It then began to travel North.  We watched it for about 20 minutes, and then it moved skyward as last we saw it.  It was not threatening . It had to be massive for us to be able to see it that well from such a long distance.

The area is mostly dark, unlit, with only a few area street/building lights. The sky was clear and there were about three puffy storm clouds nearby but all out over the Gulf or Mexico and to the South of my location. It was a typical Florida summer night, hot and muggy with little to no wind and almost a full moon. I had a clear view of the sky straight ahead and to my left. To the right side of my view, the sky was mostly visible between the sparse tree branches/leaves of a 15 foot tall decorative tree. I noticed through the foliage of the tree was a very bright fiery orange ball.  It was at approximately a 45 degree angle in the sky from my seated position. The object was as intense as the flames typically seen coming from rockets after leaving Kennedy Space Center. However, this was not an oblong flame, it appeared circular. The object had the same orange intensity on all sides and across the middle. It did not appear that any side was more or less lit up as it slowly moved across the sky. There was no visible trail left behind the object as it moved, no blinking lights, no change in intensity and no audible sound. It was moving very slowly from the north to the south almost horizontal. I confirmed its movement by watching it traverse across openings between the stationary tree branches. I estimated it traveled from my view approximately one inch across the sky in twenty seconds. After watching it move for approximately five minutes, I estimated it was approximately one mile up in the sky and about a mile west of my location out over the Gulf of Mexico. Watching the object, I walked through the open courtyard and then into the street to be in an unlit area when the object disappeared over the course of four seconds.  It went from its standard full size and brightness to half the circumference and half brightness and intense orange color. Then half of that circumference and a dimmer orange-grey color, then half of that circumference and grey, then completely non-visible. I gave the appearance that the orange sphere moved due West out of sight at a very high speed. I initially thought it was possible a storm cloud had begun to cross in front of the object obstructing the view, but the lonely storm cloud was still south of where the light disappeared. ( Total visibility time of approximately 6 minutes.)  I went inside and told the wife and kids of the weird light. I went back outside with the kids two minutes later. At 2229 hours, back in the courtyard we all see it the orange object. It was the same size, shape, color, fiery intensity and distance away as before. It was again very slowly traversing the sky from North to South.  We walked out to the dark street monitoring it. It still appeared to be about a mile out over the gulf and a mile up in the sky as we watched it for three minutes. Comparing it to the stars in the sky it appears to be 15 times the largest visible star or 20 times larger than the smaller stars. If a pencil point on a paper was a star, the eraser of the pencil was the size of the orange object. Moving at a very slow speed horizontally from North to South, the light stopped moving for approximately two to three seconds, then changed direction and began to traverse in the complete opposite directions now from South to North at the same speed.  Nothing changed with the fiery orb during the direction change other than the direction of travel. We all quickly return to the room and enter.(Total visibility time 4 minutes)  I grabbed my camera with zoom lens and rush back outside one minute later. The light is gone and unable to be located. I walked to the beach and find no one with drones or Chinese lanterns. Returning inside I checked the weather website and determined cloud elevation was 6000 feet. When the object disappeared the first time it was half way up in height from the bottom of the storm cloud it was near so the object was possibly at 6200 feet. I estimate the object was moving at approximately 10-15 mph.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,,

Signal. My encounter began on September 7th, 2006. My friend J** and I were driving home from a friend's house nearby where the Big Ear Telescope used to be. It was somewhere around 10 PM near the corner of Cheshire Rd. and Rt 23 between Delaware, Ohio, and Lewis Center, Ohio. We were driving down Route 23 heading south towards Lewis Center when J** saw a bright light very distant in the sky; we both joked saying “It’s probably a UFO.”.   So we keep driving and we eventually lose sight and forget about the distant object in the sky but then as we are coming over the precipice of the hill on Route 23 just beyond where the golf course is now, (where the telescope once stood) there was an enormous glowing football-shaped or (Cigar) shaped UFO hanging at nearly 90 degrees right above our heads steadily moving overtop of Route 23 heading towards Lewis Center. It was the most frightening, and awe-inspiring thing I have ever witnessed. It looked like it had fire, and flame red and orange and yellow churning within it, like it was an explosion encased in an invisible Football/Cigar-shaped shield that was just slowly floating just above our heads. We stopped on the side of the highway and got out of the car. It was the largest thing I have ever seen, I felt like an Ant beneath a giant glowing Boot. It was godlike in its scale.   I tried to take a video with my Motorola Razor but the phone just would not work at all even though it had just been working fine. We followed it back to Lewis Center where my friends and I watched it eventually begin to gain altitude then in a dizzying display of lights and flashes it blasted away in the blink of an eye leaving behind a wispy blue/teal vapor trail. I found out later on that the Big Ear Radio Telescope was where they had received the WOW! Signal.   This object took up a large portion of the visible sky as we came upon it. I’m an Airmen, a trained observer. I would estimate the object to be the size of an NFL Football Stadium, just floating above the tree line/highway and houses and buildings. The object was witnessed by at least 5 people other than myself.  To go into a bit more detail as it was gaining altitude glowing blueish/purplish orbs started cascading out of the main Football(Cigar) shaped object one after the other. Each time one appeared the momentum of which they revolved around the main object intensified until all I could see was a spinning blue glow around the main Football object and then in the blink of an eye it shot off into a flash of light in front of it, honestly, it was just like the Enterprise going to warp speed leaving only a bluish trailing haze behind it.   That is all.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,40.1832,-82.9954

However, my mum saw it slightly different ! to me she saw it as a golden yellow bright shining light zooming through the sky rather then a white one - she described it as a “hovering yellow globe”.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,,
