I called my friend who lives probly a mile or so down the road.  He went outside and thought the same thing about the lighting of this craft.  It was Red, Yellow and White I would say but its like you could always see one of the lights flicker (but it wasnt a really quick flicker near the slower end for a flying object) Red then yellow then white then red etc, but this craft was out of sight in no time at all, it went from pretty much not moving to out of sight within about 15-20secs. I came inside thinking it was all over but the friend I called, contacted another friend about the incident he lives about 2miles from us. They went back out approx. 15mins after the initial sighting and they saw two of this same craft with the same lighting scheme in the sky now.

They were vertically parallel, and the bottom one was slightly bigger (ie. closer). Because I'm deathly curious and and a UFO/alien fanatic, I immediately turned in that direction. Gradually the bottom orb increased in size as I twisted through the neighborhood I'd entered, and before I knew it I was almost directly beneath it.  No longer appearing as an orb, the UFO was extremely close enough to the ground; I'm not great with measuring distances, but to give you an idea, to my vision it was about the size of making circle with your index finger and thumb. It was rather egg-shaped, if the egg were on its side, and it appeared to be black, although it was hard to distinguish color in the dark of night. I remember the arrangement of the ship's lights looking rather like three, bright bug-eyes.  As I raced through the suburban streets to keep pursuit, the UFO slowly flew overhead at a constant pace. Eventually it decided it was done there (or as I like to believe, wanted to lose me) and picked up speed so it was impossible to continue the chase. I watched it fly away from me, and suddenly it was above the hills on the far side of town.  Hopeful to see more, I drove in that direction, and during this drive I saw two more very shiny orbs hovering on either end of town. After waking up another space-loving friend of mine to watch the two, I changed course for a nearby set of hills one of them seemed to be over. When the orb didn't get any bigger after a short hike, I gave up, but from that hill I had a fantastic view of one of the UFOs directly above the center of the valley. From this view I also noticed a human aircraft flying over the valley but at a lower altitude than the UFOs.  Around 6am, when the sky was finally starting to lighten from daylight, I returned home on the outskirts of town to clearly see another orb over the neighboring city. With such a clear view in the morning sky, I woke up my parents to witness the UFO as well.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,37.665087581699346,-121.89576392156862

As I was scanning the sky and watching these ""smoke trails"" I began to look at a small area of natural clouds, directly overhead but out of the general area of flight of the aircraft, which was one of the very few places left uncovered by the smoke trails and it offered a glimpse of the clear blue sky.

It was just stationary in the sky with no movement or sound,Just sitting there as if it was observing all these aircraft which were laying down smoke trails.! It was solid white just the was the same color as the cloud it was near like it was using it as a camouflage. I handed the binoculars to my wife and she was unable to find the object. I grabbed them back from her and I spotted the craft once again. I handed them to her to let her see and she was unable to spot it due to her vision and inability to focus the cheap binoculars. I took them from her again and looked at the craft and it disappeared into nothing. The aircraft made one or two more passes from horizon to horizon and then I didn't see them again. I believe the UFO was there observing the aircraft as they lay down the smoke trails or possibly the aircraft may have been hiding the presence of the UFO from the sight of the public by laying down smoke to obscure the sky..

It was hovering over a mostly rural area and we thought initially it may be a helicopter, but would seem somewhat out of place given the area. As we got closer we could see it had some very erratic, and bright, small square lights flashing in a bizarre linear sequence. It was unlike any aircraft lighting scheme I've ever seen. The lights also didn't seem to illuminate (a very humid evening with much haze) as much as just shine brightly. As we passed it we could see three red lights on each tip of an isosceles triangle and could hear no noise of engine or rotors since we had all the windows down. The driver confirmed the lighting being on three corners and also concluded it wasn't a plane or helico! pter. Estimated to be the size of three fighter jets nose to nose. It was way to large to be a kite. No visible craft was seen but the lights did look attached and static compared to the rest that were visible. The larger lights did not blink.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,,

They would first appear just over the horizon in the SW.  They approached at the speed of a high flying plane.  They were always in pairs of two, one following in the path of the other, and each the same size and shape as the other. When they got to a vertical height of about 60 degrees above the horizon, they would gradually turn black and disappear.  Moments after they would disappear another pair would start appearing over the distant horizon.  There were five sets of two that appeared this way, and then they was a time lapse, and then 3 appeared at once.  Their general appearance to the naked eye was that of a ball of fire. The shape changed when they neared the height of their visible flight. I was able to zoom and get six pictures of different sets at various stages. The 5th picture in particular, shows the degree of similiarity in size and shape between the two objects. I have no idea what they were, but I would definitely categorize them as ""Unidentified.""",2009-08-27T00:00:00,,

UFO SIGHTING REPORT  Aug 14, 2009 9:15 PM  We were traveling south on I-25 in Colorado and my office manager was driving. I noticed a very bright light in the sky kind of a giant headlight. I noticed it kept getting closer to us as if it was traveling north. Then it began to separate into two lights as we drew closer.  This went on for about 5 minutes. Soon I could see it was an enormous object in size so I asked my office manager to pull off an available exit. As we watched then it was over a mountain and looked like a tower because it had a red flashing light on top. So I asked her to pull back on the highway. We had been in a large dip so when we pulled up it was just arriving. I asked my office manager. So what do you see, is that a UFO? She studied it as it approached us at what seemed like a fairly slow speed, it was like floating for a few seconds, by now it was very close and you could see whatever it was it was enormous. It looked like at that point a giant car floating through the sky with headlights probably 20 or 30 feet around that turned with the craft. It was swooping towards us so I said “pull over” as she whipped out of traffic traveling at 80mph with lots of traffic that had to be witnessing the same thing.  My wife pulled over behind us as she was following us. I was jumping out of the truck as she was slowing,. By now it was beginning to pass us overhead but it slowed to nearly a stop, like floating as I stared straight up at the bottom of it. It nearly blocked out the sky from where I was standing. I quickly measured it with my eye in comparison to the width of the freeway and decided that if it were to land there that it would cover the whole freeway both sides and probably hang over both sides by 2 or 300 feet. I estimated it to be about 600 feet or more. I have 30 years in construction so I usually have a pretty good eye. If I were to have held out my arms to the sky I would guess they would be at about a 45 degree angle. I was so wrapped up in getting every detail that I couldn’t take the time to take a photo with my cell phone. It looked like two huge pontoons on each side of a disc or saucer shape and all over the bottom I could see like rectangle windows (or what appeared to be). Each window was surrounded with a very soft light that I would say was a glowing greenish light. And the whole perimeter of the bottom seemed to be outlined with this light. It was probably 500 to 1000 feet above me as it slowed to almost a stop over my head. I noticed I could not hear any sound at all. The pontoons were hard to make out other than I could see the shape how they blocked out the stars and they also had white corner marker lights. In the very bottom of where the saucer came to a point in the bottom there was almost like a slit where it looked like a door would be. Underneath everything seemed to be outlined with that soft greenish light. As it flew over it started to gain speed and elevation still heading north only probably about 10 miles from Norad and slightly veering to the east as it disappeared I could see again its enormous size and the white marker lights on all the corners and also one red light in the center of the peak of the saucer. I got back in the truck and we pulled out onto the highway and I noticed there was another one that was approaching on the right much smaller in size probably about 1000 feet or so in elevation and about 1500 feet to my right. This one however was completely different; it seemed to be more like a cubic shape by the marker lights that were all white, except a large blue light in the center. No red light on this one, it stayed on  the west side of I-25 as it headed north, where as the other one crossed over the freeway still flying quite parallel to the highway. I thought this one was skirting Fort Carson for some kind of security for the large ship. In comparison to the moon this craft was probably about the same size as the moon at it closest point. It seemed a little larger than a large military helicopter but it seemed more awkward. Although it seemed cubicle it also seemed to have other cubicle dimensions. I am doing some drawings of what I saw but I am In the mountains and away from my scanner and will be scanning them in and sending them in the next couple of days.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,38.6657,-104.6838

In my perpective, it seemed to be about 3000 to 6000 feet up and appeared to us to be seven inches high, I do not know how to calculate what size that would make it.  It passed between Anguilla and St. Martin for a duration of 90 seconds, V shaped with extremely bright orange on the bottom, bright red in center and startling white at the top. It appeared to actually waver back and forth due to air resistance as it passed between the two islands, it was not moving at all like meteorites which we have witnessed many times in the past.  It may have had a flat surface which would cause this wavering.   We watched it pass just fifteen degrees to our North and headed out to open ocean to our South West.  It was obviously burning up and started to get smaller and smaller until it burned out before crossing the horizon. The conditions were perfect, cloudless, the moon had already passed over the horizon, very little light polution, we have a video phone, video of it and are trying to enhance it because of the low quality.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

The proximity of Travis Air Force Base to this location cannot be ignored due to the nature of this event. There were two very distinct and strange occurrences witnessed and attempting to digest, as what I was, witnessing did not relate to the disk that appears to be following the jet airliner. The fist strange occurrence was the absence of sound emanating from the jet engines, in a valley with foothills on either side you would expect to hear the roar of a jet flying at low altitude.  The second bit of strangeness was the air speed at which the jet airliner was moving, well below stall speed and technically should have fallen from the sky. The markings on the jet were indistinguishable so I raised my camera and started to shoot pictures of the jet, to my surprise, a brilliant flash of light just behind the jet appeared as I shot the first picture.  I looked at my camera and saw what appeared to be a disk like shape that was not visible to the naked eye. I continued to shoot pictures of the jet in sequence until it disappeared further into the valley.  Odd as it may sound you would think that a jet airliner with four engines would make some noise.  There were people all around shooting pictures of the castle and no one seemed to notice the plane. I still have the pictures on my flash card and would be interested in anyone who can provide high-resolution digital imaging as I have about 15 pictures in sequence of the airplane moving through the valley.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,38.6253,-122.6159

However, this ‘firework’ did not set of, but continued to rise, prompting me once again to say, ""Maybe it is a flare instead?""  However, the light quickly diverted to the left, towards the sea and continued to gain in height and in distance.  We stopped and I opened the door hoping for a noise of some sort, only to hear a nearby plane, to which this light had increased its speed and quite possibly travelling up to, if not faster than the speed of light.   Another surprising issue was how bright the light was in comparison to stars and lights from planes nearby.  No sooner had 3 minutes past, when the light faded and disappeared in the distance.

I am a 48-year-old licensed mechanical engineer.  My 13-year-old son and I were sitting in our Jacuzzi this evening looking at Orion’s belt when my son suddenly pointed up at the sky.  He had spotted something flying and asked me to identify it.  The object was flying overhead coming in our direction from the east and heading westward in a straight line.  It was triangular in shape and had a relative size of about one quarter of a full moon (if you cut the moon up like a pie).  I would estimate its altitude to have been about that of a conventional, single engine propeller plane, or perhaps even as low as a helicopter. The object had a dim but solid orange glow to it and there were no blinking lights (red or green) as most aircraft have when in flight.  Although I cannot estimate its speed with much accuracy I can say that from the time it entered our field of vision from the east to when it disappeared to the west took no more than three to four seconds.  Thus, I would say that it appeared to be traveling quite fast.  What astonished both myself and my son, however, was the fact that the object made no sound whatsoever.  No buzz of props, no rumble of jet engines-nothing-not even after it had passed. It was a bizarre and surreal feeling watching it seemingly ""glide"" at such a speed over us.   The absolute silence of the craft and its flight is what got us to report it.  From the time we first saw the craft in the east to the time it left our field of vision in the west the craft had traveled approximately 110 degrees (180 degrees being from one horizon to the other on a perfectly flat plane).

I saw a bright light in the sky on November 27, 2009 between 5:30 a.m. until 6:40 a.m.  I was woken up at 5:30 a.m. by my dog doing one of those low 'berf' barks dogs do.  I noticed it was lighter than usual outside, but dismissed it as me not being a morning person.  My dog would not stop making that low sound so at 5:40 I got up to put her and my other dog, outside.  By then, the brightness from outside was gone.   My patio door faces North and it was clear outside except a very few horizon clouds. When I got to the patio door I noticed a really bright 'star or Venus' in the sky.  It seemed strange because I have never seen 'Venus' so high in the sky, nor a 'star' so bright.  The light was stationary, very bright and twinkling two different pulses.  I looked at it for about 8 seconds.  When opening the patio door, I looked down for about 5-6 seconds or so to keep the cat from getting out; as I closed the door, I looked back at 'Venus', however, it had moved visually 5 feet over to the West, and 2 feet to the North!  I know it was in a different position because when I first saw it I compared the position in the sky to the  plant on my patio railing.  I looked at it for another 10 seconds or so to determine that it was definitely stationary in the sky. I closed the curtain, because my dogs will stare in the patio door instead of doing their business, and went over to a window on the same wall and two feet over from the patio door (taking about 2 seconds to do that).  I could not see the light anymore.  There are no large objects on my patio which would block out the area where I saw the light, in fact I have a very clear view of the sky from the entire North side of my house.  I got right up to the window searching for the light all over the sky and horizon.  Did not see anything but a few regular stars. About 3 minutes later I let my dogs in and saw the light further down on the horizon, just above the clouds and more toward the West visually about 1 foot above the horizon, above the town water tank.   I had looked in that area minutes before and did not see it there.  It appeared further away because it was about 3/4 the size as when I first saw it.  I went outside stood there for approx. 5 minutes watching it.  Getting cold, I went inside and watched it for 45 minutes.  I watched the light stay in exactly one position, still very bright and still twinkling 2 different pulses.  There were tiny flashing lights that would pop up all around the sky near the light at different times, about 8- 10 of them.  At one time a cloud passed in front of it, but it was still there once the cloud moved.  The clouds slowly went away, and now it was completely clear.  After 45 minutes,I walked over to grab a chair to sit in to watch it, when I returned seconds later, the light was gone.  I ! right away started to e-mail my Mother, when I noticed my computer was 2 hours off.  I had not been that way the night before because I always check the time while I am e-mailing someone.  What was strange about it was that the light would be stationary, then be in a totally different area in the sky within seconds.

I was camping with my family and everyone was sleeping.  I was sitting near a fire and I was checking out the night sky. It was very clear so there were many star’s to view.  At about 11:00 pm Eastern standard time I noticed a strange looking craft flying through the big dipper.  My first thought was that it was just a plane. But upon further review it was shaped like a circle or a oval. The craft was all white. There were no red or blinking lights that you normally see with a airplane. I saw this craft making very quick turns and dips in the sky. I thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me so I moved away from the fire to adjust my eyes. I kept track of this object and my eyes got adjusted so I continued to view this object. The thing that made me want to report this craft was how it was making very quick turns and dips in the night sky. It flew and moved in a triangular flight path. It moved into this position in about 1 second. It did this about 10 more times. It moved back and forth between the big dipper and other stars so fast. I have never seen a object move this fast and take multiple positions in the sky. I do not think this was a plane. I have been observing the night sky since I was a child and this is the first time I have ever wanted to report an object. The other thing that caught my attention about this object was that it would move all over the sky and then go back to it’s original flight path. My observations about this object make me believe that it was very high in the sky and it was not close to me. So if possible please advise on this. If this is a standard craft then please try to tell me what it was. Otherwise I hope someone else reported this.,2009-06-09T00:00:00,,

The one light in question not flashing U-Turns towards the North and slips away toward the stars. The direction it took off was between a 45 degree to 70 degree angle from the plane of horizon. Anyone who has heard a plane knows it's engine would be loudly roaring with that type of acceleration. Not only that but I have never seen anything go from town to gone.

My first reaction was that it was a satellite or a space shuttle since they are repairing the Hubble Telescope.  I rushed to the garage to get my mom to try and show what I was seeing. I was keeping an eye on the object the whole time as to not lose it. I then noticed that it started to go from side across the sky like a plane would, then it started to go straight up and stay in a spot in the sky and started to flash. Two other points in the sky that were to the lower left of it started to flash and move side to side. The main light was in the same spot but moved up and down and kept flashing.  We both went back into the garage and started to sort some things out and move things around. About 5 minutes elapsed and we went back out and to my surprise they were still there in the sky flashing and moving a little bit, and then they all vanished one after another. All 3 lights disappeared. Keep in mind that planes are flying around in the sky due to the fact I live a few towns away from a major airport.  They moved way to fast for a plane and too slow to be a satellite or a space shuttle. I have seen the space shuttle in the sky while in orbit and that moved very fast.

I looked up to the point of that sound and saw four chemtrails, very obvious and very high in the sky, all close together, as if from one plane with four jet engines.  Through my binoculars I saw, rather, four tiny objects extremely close to one another producing these enormous chemtrails.  The objects, of what I can say were chevron shaped, and silver, traveled at a faster pace than an airliner, heading SW, and at an altitude,  I would guess, of 15 to 20 thousand feet.   What struck me as very odd was the precision of these four small craft and the much larger chemtrails they produced.  They were so precise in there close proximity to one another and produced identical chemtrails that it appeared to be one object, like the four engined jet that I first thought it was.  However, I did see through the binoculars that they were four distinct objects.

At the time I was working on a song that I had been writing, using a handheld synthesizer.  The sky had been mostly clear all day, but it was beginning to get a little cloudy. I needed to urinate badly, so I got up and walked to the side of our property and began my bussiness. It was then that I noticed that the moon was becoming extremely bright, so bright that I began worry that someone might see me, and become offended.  I then noticed that the light that was shining so brightly was not the moon at all, the moon being white in color.  This was yellow, so close to the color of a street light, that I thought for a brief moment that maybe someone had installed a telephone pole and street light in our yard.  That ridiculous notion was taken from me when the ""street light"" began to slowly move in the direction of the clouds.  The light had been so close to the ground that it had eclipsed the moon, but as it moved, I could see the moon again.  The light then seemed to shrink in on itself, not unlike a dimmer switch connected to a light bulb.  It startled me to the point that I had forgotten I was still indecently exposed.  As I stood there, mouth agape, I was starled yet again. This time it was bone chilling.  As a hole in the clouds opened up, I saw the night sky clearly. The stars were easy to see, and were clearly stationary, because the clouds were moving very fast, but the stars were remaining still.  But what startled me was the sheer number of yellow stars.  They were moving in the same direction as the clouds, and these ""yellow stars"" were above the clouds, because they would be covered up by the clouds as they moved.  It occured to me then, that the yellow lights were in our atmosphere, because they were much clearer to see than the stars.  I know they were just above the clouds, because some of them were doing what I had seen the first one I noticed doing. They  looked like they would have been part of the star field, but they were too many and too clearly observed. To be honest, I thought that we were being invaded. I know, I know, I watch alot of movies, but this was the real thing! I was honestly scared, and I figured that maybe I had better go tell my loved ones that I love them.  I was a little shaky as I ran inside to get my brother and mother. I got into the door, and stopped, realizing the enormity of what I was about to say to them. My mother looked at me expectantly, knowing somehow, that I had some important news. At this point I thought, if they are going to think I'm going crazy, then I'm going to force this on them, instead of just telling them. So I said,"" Mom, you have to help me now!""  Then I turned, and ran out the front door. They followed me, but when they saw the lights, they came up short.  There were dozens, maybe hundreds, above the clouds, and they would show up in the dozens below the clouds.  However, when they would show up below the clouds, it seemed that they were there already, but not shining. Then the light would intensify,  sustain, then dim. Sometimes they would just dissapear into a cloud, and would actually ""burn"" holes in the clouds. I then called my grandma, my best friends, my other friends. Several of my friends were in different places, a couple miles away, but when they went outside, they were amazed. Many people saw these lights, and I think many people are afraid to admit it. I was just watching them, when three jets came roaring in a speeds much faster than lights were moving. The lights did not appear to flee. Instead, they just dimmed down, until you could not see them. They would appear in different intervals in many different places, only to dissapear again. After that there were helicopters flying in really low. They could not get near a light, but it was clear that the pilots were aware of the lights, and desired to close in on them. But it was the same thing as with the jets.By this time there were very few showing up close to the! ground, instead they all seemed to slowly move on to the west! . At abo ut eleven  o'clock, I had decided to get the little camera we have. I was waiting for another to come  low enough to photograph, but I had to settle for one that was actually at a high altitude. As I took the picture, and the flash went off, the camera died from loss of power. It was probably only coincidence, but the wireless internet at my house was knocked out of service at that exact moment. Upon recharging the camera, I found no picture recorded. That is too bad. I was so excited about seeing these things, that I lost my priorities. Next time I see anything like that, I'm going to have a camera waiting.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,27.9709,-97.155

But then I noticed that the twinkling/flashing light was moving pretty fast, and was hovering above a smaller light.  As it flew before me, it spinned like a baton at least three times before I noticed it was somewhat cigar/rod shaped. Meanwhile, I was also trying to get my mother's attention without keeping my eyes off the UFO.  I tried to speak, but all I could say was ""Oh my G-d!"" and ""Look!"".  My mother didn't see anything except the larger twinkling light.

Tuesday, April 27th, 2010 should be noted as a particularly fair-weathered, cloud-free day.  At the time of this incident there were no clouds visible, the sun was at my back, and no known aircraft could be seen or heard at this specific time.  Living relatively close to an airport, I’m very familiar with the daily sights and sounds of small aircraft and helicopters.  I was sunbathing this afternoon while on the telephone with my sister when a flash of light caught my attention from the corner of my eye.  The flash of light was relative to sunlight reflected by a mirror from a distance.  When I focused my attention toward the eastern sky I had a difficult time identifying exactly what I was witnessing at that moment.  I saw three spherical/disk-like objects flying in what appeared to be a perfect equilateral triangle formation.  These three, separate objects appeared to be metallic and continued to reflect light, but appeared darker on the bottom.  Perhaps the darke! r appearance on the bottom was an effect of shade.  However, the shade theory is merely speculation.  Although the objects were indeed reflecting sunlight, they did not emit any other light whatsoever. The three, separate objects held their perfect equilateral triangle formation for approximately 30 seconds. They appeared to be fading in and out of my plain of sight flying rapidly, sharply in a direct east to west motion while maintaining the triangular formation. Each separate object appeared to be twice the size of how the planet Venus appears in the night sky. One of the objects was flying at a slightly higher elevation than the two objects below. The appearance of these three objects was specifically puzzling as they appeared as if they were out of focus, exhibiting an almost hazy appearance. I live at approximately 5,500 feet above sea level. Using the western mountain peaks as a reference I estimate that these objects were flying at altitudes between 8,000 and 12,000 feet above sea level. Their low-altitude flight level could be compared to the altitude of a south-bound, ascending plane from the nearby airport, which is within a five mile radius of my home. Despite t! heir low altitude, no sounds could be heard. If I would have held a ruler to the sky to measure their distance apart, they appeared about ¾ of an inch from each other. They were not spread throughout the sky, they were tightly grouped in the equilateral triangle formation for the first 30 seconds of this occurrence. After the first 30 seconds had passed I moved toward the eastern side of my deck for a prolonged view as the objects were slowly creeping north. Suddenly these three objects began flying in circles around each other. The circular patterns they flew around each other were perfect circles which could be compared to the circular motions demonstrated by braiding three sections of hair. Weaving in a very calculated manner from left to right, up and down. They repeated this pattern 2-3 times in a matter of 10 seconds. The three objects then altered their path, all three of them were flying in completely random circles around each other similar to how flies would buzz around each other. During both patterns of circular, weaving motions the three objects became so close to each other it was difficult to discern one from the other at times. This confirmed that what I was witnessing was indeed not a small aircraft or a helicopter. I am aware of the kinds of maneuvers our known aircraf! ts are capable of and these three separate objects were not demonstrating ordinary or technical maneuvers, these maneuvers were absolutely mind-boggling. The objects maintained their relative position in the eastern sky, slowly making their way toward the north while holding their altitude. Believing the objects would hold their position I bolted inside the sliding glass door of my bedroom and swiftly grabbed my digital camera. With the objects still within sight it was obvious they had returned to their original equilateral formation in those few seconds, exactly as it was earlier; fading in and out of my plain of sight. While fumbling with my camera to set it to video mode, the objects had moved far enough to the north and east that they were no longer visible. Minutes later the sounds of small aircraft could be heard once again, and were beginning to come within sight. I later contacted the Federal Aviation Administration who referred me to the National UFO reporting center per section 6 of FAA regulations regarding Safety, Accident, and Hazard Reports, 7-6-4. Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Reports. What were these three objects? Why three patters? Why a triangle? How did these objects manage these impossible maneuvers? Why the middle of the day? Why Colorado?  My sighting today has left me with many understandable, unanswered questions. The most poignant of all these questions is: When will I experience a second sighting?? Until then I will keep my eyes on the skies whenever possible.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,39.913411574074075,-105.0857399691358

This is where the whole incident took place it did not happen in the sky. The objects appeared about a half mile away from us, from the opposite bank, the east side, of the river. Before we noticed the lights, we were having a good conversation talking about the state of the world, spirituality, and sharing personal experiences.  I had gotten to the subject of recent UFO sighting I've had, and I was explaining to him that I really feel that we can be making efforts to reach out and contact off world visitors, as individuals, and as communities or small groups.

I closed my eyes and began to envision a light rising up out of the lake, and I put out my thoughts that I wish to have a contact and I want to see something, then when I opened my eyes out in the distance on one of the hills was a white light which had appeared while my! eyes were closed! It pulsed irregularly with no apparent pattern, and the brightness of the pulses also were changing.  This is a sighting in Washington months ago so I won't go into detail here.  But it's important to describe this because it is interconnected with all of my sightings I've had recently, which all seem to be the same 'type of craft'. SO, while I was describing this to my friend, I had been looking out his window at lights which were flashing and changing colors, but I hadn't noticed consciously.  My friend interrupted me from my descriptions and said, ""What are those lights out there?""  I then noticed we were looking at something unusual.  I started to list things off and I thought at first we were looking at a traffic intersection, was there an accident?  Were we looking at ambulance lights or was there construction going on out there?  But my friend pointed out the lights were not coming from our side of the river, they weren't that close.  These lights were coming from across the river!  We went out to the balcony and our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was just before sun rise so it was pretty dark out.  We could clearly see the outline of the river and Ross Island, and the tree line and bank of the east side where Oaks Bottom sits. The lights were all very close together, I would say there was an area of 100-200 feet which these lights stuck together and hovered around very close to ground level.  The lights didn't rise up above the tree line so they stayed about 50-100 feet above the ground and the river.  They moved slightly at first from side to side, and then towards the end of the sighting they did move north about a quarter mile before disappearing right before our eyes. To describe the lights without seeing them for yourself does not give justice to the intensity of what we saw! I could not stop saying, ""This is so beautiful! Have you ever seen something so amazing and beautiful before!""  I was touched by the sheer sight of it all.  But also I was going through phases of many emotions and physical feelings during this sighting.  At first I was skeptical, uncertain of the area we were viewing, that it could be something unexplainable.  But as it got brighter out I could see my friend was right, it was an area where there are no buildings, no roads, and no public access.  The lights we saw are unlike anything I've really seen before.  Even in science fiction movies, these lights just were so unique I can't really describe it perfectly. There were lots of colors, and the lights seemed to change rapidly in shape, size, color, and brightness. The lights would stay 'lit' for a split-second to a full few seconds.  And the lights were not lights on an object - this is very important to understand - the UFO was a group of lights with no other objects associated.  I could clearly see, for the entire duration, the larger lights would pulsate, glow, and vibrate for a few seconds.  Then, upon shrinking and disappearing, it would be followed by dozens of colorful sparkles and twinkles and yet more bright white-blue or golden pulses.  The number of individual pulses and appearances would number in the hundreds.  Because for the whole duration these twinkling pulsating orbs of light would be constantly changing and it was hard to say whether we were observing a collective of dozens of individual objects, or if this was some kind of vortex which many objects were popping in and out of, or if maybe it was all one big transparent object which dozens of changing lights appearing all over it. We were out there for a while and continued to watch these lights with much excitement and wonder, for the next 20-30 minutes I assume.  The sun came up not long after we stepped outside, and the lights continued pulsing even though it was then light out and we could clearly see no vehicles, people, objects, or anything at all! The lights were appearing from out of nowhere, they were literally phasing into our visual perception either from another dimension, or from a band of light or vibration which we cannot visually see - or both. I recall my friend describing that he felt very warm through the entire experience, I too did feel like I was having hot-flashes, but I at the peak of the experience, I felt as if electricity was surging through my body, and I felt like I was having a transmission of thought with these objects. So many feelings went through me. But not one tiny amount of fear was felt - I felt completely secure and in fact I felt very blissful and loving energy. I recall that there were tears streaming down my cheeks and I couldn't help but cry because the love and joy I was feeling was SO intense!  I felt that these lights were supporting us, all of humanity, and they care dearly for our well-being and our planet too. We are not alone and we live in a vast universe. But we do not have anything to fear, if we feel fear and are in a negative place within, then we are going to attract such experiences perhaps unconsciously. We must remain grounded, centered, and composed. We didn't get any pictures or footage at all unfortunately, but this sighting was more than a usual UFO sighting, to me it was a CE5 - a close encounter of the fifth kind characterized by close bilateral communication, and experiencing physical effects from the encounter. I can send a picture of where the sighting took place using an aerial of the area from google maps - if this is something that would be useful then let me know. I can be contacted via phone or e-mail for further questions and details.  I am an artist so I have been drawing what I saw but truly the whole incident was so dynamic a simple picture doesn't really show the incredible animation of these objects. I am personally making efforts to pursue more contacts and I feel very confident now that things are just beginning and I am very excited for the near future events to come.  I know I have my own personal perception of what happened and because i've experienced 'supernatural' or unusual events all my life, I am very confident in trusting my intuition on these matters.  Contact with these higher dimensional beings requires an open heart, and pure intent.  We must be raising our vibration as individuals, communities, and a planet - there is much hope for us here in our quest to heal and clean our home, these beings are here for multiple reasons, some may be a part of our earth too, some may be here to assist us or our planets or the sun. We will find out more as we open up and begin to shift into the new paradigm. There is much more I could attribute to this sighting, as in the last 2 weeks I've had yet another sighting but of a smaller implication. I've seen ufos in the sky but my sightings are happening on ground level as well simultaneously in some cases. I am pursuing more contacts with an open heart and mind. Thought and meditation techniques are very helpful and I believe the way to go for pursuing a communication with dimensional beings. Please contact me if you feel compelled to, I feel there is much more to come very soon!",2010-05-12T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I was driving  home this morning from work (I work at night) in my old Ford Orion and suddently something came in my direction.  First, I thought it was an uncontrolled car comming over me and, to avoid an imminent crash, I turned the steering wheel to the right side of the road and stopped. It wasn´t another car.  The object stopped at my left side.  That thing had almost 8m long in a  metallic blue  color, with a damn shape I really can´t describe.

We had our radio.  This was at 10pm  sometime between 10 and midnight we saw three strange flashes.  There were three incidences:  two we both saw and one my husband alone saw. The first one my husband alone saw. He said what he saw was an extremely bright flash of light, right between the two bottom stars of the big dipper.  By time he said ""oh wow!"" and pointed, it had disappeared.  It wasn't streaking like a meteor. He said it just got bright and disappeared. A while later, maybe 20 minutes to a half hour later I was watching a satellite cross the sky.  I pointed it out to my husband, ""I see one!"".  It was directly in front of us.  We both were watching it. As it crossed, it suddenly got extremely bright. So bright the light from it almost hurt my eyes the way high beams from an oncoming car would. It lasted no more than two seconds and them dimmed.  After it dimmed you could no longer see the satellite at all.  I thought maybe it had burned up in space.  There wasn't an object to track across the sky any longer.  I thought maybe because of the brightness I just couldn't see it anymore, but it was really gone!  My husband said that was what he had seen earlier. We saw a third one which wasn't nearly as bright as the first one I had witnessed.  The third one happened the same way.  Visually tracking a satellite across the sky, this one was further to our North (our right hand side, our chairs were facing West). It brightened, then disappeared completely from the sky. After hearing reports on the radio last night, July 6th, about others seeing something unusual, I was compelled to write.  We sat out briefly last night and something unusual again. At around 10:20 we saw the same thing again.  While tracking a satellite across the sky we saw it brighten significantly and then disappear.  This was not as bright as the first one I saw on July fourth.   Maybe 15 minutes later we both saw what looked like two satellites traveling North one behind the other quite close (I have NEVER seen that before).  We watched as the one behind then gradually changed direction heading East as the first one continued North. I am 52 years old.

I am not schooled in aviation, but the object appeared to be moving far below the normal altitude of the everyday commercial and miltary flights that are frequent over my location, for Hartsfield Airport and Dobbins AFB.

It also had three bands of marquee-like lights on the bottom. There were lights between some of the sections and internally. I have never seen this type of craft before nor read any accounts of it. (You may post this if you wish...I did not have anyway to draw then post to internet so I found a program called draw where I made a ""sketch"" of the general shape.  The smaller circle at the end represents the exhaust or afterburner; the rectangles represent the three strips of ""marquee"" like lights which were solidly on...they did not blink,,,,and the small circle the red light which was flashing on and off. I am emailing you seperately the 'drawing""  as an jpg I made using draw online software.)   I don't know if it was of earth or beyond, but it was impressive, and much larger than a typical jet.  It sounded like a typical jet but the light patterns and shape dispelled similarity to a typical jet. It made the sound of a typical jet albeit louder than average, and it appeared much larger than typical jet, if I held my arm at full length and measured using fingers I would say it appeared four inches in length, about 1/2 inch in width against the night sky.  I would estimate it was way less than 30,000 feet --maybe 10,000 feet up. <To match drawing being mailed seperately please look for KCSHAPE in tagline of my sepearte email.>",2009-08-05T00:00:00,39.106140833333335,-94.70725125

A really bright orange light flickering like a flame.  Still assuming it was just a balloon I moved as it went behind some trees to catch sight of it coming around the other side but realized the clouds weren't noticeably moving and there was no noticeable wind at ground level. The object continued to move north north east and the light never changed in intensity.  We are close to Willow Run airport, and the light seemed to be heading NNE toward the direction of the aiport - but flight paths in that area of the sky are generally heading 'away' from the airport unless they are on landing approach (descending rather than ascending). I tried to see if I could spot any strobes or navigation (red/green) lighting but the orange flicker was too intense.  I also strained to hear any sort of engine noises but heard none and it was generally quiet due to the time of the evening. I watched the light continue to ascend in a rather consistent north-north east direction, getting slightly smaller but still quite intense and still flickering orange like a flame until it eventually disapeered into the clouds to the northeast. It was more than likely just a plane with a whacked out light, but they generally don't take a flight path that would be that close to the airport and I could not hear any sounds of engine noises which is generally strange for anything that bright. (generally meaning it is closer proximity)  Also it would have been at least somewhat in profile when I first saw it and was obviously headed away when I finally lost sight of it - generally when you catch site of a plane coming or going from the airport, you may for example see a landing light that appears quite intense, but that is only when the plane is coming directly at you.  I contacted the local police department non-emergency line and my call was the first they had heard of it.

The object was dark with three large bright white lights in a triangular configuration on its underside, one toward the front, two in the back.

A large, lit cigar-shaped object was noticed by me moving at a slow velocity in a westward-slight northwest ward direction. The object, when first noticed at 21:31 PM was in a general position of 45 degrees above the southernmost horizon of Albuquerque and moved to a stationary position approximately 15 degrees above the western most horizon above Albuquerque’s Nine Mile Hill by 21:34 PM. At 21:33 PM, I placed a call to Albuquerque 9-1-1 to inquire if anybody else had reported this event also. At the intersection of Central and Carlisle NE, the object’s light dimmed slowly for approximately two seconds, then intensified greatly. While eyeing the object, we drove 1/4 mile southwest to a higher vantage point in the city at Lead and Amherst NE. My girlfriend and I parked and exited the vehicle to concentrate on the unfolding events. What appeared originally as a singular, intensifying object was “growing” into a crescent-shaped object with now two other, distinctive intensifying lights; equaling now three, bright lights. At 21:36 PM, I placed a call to my boss who lives in far NE Heights section of Albuquerque with a view towards the west for his opinion on the events. He witnessed the object immediately with his naked eye and later with great detail via a telescope. The object appeared to be a structure hundreds of stories tall. As it was positioned stationary, the bottom light (which was what appeared to be the original cigar object)was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the sky. The top of the structure(what was the third light) was at the 25 degree mark above the horizon. The second light was at the 20 degree position between the two lights. Again, all three light were arced in a crescent shape, with the 25 degree light being the northernmost. The lit object/s was/were visible from my vantage point until 21:51 PM. From 21:36 PM to 21:51 PM. From 21:35 PM to 21:38 PM , smaller, ancillary objects/lights appeared to rotate and fly around the stationary three, main objects/lights. From 21:39 to 21:41 PM, a large, unlit structure (close in appearance to an Eiffel Tower like-shaped structure) appeared from the extreme top of third light located at the 25 degree mark above horizon. At 21:49 PM, I placed  a call to my parents home in Seattle, Washington to describe to them what was happening. At 21:50 PM, 25 degrees above the horizon light dimmed, but was still visible. At 21:50:30 PM, 20 degrees above the horizon light dimmed, but was still visible. At 21:51 PM, 15 degrees above the horizon light (and the original lit object)dimmed completely; object and lights completely ceased from view on the horizon.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

Another object was seen about eight degrees behind the station, following in its orbit.  And, an unusual light was seen in the northwest about two minutes before the Station passed over, which has left us puzzled. Things were not looking good for astronomy Friday night.  Though the weather forecast was for clear skies, clouds had been passing through.  We planned to try and get a telescope on the Space Station, to see if we could make out any details.  The pass of the Station was scheduled to start at 1013pm ET, and to last for about two minutes.  The important fact was that it would be around 50 degrees high, which would be high enough to see from our observatory, but low enough to make pointing easy - for pointing a telescope right overhead is a chore!     About 1005pm, clearing was seen to be moving in from the southwest.  We opened up the observatory and turned the dome west.  The Station was scheduled to appear just to the right of west, and to move left toward the south before disappearing.  As we were turning the tube on our 10"" Newtonian to bring the eyepiece to the proper angle, we noticed a light high overhead, heading northwest.  The light was orange and quite bright, perhaps magnitude 0 or brighter. We watched the light head down into the northwest, and by slow speed and appearance it was assumed to be a satellite. It was viewed with 15x70 binoculars and appeared only as a bright orange light.   The light stayed the same brightness as it went along, and we were wondering what satellite might be so bright.   Just then, at an altitude of about 25 degrees, it made a sharp turn left to a heading of roughly south.  At that point, we were a little more puzzled. But, the object disappeared behind our maple tree which sits due west of the observatory.  Maybe it was a helicopter, but we heard no noise and the light appeared exactly the same down low as when high overhead, which does not suggest a directional light like a landing light. By then, it was just about time for the Station to appear.  On schedule, it appeared above the maple tree, and we got the telescope on it.  By positioning the telescope ahead of the Station with a reticle finder, we were able to pick up the Station and move the scope by hand at a power of about 30x. We'd move the scope, look for a second as the Station passed through, and jerk the scope ahead a bit.  We lost the Station after about fifteen seconds, and when we went back to the reticle finder to reposition it, we looked up and saw the other object trailing the Station.   We now think it is either a new module which was launched toward the station today, or a resupply vessel which was cut loose from the station a few weeks back. Whatever it was, the excitement of the night will make this a night to remember.  Actually, the light we saw before the Station pass was most memorable. It floated along silently like a satellite, and it remained the same brightness and color the whole time we saw it. Anyhow, when viewing the Station through a telescope, it looks bigger than expected.  It is very bright yellow, almost fiery looking, and the major components can be seen. It is hard to make out very much when manually pushing the telescope to stay on the target, however.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,39.2844,-80.2307

The next morning I woke up, gassed up, cleaned my windows and continued on toward my destination at approx. 7am. I was still on the far eastern side of NM and was had a long day of travel ahead of me so I found what I thought was the best coffee in town and hit the road.

I noticed a bright object in the direction I was looking and focused my vision on it. At first I thought it might be a hot air balloon, having just watched a documentary on them on PBS just a few days before, but the object wasn’t shaped like a balloon. The object was shaped like a dome that was slightly short of a half circle. It had a flat bottom to it that was shaped like a tear drop on its side, with the pointy end facing toward my right. I approximate that I was looking up at a 20 to 30 degree angle, through my windshield. There was a plane in the far distance coming toward me from the area of NW Arizona that was within my field of vision as well, evidenced by the con trail it left in its wake and a large mesa off to the right that was parallel to the highway. The craft was slightly above the mesa in clear blue sky. The object was bright metallic silver, as pure a color silver as I’ve ever seen. There were no other distinguishing marks other than the bottom which appeared white and which for the briefest of moment seemed to phase out of distinct characteristic form and then back in. I had been looking at the object for a matter of probably six seconds and had to turn my attention back to the road to make sure I was still traveling in my lane. Convinced I was ok I looked back to where the object had been and it was gone… completely. Within a couple miles of the sighting was an exit off the highway. I took it and got out of my car to investigate further. I couldn’t see anything but several airplanes with the con trails left in their wake. I later exited at another off ramp to ask if there was any historical significance to the area and I found out that right there was the entrance to Chaco Canyon, the residence of the now extinct Anastasi Indians.

April 20, 2009 8:00PM  9:30PM Kennewick, Washington UFO sighting Still Photographs taken. In the back of our house looking at the stars I noticed a twinkling object west of our location. My husband went to get our camera, which had a telephoto lens. I looked through the lens, and saw red, green, and white lights twinkling. We decided it was not a star. It was not on top of a tower or a hill. It was not traveling (moving) like a plane. It was too bright to be a helicopter. We did determine after sitting in the same spot for about 12 minutes that the twinkling light was moving NW as it had drifted from our reference point between two trees  We grabbed our tri-pod, got in our vehicle, and headed in the general direction of this twinkling light. We decided it was above West Richland, Washington or Benton City, Washington. We went to the Union St. Library in Kennewick, which is about 3 miles or so west of our home. We got out of our car, walked to the darkest part of the field, set up the tri-pod, and began to snap photographs. The light changed shape. The light made perfect cylindrical clouds that were red, white and green in color. We snapped two photographs where it appears there is a HUGE unidentified (by us) flying object. Like to know what THAT is! In many of the photographs, there is what seems to be a multi-colored tail coming from the light. The light began to drift very quickly at the end heading in the direction of Yakima Washington. We focused the camera on light from a house at one point to show the object was moving, and changing shape. This can all be seen VERY CLEARLY from the still photos. There are also the stars to use as a reference. My husband and I would like to know what we were looking at. Yeah, we would really like to know. Will someone please IDENTIFY this UNIDENTIFIED flying object so we can sink back into our safety zone? We are not stupid so please make it something we can grasp with certainty. If you tell us they are here….we will understand.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,46.17882291666667,-119.16297812500001

Two adult males were standing outside, looking toward the eastern sky.  Conditions were unusually clear, with no cloud coverage.  The stars were beautifully prominent. One of the witnesses observed a very bright light in the eastern sky, which initially he thought was a satellite.  The light was at an azimuth of approximately 80-100 degrees (true); angle of elevation was approximately 45-60 degrees (above the horizontal plane). The first witness called the unusual looking light to the attention of the other witness present, and they both stood, watching the object, as it coursed generally to the north, i.e., from their right to left.  It followed a flight path that was generally parallel to a horizontal line.  It was moving at approximately the same (angular) velocity that is seen for a typical satellite, i.e. approximately ½-1 degree of arc per second. Suddenly, the light, which already was quite bright, e.g. brighter than the ISS when it passes directly overhead, flared up dramatically.  Following this dramatic increase in luminosity, and over the course of approximately 10-15 seconds, the brilliance of the object subsided to the size and illumination of a typical prominent low-orbit satellite, and the object continued its flight to the north. It was still visible at approximately an azimuth of 20 degrees (true), and at approximately 20-30 degrees angle of elevation. I have checked www.Heavens-Above.com, and no Iridium satellite was visible from the witnesses’ location for the evening of April 20, 2009.  Also, the ISS was not visible from the location on this date, and no Space Shuttle was in orbit on this date. My impression is that the object was not a tumbling booster (ullage) in orbit, many of which I have witnessed.  It was dramatically brighter than the many boosters I have witnessed, and there apparently was no regular periodicity to the flare-up of the object; it flared only once, during the observation. Note:  Both witnesses, who have normal color perception, had the impression that the object had ""color"" to it, when it flared dramatically.  The second witness reported that he thought he witnessed a ""purple"" tint to the light, during the flare-up, although the color change was subtle. Both witnesses are quite familiar with satellites in the night sky, and both have been witness to over-flights of the ISS, most recently on March 25, 2009, at 20:05 hrs. (Pacific) when both the ISS and Space Shuttle were visible, flying in formation, in the northern sky.  They had performed their undocking maneuver at 13:35 hrs., on that date. I remain mystified by this event.  If anyone can identify a satellite or ullage that would have been visible from our location, at the time and date indicated, I would be most grateful if you would please submit that information to NUFORC, so that they can post that information, to supplement this report. Thank you!",2009-05-12T00:00:00,47.42069999999999,-118.3997

For the last three nights it has been observed at a 15 minute earlier time in the evening.  The light flashes with a period of 60 seconds and only lasts for 10-15 minutes. It is possibly a satellite but is unusual in that it has very little motion across the sky and is at a very high azimuth from the horizon (approx 80 degrees), I would expect to see geosynchronous satellites at about 30 degrees azimuth from the horizon at this latitude.

It was approximately the same brightness as the stars comprising the Plough.   I watched it for about five seconds as it dawned on me that it can't be a star, whereupon it gradually faded to nothing, taking about another three seconds to do so.

Yesterday night, right around 11:45pm I witnessed 2 Orange glowing balls.  It was distant, but was bright enough to reflect light off of Little Lake George on the St. Johns river in North Florida.  I was looking almost exactly South, With a clear view of the Stars and the moon was not a factor, it was behind me.  It was Clear,  but with Clouds that had rolled in off of the Atlantic. It was in the sky when I noticed it.   I smoked a cigarette watching it, I'd say 7 minutes total time watching it.  It looked at first as if it was stationary, but very high in the air.  I'd obviously say no more than 6 miles away.  Stayed stationary for about 5 1/2 minutes.  It started moving at an incredible speed from right to left then down lower and lower away and down below the horizon, never losing luminosity.   I've spent a lot of time in that spot, and I've never seen that before. I've seen night training, I've seen jets buzzing the tops of trees, following the river down to the ra! nge.  Not that big, Not that bright. No exhaust vents on a jet can put out that much light,  There is nothing in that direction, no light, no civilization for that matter for about 30-35 miles. The lake goes out for 2 miles, and reflected the light. Around 30 miles down the river and through the forest is the Ocala National Forests Bombing range.  I've seen Flares, I've seen training over that thing more than once, Night and Day.  After the bombing range is the Umatilla Municipal Airport.  Way too far away, in my opinion, that's around 50-60 or greater miles away.  If it were a flare, from a boat on Lake George, once again, I'd have ruled it out. There were visible aircraft in the Area, with green and red lights, blinking. They were obvious commercial Aircraft. I called my friend, explained what was going on, while watching it. That was 3 minutes in. He works at a Government facility near Jacksonville and asked if he was busy with anything that night, I'll keep that interpretation up to you. There is a Power Station North of the site, and I thought well maybe it is some kind of reflection. He said no.  He will talk to me in person soon about this, But because of the sensitivity of his job, I'm not sure if he will.  He's a close friend though. As for myself, That's where I was, that's what I saw. My  Anonymousness is no matter,  My Personal description is one of a College Educated Young man. I don't have any experience with Military Aircraft, but talked to someone via phone during the event that does. I've also never seen a UFO or anything for that matter that I can't explain easily.

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter,  I thank  you very much for having my UFO sighting report published on your website.  However , I must admit that I felt slightly ridiculed as someone had written his own evaluation of what I saw on that report by  adding the following lie to it "" possibly Jupiter in the southern sky"" .   The trees where the UfO was silently floating are  30 ft away from my house!  One cannot put a planet in those trees!  The ufo was directly behind the trees, moving and changing its appearance. I saw the perfectly bright lights in detail and its pulsating lights.  Planets do not move, display lights and change appearance.  This was a moving object not  Jupiter.  I feel slightly insulted by this odd addition to my Report. It should not be there.     Best,  ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  The witness may be correct, but we believe it is the rare UFO that hangs around for an hour and a half.

I have watched the video several times now and loaded it onto you tube. I do not think this is a convential aircraft or a military aircraft. It appears to be moving in the video and somewhat metallic in how it reflects the light. If this video had been shot at normal speed i would have thought nothing of it and dismissed it as a aircraft.

If we sped up it would catch up with us and be right by us once again, it was So very fast!! A few times along the way we could see the light from a differant angle and see it coming directly at us then when finally catching up to us it would turn back straight and go right along with us. There were no flashing lights, just a white light. At one point i looked to see it behind us and we sped up trying to lose it, not even 5 sec later seeing it had already made it in front of us. it would back off the more we stared at it, only to come right back and follow us again.  At one point we had slowed down and in amazement of what this could be we were just really trying to figure it out and all of a sudden the light just slowly dimmed to nothing.  In shock we quickly pulled over and couldnt believe it had just vanished.  Not even 5sec later it slowly reappeared.  No clouds in that area at time.  We found a gas station and stood outside staring at it for probably a good 10 min.  It just stayed in place.  But when we pulled out, it Sped up REALLY fast to catch up with us!

Drving from Bozeman to Belgrade.  I saw something streak north in the sky; I thought I was seeing a shooting star (I have only seen about 4-5 in my lifetime), but then it went behind clouds, and I could see it partially obscured by the clouds, and continue in a straight, maybe barely arcing path. There was no accompanying roar as if it was a plane or jet, and it was not as fast as a shooting star, but faster than any plane I have seen.  My roommate was in the car (passenger seat), but he did not see anything, and I kept asking him if he saw it, and he said no.  It was only one object I saw. I grew up around the space center in Clear Lake, Texas, and have seen shuttle launches in Florida when I was a kid, and my best description is if a shooting star had a bit of a trail that disappeared as soon as it was made.  It was traveling South to North, and was too bright and constant to be a star, along with being too big.  It flew just behind some clouds, continued on and then disappeared. I do not know what to make of this, but this is not the first time I have seen something weird in the sky here in Montana.  I Arrived in Bozeman December 23rd, 2009, and last Friday (July 16th) I saw a very strange object in the sky that I mistook for a star, until it moved, leading me to believe it was a plane, but then it moved in very tight curves and zig-zagged.  After about 1 minute it disappeared, but then I could only see it with peripheral vision, and could not observe it if I looked directly at it.  My roommate was outside with me as well, and witnessed and confirmed the object, it's movement, and then it only being observable with peripheral vision.

Time: Around midnight EST  Location: Greenville, Ohio   Description:  Around midnight EST I was alone outside letting my dog out and looked up to the Northwest sky and saw a bright orange spherical ""thing"" in the sky.   At first it looked like a hot air balloon possibly on fire, but then it was moving too fast to be one and looked less like one the closer it got.  There was a darker center to this object.  Size wise, the object would be more comparable to the size of the moon than to any stars from our perspective on Earth and much larger than any meteor I have seen.   It was about the size that a dime looks when extending your arm fully and looking up at it.  It was closer to the ground than a plane would be flying, but higher than a bird would be flying in the sky.   The object was not at all comparable to fireworks, remote controlled airplanes, etc.  It had an orange glow emitting from it which looked almost like fire does, although I could see no flames.  It moved toward the Northern sky and disappeared out of sight.  At first the glowing object was stationary but then it started moving.  The flight pattern was mostly horizontal, although it did rise straight up and go straight down twice and it moved diagonally in the sky once.  This all happened in a matter of 30 - 45 seconds if not longer I would guess.  It was much quicker than a plane would be viewed moving in the sky, although it did hesitate a few times.   There were no sounds associated with this. Witness:  I was the only witness to this at my location and did not have a camera or video recorder on me.

PD)) Four light orbs that disappeared and reappeared in West Chester, OH 7/16/10 UFO Sighting July 16, 2010 in West Chester, Ohio   At approximately 9:40pm at XXXX Ridgetop Drive, Cincinnati, OH, I and two friends were walking out of Monster Golf towards the parking lot when to the North, we saw orbs in the sky above a dark, wooded area. These lights were yellow in color and there were 4 of them.  They were all floating in a straight, diagonal line.  Slowly, one by one the lights began to disappear until there was only one left.  Then, the lights all started to reappear one by one until there were 4 again.   All while this pattern was happening, the whole formation was moving downwards.  After watching it for about a minute, it eventually reached down to the earth but we couldn’t see it anymore as it was hid by the trees.  Every 5 seconds or so, a faint yellow light was seen behind the trees, as if the UFO had landed. We know it can’t be planes or helicopters because planes do not flicker their lights on and off, they do not maintain this weird formation, and there is no runway near this location.

Close Encounter of the 5th Kind. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious-minded report.

Immediately after sitting down I began meditating.  I visualized in my mind my exact location.  First I began far out in space looking at the entire United States, and then I moved into Oregon, then to the Coast, then to the Bandon area.  After that I repeatedly drew my zipcode in my mind.  Then, in my mind still, I traced the roads that lead to my property.  When I had finished giving this mental beacon I watched the sky.  At approx. 6:45 pm I witnessed white lights dancing on the horizon.  Each time they made a sudden flash or sharp turn I would hold my lighter up and flash back.  Soon they were coming closer to me.  When they passed behind a cloud nearly above my head I did not see them for 10 seconds or so.  I looked back at the horizon to see if they had retreated there and when I looked back up in the sky above my head I saw a blazing orange trapezoid (sides longer than top ! and bottom) appear approx. 300 ft. up just inside the bottom of the cloud layer.  It's size was equal to a baseball at arms length.  It got very bright and slowly dissipated.  I had not been frightened when I saw them at a distance on the horizon, but once it was right above my head I became very frightened.  Just as the trapezoid vanished another light with the same color appeared in the trees on the property adjacent to ours.  I knew there were no lights conventional lights where this light had manifested.  The orange light flashed 5 or 6 times.  At this point I was too afraid to continue with the experience.  Later, I kicked myself for not investigating. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCE))  This is an adjunct to my sighting report of January 21st, 2010.  As reported, I witnessed a fire orange trapezoid shape illumined in the sky approx. 300 ft. above my head and 30-40 ft. in front of me following an observation of three white lights dancing on the horizon.  Just as the trapezoid disappeared a light of the same color lit up a patch of forest on an adjacent property where I knew there should not be any source of light.  Obviously this was quite shocking for me.  The next day I walked up to the same spot I had been standing the previous night.  I was questioning my sighting and sanity because it was just too vivid and close.  It is one thing to see lights dancing around far off in the atmosphere, but it is quite another experience to have something happen directly over your head at a close distance.  So I went up there again to see if I could see anything else in the daytime.  I watched the sky where the trapezoid had appeared for five minutes or so and decided that I would go back to the house.  When my eyes retreated from the sky and came down to Earth I saw something very strange on the ground directly below the spot where I had seen the trapezoid.  I approached the strange spot on the ground.  It was the body of my dog that went missing approx. 2 months previous.  I was shaken when I put all the events of the past 24 hours together.  It is my feeling that this is not at all a case of animal mutilation, rather, it is my strong conviction that I was led to the spot for a sign of intent on behalf of whatever force was controlling the lights in the sky.

She is of sound mind and on no medications. She does not take drugs nor is she prescribed medications that would cause delusions, hallucinations or any other side-effects.  She does drink alcohol but no alcohol was in her system for at least 24 hours prior to event. Note: The rest of this report will be ""penned"" in the first-person context by the Observer. Event: I was getting ready to finally get some sleep after a long week of work, and admittedly, was extremely tired. The hour was very late, but I am actually very accustomed to not getting much sleep. As I was getting ready for bed, I heard what I would describe as a screeching/crackling sound that sounded almost like an animal, though I can't figure out what type. I went outside my front door to my yard, which is 30 meters from the street and extremely dark. No lights were on in the front portion of the house so there was a very clear view of the sky. The witness exited a few seconds behind me and we both heard the noise again and noticed at approximately 75 degrees E from our location / 20 degrees above the horizon, a dull-white craft circling around the North End of Boise. It was just below the cloud deck which was estimated to be approximately 1800 feet above the ground. It emitted noise a third time and circled around in a somewhat erratic manner. I reached for an extr! emely bright flashlight (StreamLight STRION LED), which is basically about as bright as the high beams of a car... I shined it towards the craft. There was no reflection. However, it did produce the following reactions and data. 1) Craft stopped suddenly and started heading towards us 2) Craft changed shape and luminosity became greater 3) There was a noticeable crackle sound in the atmosphere (similar to lightning in the distance; note that there was no precipitation nor any Stratocumulus clouds or similar type clouds to produce lightning--nor were the weather conditions such to generate lightning) 4) Craft appeared to be approximately 1000 feet away (based on known distance that flashlight can illuminate and known distance of background objects) 5) Craft was estimated to be about 8-10 meters in diameter  Craft circled for the first 15-18 seconds, then stopped, changed shape and headed towards us, became much brighter, then headed North at an estimated 300-400 mph before disappearing above the clouds. Although there is Boise Airport and Gowen Field, there were no aircraft flying. I have an application (FlightTracker Pro) that tracks flights (including some military aircraft without N-numbers). There was 100% cloud coverage so it was not a planet, star, or satellite. Also note that I track the ISS with 'ISSLite', and satellites with TLE Files on 'Satellite Tracker'  I do not know what this object was, but it was the latest in a flurry of objects that I've witnessed above Boise in the past year. It's become one of my hobbies! And it yielded a video that I submitted to Mr. Davenport on Jan 16th. Please come forward if you have any sightings in Boise as I personally can attest to at least 30 that in my opinion, were not aircraft, atmospheric effects, other manmade craft/materials, or near or far space base objects (stars/planets/etc).

While traveling north through Peekskill, through the windshield of my Locomotive I witnessed an object flying from west to east over the Hudson River where Annsville Creek meets the Hudson.  It passed in front of me approximately one hundred feet above the ground.  It traveled at or about the speed of a fast moving single engine aircraft or helicopter.  It didn't have the normal formation lights you would see on an aircraft.  It had one amber light that flashed at a rate of about 5 times per second.   I was not able to determine a shape or size even though it did pass through my headlight beam at a distance of about 300 feet in front of me.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about the size of a beachball.   After passing in front of me, the object turned slightly south and at this point I was able to see it from behind while I was traveling around a bend in the railroad track.  The object continued to fly in the southeast direction towards the wooded hillside that! separates Annsville creek and Route 9.  I lost sight of it a few seconds later because my own train was now blocking my view.   I watched for a few more seconds over my train to see if this object would rise up to clear the hillside and go over Route 9 and that was the last I saw of this object.   About an hour later I was traveling southbound on my return trip and looked around for evidence of a crash only it was too dark to see anything on the hillside.

They were somewhat reflective either white or silver and glinted as if they were moving yet stayed stationary for the most part.   One of them seemed larger, possibly because it was nearer and had a sort of  parachute shape.  Some ladies saw me taking pictures and we all started looking at the objects trying to figure out what they were.   At first we thought they might be parachutes, but they were hovering in the same position for too long. We also guessed they might be balloons.   After about a minute or so of staying in a fairly stable pattern, they started to spread out and change positions.  They looked like star constellations.

I thought that could be military airplanes, since I live near the air force academy. But then I saw something real strange, the light had become stationary about 15 seconds, and then I make some things real strange.

First, let me say that I have seen this type of incident many times in my life, but this is the first time I am reporting it. I got up at approx. 4 am, because of a bad dream.   I walked into my living room which is all glass, and the night sky was exceptionally clear, no clouds.  In between some palm fronds I noticed something that was EXTREMELY bright, like a planet, but upon further inspection, I noticed it had a somewhat strange shape, somewhat of a triangle, with a larger flat top and pointed bottom.  It seemed to be "" pulsing"" bright, dimmer,brighter, dimmer, AND was moving in a jerky side to side motion, while very slowly moving upward, I lined my head up with the wall of the sliding glass door to make sure I wasn't moving and I watched this thing making a weird, loopy motion, sort of wobbling here and there, but always slowly moving upwards, while it still kept getting VERY bright, then dimming, and getting bright, over and over.  I know it wasn't a plane, or a helicopter, or a satellite, or a star, etc........ and as I said, I have seen this same type of "" star like"" object, ( MANY times through my life from the time I was a teenager, and I am now 56) that if you were to just glance at it, would seem like a planet or star, but if you start to stare at it, you notice it is doing very bizarre things, just subtlely, as you study it. I once observed an object like this on a beach in Oxnard, Calif. at 5 am. which was just above the horizon of the ocean.  Some surfers were in the ocean, and the sun was just barely starting to come up.  The object went directly into the ocean !!!!!   I was STUNNED, and apparently the surfers were too because they started yelling and screaming and going wild !!!! We had all witnessed something of the most bizarre nature, not knowing what to think.   I witnessed the object I am reporting now, for about 30-40 min. before I noticed it started waning in intensity, and it just "" went out"" and vanished in a perfectly clear night sky............

The computer is in front of the window.  The window was open.  I noticed a very bright object in the sky. I thought it was a plane on fire, heading towards the ocean. First point of observation  The window faces Southeast and is 3’x3’. The object moved from E to SE, horizontal with a slight ascending direction, just over the tree top, (tree is about 40’ high and about 100’ from window. The shape was cylinder like, (side view of a plane, without the tail, no wings).  Using the size of the window, 3’x3’ as a reference and a piece of tape on the window to represent the object, the tape would be about 1 to 1 1/2  long, and 1/4 wide. The color was  an orange-yellow-red liquid fire and was moving/flowing/changing within the cylinder.  It was very bright,  and had depth, as if you could see into it.  (It did not appear to be a flat surface, but a surface with depth)  There was no glow or halo around it and no trailing tail.  All the light was contained within the cylinder.  No sound. Second point of observation  As the object neared the outer edge of the window, I went outside to continue observation.  (Retraced steps today and it takes approx. 45 secs. to get to where I was standing last night.)  The object was not where I thought it would be, instead, it was stationary and enlarged into a circle. (I thought the plane had exploded.  There was no sound and nothing falling from the circle.)  The light was contained within the circle, there was no halo and it was not as bright as the cylinder light.  There was still movement within the light.  The circle dimmed, brightened, dimmed again and then blinked out. I returned to the house and checked the time:  10:45 PM. Standing in the same place today, I noticed the size of the circle and location of the circle was almost in the same place as the (whole)  Moon was at 5:24 PM today .

I am a fifty-six year old male and I’ve debated about reporting this event for several days.  A friend of mine is a believer and he encouraged me to tell you about what happened last Monday.  My son and I were working on the exterior of one of our customer’s buildings.  My son was on the roof at the northeast corner and I was on the ground looking up at his position.  It was a beautiful day with bright blue skies and wispy clouds at the horizon.  I was observing all the planes that were in the sky above us and was amazed how many there were at that time.  The contrails were long and well defined.  As I was watching the planes and keeping an eye on my son I noticed an object coming into to my line of sight from my left.  It was traveling from my north to the south, directly behind the building we were working on, at about 60 to 80 feet above the ground.  When I first focused on the object to determine what I was seeing, I dismissed a bird because there were no wings, no head, no movement a bird normally makes when it flies, ie; beating wings, up and down pattern as the a bird raises and lowers it’s wings in flight darting back and forth, etc.  Was it a radio controlled plane?  No.  Then I really started to focus, because this was making me uncomfortable.  I yelled at my son so he could verify what I was witnessing.  He did not acknowledge me.  He was busy.  I really yelled his name again and he raised his head in frustration.  What!  He yelled back.  Look! Look! Look!, I said.  Did you see that?  I said to him.  See What?, he asked.  That thing that just went behind the building in the sky.  No!, he said.  See what, Dad?  I paused for a moment, not believing what I had seen and that no one would ever believe what I saw. Well, here comes the important part.  Details of what I saw last Monday.  There was a railroad track behind the building and the object was following the tracks or at least it seemed to be.  This, whatever it was, was about 60 to 80 feet above the ground and traveling at about 80 miles per hour.  It was small, about the size of a beachball.  (Not sure because things don’t look as big when they’re elevated that high.)  With my first description, to my son, I thought it was the size of a bowling ball and white in color.  After I replayed this sighting in my mind I changed that description.  It looked like the end of a Q-Tip.  It was almost fuzzy and the color matched the clouds in the horizon.  The only reason I saw it was I was looking up and the blue skies allowed me to spot it.  If I had been on the same plane with the object it would have blended into the clouds in the horizon.  One of the more interesting things to me was that it was traveling as if it were on a rail.  It never varied in it’s path.  It never ascended or descended.  I’ve never seen anything that didn’t vary a bit one way or the other.  Anyway, I watched the object until it blended into the clouds in the horizon at about ½ mile to the south of my location.  The fuzziness that surrounded the object seemed to be consistent.  It didn’t change or pulse.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,,

Ok so I was out smoking a cigarette with my girl friend and I noticed something in the sky that was moving very oddly. I burst with excitement. I had seen this same exact object or “UFO” if you will, in the sky about a month or so before at night while smoking a cigarette out on my deck. I was the only witness that time. So anyways, I asked my girl friend “do you see that?” and she said “yes I see something in the sky moving fast then slow and in weird directions”. “Yes that’s exactly what I see” I said. I then ran in to my apartment to get my roommates so that they could take a look. They both saw it too and they thought it was odd also. But they didn’t stick around to watch and they went back inside. I stayed a little longer to see if the objects behavior would change. It seemed to get further away. The UFO was in the sky in the direction of Lebanon NH a neighboring town to Canaan. The UFO seamed to stay in the same kind of region of the sky. Ok so the UFO looked like a saucer from the side. It looked like it had a row of sequencing lights along the length of it. It had a red light in the center and two lights on the sides of the red light. Sometimes the two lights on either side of the red light were blue and sometimes they were white. Most of the time they were white but when they were blue it was brilliantly bright like the red one. So at all times the UFO had three lights constantly blinking. When I stood still it seemed to move more and when I moved around a lot it seemed to ….well try and hide from me like it could see me or sense me looking, and it would stop moving and would stand still or even stop blinking and look like a star. It was bizarre. This object was making shapes with its movements such as triangles, half squares, what I mean by half squares I mean shapes like this. It would go back and forth and up and down or in a direction but at an angle. It was doing half circles like this C. I mean seriously I’ve never seen any object in the sky make these movements before. I’ve watched lots of shows about UFOs in my life and they seemed very similar to some of the things I saw.

It is what I believe to be known as a flap, only not so many people seem to be spotting them. One other person has seen three before, unknown others may have too. I was putting the rubbish outside when I spotted the UFO in the sky, directly adjacent to my house. I jusually check now and this is the second time in under two weeks. I rushed to the window upstairs for a better look, and used my torch and a list of morse codes to try to establish contact. All that happened was that the UFO (which was perfectly still in the sky, only differentiating from a star by its flashes and colour changes) flashed more sporadically. I gave up on contact, seeing it couldn't communicate back. I got my mother and showed her it, but being a sceptic she glanced at it and just said it was a star. However she likes to deny it, she is a witness to this too. Then anothe UFO or possibly more (I couldn't tell) flew north west past my house, just like many before them. The first one stayed still, and the others dissapeared from view. I then tried morse coding them to take me onboard, in the hopes of some third kind encounter. At this point a very bright light came flying past from behind a tree. At first I thought it was one coming for me, as it seemed to be getting closer. However it flew past, and even now I can not tell whether it was a UFO or a stealth fighter. It had three lights in a triangular pointed layout, but I do not wish to jump to conclusions. Another UFO then seemed to come and head north east, after the stealth fighter. I did not see much but a faint shimmer of this one, leading me to wonder whether or not in my current excited situation my eyes were playing tricks. However when I settled down to report it to my friends on the internet site Facebook a heard a loud rumble. I looked out of the window to find a plane or jet on its side, heading extremely fast north east. This is a clear sign that the RAF is now involved, and most likely RAF Cosford. Please look into this, as I have pleaded many times something big could be happening here and I seem to be the only one to realise it. Also a few weeks ago I had another sighting which I did not report, in which I saw one of them taking off from a nearby field.

I was outside on my back porch smoking a cigarette, when I noticed what I thought to be the light of a plane to my left. (west or south/west) then I notice it wasn’t moving so I thought it to be a star, however too bright to be, then I remembered my wife telling me of an asteroid that recently passed earth.   So, I began to think that’s what I was seeing, for it was too big and bright to be a normal star.  I then heard what I knew was an airplane coming from behind me heading towards the same direction.  (I was in the back porch and the flight line is about ten blocks in front of my house give or take.)  At that time I notice the ""star like"" light rise, then I began to notice a flashing light from the bottom left and the airplane was passing under it.  The object began to slowly move to the right in front of me.  As it did it did the airplane was coming up on the object and the plane looked different from what I was used to at night.  I definitely could identify the airplane, a little further away than the object, in a normal flight path that I usually see them.  For airplanes tend not to fly too close over base housing from what I’m used to.   However the plane was darker than usual. The object moved at a slower pace closer to me, allowing the plane to pass below it. I thought it was a helicopter, trying to convince myself with the fact that it was a hovering light in the distance at first. But there was no chopper sound, for it how close it was.  I then noticed the dark outline similar to a large helicopter or even a shoe.  I saw a bluish light on what would be the tail of the helicopter. The bright light was now towards what would be the windshield of the helicopter now a little dimmer since I believed to be seeing it from the side, a blinking light under the rear and a red light on the bottom towards the front about a third of a distance from the front.  The lights were definitely brighter than the plane. I also saw that the lights of the object were projecting on the body of it. Giving me somewhat of an idea of how the body was shaped other than a silhouette. So as it flew away to my right, (East, north/east) it was very wide in the back.  The bluish light still visible.  The bright light dimmer, but still visible.  Narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. And a smaller blinking white light towards the left center of the rear. Reddish light also still visible, but also dimmer.  There was also a glow coming from the center of the object, running in a line almost the entire rear.  I believe it could have been interior lights or just the exterior lights projecting on the outside curvature. The reason I believe it to be strange was the fact that the airplane was darker than I was used to and also that it appeared to be there only to make a sound everyone was familiar with to make up for the strange object in the night sky tonight.  Also, the fact that it was close enough for me to see the outline and the lights projecting on the outside and the fact that it was hovering for about five minutes.  But considering the hovering and the distance of the object, there were no sounds of a helicopter, nor any other aircraft coming from this particular object.   As it flew away the plane was ahead of it to the left. That was about two hours ago.  On Fairchild Air force base WA.

The object, as stated earlier, moved erratically for a short time then stopped and hovered for about 5 minutes. The photo numbered 705 is the picture of the object just hovering.  Once stopped we could tell that it was shaped circular like a doughnut with lights of every color around the outside of the craft with a solid center.

The larger light was similar to the brightness of Venus on a clear night. The smaller light more consistant to the brightness of a typical satelite.  I ran inside to get other witness's,apon returning we all watched them fly completly silent and in a perfect straight line almost directly over our home.  I took note that the stars where visible between the two lights as it flew giving the impression of being two objects, although these two lights stayed in pefect unison untill roughly 3 minutes into the sighting roughly (1 mile past our home) when the trailing-smaller light slowly moved and to the lower right of the bigger light.  It's very possible if the two were connected-the object could have been tilting to give this effect.  The object made no sound whatsoever. Nobody felt paranoia only exitement and extreme wonderment.  We watched it untill, at about a quarter at arms length from the horizon, it suddenly (not instantly) both blinked out out.If these two lights were connected it would have been absolutely massive, football stadium sized would be an understatement.

Eventually it got to be at such an elevation, it was hard to keep up with and make out anymore.  Moments later, I noticed even further southeast, it seemed to have two other identical objects waiting for it.

The incident occurred somewhere between 5:15 pm and 5:25 pm.  It was a sunny day with a bright blue sky. It was cloudless. We were laying on our backs looking up at the sky.  I noticed a pigeon sitting on top of a lamp post that was in the park.  I noticed a small white object floating down to the earth.  I thought the object was a feather that had fallen from the bird.  For some reason, I was fixated on it and watched it float to the ground. I told my friend to look at the feather and pointed out that it was taking a really long time to hit the ground.  All of a sudden (and I know this sounds strange,) the ""feather"" went up higher in the air instead of coming down.   At first I thought a gust of wind blew it higher. Then, all of a sudden it appeared to shoot through the sky up and over to the right above some houses.  The way it was traveling did not seem plausible by Science.  It shot FAST across the sky as if the sky was sucking it in.  Like it was traveling through another dimension. I don't know if it was actually a feather that we noticed which drew our attention to the small white object or if the feather transformed into the white object.  But it flew SO fast and high and eventually disappeared.  As it got further away it looked less and less like a feather and more like a tiny white dot that was glowing. Like a shooting start that went up instead of down.  I hope this made sense. I looked around to see if anyone else in the park was noticing it but no one was.  My friend that was with me saw the exact same thing.  I had him describe to me in detail what he witnessed to make sure I wasn't seeing things.

There has to be a rational explanation for this sighting.  I'm sure there is.  And I'm really curious to identify it. I'm in Valencia, CA.  After midnight on March 27, 2010, I came upstairs and immediately noticed a blue light (like a huge glowing LED) emanating from outside the large window in the baby's room.  Looking outside, I could clearly see three rows of brilliant blue lights hovering low to the ground over the mountains -- perhaps a mile away.  I had an eerie sensation seeing this unidentified object, as I had never seen anything like it before.  The mountains are free of houses or any man-made structures, so it was completely out of place and very prominent. I immediately ran to grab my Sony Cyber-shot.  After taking a few pictures, I tried to take a video, but it was not very clear.  So I ran downstairs and got my Panasonic DVX-100 and started filming with that.  The video doesn't begin to do it justice, but at least it's something.  You can see a blue-lit object just hovering there.  From what I could make out, there were 3 rows of brilliant blue lights and one pulsating red light at the top in the middle.  (You hear me describe this on the video.)  There appeared to be slight movement or rotation, but I can't say that with any certainty. After the camera battery ran out, I watched the object for a few more minutes and then went back downstairs and tried to convince myself that there was a rational explanation.  I came up fifteen minutes later and the object was still there.  Went to bed soon after, so I'm not sure how much longer it stuck around.  Kicking myself for not continuing to watch, but quite frankly, I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing.  It was only the following morning when I reviewed the footage that it really began to sink in. To be certain, I recorded video out the window at the same time the following two nights, but no lights appeared.  I searched around online to see if anyone else reported a similar sighting.  It looks like there were two other reports on or around March 27 -- one in Tracy, CA and one in Blue Lake, CA.  Specifically, I believe both of those reports also cited the pulsating red light atop blue lights. I have both video and pictures of the object.  Happy to upload or provide original footage if it's helpful.  Would appreciate any info.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,34.42961198156682,-118.57039631336404

On the 24th of October, 2008 I and two friends were driving back to our hotel in Pismo Beach, California on California highway 101 southbound about 6 miles north of the town of Pismo Beach.  At 7:29 PM, a bright orange light arose from behind a hill ahead SSE of our position.  It initially put me in mind of a helicopter pointing a searchlight directly at us because of the intensity of the light.  After about 20 seconds of  watching and guessing as to the nature of said light, I pulled out my cell phone (while driving, so the video is not only poor, but shaky) and filmed a short video.  The light dimmed as it rose making me initially think it was a flare, so I watched for telltale signs.  It did not seem to accelerate (as a non-propelled projectile at -9.8 m/s^2), it seemed to be rising at a constant velocity.  I was unable to watch it with the attention it deserved until I was able to pull off the highway at the next exit.  So the next paragraph will be the event as described by the passenger sitting in the rear right seat between its initial rise into the air to the time we were able to get out of the car. My friend driving the car pointed out a flying object ahead of us. It seemed to be to close to be an airplane and didn’t look like one either. We traced it as it seemed to get farther away from us until it was just visibly the size of a bight star. We kept our eyes on it as we pulled off the highway, there we watched it for another minute or so before it abruptly disappeared. I was taking quick glances up at the light as it rose higher and became dimmer and more angled.  The light seemed to be becoming more triangular (isosceles with the most acute angle seemingly pointing northwest).  It seemed to be traveling more westward over the ocean.  Eventually the light became a single point and was only distinguishable from the stars around it because it still had the characteristic orange color that it had when it first came into view over the nearby hill.  We pulled the car off the freeway at around 7:32 PM, immediately parked and got out of the car to pay full attention (we think it was Spyglass Drive, but we weren’t focused on the name of the exit at the time).  The light was suspended in the same position from our perspective and compared to its original size was at least a factor of 4 or 5 times its initial distance from us (just a size ratio and some simple trigonometry).  And that being the case, I’m able to determine that it was not descending (unless moving towards me simultaneously, which is easily verified by intuition or vector analysis).  That being the case, the light remained at the same intensity as we discussed what it could possibly be.  I was looking very closely and it seemed that it was getting slightly brighter.  But just about as soon as I made that realization, the light “turned off”.  It looked like it either burned out or went very quickly away from us.  I started writing this record of the event at about 7:50 PM and have now finished it at 8:58 PM, making sure to be as clear and accurate as I possibly can. As a side note, I just had a friend read this just a few minutes after I finished writing it.  He was driving another vehicle with another of our friends with him.  The report from them is they saw it as well and one reports seeing another similar “object” in the northwest direction during the event described above.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,35.1546,-120.6595

If the cloud had a tail the light moved out to the tip, then retraced it's path, then moved along the outside parimeter of the cloud.  All three lights were doing the same thing with the cloud it was in.  They were following the outside parimeter of the clouds no matter what shape the cloud changed into.  Then the lights started to jump from cloud to cloud.  Two lights didn't remain in the same cloud at the same time though.  One would immediately jump to another cloud when another light came into it's cloud.  It was so awesome to watch this.  My daughter and I couldn't believe what we were seeing.  It was like each light was a ball of electricity moving around in the cloud.  But there was no lightening, no thunder, no dark clouds, no storm at all.  The clouds started to loose their density and their individual shapes.  The clouds were thinning out and started to join together into one ball of mist when we noticed the lights were starting to run into each but would bounce off in opposite directions as soon as they touched.  It was like they were magnets with the polarities repelling each other.  We have no idea what we were watching but we were both very disappointed when the lights stopped.  They didn't fly off they were just gone as the clouds became too misty.  I! t was li ke someone just flicked the light switch off.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,53.52298881322957,-113.5039614461738

I am a police sergeant and while on duty on Friday (10/24/08) at approximately 22:20hrs., I observed about 10-15 amber colored lights floating or flying upwards.  I was parked in a downtown parking lot facing north when this occurred.  I iniatially observed 3 lights spaced pretty equally apart, but at slightly different altitudes.  Because of the downtown horizon I was unable to ascertain if they were coming up from the ground or just a slightly lower altitude.   These lights appeared to be coming from the northeast east quadrant of Marion County (about 10 miles away from me).   After noticing and watching the first three lights, I observed 3 or 4 more about 20-30 seconds behind, ascending in the same manner as the first 3. I then observed approximatly 6-8 more of these objects floating or flying upwards from the same area.  After getting so high into the sky the objects disappeared.   There was a cloud cover on this night, as we did have rainfall off and on.  I am not sure if the lights or objects just burned out or I was unable to see due to the clouds.  The puzzeling thing was that the clouds were going from west to east, and these objects were floating upwards from east to the west, into the wind, but only at a very gradual change.  Because these objects were going into the wind rather than with the wind, I quickly dismissed them as balloons of any kind but I could be wrong.   I have never seen anything like this before but there could be a legitimate reason for them.  I am just curious what they were.   I did watch the 6am newscast when I returned home from work and did not see any mention of the lights for legitimate or unknown purposes.  I did email the Indianapolis Star to see if they knew what the lights were, but so far I have not received a response.  I also observed what appeared to be a commercial aircraft heading towards the lights, but the lights had cleared its path by time the aircraft arrived in the area.  I would suspect there was a good possibility the aircraft pilots observed these lights as well.  The aircraft was going from the west to the east ( I assume leaving Indpls. Intn. Airport).   Several hours later when I returned to that spot (where I sit until a run comes out) I did observe what is mistakenly called a ""shooting star"" in the area.  This one appearred to be closer and brighter then ones I have seen in the past, but this could just be coincidence.  I just figured I would report it in case anyone else had seen it and no explanation could be found for the lights presence.  I also attempted to take cellphone pics and video of objects, but on review you can not see them due to poor camera quality on cellphone",2008-10-31T00:00:00,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

As we live in the country, we have a beautiful night sky.  We often star gaze and get out our telescope to observe…  Upon getting out of our vehicles, I noticed a light shining through a very large pine tree that is in our yard.  I recognized that it was peculiarly large and so I walked over to look at it.  I walked around the tree to observe the light and realized I wasn’t looking at an airplane or helicopter.  There were approximately 8-12 large red lights in a perfect horizontal line, just above the tree line.  We live on a ridge top so I had almost a 360 degree panoramic view of the sky. I did not notice a body of the aircraft, however but couldn’t stop saying “oh my goodness, you guys come look at this.”  Everyone was busy unloading stuff out of the car and it felt like I was talking to myself.  My daughter, 8, came next to me and said, “Mama, what is that?”  There was another line of approximately 5 to 6 lights to the left of the larger set of lights, which were at almost a 35 degree angle. At the very moment I finally said, “oh my goodness, it is a ufo,”  while pretty much jumping up and down in disbelief, the two streams of lights merged together into one and completely disappeared into thin air.  There was no turning around, no smoke from a jet, no noise at all.  I said, “Did anyone see that, did anyone see that?”  My sister in law said she saw the very end of the lights merge together and disappear.  Now, it was dusk and light enough for me to see a body of whatever it was that I saw, but I did not see that.  However, when we went into the house I asked my daughter to draw what she saw.  She is incredibly gifted with art, and has definitely never been exposed to talk of nor seen any movies with ufos.  She had no preconceived perception of what a ufo is…  She drew exactly what I saw with oblong shapes around the lights.  I don’t know why she saw a body around the lights, but she did.  It sounds absolutely crazy, but I think children can sometimes connect with what adults cannot.  Perhaps I was so numb from the lights that I couldn’t comprehend the body of an aircraft type object.  I don’t know. Stranger yet, I called the police department because I wanted to know if anyone else had sighted this.  They said no and just as I was hanging up the telephone, two US Army jets hovered over the area where I saw the unidentified objects.  It was obvious they were looking for something.  When they couldn’t or didn’t see what perhaps appeared on radar (I don’t know how they would know this was there and where it was, etc.) they turned their jets around and faced our home. For a moment, I tried to tell myself this was what I previously saw, however it was much different.  The lights I saw in perspective to being on the ground and standing, where comparable to the size of car headlights.  This is how large they were in the sky.  On top of that, when the jets left, they were extremely loud.  It is very clear when jets hover…the object I saw did not make a single sound.  It disappeared into thin air – in a matter of a second or so it was completely gone. I froze, and cried, in disbelief with my daughter at my side.  My family was relatively upset they didn’t get to see what I saw.  My sister in law was pretty frightened, and said, “I am going to pretend I didn’t’ see what I just saw.”  I said, “I hope this is just the beginning.”  My daughter said, “Mama, what is a ufo?”  My story may be crazy, seem unreal, I don’t know what it sounds like. I have never researched ufo’s but I tell you, once it got into my brain, I tried every way possible to discredit what I saw, and I know that is EXACTLY what I saw.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,43.6114,-90.6436

Then this object came to a complete stand still and started pusling between a very bright orange and a white/orange.  There is no way that a plane pulses like that and can move this way. I almost came to a stop in the car and another one appeared in the same way. But, this one did not seem to race across the sky. It moved to the right away from the other light and then came to an immediate stop.  These two had the same colors.  I am not a scientist but it seemed as if they were communicating with pulsing of lights.  I kept driving and made it to my friends house. Two hours later I am driving back home and saw an orange light in the sky move so fast that the orange light streaked behing it.  Then the light came to a stand still very rapidly.  No more the five seconds later two more lights appeared and they were stationary.  They did not move from appearance to dissapearence. and started flashing between colors again.   All of the lights were lit up for no more than 15 seconds.  When they dissapeared they just faded back to looking like a star and then the lights faded as if there was nothing even there.

Last night (July 31, 2008) around 9:30pm central time, my husband and I witnessed very bright white lights in the distance ‘appear’ and then ‘disappear’ several times. These lights did not move at all.  First one – ‘on’, then ‘off’. (a minute or two pass)  Next one ‘on’, another ‘on’, then both ‘off’. (a minute or two pass as we stare into the night sky above the tree line)  Next one ‘on’, two ‘on’, three ‘on’ (all in a horizontal row evenly spaced) and then all ‘off’. (a minute or two pass)  Then, as I head into the house to get away from the mosquitos (!!), my husband says “one -- two…” so I quickly look back and see one-by-one, four more bright lights turn ‘on’ (closer together than before and more to the left, but still in a straight horizontal line). The six lights turned ‘on’ in sequence from right to left, and all at once, disappeared.  That was the end of our show for the night, but it reminded us of an evening a few years back. We had seen a simlar show, but much closer and much brighter. That night, they reminded me of the rectangle-shape of those bright lights at football games. But these were across the river from us and much higher than any lights would be. Our lights in the house flickered and my phone died while in the middle of telling my mom what we had seen, so I’d had to call her back. It was a similar sequence of light turning ‘on’ in a row, and then all at once, disappearing. If you weren’t looking right then, you’d easily miss it, because they were only lit for about 10 seconds or so.  We never expected to see anything like this again!  Our background:  interest in space, like watching NOVA, but that’s about it.

She saw that last light sparkling before it disappeared. We continued on our walk for about 15 minutes and came to a spot where we could see the sky in full view over the potato field.  We stopped and looked up towards the south to see if we saw something to explain it.  We watched for about 3 minutes.  Then all of a sudden to the SW we saw it again, but this time it was really bright and lasted for about 15-20 seconds.  And it faded out from right to left again, but faster this time. It never appeared to be ""flying"" or moving, just hovered there. It was as high up as a helicopter would fly and about a quarter mile away from us.

The lights moved very quickly and demonstrated great maneuverability. The lights appeared to weave from one side of the estuary to the other in a matter of seconds which leads me to believe that what we saw was no aircraft, but is more likely to be an aerial phenomenon or UFO.

She was as stunned as I was. No sound. No red or green lights on either side of the object. Were these Army drones heading for the Chicago Air show? Were they flying objects that were going to be dislayed at the Oshgosh air show? After we saw the objects, we came inside and called the police, but no one else had reported the sighting. My wife went or neighbors house to see if anyone at their party had seen the strange objects overhead this evening. I still have goosebumps from the sightings. It was very very odd. And very cool at the same time. As my wife has returned from talking to our neighbors, she reported that two people from the party at the house behind us did see three of the lights and wondered what they were and that she spoke to a pilot who was at the party and he didn't know what the lights were either.

We all looked up and noticed three brownish objects gliding through the sky, forming a perfect triangle. For a second, I thought they might be birds, but they were way too still and uniformly spaced. They were also way to low, dimly lit, and fast to be any sort of aircraft I know. The triangle itself blended with the sky behind it, but my friend said he would see the stars behind it disappearing when the triangle passed under them. It took maybe five, ten seconds to completely pass across the sky, and it was completely noiseless. My friends and I were amazed.

Possible UFO Sighting  Alamogordo New Mexico  On November 30th at 2051 Local time (As verified with my Atomic Watch) at my residence in Alamogordo New Mexico, I happened to step outside to check on the weather conditions.  Snow was forecasted for the evening. The weather was overcast with slight rain/sleet.  As I walked around to my drive way I happened on a Bright Orange Light in the night sky.  The object was North by East in direction. I wondered if it could be a meteorite. The object appeared to be travelling horizontally for a few minutes in a westerly direction.  I did not notice any flashing marker lights as usually seen by nearby Military and civilian traffic. There was no trail as found with meteorites. The bright object was below the cloud cover at this time.  I decided to go inside my house and get my wife and get my 8 X 40mm Tasco binoculars. At 2055 the object stopped in mid air just north of my residence.  The object was hovering at this point and my wife was observing it with the binoculars.  At this time the object was just above the cloud cover.  At 2057 my wife went inside the house due to the cold and to attend to our kids.  I continued to observe this object for another minute and it appeared to gradually lose its orange brightness and slowly fade.  It appeared at this time to be going straight up and in a matter of about three seconds disappeared completely. I looked at my watch and noted the time to be 2058. The Orbs brightness was brighter than any aircraft I have witnessed in my 22 years in the U.S. Air Force.  The brightness was equivalent to it being on fire.  I observed the object before it ascended above the cloud cover with the binoculars.  I did notice a variety of red almost pink colors toward the rear of the orb.  No sound was heard. No other aircraft in the sky were visible.  This was a very eerie experience. I then contemplated calling the local Base (Holloman AFB) to report what I had seen.  Being a retired Air Force member myself, I realized this would be a waste of time.  Who do you call at now 2110 at night??  I talked with my wife who is a complete skeptic on the subjects of UFOs.

I have never seen anything like this in my life, and for a person who lives most his life by logic, this just gets to me. First off, this is all in Nags Head, NC, right on the Outer Banks of NC. So as me and my fellow employees go to stop the last go kart race and get the place closed down, we start seeing the lights come up just a couple miles from us(looked like it was coming from the ocean!, but maybe on the beach). It was kind of cloudy out, so all you could see is the lights. It wasnt a steady light, it was more like a flame going straight up, kind of fluttering. So the first that came were 4 of them, they stayed together in a 7 formation, staying so amazingly steady, it looked to form an outline of an insanely huge ship. The first thing that came to mind were those big imperial cruiser or whatever those huge ships that vaders guys rode in in the earliest star wars. Suddenly one of the ships darted off, and it became a straight line, then those broke up. If that wasn't weird enough, they kept coming. There must have been at least 20 of these. The rest did not fly in the same path like the first, more random. Then it gets to the last 2, this is the part that really made me confused. The last 2 were took off with what it looked like just mere feet between them! It was an amazing site, they were right next too each other, then one would get futher forward, then the other would dart out infront, and then the other would get ahead again. This definitely does not seem like a military formation...nor civilian or commercial. Also, for as close as they were, there were no sounds at all coming from that direction, but they looked to be going as fast as jets almost! It was really an amazing site, everyone working and the 15 people who just got off the track, just stood there for 15 minutes watching it. Overall though, I would say the lights lasted for a good 20-30 minutes total, but each one would go from launch to disappear in about 30 seconds to a minut! e, from launching around the ocean to disappearing right above us. Oh! Almost forgot to point out that the guy who owns the place, said the same thing happened last night! I will bring my camera tomorrow night in hope it happens again. But does anyone have any ideas? There has got to be some logical answer, but I am just baffled. Sorry the post is so long, I am still creeped out a bit from it, but any help at all would be greatly appreciated!",2009-06-09T00:00:00,35.885,-75.5911

The object was in the west heading east. I was driving west on Colburn Road. We had just passed Lake Jacomo and were i! n the outskirts of Lee’s Summit. As I got closer and finally under the object I looked up and realized the object was a black triangle and not a plane. It was completely black except for the three lights. I am an educated person who has a B.A. in Psychology and I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Counseling. I am aware of the Gestalt Theories and this was not my brain “filling in” lines. The sky blackened and there was no background filter light between the three lights on the object as it flew past me. The object was flying low and the night sky was not yet completely dark so I was able to get a very good look at it. I said something to my daughter who then looked at it and got very excited exclaiming, “I see it mom it is a triangle! I see it! I see it!” My next thought was it was a B2 bomber because Whiteman Air Force Base is only about 45 minutes away. However, as low as the object was flying it definitely was not a B2 because it was way too small. I have seen those fl! y around our area quite often and they are huge, especially wh! en flyin g low. I asked my daughter if she could track it, and she said she could. I made a u-turn to try and follow the object so I could get ahead of it and stop the car to get a really good look at it while standing still and hopefully take a picture on my cell phone. Unfortunately I lost the object in the street lights when I started heading east. While I was driving west the lights had been on the north side as I looked west. I was basically looking away from the lights and they were on my right side, which was the passenger side of the car. Now that I was driving east, the lights were shining in my eyes on the driver’s side of the car and I could not see the object anymore. However, my daughter still had the object in her sight and I followed it as she guided me. Then as I approached the intersection of 7 Highway and Colburn Road, my daughter stated the object had suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared into some clouds. We lost the object and I was unable to get! a really good look at it while standing still. I don’t know if anyone else witnessed this object in Lee’s Summit tonight and I don’t know exactly what it was. I can only say what it was not. It was not a B2 Bomber because it was too small; and it was not one of the small planes that fly out of the municipal airport in Lee’s Summit because I have never seen any of those planes make that triangle shape. I drive that area daily and nightly to and from work and school and I have lived here for 10 years. I have seen planes come and go from that tiny municipal airport day and night and none of the planes have ever made the triangle shape I saw tonight. Though I am a believer in UFO’s, whenever I observe anything in the sky I do so with a very skeptical mindset. I always think of all possibilities before saying what I saw was “unexplained.” Tonight I honestly cannot think of anything that is as small as the object I saw and makes the shape of the black triangle which I saw in the! sky earlier this evening.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,38.924561847389555,-94.35537228915663

Tonight in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, England (at approx 22:28) we observed what started of as 2 fiery balls in the sky moving up from behind the house behind my sisters this then changed to 3, and eventually 5 different firey balls of light. They seemed to move independently, and moved in different directions and different speeds. They were also different sizes which I guess was to do with distance, some must have started to come closer as they were getting bigger, some getting smaller and dimmer. Over time they seemed to go out of visable range, getting smaller/dimmer before dispearing into the horizon, or shooting up into the sky. A few minutes later there seemed to be 3 more launch off from the ground into the sky, these were in formation. Eventually they all disappeared, but over the course of the next 20mins, more were seen, to be moving around the sky. My guess is they would be over the Clipstone or Ollerton region of Nottinghamshire, England. I have a few blurry photos, and a movie, but as there from my mobile phone there not great.... but they do show 2/3 orange firey balls launching off into the sky... We walked home about 20 minutes later, and the sky seemed to have 3 or 4 low flying jet type aircraft, possibly military in nature. This is unusual as we are not in any normal aeroplane flight path. Also as we walked home my sister called me saying she saw another going across the horizon. This is not the 1st time I have seen weird firey orange lights in the sky moving at high speeds with sudden direction changes... I saw one quite close back in Nov 2007... This time though, the fiery balls were witnessed by 5 different people including adults and a child. 10 other sightings of the same objects all over England were also witnessed, accounts of these are on http://www.uk-ufo.co.uk/",2010-06-03T00:00:00,,

The lights were a bright orange/red and were moving in irregular patterns from a south to north direction.  One of them stopped.  Another one sped up past it, and then slightly changed direction. The last one continued its speed and eventually all the lights “went out” starting with the one that stopped.   After the lights went out we were all trying to figure out what we just witnessed.  We live 5 minutes away from Hopkins airport, these were not planes.  Not helicopters.  There was no starboard or starlight, the lights were not blinking it was solid.  This was nothing any of us have ever seen. The thought of it being an asteroid was brought up, but there was no trail left behind in the sky, and they were changing directions and speeds.   An older couple pulled over to the side of the street and confirmed that they have “never seen anything remotely close to these lights in over 60 years of living in Cleveland, OH.”  The actual amount of time we witnessed the lights was not longer then 3 minutes.   About 10 minutes later we saw another light, a single one moving slower then the previous.  It started to change direction and head east.  Within a minute of watching, the light “went out.” I could still see the shape of it through the clouds.  It appeared to be large, dark, and round.  I tried to follow it for as long as I could but when I blinked it was gone.   We called into FOX8 News to see if they knew what it was, and they told us that they were following it from Lakewood, OH and that they didn’t know what it was.

Any and all planes I've ever saw have strobes or red light or both. I live in the country outside of town so planes never fly over my house at all unless they are rerouted due to a storm is the only time I've ever seen them fly over. Anytime a plane flys over me I will hear it after it passes. Delay in sound. I have also spotted sattellites before.  They look like a star way out above the atmosphere moving slowly across the sky.  Ok what I witnessed was neither a plane nor satellite looking whatsoever.  I was in my backyard facing south towards Dallas tx when to the southwest of me maybe gainsville tx area a bright light moving towards me caught my attention.  My first thought was a that's deffinatly not a plane. I immediatly thought a satellite.  Well it was moving very fast and as it became closer I notice it was not very high in the sky and it was to bright to be a satellite.  It actually passes right over my house. Well when I first see it it's to my southwest ,passes over my house I run around the side of my house And it's now heading away from me now because it had flew over my house but was heading northeast the whole time. It's was flying lower than a commercial airline.  As it went over my house the light was very bright.  It was a clear night with the moon shining.  I don't wanna say for sure but when it was directly above me it seemed to be a circle or triangular shaped craft but the light on bottom made me unsure exactly what shape it was.  The only reason I saw a bit of a shape for a second was because of the moonlight and position Of the craft at that moment.  There was absolutly no sound whatsoever from it.  From the time I spotted it to the time it went over my house and flew totaly out of site took only a minute to a minute and a half.  It happened about 4 hrs before I wrote this. I hope someone else saw it or it can be explained.  It pretty well traveled across the whole sky in 1 min 30 sec. I've sat and watched aiplanes fly for sometimes 5 to 10 minutes before I can't see them a! nymore and we are talking about planes in the distance with blinking lights.  I am 99% sure it was not a plane we k ow of or a satellite flying across the sky in our atmosphere.  I'd say it was approximatly 10,000 to 15,000 feet from the ground. I jus hope more comes of it becuz it was only 4 hrs ago. I know that there had to be others around here that saw it I jus don't know yet. I am buying a video camera now jus because this incedent hoping to get film of an event like this if I ever see this again but I doubt it. As soon as I saw it I hollered in the house to two of my friends and they came outside and witnessed it but they were not very interested.  They just said it looked strange because they thought planes had blinking lights and not jus one big bright light facing the ground.  The way it was moving was also strange it seemed to speed up then slow down then speed up again.  It didn't move slowly across the sky like a plane nice and steady it was more jagged like it could! jus take off and be gone in the blink of an eye if it wanted  to.  VERY STRANGE.  Anyways I probly sound crazy and I'm tired of talkin about it because I can't do anything about it and I have no proof other than 2 witnesses and myself. Hopefully someone else witnessed it and maybe they have it on radar.  Well that's about all I can say for now thank you",2010-05-12T00:00:00,33.995,-96.3917

I saw that it was a black flying wing/chevron shaped craft made of just 2 wings joined together at an angle of approximately 160 degrees. Each wing was a long narrow black rectangle; the ""wingtip"" edges did not taper at all and were squared off at 90 degrees, but with rounded corners. Arrayed along these wings were 7 round, white, non-blinking lights equidistant from each other and the front and rear edges, from tip to tip; the fourth central light was right on the central axis where the 2 wings would join (if they were separate pieces). The diameter of each of these 7 lights was approximately 50% of the width of the wing from the front edge to the back edge. It is very difficult to judge never having been close to the craft to get a sense of scale, but its size may have been as much as 180 - 200 feet from left to right, and it may have been traveling at an altitude of 1200 feet. It is also possible that it was a larger craft traveling faster and higher, or a smaller craft traveling lower and slower; at any rate the speed I observed it moving at was almost leisurely. Its direction of movement was due west, or with a very slight northwest component, and it was silent. It was in my line of sight for 3-4 seconds before it moved out of sight behind the roofline of the entrance to the Aria.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

In the early afternoon on 30 April 2010, I took three pictures of some rainbow-colored clouds that were approximately 50 to 60 degrees in azimuth in the West-South-Westerly direction above my house.  I positioned myself in the shade of the roof line to mask the sun from my shots. I downloaded the pictures, from my camera to my computer, late in the afternoon to see if I was successful in capturing the colorful effects of the sun.  As I visually scanned the pictures, I noticed several outstanding white circular blots which appeared at several locations in each of the pictures.  Some were relatively close to others, some were larger and more prevalent than others, but all except one, were, by my estimation, at an extreme distance in the sky.  I counted no less than eight objects on one of the three pictures I took and found there to be two to three objects on the second photo and five, maybe more on the other. One image appears very much larger or closer and lower than the rest:  it is spherical in shape and has what appears to be a dark belt (almost like a wind shield) wrapping horizontally around the mid-section of the sphere.  I cannot describe this image in better detail, because it is out of focus.  I thought, at first, that I might have captured a portion of my old TV antenna array, but I can't visualize this, even if it is out of focus.  And the antenna is farther to the left of where I took these pictures. In trying to give this object some size or distance perspective with the surroundings in the picture, I note it is at the bottom of the picture, just above the roof line and almost gives the appearance of a head-on frontal aspect of a jetliner, but there are no wings, rudder, or elevators in view.  Additionally, I saw no aircraft while I was taking these pictures, though the Providence airport is in the direction of my photos. I checked the other two photos to see if the same images appeared, or if they were at the same relative locations on each picture, thinking perhaps my lens might be dirty, and if so, the spots would be observable on them too, but this was not the case. I thought for a moment, that I might be seeing some very bright stars as an anomally, but ruled this out as these sightings are so close to the sun. I cannot tell whether these objects had any relative motion, or how long they may have been observable since I didn't even notice them when I took the pictures.  I am however, baffled by what I have captured on these photos.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,41.75188260869565,-71.15711739130434

While working at my computer in a bedroom with its window facing south (also faces the front yard of my house), I heard some strange noises outside the window.  The strange noises sounded as if there were hard droplets, hail, or a large amount of pecans falling onto my roof and sidewalk from trees outside.  Being concerned that a thunderstorm was blowing in, I stood up from the computer and went to the window to look through the blinds to see outside. When I peeked through the blinds, the strange sounds immediately stopped.  I looked into the yard and into the street across the way to see if rain drops or hail were falling.  Not seeing any drops of rain or hail, I then looked out onto the horizon to see if there were any thunderstorm clouds, and immediately saw a series of strange lights directly south approximately 15 degrees on the horizon. At first, the lights appeared to be three landing lights on the front of a large airplane heading north. What was strange about this apparent airplane was that it was banked downward as if it were about to turn to the west, but it did not move from this position.  The lights were all of the same amber color, with the two outermost lights the brightest, the center light more dim.  The craft stayed stationary as if it were parked in the sky at an angle.  The other odd thing about this craft was that it seemed to be extremely large, and located approximately 5 or 6 miles southward near the junction of the Dallas North Tollway and I-35.  An estimate of the size was approximately 300 or 400 feet across (huge). Then, incredibly, another craft of similar proportions (but further in the distance), suddenly appeared to the left of the first craft, and it was banked at a different angle compared to the first craft.  The sudden appearance of the second craft was immediate, as if a light switch or strobe had been turned on.  My immediate thought was that there was some sort of fireworks or laser light show being given near the American Airlines Center near downtown.  Then, incredibly, a third craft, immediately appeared to the right, with the same proportions, but at a different distance than the other two craft.  The third craft was also banked at a different angle compared to the others.  It was difficult to discern whether the crafts were actually moving very slowly, or if they were completely stationary. Then, each craft blinked its lights off and on (the three lights of a craft in unison) as if the crafts were communicating with each other.  The blinking seemed to be in a sequence, as if each craft was a separate ornament on a Christmas tree.  The sequential blinking lasted less than 1 or 2 seconds.  All of the lights disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared, but not at the same time (each craft ""turned-off"" at different times). All of the above took place on the order of about 10 seconds.  I have never seen anything like it before. I have been searching the news sites to see if anyone else saw the same lights.

July 7th 2010, 10:00pm  Walking down a street in western Seattle, I looked to the sky and saw a large bright gold object crossing the sky from east to west.  I watched it because it was unusually large and near to the earth.  The object suddenly began to fade away at a rapid speed and then turned red and disappeared altogether. Later that night, I saw four or five other bright objects zoom through the sky at an insane amount of speed.  Some of the objects would disappear and then reappear and others would turn from gold to gray.  At about 3:00am on the 8th of July I saw a brilliant light that appeared to be a golden magnetic energy rise from the earth until about two hundred feet off the ground at which point it stopped emitting the gold light and began to blink in a manner very similar to a commercial jet.  The object then blinked a pattern of red, green and blue lights, turned in my direction and then flew over my head.  I was unable to discern its shape.  It then flew away and as the distance between it and me increased, the blinking lights made the object look like a shimmering star.  But if you scrutinized it closely, you could tell it wasn’t a star, but some form of advanced technological cloaking device.  Then I noticed there were other “stars” in the sky that blinked in a similar fashion.  As I watched these objects, some of them moved slowly through the sky, while others zoomed at very high speeds.  Then they objects would settle down again and mimic the stars. July 8th 2010, Dusk. Due to the prior night’s events, I found a good viewing spot (the top of a hill in Wedgewood) and began watching the sky much earlier. From this vantage point I witnessed hundreds of these ""stars"" crept across the firmament and descended ever so slowly from the real stars to earth.  They moved so slowly that if I hadn’t been anticipating the event and patiently watching, I never would have noticed. But I did notice.  And as the ships reached Earth the sun went down.  But just before it was totally dark, I caught a brief glimpse of one of these ships.  To my surprise it resembled a very sophisticated space-plane. It hummed soothingly.  The other ships then came in my direction traveling slow and low, but keeping their lights in a fashion as to mimic commercial jets.  Occasionally the light pattern would change into a sudden brilliant display of undulating red, green, blue and gold lights.  The ships then circled around Seattle for an hour or so, at which point some of them scattered! out in all directions, while others settled in the sky and mimicked the stars.  I stayed up all night watching the ships that remained.  Some had three lights and appeared to be triangular; others had four lights and appeared to be square. I got some footage with my cell phone.  But the quality is pretty low.  Also, they knew when I was about to take a picture because almost every time I raised my camera, they would change from what they were doing with the lights back to a commercial jet pattern.  I talked out loud and it was as if they could hear me.  For a while nothing particularly obviously out of this world happened. So I said, ""Okay, I’ll but my camera away.""  Then the ship nearest me did a good deal of rapid blinking and all of a sudden, to the south, I saw a golden light arise over Capitol Hill.  It neared me. When it flew past, I saw that it was another ship that had just come in.  Then I walked home and went to bed.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

We were 4 people sitting outside in a garden away from any big city. The first object we saw was the brightest we saw at all. It was a very bright red and extremely fast flying object. Like nothing we had ever seen before. It was surely no army aircraft, at first it seemed as it was just a bright red star, but then it suddenly started moving with a very high speed. It was also fascinating to see that all those UFO’s were moving towards the same direction. They were moving towards Jupiter which was over the sea so it was east. After the first one had gone we didn’t see much for a while until a couple just flew in to view like from nowhere again heading eastwards. At that point I decided to bring out the small telescope we had in our position. Despite the objects very high speed, I pointed the telescope towards east in hope that another one might pass in to view. Three passed again in the same direction, but I was not able to capture them in time. I saw another one coming from a distance again just one bright light going into a straight line towards east. I was able to aim the telescope a bit ahead of its course then I managed to capture it just for a split second. One thing was clear to me that it wasn’t a plane. It was just an extremely bright light moving in a straight line with out making a noise and moving in a speed I have never seen before and disappearing right in front of our eyes. Even with the telescope I wasn’t able to identify the shape of the object as it moved very quickly and eventually disappeared. After that we saw even more of them all moving to the same palace, but not in a squadron formation like army planes would do. The four of us look at that same sky every night and never in the 3 years we have owned this house have we seen something like that.

As I was walking down my apartment stairs I noticed 3 bright lights in the ski.  One was standing still, one was moving to the left, and the other was coming straight for me or more like over my apartment. At first I didn’t think anything of it because I live by Boeing airfield in Everett. Then I noticed that the one that was coming towards me was really bright, kind of like the north star that those guys where following to find Jesus, but this was no star I promise you that. I also noticed it had no other lights like a regular aircraft. No red, green, or blue lights that usually flash on a plane or helicopter, the other two where the same. I was more focused on the one coming closer to me, because I could see it so clearly. I also noticed it was flying lower than a plane. Planes from Boeing don’t take off over my apartment ever, and they never get that close to our apartment like that. There was also no sound. You would defiantly hear noise if it was that close. Now when I say close, I don’t mean hit my house close but it was to close for a normal plane, and if it was a helicopter I would have heard it. Then also as it got closer I noticed it was swinging side to side, kind of like how if you hold up a necklace and it swings side to side. By now I was getting a little excited because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Then I quickly looked at the one moving to the left and it was moving at the same speed, and it looked the same. It was just farther away. The third one was higher and standing still, but I am not sure if it was the space station or not. I don’t know exactly where it is in the ski, but I never noticed it there before until last night. Then I decided to run in my house, and go on the deck to watch the one that was coming towards me pass over my house, but as I got there, nothing came over. It was just gone. If it was a real plane it should have come right over my apartment, and past right in front of my deck. But it didn’t. Then I ran back out to see if I could see the other one and it was gone. The only one left was the one that was standing still. I am going to go back out tonight to see if I can see the one that was standing still, and if I can then it was just the space station.

On Friday night, 7/24/09, I was staying alone at my country place near Kingston in NW GA, about 15 miles from the nearest metropolitan areas (Cartersville, Rome).  It was a clear moonless night, so I hoped for some good night sky viewing (even though I’m no astronomer).   Shortly before midnight I went out to look at the sky, and easily spotted the Big Dipper in the NW sky, and Polaris.  I happened to be looking towards an open space between some trees to the NE, at about 45 degrees above the horizon, and could see a number of stars though I couldn’t name the constellation. Movement caught my eye, and I noticed a light that looked like a star (no apparent size, shape or color) which seemed to be moving with respect to the fixed stars in a 10 o’clock direction.  At first I assumed it was a distant airplane, although its angular speed seemed large for the apparent distance, given that I heard no sound.  What first startled me was that after a few seconds it suddenly changed direction by more than 90 degrees with no apparent curve to its trajectory.  A few seconds later it started moving erratically (like Brownian motion) at high rates of angular velocity; then it almost stopped at a point about which it jittered rapidly (like a laser pointer that someone is trying to hold still).  A couple of seconds after that the light suddenly disappeared.  Up to that time it had been in clear sky (not close to the tree cover), and the nearby stars remained clearly visible just as before it disappeared.  The whole event lasted no more than 10-15 seconds. Afterwards I felt rather stunned, asking myself if I had really seen what I thought I saw...I couldn’t begin to explain it to myself.  The object’s rapid angular movement, changes of direction and sudden disappearance made no physical sense.   I waited, watching in the same direction, for perhaps 5 minutes but saw nothing more of an unusual nature. I am 60 years old, with a BS in Physics and have worked in engineering most of my career.

The lights were much larger than any star and I would compare the total width of the 3 lights in a row to that of a full moon that is just rising up. (When the moon is brighter orange and appears to sit just above tree top levels.)  I watched the bright amber lights rotate towards the north, (my left facing east) and witnessed another complete set of 3 amber lights, with the rotation the lights appeared to stay within the same proximity of one another and also appeared to be what I would say part of the same “craft”, being the one set of lights rotated around out of my sight and another set appeared. I witnessed the bright amber lights for approximately 15 seconds, and just as the lights had rotated I witnessed 3 or 4 smaller white lights, what would appear the size of a star in the sky, these white lights were moving around very erratically in the same general area of the amber lights. After contacting the National UFO Reporting Center, I contacted the local law enforcement and was informed by the deputy sheriff that he had also witnessed the same lights as well as another witness that was in his squad car at the time.  The sheriff’s location at the time of the sighting was approximately 12-17 miles east north east of my location, and he witnessed the lights to the west of his location.

On the freeway to go home,  I had just gotten on I-25 from the frontage road and was somewhere around the exit for Montgomery road. As I was driving I happened to look up through the windshield at what I though was a reflection in the glass from behind. However, when I looked up the light was coming from an intensely bright object in the sky, maybe (I'm estimating here) about 45 degrees up from the horizon of my car hood. The object was shaped like a tear-drop on it's side. I almost thought it was a comet at first, but then I realized it was completely solid looking. It looked like it had a tail except the ""tail"" was as solid as the rest of the object and very distinct. There was none of the hazy quality you usually see with a comet's tail, plus it was clearly all one piece, with no detached parts. Also, it was really low in the sky so I could see it very clearly. I'm thinking a comet that close to the city would be pretty much impossible. The object was about the same altitude as planes are when they are coming in to land at the airport nearby. There was a red ""aura"" for lack of a better word springing to mind, out in front of it...but only around the curve where the ""front"" of the object was based on the direction it was travelling (west to east across the sky). The object was moving really fast. It crossed an area of the sky about as wide as my windshield in probably less than a second. I got a good look at it but only briefly before it flashed a kind of bright blue and was completely gone. It did not go over a horizon or behind any buildings or cars and the Sandia mountains were still a good distance away from where it disappeared. It just flashed bright blue and was gone. There was no sound, and no trace of anything left in the sky. The night was largely clear (at least I didn't notice any clouds), with very good visibility. You could see all the constellations really well and there were not an inordinate amount of vehicles on the road, about average for a Tuesday night. I can say with certainty that this was not a reflection, a balloon or lamp, a shooting star, or anything else. It was way too solid, distinct and fast (and pretty big at that) for any of those things. It moved in a fairly straight line before disappearing. I looked around to see if anyone else noticed it, but honestly couldn't tell if anyone had. I hope someone else did because I'd like to compare notes and see what they saw. It was very intense,solid, bright and quick, but it was one of those moments where there is no doubt about the details of what I saw. I don't drink or party or anything and I got a really clear look at it. It was definitely odd looking and not something I could explain. I wish I could say I had snapped a pic, but it was gone too quick.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

Directly toward me.  It was round, but it looked like it had a web of lights on top of it, making it look almost teardrop shaped.   At first, I considered it was flames.  I thought it might be a comet falling from the sky, so I turned onto 13 Mile road and pulled into the parking lot of the apartments that were west of Grove.  It had gotten higher in the sky at this point and looked like an orange dot.  It started moving north. I took a picture of it and watched it for a few minutes.  It seemed to just be standing in the sky at this point. So I continued heading west on 13 Mile Road to Schoenherr.  In the parking lot of the Kmart at 13 Mile and Schoenherr, the orange light was still visible and heading west, toward me.

They emitted red and orange light over their entire surface, almost as if the light was being reflected from their surface.  The orange and red light was hazy but it spread in every direction; similar to the same effect that takes place when one squints while looking a street light at night.   The moon was entirely full and these objects were easily detectable.  They moved very fluidly as they flew to the northeast.  They made no sound and they flew as if they were all separate entities; flying closer and farther apart.  It seemed as if they were gliding because they were almost dipping in the sky, but they also rose.  They flew very smoothly, but it seemed as if they were suspended at times and even slightly moved backward.   I yelled to both my girlfriend and her friend to look into the sky and they were immediately taken aback by the occurrence as well.  My girlfriend took a picture on her Iphone and the figures’ arrowhead formation is unmistakeable. They flew out of view to the northeast and another object of the same description emerged from the southwest.  This object, too, flowed very smoothly but seemed to have slowed down more than the other three and stay suspended for a longer period of time; about two seconds.  It was difficult to see how large the objects were because they were so far away but they were about the size of a penny on its side at arm’s length.  After the fourth object hesitated, it followed the other three objects out of sight to the northeast.  The other two witnesses and I are typically very skeptical of UFO’s, however, there is no denying that we witnessed something incredibly bizarre. We are at the top of our classes in the colleges we attend; the University of Maine and the University of North Carolina and were sober at the time of the sighting.

I just Googled: ""orange triangle light glow over salt lake city tonight disappears"" which led me to another site.  I thought I would find others who saw this. someone suggested this site to report what I saw.  If I thought it was going to disappear like that I would have taken a picture. Well to the right of the full moon from my perspective, maybe 20 degrees, I just noticed a very strange orange flame like light that appeared to be heading North toward the Avenues (it was to the South of me). I presumed it was odd colored forward lights to a plane flying low in the Valley.  It was odd from the start.  It was like a triangle in the center surrounded by a flaming orange with almost a tail of the same flaming orange. I stared at it for 2 minutes expecting it to eventually make sense.  But it didn’t. It didn’t move much really.  Never any noise.  I was expecting and listening for an engine noise that never came. Then it started to fade. I thought it was turning away, but then it faded, still visible but smaller.  Then it totally disappeared.  I thought maybe it went behind a cloud.  But there were no clouds in the sky in that area at all. In total I witnessed this for about two minutes.  And at arms length, it would have taken a full fingernail to cover it up. The Orange balls of light I see here described by others in other areas sound very similar. ((ADDENDUM SUBMITTED BY WITNESS)) Possible explainations of what i saw in Salt Lake City last night ((name deleted)) in Salt Lake City 24 hours later:  I’ve tried to make sense of what I saw last night and came up with two plausible theories.   The first, which I have disqualified is that I was witnessing a reentry by the Space Shuttle at a much greater distance than I originally perceived and at an angle more or less directly toward my position. The second, is that I was watching some sort of burning balloon.  I had this notion in my mind tonight and then saw some you tube videos on Chinese lanterns.  If that is what I saw, it was quite large and was either on fire entirely, or was supporting an enormous flame before burning out.  This does however explain the orange flame color, the lack of sound, the slow movement, and the ultimate disappearance if it were to burn itself out. Still, I wish someone would confirm they saw what I saw last night, or someone would confess to launching the thing.  Like I say, I saw it for two minutes before it disappeared.  It could have been there much longer before I noticed it upon admiring the full moon. ((END ADDENDUM))",2010-07-28T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

It appeared to be a star, but as we watched it for awhile, we noticed that we could both see something like spurts coming out of it and it would move.  My first impression was something was shooting out of it like a projectile.  It was far enough away to appear as a star but close enough to see almost tracers off of it when it moved.  As we were watching this light move around, another star looking light came floating across the sky towards the one that we were watching and continued past it without stopping or slowing.  There was no erratic movement with the one going across the sky, but it did manage to cross the entire skyline and out of our sight within 2 minutes or less. I don't know how fast that would be.  Now as of July 27th, 2010 there are still lights in the sky and I have noticed up to 6 or more. I have an apartment that has windows facing the other side of my building and I could see more of these moving objects in the sky on that side as well.  It almost appears as if they are making a circle around a large part of my city, but very high up.  I do live in a border town, which borders Sault Ste Marie, Michigan. I noticed one light that stood out more than the rest and it seemed to have a red that I could notice through the white. When I first noticed this light from my balcony, it seemed closer than the others and it was more centered over the international bridge on the USA side. I recently went back out to look and this red and white light seems to have now moved more to the Canadian side and more over Essar Steel which is what I believe to be the 3rd largest steel comapany in the the World. I don't know if anyone else has seen anything like this on either side of the border, but I encourage anyone in the area to take a look and see if you can notice these same lights. This is not my first time seeing the white light with r! ed shining through. I did submit a report back in September of! 2009 wh en I was about 4 to 5 hours out of town and I witnessed a sighting at a closer range that appeared to be the same type of light. My friend that witnessed this recent sighting has also witnessed another sighting about a month ago from his back yard and was lucky enough to get footage of a white star looking light flying at a constant rate across the sky. I have heard of people referring to the movements as almost seeming like the operator is drunk, but being an outdoors man, the best way I could describe the movement is, the way a water spider moves around on the water. I have tried to research satellite flight patterns, but they seem to be moving to fast to be satellites. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for taking an interest.

My attention had been kept because this star had a pulsating twinkle to it, where it would twinkle white, red and green colors while keeping a white color to it.  The twinkling was rather fast, not a slow changing in colors, but pulsating.  The object was always stationary and did not move.  The first 10 minutes I looked at it with my naked eye.

(boy) It was around 10:45 p.m., when myself and my girlfriend were taking a late night walk around the outside of the college campus.  After walking for awhile we decide to lay down and relax for a bit in a nice grassy area.  It was a nice spot with many small trees well spaced apart.  Me and her were relaxing just talking looking up into the sky when I first spotted a group of lights.  I then pointed and said to her ""what's that?"" ""right there...that group of lights"" then I jokingly told her ""right there it's a UFO.""  Of course she didn't believe and said something a long of the lines of ""no it's not!,"" but then 30 seconds later she spotted it as well.  So then for a good five minutes we watch the group of lights trying to talk out what it might be. (boy) The pattern of the lights is best described in my opinion is that of a school of fish swimming together. It was about 10 to 12 very dim lights in the very far distance (past the cloud line) moving around together in a very fluid motion.  The overall movement was not in a straight line, but as I said like a school of fish moving in a large circle.  Very fluid, very pretty, and very graceful movements.  The lights were very hard to keep track of, and we both had to strain our eyes to see it, but what we both saw is very consistent and unmistakable. (boy) Neither of us can say that we believe that is was aliens or anything to that effect, but what we did see doesn't a line with anything we've seen before.  It could not have been a plane, helicopter, or satellite.  It was very foreign to us, and I thought it would be best to report while the event was still fresh in our minds. (Girl)  I don't exactly know how to describe what i saw because i have never seen anything that nearly resembles it.  To me it looked as if an invisible bubble that was nearly the size of the moon was containing a small group of 12 or so fire flies.  The light didn't move like fire flies, the movement of the light was so fluid and graceful. It was so hard to see the lights at times but once you had your eye on the lights it was unmistakable what you saw.  The lights almost looked red to me but I'm not sure, just like dim stars look red sometimes.  The lights moved together in random patterns, but as they moved in their sphere they as a group moved in a circular movement.  The lights didn't flash at all they were completely solid unlike a plane light or like a twinkling star.  We watched it together and discussed what we saw for about three minutes until a cloud moved in front of the lights and then it was completely out of sight.  There was no sign of the lights through the ! clouds.  We sat for about a minute and were a little confused at what we saw and decided to get up and go home and tell my boyfriends family what we had seen. (Girl) While we had been watching the lights I had mentioned that we should call someone so that they could come outside and see what we had seen but then I realized that no one would be able to see it unless they knew where to look and also the light pollution is bad and we had been lucky enough to have stopped in a slightly dense area of trees.  It was barely dark enough for the two of us to see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I'm a Superintendant of a Residentual Building across the street from the Bronx Supreme Court and one block away from the Yankee Stadium.   My two nephiews and I were walked up to the roof to watch the amount of Yankee fans that came for the Old Timers Game.  Sure enough, as I last stated here back in July of (I think it was 1999), we witnessed them again, the first one appeared to us like fire directly above our heads it just spun around in a circular motion then just disappeared.  The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion. The third was astonishing. It was amazing but we were not surprised due to the fact we saw them before plenty of times just spending time up on roof-tops. It was close to the Supreme Court's roof just hovering straight across in a very slow-motion. It was an oval egg-shaped like object, about the size of a full-sized van and an orange or fire like color to it with no shine or light, just creeping across the sky. What got us was that about 3 minutes to the direction it headed towards there appeared to be a crime scene.  All of a sudden a Police helicopter flying in circles around the area and about 20 Police cars. Then we saw a fourth heading towards the same direction but this one appeared to be white.   A fifth was coming behind him, this was to the left of us while the other to the right of us.  This one startled us a little because it was very close, seemed to be coming towards us at head level then it rose up at about 50 feet above our heads, this one was very clear to us.  It was definatley oval, saucer like, with two blue lights going around in circles on the top center of it.  The lights were not bright at all, perhaps they weren't lights.  It then changed shape, seemed like two legs came out the backside of it then it crumbled like liquid metal and again back to it's solid shape and headed to the same direction as the other four. Five minutes had past and the sixth appeared behind us this time above the Yankee Stadium heading straight towards our direction also at head level and slowly towards the last fives' direction.  Then about two minutes later, five in a V shaped formation headed straight across the sky for about ten seconds and just vanished before our eyes, again towards the same direction as the last six before them. I stopped wrighting to the National Ufo Reporting Center because I wasn't getting any answers.  I was going through a lot of great disturbing confusion and wanted to point the finger at all the wrong places.   Instead I decided to ask, what ever I was looking at, for answers.  This is all I wanted to share for now, it makes no sence what-so-ever for me to dwell into this because the life experiences I have had lead me to believe and understand that folks all over the world will always be blinded by the truth and wouldn't believe it if these crafts were pointed out to them.  Yet a large amount of us believe and preach that there is a God but don't have enough faith to understand the huge fact that heaven is directly above our heads, in space, there are millions of angelic and demonic beings, or just normal like you and I, watching over us or just living their lives out there in different worlds.  We don't have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That's what makes us God's favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody's help.  There will be a time when they will reveil themselves to us with or without the approval of our so-called-leaders. If you believe what I am saying and search for aswers using faith from God then they have a special place for you.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

At 10:20 PM Saturday 7/17/2010, I was sitting in bed on my laptop online when I heard a loud boom outside.  Fearing someone had hit my car I looked outside to see nothing out of the ordinary, but due to the load nature of this boom I continued to scan my neighborhood.  I then looked up to see that there was a orange ball of light in the sky.  This ball looked to be like fire, but seemed to be in a half circle shape, rounded in the front and trailing off to the back side.  I immediately called my wife to come to the window and take a look, and she came to the window and watch the events with me. The orange light in the sky continued from south to north disappearing behind a few clouds before reemerging from the clouds.  After this light had reached almost the end of our vision another orange light very much same shape as the first appeared to the south tracking about the same direction. Then we heard a boom to the north of our house.  The boom was accompanied by a bright flash that seemed to emanate from ground level, and that was very bright.  This was no fireworks, it was bright white, produced shadowing effects and kind of hurt our eyes.  Then this happened again, I moved to a window I could see farther north from but did not see anything burning nor any explanation for the booms or flashes. My wife then announced to me that another one had appeared to the south same as the first two.  Prior to this one even getting close to our house we heard two more loud booms each accompanied by that same bright flash.  At one point I feared we were under some kind of attack mainly due to the intensity of the booms, and flashes, I dialed 911, as I awaited the dispatcher (placed on hold and transferred once since I called from my cell phone, made this call at 10:30 per my cell phone memory)  I saw another one enter from the south this one on a path south to north but much closer to my house. We heard a total of eight to nine loud booms, and saw a total of four bright orange lights. and witnessed 6 flashes, we were not at the window for all of the booms, got phone for one and was moving to different window for another, and the original boom that made me go to the window was approx 3 booms I had not been looking outside during. The 911 dispatcher told me they had reports of fireworks in the area, but I told him it was not a fireworks display. The light was high enough to be in clouds, and was traveling south to north at a fairly slow pace for something that high in the sky, with the flash and explosions occurring farther north then the orange light in the sky, and the flash appearing to be ground level. During the event my wife and I saw our neighbors come outside pointing into the sky at the lights, with still other neighbors looking out their windows for the origin of the booms.  I do intend to talk with them tomorrow, but wanted to file this tonight as the information was fresh on my mind. Although I do not personally believe in Aliens or any such thing, I know today I was witness to something unidentified and flying.

The object flew from east to west. This is a particularly exciting sighting, because at the time we were testing out my new laser pen designed to shoot a green beam strong enough to point out stars (the beam reaches approx 1000ft so it appears to be pointing at a star). We were stood in the back yard of a friends house. After making sure there were no aircraft to be seen or heard in the area, we shone the laser pen at a few stars (you have to make sure there are no aircraft in the area, especially helicopters as it is very dangerous and ILLEGAL to point this thing in the sky when aircraft are present!). I shone the laser pointer at three stars in the sky which are shaped like a triangle, They're in the west of the sky and are visible most nights. After touching each star with the laser beam I put the laser pen into my back pocket and lit a cigarette while me and my friend chuckled because I was putting on a stupid voice while pointing at the stars. From the east and for approx 1-1.5 seconds a brilliant white sphere with no glare or tail. The object appeared as bright as magnesium burning as it passed over our heads at a speed which was far less than a shooting start, but much faster than any known plane or helicopter. There was no sound and the object looked to be very defined and solid (perfect sphere, or ball). I have seen many shooting stars, satellites, commercial/military planes and many helicopters. This object did not fit into any of these criteria, nor did it resemble a comet in any way. I have never seen a large meteor in person but have on video and this object did not in anyway resemble this either. The object was difficult to scale, my friend and I talked for a while and decided it to seemed to looked a little bigger than a passenger jet in the sky but lower than a jet would fly (30,000ft). We cannot verify any size or height of the object as it was very fast, very solid and very visible but so fast that it is hard to from memory alone judge. The object did however, fly quite precisely through the centre of the triangle of stars above, pretty much the centre of the three points I shone the laser!  I have created a couple of images using Google map to point out a rough flight path. I started small then worked out. Which I have emailed to yourselves. After returning inside My friend tried to use the GPS on his phone to work out the direction of the craft, but the GPS did not work when it usually does there. It said we were out in the bay towards the direction the object flew!  A little while before my Friend and I went out to use the laser we were smoking a cigarette and My Girlfriend, My Friend and I saw two aircraft that looked like helicopters with a droning sound. They had red and green and white lights on them like a normal aircraft but were flashing differently. I know the red and green lights are used to determine which direction an aircraft is flying so other aircraft don’t hit them. But these red and green lights were alternating and the white light stayed with them. We thought nothing too unusual of these at the time.

I was traveling southbound on interstate 275 at 17:40 hours to go to a dinner party in St. Petersburg, when I saw 2-3 large and rapid flashes of light that covered the general vicinity of my location. I could not pinpoint the direction of flashes. At first I thought it may be lightening, but I had my moonroof open and I noticed that the cloud cover was broken and scattered at the time and there were no thunderstorms in the area. I thought this was odd, but I quickly disregarded it. The traffic flow on the interstate began banking to the right and heading in a west bound direction. After about 1.5 miles of going westbound, I noticed what appeared to be a commercial jet making a landing approach from over the bay waters, with landing lights. It made its approach over the shoreline in the general area of Bayshore and Hyde Park.  However, I then noticed that it seemed to be taking a long time for this jet to make its approach. I then slowed down and the lights seemed to be at a standstill and hovering  just short of the opposite lanes of the interstate expressway at about 300-feet in altitude and a quarter mile downrange from me. At about this time I then realized that what appeared to be landing lights took on a  rapid “twinkling” appearance as I closed distance on it. I then reduced my speed even more to get a better look and as I did, it went from a hovering standstill and then quickly “scooted” across all 8 lanes of I-275 in a matter of just a few seco! nds. As the object crossed over the interstate directly in front of me and all oncoming traffic, I then noticed that the entire middle of the object from end to end was illuminated in what seemed to be a grid of yellow, green and blue lights in a rotating pattern.  At this point, I thought It might be a blimp, but as I drove past it, to my dismay, I could clearly see that the lights were rotating around the circumference of a circle. There was no noise or any other anomalies. After it quickly “scooted” across the interstate it then stopped and hovered over an older and darker section of the city with few street lamps and when it did, the colors became very vivid and seemed to pop out visually and become brighter as they rotated rapidly around its circumference. I also noticed that rotational speed of the lights seemed to have varied becoming faster after it passed over my direction on the interstate.  As the object hovered in darkness, it then became apparent to me that this thing was big. I cannot even estimate a size in feet, but visually, It was the size of a nickel held at arms length in your hand.  As I was attempting to make a phone call to my spouse to tell her about what I saw (She has also seen lights of this description in the past), I looked over twice to see if it was still there and it did not move after it crossed the interstate.  Based on the rotation of vivid multicolored lights around its circumference and its ability hover, then! quickly pick up speed and have no noise, I am confident that this was not a regular aircraft.  I am at a loss to figure what it was and I am not sure if the flashes of light I had seen a couple of minutes earlier were linked to what I saw.

I'm a 23 year old security officer at work in Naples by Marco.  I'm also a private pilot.  The time was about 7PM.  I walked outside of my gatehouse and was looking west toward the ocean.  Its a very clear night with unlimited visibility. I can see stars and jets at 30k feet strobe lights flashing. Out of the corner of my eye to the north I could see what I thought was a jet landing at fort myers intl airport or Naples even.  The light was small and amber in color like a Boeing jet.  It had a little kind of comet tail that was the same color as the light behind it that I could see as it moved closer and passed over my head going south.  It moved from north to south like it was flying down the Florida coast but at 50-100k feet.  It was moving a lot faster then the other jets and had no flashing lights of any kind.  It took maybe 45 seconds to a minute for the light to disappear over the South horizon.  It looked like a star floating across the sky.  Perfectly round amber light.  I thought it was a jet until it passed over my head going south and it was just as bright as it was coming at me.   Like the headlights of a 737 coming at you but when its going away.?  Jets don't use landing lights on at cruise altitude?  The object appeared to be very high and was moving quicker then the other jets that I could see and pick out in the sky.  I saw a amber ball of light travel from North to South at a high rate of speed that didn't look like anything I have ever seen before including the ISS. I also witnessed the 3 red lights over Naples park on new years.  It was a nice size triangle with 3 red lights that hovered and took off north. If looked like it had to be huge.  I couldn't see a outline but it looked to be one object.  There's a movie of it on you tube.  This thing whatever it was flew around and took off to the North without makeing a noise.,2010-02-14T00:00:00,26.19318196994992,-81.73703021702838

He told me him and his girlfriend had seen a legitmate ufo, not explainable any other way.  He described it as bright red lights, ascending from below the treeline and rising up into the sky before forming a triangle and then disappearing. Fifteen minutes later he called me, as they had returned.  I went onto my roof and obvserved the lights, facing the south.  My girlfriend and my sister were also witnesses on the roof with me.  First I saw only a few lights, they slowly ascended vertically until there were at least six (I estimate, I didn't count exact, or get a photograph).  They rose slowly and eventually formed a triangle before they slowly dimmed, one at a time, and disappeared. The appearance of the lights was a bright red, and must have been large in size judging by my estimated distance, minimum of 5-10 miles away, possibly further.  They rose very slowly, and not in a perfect linear line as a plane would climb as it gained altitude.  They seemed to exhibit a fixed x-y position relative to the ground, only increasing their z position (altitude). They formed into a triangle, and then began to disappear. These were not any kind of aircraft I've seen a human have.  The detroit metro airport is nearby in that direction, as well as the monroe nuclear facility.

I awoke from sleep last night to go to the washroom, and on returning into my room I glanced outside and noticed a glowing green rectangular object approximately 500 metres away.  My estimate of the size of this object, taking into account the distance it was from my window, is that it was in between 10 and 30 centimetres wide and 120 to 200 centimetres tall. After throwing on some clothes and shoes I left my house and observed this object from the top of my driveway (~465m away). The object appeared to slowly float right to left parallel to the ground, at an estimated 5km/h.  It continued its course until it was obscured by trees that blocked my vision. The easiest way for me to describe the appearance of this object is to compare it to an oversized ruler. I have been trying to come up with an explanation of what I saw, and as such I have thought of a few questions already that readers of this report may want to ask, so I present to you some more facts:  There are no lights in my room that are green, or otherwise. I did not turn on the lights when I got up to go to the washroom, so this sighting couldn’t have been caused by a reflection of light from my room, or my house. I did turn on a light in the washroom, but it is a dull 40w glazed bulb, and I didn’t look directly at it, so this couldn’t have been a case of after-images in my eyes created by looking at a bright light source while my pupils were dilated from darkness. I can’t discount is the possibility of fireflies engaging in some sort of strange behaviour, as the colour of green was identical to the colour that fireflies produce. As to why these fireflies would /could behave in this type of behaviour is beyond me. I considered the possibility that someone could have had some sort of reflector /light/glow stick on the side of a bike, or on pants or arms, but this doesn’t seem likely since the object was moving in what appeared to be only along the x axis from right to left, not up or down at all – contradictory to what one would expect to see if this object was affixed to somebody’s leg or arms while walking. What do you think? If you have any ideas as to what this object may have been, please let me know!",2010-06-23T00:00:00,43.38223451178451,-79.82626717171718

It was on a clear day last week, around the 25th of March. I was standing next to my house, looking up at the sky, observing the chemtrails which I do often. It wasn't a heavy chemtrail day, just a couple of Xes and lines that were spreading out. Suddenly I noticed something moving quickly past the trails. My eyes focused on what I first thought was a flock of birds in the far distance. It looked like bunch of dots in a formation. I'm wasn't sure how many, maybe ten or twelve, because this formation of dots was moving very fast. When I noticed them, they were directly in front of me, but within 2 to 3 seconds they had traveled across the sky to my left until they vanished in the distance. I stood there a few minutes thinking about what I just saw, wondering what it could have been. If it wasn't for the speed, it could have been a flock of birds so far away that they looked like dots. Then I thought it could have been a group of insects that were quite close to me streaking by and staying in a perfect formation. Maybe a squadron of jet fighters? But there was no noise made by this UFO. I thought it couldn't have been any of these things because it was just moving to fast. I didn't think much more about my sighting until last night when I saw the photo of the London sighting. It appears to be the same kind of formation only closer to the viewer. Could it be that there's a UFO squadron speeding around globe? I think it's a possibility.  I have a degree in Nursing and have worked in the manufacturing field.

I noticed a large, silent craft in the shape of an equilateral triangle overhead, moving due south.  The craft had three white lights, one at each point of the triangle, which did not flash or blink, and one red light in the center of the triangle which flashed like the light of a ""normal"" aircraft. The craft was completely silent and left no vapor trail.  Although it made no sound, I could ""sense"" the craft, as though it were somehow silently moving air or altering the pressure around it, much the way you ""sense"" a person moving behind you even if you don't hear them. The craft appeared approximately one-half the size of Orion's belt on each side.  I am no expert on estimating altitude, but I do not believe it was at commercial aircraft altitude.  My best guess is that the craft was maybe three to five times the size of a large commercial aircraft, assuming it was indeed flying comparatively low.  If it was at a high altitude, based on observations of hundreds of commercial aircraft during both day and night, it would be dozens of times larger than even the largest commercial aircraft that fly over Kansas. I also briefly noticed several (didn't get a count) flashing lights, alternating between pale blue, green, and red, along the two front edges of the craft.  As it moved over my head, I could no longer see these lights.  This is the fourth time I have seen this particular craft (or others just like it) in the past month or so, but this was the first time I noticed the flashing lights along the front edges. The craft moved at a steady pace without any fluctuation in speed, roughly the observed speed of traditional aircraft.  Again, depending on altitude, it was either moving very fast or extraordinarily slowly.  The two rear white lights were visible for nearly fifteen minutes as it moved out of sight to the south.  In two of the other instances, the craft similarly moved south.  In the other instance, the craft was moving due north as it passed over me, then turned northwest (toward and over Colby, by my estimation) before turning due south and disappearing. During one of the earlier sightings, maybe two weeks prior to the 24 March sighting, I had noticed a number of other odd happenings in the sky, including two very bright lights about five or ten degrees off the southern horizon that flashed on for about two seconds, then slowly dimmed like stadium lights being turned off.  These flashed on and off for about two minutes before disappearing outright.  I also noticed several larger-than-usual aircraft flying due west over a roughly half-hour period on either side of seeing the triangle, these could have been passenger aircraft but they would have had to be flying lower than usual to appear as large as they did.  I was on the phone with a friend during this whole time, and recall relaying to him several oddities that night.  No aircraft followed the triangle, but the other oddities happened in a time frame centered on the triangle flying over.  I remember commenting on the fact that almost all the other aircraft were moving due west, as usually the aircraft at this time (this sighting was right around 20:30, just before the time change) are moving in various directions and are not as highly concentrated.

I took my daughter on a small tractor ride through a dense wooded area about a mile from the lake itself.  My daughter was on my lap steering when she suddenly pointed up at this object directly in front of us about 100 yards and around 30 feet off the ground. She turned around quickly and hid her eyes on my shoulder as I tried to stretch my leg out to get my cell phone out of my pocket and take pictures.  I was extremely nervous that it was so clearly in plain view and that I knew I needed to get the pictures. But not being able to take my eyes off of the object made for fumbling fingers and tight pockets, not to mention that my daughter was scared to death. This whole process from first sighting to getting the cell phone out took about 7 - 9 seconds.  By that time the object tilted slightly and the sun light gleemed off of its surface as it disappeared. I tried to see a trail but there was nothing. I told my daughter to relax and when we got back and told everyone they said we were pulling their legs.  But it happened.

OK, this was a strange night.  After walking my dog at Seward Park, we sat at the picnic table near the clay studio so my dog could have his treat break.  It was about 8:00 p.m., the sun had already set and the stars were finally coming out.  I'm fascinated with stars and as usual, I am looking up at the Big Dipper in the Northeast direction.  As I glanced at the I-90 Bridge, a flash of light caught my eye above and north of me.  I noticed that there was a small light followed by a larger light flying directly behind the smaller light, if I had to guess, the lights seem to be four blocks apart from one another, it was moving slowing to the east and it didn't seem to be more that 600-800 feet above the evergreen trees of the park.  As I pondered where the these planes came from and why they were so low, I realized that they were too close to be flying behind one another.  I noticed that they moved at the same speed and the distance between the two lights never shifted but remained straight across from one another.  In addition, there were no strobe lights as there are on all airplanes and helicopter's (as far as I know) and the most amazing thing was that there was absolutely no sound at all.  All this I described happened within a minute of me noticing the lights and I was chatting with my mom on the phone at the time and told her I was pretty sure I was seeing a actual UFO.  Although it was not completely dark I could see there was no outline of a vehicle between the two lights, however, it was just too strange that the lights moved as if they were connected to something.  The only example I can offer is this, if you see a ship on the ocean at night and there was a light on the front of the ship and another on the back of the ship, you would not see the ship but you’d know that there must be a ship out there because the light spacing never changes.  I could see that the larger light was globe like with either vents of blue light or some feature that I was unable to clearly make out at t! he dista nce I was at. However, I could see there was something more to the light.  As the UFO disappeared over the tree going east, my mom grabbed her camera and because her house sits on a hill over near the airport she was able to see the lights as I had described and she said that she could see them going a little below the tops of the Cascade Mountains going south.  Then she lost them.  A minute later she was again able to see the two lights heading south.  They still appeared to be near the Cascade Mountains.  I hope there was others who reported this because it was truly an amazing sight for me and I will always regret not carrying my camera or binoculars.

It moved quickly in a swirling motion as well as at sharp angles before stopping completely and not moving at all. It at times moved slowly too.

My phone was upstairs, so I went up to answer it, and than out onto my 3rd floor balcony as I noticed the moon was very light.  The night sky was almost absolutely clear, the stars were really shining and I could see very well, since all the sreet lights were out.  I am in Quito Ecaudor, in a valley outside the city.  At about 7:30, while looking at the sky, I saw something far away, as it looked like a star, moving across the night sky.  This was nothing like a shooting star, as I have seen many before....this maintained its luminosity? and moved consistently at the same pace about 90 degrees across the sky.  I called my dad to tell him what he saw, and at his house  1 mile away, he went out.  He noticed something moving across the sky, in the other direction...i was still looking in the direction on mine as I thought it had stopped moving.  Than about 1 hour later, i went back out and saw another object, much lower in the sky move across the mountain range. It definietly have a few red lights....and one white.  It moved across the mountain range, than out over a valley andover a mountain.  This was not a plane.  Since the night sky was so clear, you can EASILY tell an airplane....and also hear it.  This was silent.  About 3 minutes after that had passed, another passed in the same pattern, no noise.  About 5 minutes later...an airplane came in and I could notice the MANY differences in ligthing, noise, etc. than what i had previously just seen.

So I’ve been out every evening with binoculars looking for UFO’s or whatever they are. So five days have pasted and I have not saw anything else. On the sixth day after my first sightings it is Thursday night, March 5th , 2009. I have 3 sighting that were note worthy. These objects were not at all like the objects in my first sightings on Feb. 27th, 2009. (1)  March 5th, 2009 in the evening about 8:05 I spotted 2 odd bright white lights close together above the mountain range NNE of down town Salt Lake City. I didn’t recall ever seeing any lights here before so I watched them. About 8:15pm an airplane flew near these 2 lights and over the mountain range, so I decided to watch the plane. The airplane was flying across the valley from the east and heading west. Because of this I spotted an object with my 10x50 binoculars while I was watching this  jet fly over the valley from east to west. The object I spotted was coming from the north west and heading south east ward and just a little lower than the airplane. The object was a small dim light with a slight amber color to it. It flew close and under the airplane and then arced up and stopped at about the height that the airplane was. It stay at that spot for about 3 seconds. Then the object moved north a very short distance before stopping again. During this very short movement towards the north I could see 2 circles of lights on the bottom with one light in the center. The lights were white in color, one circle of lights with a smaller circle of lights inside that circle and inside the inner circle was the light in the center.(The object was mainly visibly clear with my binoculars and too far away to bother with photographing it.) The object was fairly high up and hard to get any real detail once it stopped and hovered. At this time I could only see that it had a cluster of lights on the bottom of it. It hovered there for 20 minutes before it flew north and disappeared at about 8:35pm. While I was watching this object, at times I would put the binocular down and give my arms a rest. It was during these periods of resting that I would check out the 2 lights that were close together but never moved. (This sighting is pictured in the northern west area of the map picture with the white line showing its flight path. In the “V” of this line is where it hovered for about 20 minutes.) I am viewing this sighting jus! t south of the red dot marking where West Valley City is on the map. (2)  The other object that I first saw (8:05pm) was the two odd bright white lights that were side by side and a little above the mountains (NNE of Salt Lake City). I had not ever seen anything bright there before and this was about 8:05pm when I first became aware of this. I felt that it didn’t belong there. I watched it off and on with the binoculars, it never moved at all.  It was during this that I saw an airplane flying near these 2 lights and decided to watch it fly across the valley and if not for this I would have not saw the sighting I first described. During about a 4 minute period of time  while I was watching it, to my surprise, it took off and headed west and then sharply turned north. It didn’t appear to bank at all during this turn. Shortly after I saw it moving north I could see other lights on it and after a short distance a few of the lights  began blinking. Soon it was out of my view. ( 8:20pm) The lights were mostly white and one red light. It flew away at a normal speed similar to a regular aircraft? It was at a good distance and I didn’t bother with trying photograph it. It would have only been another unknown light with no way to identify it. (On the map picture of Salt Lake City in the area NNE on the edge of the mountain range is a red line that goes northward. The start of this red line NNE of Salt Lake City is where it hovered for several minutes before flying north ward) I am viewing this sighting just south of the red dot marking where West Valley City is on the map. (3)  Later near where I spotted had saw the 2 odd bright lights hovering above the mountain range NNE of Salt Lake City, but north of this area. I panned across this area with my binoculars and I saw a multiple colored light darting back and forth, up and down at times. It mainly zig zagging up and down in “Z” pattern laid on its side! It moved in this jerky fashion as it traveled south ward across and near the mountain tops. At times it was higher than the snow topped mountains under it and other times it was lower than the tops of the mountain. The multiple colored light was only visible with my binoculars. The colors were white, green, red and blue, I didn’t see any of the lights blinking. At times the colors were very sharp and vivid. It kind of reminded me of a buttery flittering about. (9:40 pm) The sighting was about a ½ a minute in duration. I don’t understand why anything would be so erratic in flight. (On the map picture is a squiggle greenish line just north of where the red line starts. This is about where it was sighted moving south ward.) I am viewing this sighting just south of the red dot marking where West Valley City is on the map. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Area On March 6, 2009 at approximately 19:45 hrs. my husband and I were walking in the hills of Point Richmond, California.  We were looking upwards at the constellation of Orion and my husband brought to my attention that one of the brighter ""stars"" was moving.  Even though I was not wearing my eyeglasses at the time (I am near-sighted and thus have trouble focusing on far objects) I could see the movement of the object quite clearly.  It looked almost exactly like any other star.  It was so far distant from us; however, that we were unable to discern any distinct shape other than that it looked like a star that was moving. Neither my husband nor myself have either seen nor witnessed any other UFO that behaved in this manner. We have both seen the Space Station and other satellites in the sky as well as comets and meteor showers at other times, but this ""apparition"" did not behave in any way like any of those other objects.  We are also very used to seeing many different types of aircraft in the sky, as we are on the flight pathways of various airports in the San Francisco Bay area, and this object did in no way resemble any aircraft or the manner in which any aircraft could possibly fly  The UFO appeared in the constellation of Orion and moved in a Northerly direction, but not in a smooth or straight line such as a satellite or comet might, its pattern was highly erratic and it ""wandered"" along a Northern pathway.  To me it appeared to ""jump"" from side to side, probably due to the fact that as I was not wearing my eyeglasses and my eyes kept trying to focus on it as it moved.  However, my husband said that the objects movement was fairly smooth, but that it was moving erratically from side to side as it moved ""forward."" At one point it suddenly stopped and it moved backwards quickly and then just as quickly it returned to its forward progression.  It continued to move erratically in this manner and traveled approximately halfway across the visible sky before it rapidly faded and disappeared into the Earth’s shadow. To me it appeared as if it was moving away from us and thus was getting smaller as it progressed on its path.  . My husband describes its behavior as being like a bloodhound during a tracking exercise, in other words it did not move forward without varying from side to side.  Due to how small it appeared and how very far away it seemed to be, it must have been moving at an extremely high rate of speed to cover such a distance in the sky while it moved in this strange pattern. The entire event lasted perhaps 5 minutes, maybe a little less, although we were very spellbound by it’s appearance and movement so it may have taken a bit longer in actuality.

Next, the object begins to turn and the red glow went out. It was dark out so we couldn’t see the object’s shape but we could see its lights. It had a big light at the front that looked like a dull glow to me. It could have been the glow from being heated. It also had a light at the end. It was a very small flashing red light. That’s when we realized that this is a UFO. The object was long and skinny judging by the placement of the lights. The object continues flying with the appearance of an elongated aircraft for about 5 seconds. (It’s now on the left side of the road and had made a complete U-turn.)  Then, the object begins to light up again. It gets brighter and brighter and becomes engulfed in blue flames. It looks like a meteor now. It was still moving slowly. It appears as a slowly falling meteor for a little over 5 seconds before all lights go out and the object disappears completely. Three people observed it while in the car. The driver only caught a glimpse of it. We are all college students from the ages of 18-20. I can’t speak for the three people who saw it at the house, but they had a completely clear view of the object. They were sitting outside around a fire when they saw it.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,26.70504529494382,-80.13514009831461

It was much higher in the sky than the jet and it was moving much faster than the jet.  It was either two objects moving at tandem or it was one object with some sort of ""color"" in the middle of the object making it seem like two objects.  This object was very white. It seemed much whiter than the jet and this object was moving so much faster than the jet it was unreal.  I stood and watched it for approximately 15 seconda when I came back into the house since I had no way of filming it.  I could not see any wings or tail on it.

My entire family and several other people sitting around us witnessed a light brown flying object with a glowing golden ball in the center.   This thing was not an airplane or firework debris, as it slowly flew across the length of the entire sky over our heads in a curved line at the same altitude.  It flew from a west direction towards the east, but then curved northward, again at what appeared to be the same altitude throughout.   The top of this thing spun around, and one side of it was black with something that protruded from it (you could see this black side with the protruding thing spinning slowly as it flew across the sky.)  It had no smoke, no sound, and this protruding thing swung around the top of it only randomly and very slowy while the bottom of it did not spin.  The best way I could describe the protruding black thing was that it looked like a large tel! escope with a dark shiny window in the center of it.  I say it was shiny window because you could see light reflecting off of the center of it, but the rest of the telescope thing itself didn't reflect light.   The entire object was pyramid shaped, but the top of it spun around slowly while the bottom of it seemed to remain stationery.  A glowing orange ball was right in the center of the bottom of it.   There were at least twenty five other people around us who looked up with us and watched this thing as it slowly flew by.

We did see a plane at one point, as well as a helicopter.  Then, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, my mother and I saw an orange-red orb flying towards our house. At first we thought it might be the lights on an airplane because it was flying so smoothly, but as it moved closer we speculated it might be a flare or firework of some kind.  However, it was moving slowly, and the light wasn't diminishing in intensity at all.  There was no trail behind it--it was an entirely self-contained light.   As it flew over our house, we both noticed smaller lights that seemed to be circling around the larger light.  The smaller lights, to me, looked to be pink and green in hue (among other colors.)  I only got a clear look at it for a couple of seconds. We ran to the back of the house, out onto our deck, and watched as it flew slowly over the pine trees and over the neighborhood behind us.  Again, it didn't explode or diminish as fireworks might. It made no sound whatsoever. We ran inside and downstairs to inform my father, then ran back upstairs to watch it circling around and taking a similar path over the house for a second time.  I ran to get my camera, but the battery was dead.  I hooked up the family camcorder quickly so that it was pulgged into the wall and not running on a battery, but it was behaving strangely and kept shutting off.  We watched as the object disappeared over the house a second time.  I went to charge the other camera while my parents watched the object take its route over the back of the house again.  My father initially suggested it might be a flare, and then admitted he had no idea what it really was. My mother and I are confident we saw something out of the ordinary.  It was the moment when it was almost directly above us and we saw the smaller lights around the object that conviced us this was no typical 4th of July experience.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,44.6398,-73.1104

It was almost silent, but looked almost like it was spinning the body part of it, but was just moving forward.  It was the strangest thing!  I started freaking out, and yelled for my boyfriend.   As he came over it was now almost right over the front of our house. It wasn’t very high in the sky maybe a couple hundred feet above our trees.  He ran into the house, and tried to grab the camera, but by the time he came back it was alre! ady over our neighbors house, and hidden by their trees. I kept watching in the sky, turning in circles hoping I would see it again.  Maybe 2  minutes later another one appeared in the same direction the first one appeared to of come from.

As the airplane headed toward this unidentified object it went back up in the sky, and the lights seem to disappear, or go off.  The aircraft then was over the spot where this craft was, and went passed it. I thought it was gone but then it came down out of the clouds but behind my house in the sky.

It was a steady glow that at first sight appeared like a star.  I paused to focus better to make sure I was not looking at a plane since LAX is in the same direction, South.  I ran inside to grab my camera. When I returned I lost sight of where it went. About five minutes went by and I spotted it again.  This time it was traveling North West. Same speed but very high up. I ran inside to call my 2 kids and my wife.  Again, I returned to lose it again in the night sky. I asked my kids to stay with me as we scanned the sky.  We then spotted it again but this time it was traveling due east.  In the distance we followed it closely as to not lose it.  It kept its course east and disappeared.  We then looked straight up and saw the same kind of light traveling due north east.  This light disappeared the same way as the one traveling due east.

It was partially hazy but almost completely clear around Mt. Lemon of the Santa Catalina Range north of the city. As soon as we stepped out of the house I heard a high pitched screech coming from the south (from Tucson). It was fairly high pitched but sounded like a commercial airliner. The aircraft(s) were in the haze traveling north. Since it was loud (so most likely low) and traveling in a heading not a major population center I will assume that they were A-10 Warthogs hailing from Davis Monthon Airforce base in Tucson (they have exposed turbofan jet engines and sound similar to commercial aircraft). I only saw on faint pair of lights and they were flying west by northwest and probably at low altitude.  As the noise subsided, I looked towards Mt. Lemon and noticed ONE bright pulsating light coming from the northeast. It was brightly pulsating and at high altitude, pulsating at random intervals (sometimes many times in a second and sometimes one every two or three seconds). When it pulsated it appeared that their were green and red lights (one of each) in addition to many very small white lights on the sides of the objects. I am sure  that this was not an airplane as the red and green lights (like those on the sides of airplanes to indicate their port and starboard sides) as they were not constant and the white lights were not a planes landing lights as they were not constant or pulsating in constant time. Although it was hazy in most of the sky, the sky around Mt. Lemon and the rest of the Santa Catalina mountains was clear as the moon and numerous stars were visible  while only the brightest stars were visible in the rest of the sky. The craft appeared to spawn, as it sudd! enly appeared next to a star that I was viewing to the northeast. The craft travelled very quickly as it was able to transverse the entire mountain range in the course of about two minutes. As it progressed its strobing light gained in intensity. Although I can not say for sure, I would speculate that it flew at high altitude and was far to the north, most likely directly over Globe AZ. After about 30 seconds or so, a second identical object appeared behind and closer to the horizon, in relation to the first object. They were in constant formation and had a tethered appearance to it. The objects were definitely not satellites (as I've heard of old tethered satellites) as they were very bright (brighter than the surrounding stars). Right before I went in the house to get the whole family to see (as only three other people were witnessing it) a third light appeared. The object was identical to the others but was far in front of the other two and was at an altitude (or locatio! n as I can't really speculate on its hight) in between that of! the oth er objects. The objects combined form a V shape or that of an isosceles triangle with a very small angle made between the first two objects and the third one in front. When I came back out with the rest of the family about one minute later the objects and any traces of them were gone.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

We live in the downtown area and were looking west towards the mountains. My fiancé pointed out a dim orange light very high in the sky.  The light then split into about 7 or 8 orbs and started to travel north, north east.  There was no sound and they were traveling much faster than planes.  (Which we see all the time).  They traveled across the entire sky and started to separate and finaly dissapeared into the sky. The whole event happened in about 10 seconds, there was no time to get a camera.  If I didn’t see it myself, I would have never believed her. With that being said, I have another sighting to report on her behalf.  Two months ago at about 6:30am, she saw something flying in the dimly lit sky that resembled a pterodactyl.   Yes I am aware that they are extinct!  So of course I had a hard time believing her.  She said it was the size of a small plane and it was flying at a relatively low altitude.  It looked as if it were carrying a large animal by its legs.  An animal the size of a bear or cow.  She said she saw it for about 6-8 seconds and then it disappeared.  We are baffled as to what it could be.

It had a very high altitude I would say about the same height as a commercial jet.  At the time seen the night sky was very clear with only stars in the backgroud no clouds at time seen. However there were two other aircraft in the area.  One had to be a airliner or jet I could hear that and it was far behind the red light moving at about half the speed of the red light.  The other aircraft I would say was a Cessna type craft, because of the engine I knew this and its altitude was lower than the other two.  Proably on approach to the small Marion airport (mainly for crop dusters).  The two knowns had the navi lights on so I knew they were known plus the noises they make to tell the difference.  I had seen falling stars around 21:00 looking straight up moving to the west and came back outside around 22:30 so I was keeping my eyes on the sky, I saw the brightest one I've ever seen at that time falling to the east this time so I stayed outside to watch the show looking east when the red unknown caught my attention.  It could not of been a sattelite to low an orbit. Then what I hope was a Common Barn Owl schreeched at me several times and scared me back in the house.

Okay, here’s the deal. I’ve always wanted to see a UFO and tonight I got the chance to see 4!! I’ve seen things in the past that were questionable. But in my mind I could never say for sure. Tonight I finally have no doubts!! The first sighting occurred around 1:30 am and it was one UFO (strobe like) flashing across the sky heading in a slight southwest direction (a lot more west than south). At first I thought it was a shooting star, but it never burned out as I watched it fly from east to west. As it was dawning on me what I was seeing, it then quickly changed directions and turned around and flew south east kind of like what a fish would look like in water. Needless to say, I was stoked (still am)!! About 10 minutes after as I was about to head in, I saw three more headed in the same direction flying in formation. Right before they would have been out of sight I saw both side UFO’s split up left and right at the same time with the middle one flying straight. It was truly amazing!! I know what I saw was not birds or jets because they made no sound and flew way too fast (8 seconds across the sky). I don’t know star formations, but all four (both sightings) flew between the 3 straight up and down stars, and the cluster of stars (4 total I think) with one in the middle. So yeah, I’m very stoked!!! Finally after 33 years of being on this earth, I got to see it with no doubts in my mind, no one can ever take that away from me!!!

Two formations - semicircular & v-shaped. 1st moved from north to south. 2nd moved from east to west. Starting at 11:53 as I lay on the porch of my four-story townhouse in downtown Dallas. I was looking up at the night sky and I saw a semicircular object moving from north to south. The shape looked like an incomplete circle of lights that was missing about 1 or 2 lights that would have completed the circle. The single lights that made up the incomplete circle were blue-white and circular, and there were probably about 7 of them. It was moving across the sky at about the same speed that a plane would but it was moving in very sudden, subtle movements and it wasn't exactly moving in a straight line. It also seemed like it would stop on a dime and then continue as it was. Also, when I looked at the formation it looked as if I were squinting my eyes and looking at a streetlight (it was blurry), but as I looked at the stars near the formation, I could see them clearly. They continued on their path for about 2-3 minutes until they disappeared on the other side of my roof. After that I saw another formation moving from west to east. This was probably at 12:30-12:45. It was in a V-shape and it wasn't as blurry as the first one. Again it was moving at about the same speed as an airplane. These could have been jets in a very precise formation heading somewhere but it was completely inaudible. This formation seemed to move in more of a straight line but again they had some sudden, subtle movements that lead me to believe that they were not airplanes. There were probably 7 circular white-orange lights with one in the front and even amount of lights on either side of the ""V"". I am the only observer that I know of. I am 14 years old and I go to a private school in Dallas that requires greater than average intelligence. I wasn't fatigued at all as I saw these formations and I've never had any mental hallucinations or anything before. I have experienced floaters (in eye doctor jargon) but I'm sure that the objects I saw were not them. The wind was going from north to south, so they weren't flares if the! y went f rom east to west. To conclude, I have never really strongly believed in aliens or UFO's or anything of the sort, but this seems very extra terrestrial to me.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

I walked outside and looked to the south and observed Jupiter.  I am pretty familiar with the night sky, and Jupiter was to be expected.   But I quickly notices a pair of “stars” to the left of Jupiter by about 15 or 20 degrees.  If this pair was two marks on a clock, I would say they were at 10:30 and about 4:30, separated by the width of my little finger at an arms length.  These two lights were bright, as it was not totally dark yet, but they were clear to be seen.  They were low to the horizon, maybe just lower than Jupiter’s relative height above the horizon.  Being a bright pair was unusual, and after staring at them for about a minute, I just felt like they were moving faster than…stars move due to earth’s rotation.  So I tried to mark their position to a tree branch, and I do believe they were moving away from me, to the SSE, getting closer to the horizon.  The one at 4:30 position faded out first, and then the one at 10:30 faded out.  Probably satelites, but the pair is unusual for me to see.  I have seen three satelites moving together in the past, in the mid to late 90’s.  So I know it happens, but like I said, I just wanted to post this little piece that I did observe, in case somebody saw more of it, for verification purposes.  I checked for ISS passes, and I couldn’t find one during this time frame.  There was a listing for Cosmos 1408, but…I think I saw this pair prior to when Cosmos would have passed over as a single object.  Oh well.  Still waiting to see the one light that stops and takes a left!  PD...just delete this post if nobody else saw anything interesting.  I just wanted to give witness to the ""pair"" of objects.

July 31st, 1040 pm… I have reported what I have seen on every single clear night but one night…since June 17th to MUFON, and the National UFO Reporting Center.  I have seen mostly orbs with 2 witnesses…several times per night. I have said I will take a polygraph, I have offered for someone to come out and view it with me, and I took 2 photos, and I have DVD video evidence as well.  But tonight was much different. I was not even looking up to the sky, and a light hit my face from above.  The light blinded me for a second…I looked up and saw in detail a white orb, at a very high altitude, seemingly spinning, and a blue-white beam was shining from it.  As I jumped up out of my seat, (thinking I was going to have a Travis Walton Experience), the beam shut off.  The object was hovering.  When the light/beam retracted, the object changed directions, moved even higher, and started moving northeast at a fast rate, until it was out of sight.  My face right now is tingling…and I am actually shaking, as it scared the hell out of me.  I know this all sounds hard to believe, but I am willing to show you what I saw, and I am willing to take a polygraph.  The object was bright white, and made not a sound.  My face is not sun burned like Richard Dreyfus in Close Encounters, but it is tingling right now. I want someone to sit with me.  You don’t even have to look up all night at all.  I will spot it…and direct you to where it is in the sky.  For some reason, it seemed to want to make contact with me.  I think this is significant, and I want someone to check it out, follow up on this…before they stop appearing.  This has been consistent since June 17, 2008, but never before had it shined a beam down.  I am 40 years old, never saw anything before…I actually hate being ridiculed, and I cannot stand attention…but I do think this is important…I have a gut feeling…that will not go away.  That is why I go outside every single night…hoping to see it again…They just started showing up…I don’t know why…I don’t know how…but I am beyond frustrated with the reactions I get from people, and at this point, I refuse to talk to anyone except people who will at least hear me out…and have experience in dealing with UFO’s.  Whatever shot a beam down at me…was at an extremely high altitude. I don’t even bother telling the neighbors, or my friends about this.  My parents never believed me either…until they saw it themselves.  I have seen more stuff like this than anyone I have read about…and no one seems to care.  I just don’t think this one can be explained away.  What experimental aircraft makes no noise…hovers….and shines beams down to someone’s face from way up there?  My face has been tingling since 10:40…it is now…11:22. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source.

Myself and two of my friends were camping in Voyageurs National Park in Northern Minnesota for a couple nights of camping and fishing.  We were camping on an island just a few hundred yards from the Canadian border and were enjoying a campfire on Thursday night the 31st.  It was so clear out and the stars were so bright we decided to walk out to the point and star gaze for awhile.  As we're standing there just looking at the stars one of my frineds points out a satellite moving across the sky.  We all look at it and confirm to each other that, yes, it's a satellite.  No blinking lights, just a solid white light in the sky that looked like a moving star, like most satellites look from earth.  Within a couple seconds the ""satellite"" zooms incredibly close and an incredibly bright light shines down.  I wouldn't necessarily call it a ""beam"" of light, just this intense bright white light.  It shown on us for maybe two-three seconds and then turned off and as soon as it turned off it looked like the tiny little light of a satellite again, but moving much faster and within a few seconds was out of sight.  There was not a sound at all and never saw it's shape or anything, just the light.  My friend said he didn't think it zoomed down to us, but rather just became this intense light.  I, on the other hand, felt that it came down close because it wasn't a super intense little spec of light, it was close enough that the light appeared to be a foot or two across.  So distance is still a little hard to describe and me and my friends all have different thoughts on how close it was.  Whatever this was it moved across the sky from the US into Canada.  As soon as this all happened we looked at each other and started laughing because these things don't happen to us.  This only happens in the movies kind of thing.  One of my friends immediately says, ""there's many explanations for what we just saw.""  But he couldn't come up with one single explanation and agreed that what we saw was very strange and defini! tely uni dentified.  I am a 31 year old College Grad., and work as a Purchasing manager for a lumber company.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life, nor either of my friends.  We all agreed to not tell anyone about this because who's going to believe us, right?  Off course we had to tell somebody, so we ended up telling our frineds and family and off course almost every one of them asked what we were smoking that night.

After the light in the sky vanished, I saw what looked like lightning in the distance around all of the trees on the lake.   As we were coming in to dock the boat, I looked around the lake one last time and saw some flashing lights on the ground and they were orange also.  It was like fire that flashed 5 times, and then disappeared and moved to another spot then flashed again and disappeared.   It was amazingly terrifying!

Our iPhones did not have the ability to resolve the image.  The object passed below a bright object (assumed Jupiter) and was two to three times its brightness and its observable arc width.  It was significantly brighter than any other object in the sky.  We were in a boat at the time, and the reflection of the object in the water was distinctly apparent.  The object displayed variable random intensity as if a glowing fiery ember, consistently appearing orange to amber in color, and slowly inconsistently dissolved at the end of its track.  The entire event lasted approximately 95-110 seconds. It is also notable that the object seemed to alter course by 5-10 degrees east of track at approximately 65-70 seconds (030-035 azimuth) into the event.  We contacted http://www.nuforc.org/ and were subsequently advised that this object was seen in the same time frame from Massachusetts to Chicago, possibly fractured into multiple objects.  We were advised that this is too slow for a fast moving meteor atmospheric impact or grazing event.  We saw several of these (meteors) which are very white and short lasting within the preceding sixty minutes.  This was not an aircraft, displaying normal anti-collision strobe lights and red, green, and white navigation lights.  This was not a satellite in low-earth-orbit transitioning from day to night.  We saw several of these pass into the eclipse of the Earth’s shadow prior to this event and the object did not behave as if reflecting solar light.  Also, it would be abnormal for a satellite to orbit in this Southeast to North Northwest direction.  There are four people that witnessed the event on this boat.  I am an experienced Airline Transport Pilot with 6000+ hours flying and have not witnessed anything similar prior to this.

On August 13, 14 and 16th, my girlfriend, I and her three children observed two objects in the sky adjacent to the campground we use during the Summer months. The first was massive and closer to us than the second. It was extremely bright in the sky and moved forward and back, slowly. On the 13th, it was very close to us but not close enough to view a shape with the naked eye. It did not display colors with the exception of a bright white light. It was viewed in the Eastern sky. The first night, it was very close but the remaining nights, it was much further away. The second was in the Southern skies and displayed flashing red lights.  It moved in a strange pattern, forward and back and then up and down. When it was moving forward and back, it was moving in a clear elliptical pattern.  Mindful that most UFO sightings are generally planets and stars, we used two stars as points of reference. At times, it would be above the plain between the two stars and within ten minutes or so, would transverse to the left, nearly covering the star on the left.  Then it would travel to the right, obstructing our view of the star on the right. Within thirty minutes or so it would drop below the plain between the two stars we were using as a point of reference. It followed this pattern repeatedly over the next hour. We watched this event on three separate nights for a minimum of one hour each.  On the 15th, the object was not visible.  Radar indicated that there was no cloud cover and all stars were visible.  It was a very clear night.  I spoke to a family friend who works for an Aeronautical company and he confirmed the information that I gained from my Father.  Satellites do not move in a pattern like what we observed. It is physically impossible for a star or planet to display the movements we witnessed. No alcohol or intoxicants were involved during the events and cloud cover was nonexistent. I intend on taking a telescope to the campground before the end of the month to see if I can view the objects again. I will file a second report with the new information, along with pictures (it’s a sweet telescope).",2009-08-27T00:00:00,,

I was standing by the pool when someone called my attention to an odd orange light in the sky that was varying in intensity like a fire.  It was moving towards us at the right speed and altitude to be a small plane and was heading from south to north.  I then noticed my son standing next to me looking at it as well. I thought at first it was a plane on fire.  As I watched I noticed that there were no other lights on this object like an aircraft should have, just a chaotic dimming and brightening orange light.  We did not hear any sound from the object but we did have music playing outside that could have masked any sound.  We watched the object travel across the sky, behind a large pine tree, and back into view.  A few moments later it started dimming and then went out entirely and we could see only dark sky.  The whole event seemed to last about a minute but my better judgment says about 30 to 40 seconds.  There were no clouds in the sky, no unusual weather conditions, just a calm cool summer night.   I checked the news on both the internet and local paper today (the morning after) but have found no reports of anything that would explain what we saw.   A horizontal moving flare?  Ball lightning?

There were about seven of us sitting in the front of my residence.  The group consisted of a brother, children, in-law and relatives. The neighbors started the fireworks about mid-night. The continuous exploding of fireworks last for about 9 to 11 minutes.  At the end of the firecrackers exploding, our attention was drawn to the southeastern sky.  Flying in a westerly direction were several unknown objects.  The first formation consisted of four objects. Three of these appeared to be in some type of symetrical formation and the fourth one of this group was alone.  These four objects were red in color and we could not see any blinking lights nor could we hear any noise coming from this group.  They objects were low enough that we should have been able to hear whether or not they were of a fixed wing aircraft or rotor aircraft. Behind this group of four we noticed two others and either a single or a third group of two objects.  All of the objects were similar in nature in that they all displayed a red light, none displayed any flashing lights. We could not see any color that would be visible on an aircraft; green on one side or a solid white when viewing from the rear. The sky was clear as we could see stars and a partial moon.  The wind was blowing from the north.  We had a small fire in an outdoor pit and we were sitting in a semi-circle.  I myself was sitting with my back to the north, viewing the objects coming from the east, heading westward as if to say they were followig directly over I-10. As the objects moved slightly to a point past 180 to 190 degrees, the objects seemed to just disappear.  There were no clouds that would obsecure our view of these objects.   The objects in the second and third group disappeared as did the ones in the first group. Members of the viewing group includes a 63 year old registered pharmacist and his wife who is a college graduate and her daughter; my 25 year old son, a college graduate and his wife who is a registered nurse; my sister-in-law who is a photographer; myself, a 55 year old retired state police polygraph examiner and my wife a Licensed Practical Nurse. There was no-one in the group who was intoxicated.  I had only had two drinks all night.  The only explanation I can give for not hearing any aircraft noise is that our ears were ringing from the fireworks.

January 1, 2009 just after midnight local time (CST) in Tyler, Texas we saw at first two glowing yellow-gold orbs flying from the southeast in a northwest direction (more toward the west).  Their altitude was just above the tree tops and they were flying in perfect formation staying the same distance from each other through the whole sighting.  The sky was clear (no clouds) and there was little to no wind blowing. At first we thought that it could be that they were coming from a Roman candle since there were some fireworks being set off at the time (it being just after midnight at the New Year), but these objects were flying too perfectly and stayed at the same altitude the whole time. The light from these objects stayed at the same intensity throughout until they finally faded away at the horizon, and there was no sound. Just as the first two objects disappeared another two appeared from the southeast (the same direction as the first two).  These two orbs were identical in size and shape to the first two.  They were flying a little farther apart from each other than the first two (it seemed about twice as far), and the first one of this second two objects to appear was flying at a little higher altitude than the following object.  Again these two orbs flew at the same speed as the first two and stayed at the same distance from each other and at the same altitude throughout the sighting.  Also the intensity of the light from these objects was the same as the first two and similarly did not vary until they just faded away as they reached the horizon.

Estimated Distance: 2-5 miles Estimated Altitude: 2000 ft. Shape: Saucer with some height on sides like a bottle cap but double the relative height. Features: Red glow underneath with intensity that seemed to fluctuate in coordination with the UFO's movement. Story:  I went out side my home to have a cigarette - no smoking indoors. A red light first caught my attention.  As I looked on, I saw a saucer shaped object.  At first I assumed it was a plane or helicopter and it's altitude seemed close to the altitude where I have seen helicopters hovering in the past.  The UFO was descending and approaching.  Within 30 seconds the UFO was close enough to see very clearly but didn't appear to get closer than around a mile or two.

I walked to the other side of the yard in an attempt to see around this large tree but after 3 or 4 minutes couldn't locate the UFO so I went inside.  The UFO was in my view for around 3-4 minutes. My view of the object was clear and the UFO was absolutely not a helicopter nor airplane.  The craft appeared to move or ""float"" in all directions although it never made any radical maneuvers or cha! nges in acceleration. About this report: written 3 minutes after the sighting occurred.  Since I am not in some remote, isolated, location, it seems odd to view something so strange - whether it be a UFO or some air-force experiment. I cannot say what it was. All I can report as certain, is that what I saw was not any type of normal aircraft. I can't say whether it is due to the distance of the craft or not, but if the object was making any sound, I couldn't hear it. About the whiteness: 39 year old male who has never seen nor reported a sighting before.  I have also never experienced nor reported any form of anomalous or paranormal experience. My eyesight is currently 21x20 and I have never required or used glasses.  My house where this sighting occurred is located in a normal, non-remote, neighborhood and there are no buildings, high rises or stadiums near enough to view.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

I want to start off by saying that I am incredibly skeptical when it comes to this subject, but I witnessed something last night that I cannot explain. I attend a local college and left class around 9:30pm. On my way home (headed north on Highway 27), I saw a bright orange light ahead of me. The full moon was abnormally large, so I assumed Earth may have been extra close to a particular star or planet. The light was too big to be a plane or helicopter, and at first, it appeared to be too high up to be either of those. As I continued driving, I realized it wasn’t a planet or star, because I seemed to be getting closer to it. At this point, I was trying to figure out what in the heck I was looking at. It was too high to be a light at the top of a tower, but it wasn’t moving or blinking either. As I got closer, the object got bigger, almost as if it were floating above the new soccer field on the south end of town. I turned right on Hunt Brothers Road, and at t! his point, I had a car right on my bumper. I kept looking at the light, which appeared to be almost directly above me. When I looked up, I saw three orange lights that formed a tight triangle. I kept trying to get a better look at it, but because I was in a vehicle, it was hard to see something that close (yet still so high in the air). I nearly had my whole head of the window when the lights quickly moved east (much too fast to be a plane, jet or helicopter). When this happened, I noticed that car behind me basically stopped in the middle of the road. They must have been watching too, and when the lights moved so quickly, they slammed on their brakes. When I looked back up, the lights were gone. This is where it gets even weirder… I immediately called my husband (who is even more of a skeptic than I am!). When I started telling him what I saw, he didn’t laugh or make jokes, he was actually listening and being serious about it. After I told him what I saw, he said, “That is! so weird. I am not kidding you, I saw the same thing on my wa! y home f rom work.” He works in a city north of Lake Wales and had seen this same thing two hours before I had seen it. As he headed south on Highway 27, he saw the bright orange light. It disappeared before he made it into Lake Wales. As he traveled east on Highway 60, the light reappeared about five miles east of the Lake Wales. This time, there were three lights in the shape of a triangle. He said he kept starting until it disappeared. The distance between where I saw the triangle and where he witnessed it is about 10 miles. For two skeptics to see the same thing, at different times, in slightly different locations, and NOT be able to explain them… that is strange in itself. Part of me wants to believe it has something to do with the bombing range located to the south of us (in Avon Park), but I really can’t say.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,27.87365806451613,-81.51855806451613

I am a security officer in the Napa area.   On 12/01/2009 at about 22:55 I was walking around an apartment complex in the city of Napa, CA.  My girlfriend was talking to her mother on the phone and she had me on the phone as well.  I was listening to my girlfriend talking to her mother through my Bluetooth device. While walking around this apartment complex, I happened to look up through the trees, toward the south.  I saw a bright light in the sky traveling northbound.  At first I thought this was a plane that had just taken off from the airport with its landing lights still on.  Then I noticed that it wobbled as it traveled and had no flashing lights on it.  It was also a little larger and brighter than any of the stars in the sky. Still thinking this was a plane, I found a larger opening in the trees and continued to watch it.  It appeared to stop briefly a couple of times.  The light traveled until it was almost straight up from where I was. It was still slightly south of me though. It just stopped in the sky and hovered.  There was no noise to it either.  As I watched this thing hover, I could see two horizontal lights on the sides of it.  For a moment I thought it could be a blimp with words scrolling on the sides of it but it was too small or too high, to be a blimp.  And a blimp has the lighted words on opposing sides.  This thing had the lights forward on each side, not opposite of each other. As I stood and looked at this thing, I realized this was not a plane and told my girlfriend to go outside and look at it.  She, in turn, told her mother to go outside and look too.  My girlfriend did not go outside but her father, who was with her mother, went outside at her mother’s request.  He said he didn’t see it.  I told them that it was the brightest looking ""star"" in the sky, just south of where the moon was.  Nobody else saw this light. As I watched this light, it began backing up and travelling southbound, the way it had come.  As it did, it dropped something.  What it dropped looked like a piece of glitter, but obviously larger.  It sparkled for about a second and then was no longer visible.  The light dropped about 4 or 5 of these things that I could see.  After that, the object flickered and looked like it disappeared.  It then lit back up and flickered some more. I heard some people walking toward me so I looked toward them to point this object out to them.  I wanted someone else to see this besides just me.  Well, the people who were coming toward me went into an apartment before reaching my location.  I looked back up at the sky, where the object was, and noticed it was no longer visible.  I wish I had watched it to see if it just flickered out or if it traveled somewhere else. There was some cloud cover and this object appeared to be below the clouds.  I kept watching for it all night after this and never did see it again.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,38.46812121212121,-122.19507146464646

They accelerate very fast, & brake just the same!  Move weird & come in 3's arranged in a triangle The climax of my first night, and all my other sightings, was when  I was watching six of them and they all moved up at the same time in a very unique way!   I’ve seen these UFO’s 5 different nights now.  I’ve got two other witness’s , and as of now I’ve got about  1 hour of good video tape all together .    Usually when I see them its between 10:30 p.m and 1:00 am eastern time.  They usually appear in threes, and only on the very first night was there ever more than three confirmed moving in the sky in one night.   These UFO’s seem to have intelligent operator’s.  I say this because I’ve went out side twice to try to see them better on the first couple nights but when I went out they became very still, and continued to remain still for 10 mins or so after I went inside my house. To be honest and upfront,  They look and in a sense act like star’s.  That’s the main reason why I said they had intelligent operators! 	 In due time these ufo’s “glide “as I call it across the night sky.  But they don’t only glide!  They make short, very  very  fast jerky movements at times.  I’ve seen them do u turns, complete loops and double loops, sometimes they do pointless maneuvers like,  right-----à left , right---------àLeft, right------à and I’ve seen them do 45 degree turns one right after another, They flicker but usually are the same basic colors of the stars, but the same three seem to keep appearing and one of the three is always a amberish color.  But they have a flicker effect to them that  always catches my eye.  I spotted the very first one only because it was flickering.  They make, what look like very short, fast, and erratic movements, but If your not watching that one target you would never see it moving, But on the other hand, if your only watching the one SO CALLED STAR no human alive would doubt me when it moves !!! 	 I’ve seen them slowly dim out, I’ve seen them flicker what seemed to be, at one another , and then start to flicker in sync.  When they flickered at each other and in sync the did it very brightly, and instead of a flicker,  they kind of flashed. But the night they flickered at one another and in sync was my on first night.   That night I spotted one, then I  identified three, then out of no where three more showed up, and than I was watching multiple targets move at once, since at that time they all moved rather close to each other and grouped up.  That’s around the time they all moved up in a weird fashion “which can be described if asked”   The only time I could really count them was when they all moved weirdly up together.  They would dim down and disappear and reappear out of nowhere.  But when they moved up together , they all stayed lit up, allowing me to count quickly. 	 But the most craziest part is when a bright one, “some are brighter than others” Shot out three more of these ufo’s .  One came out straight down.  Then the other two shot out at a downward 45 degree angle , one on each side.   The climax lasted maybe, 4-8 mins  then if they didn’t dim down and disappear, they moved slowly out of the South East sky, and continued moving to and threw the south southeast sky, until I could not see them no more threw my window.   But , the way they move makes no sense, and the way they accelerate is UNBELIVABLELY fast!!  They seem to be able to stop just as fast as well! 	I have a lot more to say but don’t want to ramble on.  There is so much to gain from what I’m seeing.  I can only hope you take me serious.  I would gladly upload the video I‘ve got but my camcorder use’s 8mm tapes, but I’ve burned it to a dvd+R disc, but I cant get my computer to read it!!!!  I could mail a copy????? When I video taped I opened my window ”even though it was freezing” and removed my screen and video taped while my camera sat completely still!  Some of the video is really convincing!!!   Now, I love outer space and stargazing!  I just turned 29 this year , so for about 15 years now I’ve avidly looked at the sky.  And I wouldn’t be writing this, nore would I have lost any sleep the first night, if I had stopped watching  what I thought might  have been a quasar ‘ which didn’t alarm me until it moved!”, just one second before it started moving.  But when that star/quasar started moving, well lets just say that’s 3 seconds of movement I’ll never forget! I need more and better cameras, I need professionals to see this!!!!!!    Please contact me!!!!!!!!   I don’t want to be famous, I just want the truth !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.s I just seen that I can mail my dvd+R disc to you so, I will do so.

Then all of a sudden in a span of a second it dimmed and went completely out and we could see all the stars around it!  My other friend said good call to my son that it was a shooting star!  At the same time my other friend and I said that, that was no shooting star.  It was moving way to slow to be a shooting star and it was way too bright to be a satellite!  So I said “well son I guess by definition it was a UFO because none of us had any clue to what it was!  Then about 5 min later 2 kids aged 14 came back from the pavilion claiming that they saw a UFO the same thing we saw and described it exactly as we saw it!  The next morning we spotted at least 3 military helicopters flying around the camp site as if they were searching for something!  I have no idea what it was to this day but sure would like to hear from anyone that may have also seen something that night in the same area!",2009-06-09T00:00:00,42.1625,-89.2477

It started on the 23rd of May 2010. My wife and I were in our garden watching an aeroplane wich it was   leaving a long white trail. I was thinking how bad or not those kind of trails could affect on our health. Suddenly I saw something at a very high altitude. It was reflecting the sun`s light. At first I thought it could have been a satellite visible from the ground but it was changing position very fast....My wife saw it too. After a while it disappeared and I was thinking that thing was probably a ufo and it was a shame I did not have my camera with me when suddenly another different one appeared it much lower in altitude. I felt a bit scared and I tried to see and understand the shape. It was black not circular. I would say “squared”  with different sections with one part in red. Still I did not have my camera. I thought if I would have gone upstairs I might have lost it. I`ve runned upstairs  and when I went down it was gone. Since then I see ufos everyday. Today the 31st of May 2010 I saw another different shaped one. It was triangular with lights on the angles. I have tried to take pictures but I don`t know why the images are not good at all.

I just feel like I need to tell somebody now because what I saw was incredible.  I have told a few friends but I am most definitely sure that they think I saw something(I don’t care if nobody believes me, I know what I saw).   I love to watch the UFO television shows but I am the type that has to see something in order for me to believe so if my friends came up to me saying they saw something I would also may tell them I believe them but in the back of my mind I would probably think they saw something.  Well let me get started.  It was my friends’ birthday and we decided to go to the club 2009 in Dallas, Texas.  We planned on getting wasted and have a good time like we always do.  Well we got to the club and it was a normal night until I deci! ded to go out to the car and smoke a cig with my girl.  We got to the car around 1:45AM.  We were in the car facing north in the parking lot, I was in the passenger seat and she was in the driver seat.  We were having a conversation over something very old as we watched people walk by.  I remember looking at the security guard on top of the building patrolling, looking down, I guess to make sure nothing crazy happened,  it was around 2:15AM when out of the corner of my eye I saw  UFO floating from east to west as if to be a balloon.  As soon as I saw IT, I said “Look” to my girl and we both rushed out the car to look at the thing, we both are sure it wasn’t a plane or a balloon especially because of its lights.  When we stepped out it seemed to have stopped and it just started getting smaller as it went up and before I could process what the hell was going on, it was gone!  The overall time it was there was around 10 seconds.  Well I must say I was a little drunk but it was! n’t my first time drinking and in all my life of getting drunk! I have never seen things that weren’t there especially disk like flying objects.  I also want to say that WE only saw if for a small amount of time so I don’t want to give a description of it since it may be inaccurate but I do remember that it was circular and it had circular blue lights under it!  I also remember that it was kind of fat in the middle so it wasn’t a perfect circle or sphere, maybe egg shaped but like I said I don’t want to go into too much detail since I may be inaccurate.  All I know is that I saw something that I had never seen before and I really didn’t believe in that stuff but I now know that there is “something” out there.  The object made no noise and when it started to elevate did not leave a trail/aurora, nothing, it didn't shoot off into space either like on television, it simply elevated very fast.  I am also almost certain that the guy patrolling on the roof saw it but I’m not sure.  I also know it was around 2:15AM because my cousin called at 2:22AM a! nd by then I just kept talking about it and it had just happened. I also want to add that about 2 minutes after we saw the UFO we were standing outside(because I made my girlfriend stand by me just in case we saw something else) I was looking East of in the distance when I saw 2 star like lights moving up and down as if to be playing but when I told her to ""look"" they were gone!  That only lasted for about 3 seconds. If anybody has seen something similar I would love to hear about it and compare, I am really interested and excited because I now know we are not alone.  If you think I was too drunk or I am mistaken, NO! I know what I saw.  I wish I could have captured it on camera but I don't know why I didn't even think about it.  I will go there again and try to capture some proof.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

For thirty minutes I witnessed a sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Mt. Pocono area. At around the NJ/PA border, I spotted a star as I faced west and a light approximately a hand’s distance below that star.  The light appeared to be red and green from afar, so I assumed it was an aircraft of some sort.  As I drove approximately for thirty minutes or so, I noticed that the light just above the horizon was getting brighter and larger.  As I came upon the intersection between W-80 and 380-N, I noticed that the craft was to my left (south of the W-80 road).  It appeared twice the size of a full moon, approximately 9-10 building stories above the ground, hovering.  It was very large in appearance.  At the time, the sun was setting so I had a little light to make out the bulk of the object. The craft seemed metallic in appearance, and seemed to have vertical metallic grooves going down the sides.  The object was dreidel or cross-shaped and had white lights on the upper, lower, right and left extremities.  It also had a red light in the middle of the craft.  There were also some blinking green lights along the top of the craft.  The craft emitted no sound, nor did it move.

I glanced up at the sky and I noticed what at first I thought to be a plane, flying in the southern sky, heading north.  The first thing that caught my eye was three, bright blue lights, almost the color of the lights on a black light.  I pointed this out to my friend, and he noticed how unusual the object looked also.  It was flying low enough that if it were an airplane, you would definitely be able to hear it; however this craft was completely silent. It was then that we realized this was no airplane. We immediately called my cousin and his two friends outside to look at the UFO. The five of us ran behind the house into the St. Collette church field. The three blue lights were flashing on and off, about every 3 seconds or so. When they were off, we could clearly make out the shape of the UFO.  It was a dark, circular shape. As the lights came back on, they were rotated, as if the UFO was slowly spinning.  We tried to get pictures of the object on our cell phones, but apparently it was too dark out and the UFO was too far away to get the shot, which was really frustrating.  We watched the UFO flying south for approximately 5 minutes. When the UFO was almost out of our view, about to go behind some clouds, all five of us noticed that it appeared to quickly move upward in a diagonal direction, and then move back down, as if it were making an upside-down “v”.  About 30 seconds after that, the UFO was out of our view.  Although we are not sure the size of the UFO, since we don’t know exactly how high up it was flying, it appeared to be at least the size of small airplane.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,42.0678,-88.0185

I thought this continuous pattern of low flying, low level observation, was odd, especially after the fourth time of it flying right over me.  The beach was almost unpopulated, it being a Monday, and it being a very long 3 mile stretch of beach, and I was down about a quarter mile, away from most people at the entrance.  So, there were about fifty people on the beach but all but me and three other people were at the entrance.  I had my binoculars with me, so I decided to get a close up of the plane as it kept flying directly over me in its circling.  I first noticed no FAA identifying markings of any ki! nd on it...no numbers or letters, etc. I saw only one small blinking red light at the tip of the rear 'fin' (aeleron?), and then I noticed a conspicuous large dark spot, like an oval camera lens, on the underside of the fuselage behind the wings.  I then thought this was some kind of secret government plane taking photos.  The plane continued its pattern of circling over the beach where I was, so I decided to leave and head for my trunk in the parking lot.  The plane made another pass, this time right over me in the parking lot, whereupon I took out my binoculars again to get another close look....while looking at the bottom of the 'plane' I was shocked to see a quick flash of green light, very bright, come from what I thought previously was a camera lens!  This quick flash of green light was directed toward me, as if they were letting me know that they saw me, and maybe even were reading my thoughts.  It freaked me out, as I said, 'oh my God.'  It was so unnatural a thing ! that it did.  This  was no ordinary plane by any means, but a ! craft ma squerading as a twin engine plane, but having a whole different propulsion and technology, as in the green light underneath.  There were no wing tip lights or any thing which I thought should be on a registered FAA plane.  It made a sound very similar to a prop plane, but different.  The windows were all blacked out, including the cockpit windows.  I then left in my truck and drove to Walmart about 5 miles away.  After shopping for a half hour I decided to go back to the beach parking lot to see if the 'plane' was still there in its same circling pattern, and it was!  It flew a couple hundred feet above the shoreline, then circled over the salt pond in back of the beach, headed West again, and then repeated this pattern, over and over...nothing normal about it.  This is just one more strange aircraft sighting in this area.  My belief is that aliens are masquerading their craft as jets, passenger jets, and small prop/commuter planes like this one.  The strange 'camera' spot/l! ens that flashed bright green at me while I was looking at it through the binoculars was the strangest event, and a bit intimidating...maybe that was 'their' intent.  Something very strange in going on in southern Rhode Island...very strange.  By the way, the flashing green light did not emit a beam that I could see.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,41.396,-71.6631

A large object. The sun was still fairly high at this time and was at my back.  In comparison the object would have been 1.5 times the width of the sun.  It could have been as long as a football field but what I saw at that distance looked like it took up the space a middle school spans.  Like a shopping plaza. It was white. WHITE.  It did appear to fade on the edge which was either some motion blur or reflection if it was shiny.  I can’t say it was shiny but it did appear to be somewhat reflective on the edges.  It looked a lot like a flying cigarette. A white filter cigarette about the size of a shopping plaza passed over my area and looked like it was about two miles away. Our entire town here is only 1.7 miles wide. The area is heavily congested with shopping districts and we are within 4miles of the turnpike. The commerce traffic up here is huge both on the ground and in the air. There are always balloons, small private planes, military stuff, black choppers all the time from Willow Grove and who knows where else. There is a small airport within a mile of my home and others within two miles in neighboring towns. SOMEONE HAD TO SEE THIS.  There was heavy plane traffic all day and there usually is on nice days.  The thing that can clear this up is a pilot. I was looking east on my lawn to look at one of the jets blowing one of those afterburner smoke trails traveling straight up.  My sight line at that point was looking upward more than likely 65degrees as the plane was traveling fast my gave follows it up and the cigarette either showed up or coasted into my site line and that damn thing just traveled real smooth from right to left even broke the plane of the smoke trail, no sound almost looked like it faded but I was squinting to see if this was an illusion but this thing traveled.  It did not dip, fade out, it was not smoke it did look like it could cloak itself. This is broad daylight……….. A WHITE OBJECT on a light blue sky, CLEAR day!  It could have been a giant Frisbee.  Please help me. I watched the object for 30-60secs.  I don’t have the exact time of day either.  I was so glued to it I didn’t get to my watch, I hurried into the house to grab my binoculars that are by the door knowing when I came out I wouldn’t be able to locate it.  It was white.  I never would have seen it if I wasn’t looking at the jet. About 90mins later my neighbor north of my home two doors down meets me and my girlfriend out front on the sidewalk and I asked him if he saw anything within the last two hours and he verified a cigarette traveling westbound.  His sightline was toward the south which indicates to me the object had to have made a hard left after I went into the house.  His iteration to me has the object traveling towards the highway.  When I saw the object it was traveling parallel to the highway.  Our homes are in a row and his yard is about 60 feet from mine to my left. Background information: I am 41yo and live with my girlfriend of many years.  I have spent much of my career in print publishing and design. I manage an advertising portal site and speculate stocks.  My neighbor is a 22yo cabinet maker by trade and is an import auto enthusiast.  He’s an honest kid and lives with his family.  He had a night sighting a few weeks ago and I brushed him off. I know why this place was a flap at one time.  I want and explanation from someone so I can brush it off like swamp gas or something. They fly a lot of stuff around here someone had to get a shot of it and can tell me it was a new jetliner that flies with no wings or tail and I will believe it.  Just tell me something.  Please.  I am going to the two closest airfields tomorrow and ask some questions.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,40.4418,-75.3416

The majority of the lights were white but a few were red. The lights were very clear and visible on the objects. I stated to my son that he should look out of the back window of the car and see the lights but at then at that moment I noticed that there was more than one of the objects. Two of the objects were very close together maybe about 100 to 200 ft. and the other three were further away in distance. I keep telling my son to get out the car and look that I was not trying to be funny; he stated that he saw the object earlier and that he thought because it was in the sky that it had to be a blimp. I stated that a blimp is not that bright and that blimps does not hover like that! the light were very clear I could not put a shape to the object but it definitely was not that of a of a blimp.

I, my brother and a close friend were driving to my cousins in Erin, Ontario.  We were coming close to the edge of the town, when my brother noticed something moving in a strange way in the sky.  It turned out to be a star and the moving clouds created the illusion of it moving.  As I looked at the star I noticed something else.  It looked like a tear from the side but from below it was a triangular shape.  It had a red light on what looked like the aft of the vessel. It was so close I thought it was a plane making an emergency landing.  We opened the windows to see what it sounded like, and heard nothing at all.  If it was any known craft in this area it would have been deafening at the distance it was.  We decide to follow the craft as far as we could we got to the edge of the town and watched the craft fly east at a steady pace, stop, hover, then fly west, stop, hover, then continue north west.  The three of us are still unsure what this was! and there was no reported military training in that area.  A week prior to this my brother and I were outside my house when we noticed what looked like a star moving very fast across the sky.  I said that it was probably a satellite just I  I said that the star stopped moved the opposite direction, so east, and then continued its original path, until it was out of sight.  My brother and I have had a number of experiences with these phenomenons.  We used to live close to military base Borden in Proton Township, and we would see these same types of craft all the time.  Being located so close to the military base they let the community know when they are training, and none of the sighting to which I speak of corresponded to these training exercises.

They seemed to follow each other in more of a floating manner like a balloon, than that of a helicopter or other aircraft. The objects made no sound.

Within the span of seconds, the three orbs came streaking from seemingly out of nowhere across the sky, towards us from the north, then came to a complete stop, hovered momentarily just above the treeline, then dashed away very quickly towards the south. As soon as the orbs had sped away from us, my roommate, who was driving said, ""Wow, did you see that too?""   We then had a conversation confirming that each of us had seen the event. I decided to submit this report after reading a local news article regarding the same event.  A unique thing about this sighting is that after getting home, I noted the sighting on twitter.com.

I could see them from my front walkway but not from where I was when I got near my car as my neighbor’s homes were in the way.  They were slightly to the East of due South.  I’d say they were at 15 degrees as far as elevation goes.   Since there were 4 of them and the color was different than the aircraft I see flying into PDX I decided to look at them a little closer. I held still, trying to discern any movement amongst any of the lights using the roof lines of my neighbor’s home as a reference.  I detected no movement and it crossed my mind that they could be stars.   Then I thought about it and looked for other stars in the sky and they were nowhere near the brightness or the color.  As far as brightness goes I would say maybe 10 times as bright as a normal star, and maybe half as bright as the lights I see on the commercial aircraft flying in and out of PDX.  Also they were smaller than the lights of the commercial aircraft appear.   So, I go to my car, which was closer to my neighbor’s and just make a note of it in my head in case I hear an explanation on the news. Coming out of my car, I heard/saw my neighbor’s garage door opening.  I was excited so I went to go tell him what I had seen.  But before I could I thought I’d better go back to were I could see them just to verify they were still there; they were gone.  I decided to tell him anyway because he saw me and asked ‘why are you running’?  I then explained what I had just seen.  About 30 seconds later tow teen girls came walking down the sidewalk (east bound).  I asked them had they seen the lights and they said yes.  I asked them if they were freaked out and they said yes.  I told them my story and that I didn’t see what happened to them.  They said the 4 lights moved together into one.  I forget what they said about where they went. I talked to my neighbor a bit about it and then came in and called 911.  They had not heard of anyone else calling in but they gave me the UFO hotline number.  I called a 206 area code number and the gentlemen asked if he could call back in about 5 minutes.  I said yep and asked him if he was busy with the same thing I just saw.  He said yes.  I then called KGW Portland TV news, and asked if they had any reports yet.  They said no but they would contact dispatch to se if anything had been reported.  A few minutes later a gentleman from the National UFO Reporting Center called and said someone else had just called him also and they were filling out a report.   He then asked if I had internet access and I said I was right next to my PC.   He asked if I’d fill out a report and that’s what I’m doing now.

While sitting in our lawn chairs, facing due east, we  were scanning the sky but no really looking for anything.  It was relatively clear night with just a few low level clouds.  After a short period of time (15 minutes) a bright object was observed traveling in a south east direction.  The object appeared to be twice as large as Venus, moving very fast (twice as fast an airplane) and dimmed in brightness as it’s distance from us increased.  We assumed it was the ISS with the docked shuttle Endeavor.    This initial sighting was approximately 30 minutes after sunset. From that point onward we observed multiple lights exhibiting various levels of brightness and speed.  Our observations lasted until approximately 10:30pm CST.  We assumed that the lights we saw were satellites in orbit.  If this is the correct explanation what explains the variable brightness, speed, and the large number of objects?  The path of the objects appeared random.  Some traveled directly north, while others traveled east, south, west, and varying combinations.  More than one object exhibited brightness variations even though the sun had set one hour before. The objects were star like and fast.  In one case a commercial airliner was flying due west and was overtaken (as viewed from our perspective) by one of the star like objects flying in the same direction.  Our interpretation was that the smaller object was at a substantially higher altitude ... possibly low earth orbit.  At one point we saw four objects moving in separate directions.

About a minute after I first spotted it, an airplane was heading our direction and it disappeared quite suddenly. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.

I was in Langley in the Murrayville region and not very far from the police station it was on my right side - I was on foot and decided to sit at a bus stop for a moment as I felt something was kind of  watching me.   Friday was a beautiful day with good visability and just a flew fluffy clouds.  I was looking out North and appearing high in the sky was a [dot] very very high up in the sky -  This dot  wasn't moving at all.  I then watched this stationary dot for about a minute and it just assended upwards towards space until I couldn't see it anymore.   I then continued on foot to the local coffe house and had a latte.  I then headed back in the general direction where I had just come from and noticed a vacant field.   I decided to place my jacket on the gound and sit there peacefully for a few mins and bask in the spring sun.  I was aware of my surroundings including several men working to the right of this field (city, municiple workers)  suddendly from my left side of the peripheral vision I saw something very strange.  I thought it was a metallic butterfly (taking off from the ground) or field where I was sat.   This highly reflective object was probably no bigger than compact disc in size.   It wobbled and had the motion of a jumping butterfly.  I would guestimate this object's distance to be 20 metres from me.   It moved across the field left to right and also lifting up higher and accended upwards towards the clouds and beyond.   I then took out my cell phone and tried to video cam this (checked video afterward but couldn't see anything on replay due to very poor video quality)   Also to verify what I was seeing I then ran over to the City Municiple workers and asked them to look in the sky way up to see this shimmering object - One guy said yes + the other guy couldn't see this until I gave him my sunglasses.  They both saw it thought it was very strange.    While speaking with these workers the object  disappeared.    Several minutes after I saw something odd start to zoom across the sky at high speed and I asked this guy walking towards me if he could see this object moving quickly?   He said yes (what is that?) I said, ""I'm not sure"", but something else I saw prior to this object moving high speed was very very strange in that field over there.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,,

Thinking to myself that I was about to look at another Gecko or some creepy crawly thing I walked over to them.

He said that - noticed it first, and he said,  ""Look Daddy at the stars moving across the sky!""   I started to make out the image as triangular with a glowing sphere shield around the base.  It had colored flashing lights that were blue, yellow, and red making the perfect points for a triangle.  I confirmed what I was seeing with my husband, and he said that he saw the same shape I did.

My brother and I were just closing the front door of our house from the inside when my brother called me outside. He said look up there – he pointed to the sky above the area of the Woodbine shopping centre. My brother exclaimed that there were two objects in the sky. I said they must be planes ‘cause we live only minutes from the airport. I saw the two lights, one that I am certain was an airplane cause of the flashing light pattern and the relative size of the lights. The object of concern was a very large yellow light and was shaped like a star in the sky (basically round). This yellow object did not flash or blink like an airplane nor did it grow or shrink in size. It just stayed in the same spot for approximately 60 seconds, then moves to one side very quickly and disappeared. When I first saw it (and my brother too) an airplane had been in the same airspace as the yellow orb light thing. The airplane seemed to have come from behind the light (UFO?) and broke away hard from the shared airspace and the plane continued towards the airport and then out of sight. I have lived by the airport all my life (33 years) and I see airplanes every three minutes (I live 2 minutes from the airport). Oh, as I am writing this I can remember the absence of noise. I could only hear the faint hum of the highway off in the distance. Overall, I must say that the yellow orb (UFO?) is not like any aircraft I’ve ever seen. My brother (older than me) was slightly shaken by the unusual sight too. Thank you for your attention to my observation report. C.M.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,43.7139,-79.6434

We were on Interstate 89 heading south just past Exit 14 when I first noticed two bright lights in the sky.  I've sat on the tarmack at O'Hare airport enough to know what planes look like when they're ""stacked up"" waiting to land at night and have their ""landing lights"" on.  That's what I thought I was seeing.  After driving a few miles I could see a plane that was flying very low, coming in for a landing.  This was on the left side of the Interstate near the Williston exit, #12.  Looking to the right I then saw the lights, which I again thought were planes in line to land...but now there were three of the bright lights.  The two on the left were closer together than the one that was farthest to the right.  As we drove a bit further down the road either trees or hills blocked the view of that part of the sky.  I commented to my friend that it seemed very odd that Burlington airport would have 3 planes waiting to land...ever, let alone at that time of night.  He said he thought the lights were too close together to have been planes.  A mile or two down the road, the Interstate curves to the right as it goes down a hill...about 2 miles before the Richmond exit.  I figured that we would have a good view of the ""same"" sky when we got there and then we'd have another chance to look at the lights.  However, we never saw the lights again.  The night sky was very dark, no moon...and no clouds.  I believe that, if the lights had been planes, we would have seen them again as they came in to land.  But we never saw or heard a plane landing (after the one we saw landing as we drove past the Williston exit.)  The lights appeared to be a almost an orange color, but a very yellow-white orange.  Size-wise, the lights appeared bigger than any star or planet I've ever seen in the sky.  I can't say that I saw the lights moving at all, except for seeing 3 lights after earlier having seen 2.  I am reminded of looking a! t Jupite r with the naked eye...but about 4 times larger in apparent size and a corresponding increase in brightness.  The more I replay it in my mind the more I am reminded of how the planes looked at O'Hare airport at night while they are in line waiting to land.  (They also don't appear to move when still far away in the sky because they are, in essence, heading directly at you.)

I was outside smoking a cigarette and as usual I was looking at the stars between cloud banks.  I was looking due east and about a half a degree south there was a string of bright lights that seemed to blink.  I at first just passed it off as an airliner coming in for landing approach as we are in the direct path of the mpls airport, (about 7 miles to the east southeast). so we see many aircraft on a daily basis.  When I was done with my cigarette I noticed that the lights did not seem to move.  At that point I looked for a point of reference to see if indeed the object was stationary.  I stood against the house and put my arm up at a 45 degree angle and held out my thumb horizontally so the tops of my neighbors oak trees were in sight just below my thumb, the object was an eighth of an inch above my thumb.  I watched it for 40 minutes and it did not move.  It looked like a string of five! stars that were very close together with the second from the left star blacked out.  The lights were so bright that they left a residual light shadow in my sight when i closed my eyes like when you look at a flash and it stays with you for a while after.  I would have watched it all night long if the cloud deck did not block the view.  They were white with a tinge of blue and the left most light seemed brighter than the rest.  The light clouds that would obscure the lights from time to time helped me to see that this was a string of lights as opposed to one bright one.  The clouds are not uniform in their thickness and it would show as they passed how one end would be brighter and the other would be dim and successively the other would get dim and then bright depending on the shape of the cloud. Imagine a 747 about six miles out at 5000 feet coming right at you with landing lights on.  We see this quite often from our front yard.  As It did not move and as the clouds were in front! of it I would have to guestimate that the thing was quite lar! ge and somewhat cigar shaped. side note....not the first ufo I have seen.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,44.83192661870504,-93.04600071942446

I kept looking over to glimpse it...I thought I lost it but I kept looking anyway because I kept seeing bits of it through some bushes. About 10 sec pass until I see it again, and it's fairly low to the ground; it looks like it's moving quickly so it must be have been somewhat close.  Maybe 50-70 yards away.   So I see it again and it pops up and this time, I saw more lights on it.  Each corner of the triangle had white lights and there are more along the edge that were turning on and off in a random pattern...some would flicker, blue ones flickered, but could have been other colors too.  It was black as the night sky except for the pattern of lights on each edge of the triangle.  And I could see this by the time it swooped up from a lower position.  So it would swoop up and then it would flip or tumble and then swoop very low to the ground.  It would swoop and tumble and traverse through the air while tumbling.  Like it was a black triangle flipping end on end. 3 big bright white lights would light up on the edge of it.  And they would get really bright every time it would swoop down.  It would probably be down for 3 sec at a time, then it would go up again and tumble again.  And when it would tumble, it would stay up for about 10 sec at a time just doing random things in the air, flip up over end, go through the air at the same time, looked very random. Dip back down, flatten out...looked triangle the whole time, then it would go down and the 3 white lights would swell and look like head lights.  Then would go back up and other lights would come back on.  It did this about 4 to 5 times that I saw and then I got to the overpass and called my girlfriend to tell her about it...looked behind me on the phone and saw it again.  From that point onward I didn't see it dip down again.  I took the next off ramp (W Kamm Ave), took the overpass and parked. I could still see it but by that time it looked like a normal plane in the air because of it's lights.  It traveled away, north, for about 2 minutes until it was out of sight. The most incredible thing about the sight was how close to the ground it would get.  I thought it was landing at times and then it would go up again.

I went outside to see a low flying jet of either the F-14 or F-16 shape.  Oddly, however, as it banked by raising one wing I saw absolutely no markings of any kind on the totally gun-metal grey plane.  Oddly, too, there was a smaller Cessna-like one engine plane flying very close to the 'jet.'    At this time another witness, an TV/internet installer at my house came outside and I pointed up at the craft.  He looked at it and thought it was a F-14 as he was familiar with some jet craft.  He, too, thought it odd that the 'jet' had no markings on it and that he thought the smaller plane was flying with the jet somehow.  The 'jet' flew in the exact same pattern as the night observations I made, coming from the east, flying around my house in a low flight pattern, then heading back east again over the  town of Narragansett and out to sea.   I called the South Kingstown police again.  I reported what I had seen and the dispatcher said, 'one minute please' as he went away for 3 or 4 minuted before coming back to talk to me to report that all he knew was that he was told by someone that the 'jets' came from an air base on Cape Cod somewhere and he said that was the official explanation.  I thanked him for taking my call.  I then called the Air National Guard at Quonset Pt. in North Kingstown to see what they knew.  I could not  get to talk to anyone as I had on the morning of the 22nd, Friday, where a Sergeant with the Air National Guard told me there were no jets reported to him and none were at the Quonset location (only C-130s and helicopters).  He said that Air Defense in Providence would have picked them up on radar anyway.  He also said that he was at home in Narragansett the night before and had in fact heard but not seen the 'jets.'   I also this morning called Senator Reed of Rhode Island's office to see if they knew anything about these flights.

"Very Bright in due West, Hovered about 2 min's, then accelerated very fast stright up.",Fort Collins,CO,2010-01-27T06:00:00,light,8 min,"Occurred : 1/27/2010 06:00  (Entered as : 1-27-2010 6:00) Reported: 1/27/2010 11:11:09 AM 11:11 Posted: 2/14/2010 Location: Fort Collins, CO Shape: Light Duration:8 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74206.html,"Very Bright in due West, Hovered about 2 min's, then accelerated very fast stright up. Driving due west toward the mountains, approaching north HWY 287 in Fort Collins, I saw a very bright light between 18 to 20 degrees west above the mountains.  At first I dismissed this as a planet, as it looked as if it was stationary.  The time was about 6:48am and in Fort Collins, this is during Civil Twilight where the sun is 6 degrees or less below the horizon. (Sun rise is at 7:08am).  I was about to dismiss this object and turn north to go home, when I had to stop at a red light.  I lined up three points using my Bronco, a tree for line of sight, just to make sure that the object was not moving.  I watched it hover for about 10 or 15 seconds, when I noticed that it was indeed moving very slowly.  At first, I thought that this was my imagination, but the object started to accelerate, and I knew it was not a planet.  When the light turned green, I did not turn north, but went through the intersection and pulled over as fast as I could.  I got out of my Bronco, and watched for about 30 seconds.  The object moved about 1/3 the distance it was from the ground in about 4 seconds.  It accelerated very quickly, and then disappeared.  Still assuming that this might be a Jet that was reflecting the sun light, and possibly approaching my line of sight until it turned, which would look as if it were hovering, and then accelerating, I went home and crunched the numbers.  This is what I got:  The altitudes of most commercial jets are about 30,000 feet.  If the object was 18 to 20 degrees from my line of sight, that would make it 16.61 to 18.32 miles away from me.  I went to Fort Collins airport, and found the visibility for 7:00am, and it was 10 miles.  This indicated that the object was close to double the distance for visibility.  With the sun hitting an object, one might still be able to see it, so I calculated the speed. It the object moved 1/3 its altitude in 4 seconds, then it would be traveling close to 2400 feet per second, (rounding off).  This equates to 1630 mph, which commercial jet cannot do.  My conclusions suggest that unless this was a military craft that was reflecting the sun and traveling directly into my line of sight, (which made it look like it was hovering for over two minutes), and then shot straight up at a climbing rate of 1630 mph, then it is something unique.  Lastly, if the object was indeed moving at a velocity of 1630 mph, and was coming directly at me for over two minutes, then it would have covered a distance of 54 miles, which would have brought the craft over my head in less than 60 seconds, which it did not do.  I would be interested if anyone else saw this object from another direction so I can get better numbers. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Tuesday sighting 6/15/10 total of 7 objects from 9:45 p.m. until we stopped watching at 11:00 p.m. (I verified my times with my cell phone call log); two large objects, one in the NE (a large round ball of light same as Sunday) and one to the West (a cigar shaped object with 3 lights that changed into on solid ball of light), 2 smaller flying objects were emitted from large object in the West, and 3 smaller flying objects were shooting around the large object in the NE. Object in the West changed shape and color from a cigar to a large round light and the colors changed from bright yellow to an amber orange.  Object in the NE (was the same both nights) appeared to be too far away so we could not make out a shape, it just looked like a round flashing object.  We could see lights changing colors from white, red, light blue-ish, and a slight orange color. I could physically see the NE object change direction in an almost erratic manner.  We got very excited about the sighting and were making a lot of noise and the object almost instantly stopped moving around.  At approximately 9:50 pm a smaller object shot across the sky just under the NE object.  The smaller light came from the bottom right side of the large NE object and zipped across at an upward (45 degree) angle.   At approximately 10:10 pm another smaller object shot across the sky just under the NE object.  This time the object came from the left side and shot across to the right at a very sli! ght (20 degree) angle.  One more object shot around the sky shortly after that (approx. 10:40 pm) this time just a horizontal path just under the large NE object.  All three of the shooting lights were short bursts and in different directions that the others.  They did not follow the same path or direction.  The large NE object pulsated and slightly wobbled in the sky, as the time went by it appeared to go farther up into the sky, like it was going higher up so the light appeared to be smaller and farther away, but we could still see that it was pulsated very brightly (about 3x brighter than any star in the sky, and brighter than any airplane that flew by).  Both of the large objects pulsated. The other object in the West was cigar shaped when we initially spotted it.  It was hovering (directly to the right of the moon) in place and appeared to be suspended vertically with 3 very bright lights (changing from orange to yellow).  This object was much closer and lower than the other NE object. We have a video of this (W) object.  It was recorded from the back porch through the screen, and there was some debate about if it was an optical illusion.  However, we could see the cigar shape and 3 lights in plain sight, and I am absolutely sure that it was not an illusion.  We watched this object change shape (or appear to be different in shape) because the lights appeared to become one large light instead of the 3 single lights.  When this happened we ran out to the front of the house to watch it.  From the front of the house we saw this object change color and size (or brightness).  It moved across the sky in short, slow, erratic movements (up, down, side to side, and at angled, wobbling or dancing), and eventually found its place very low in the sky and drastically below and to the right of the moon.  It pulsated the entire time with very bright, large flashes to small flickering.  At one point the object became at least 3x brighter and appeared to be coming toward us.   Shortly after that the object dimmed down and appeared to be moving (slowly) downward again.   We finally went in the house at about 11 pm and we stopped watching.",2010-06-23T00:00:00,28.4692090625,-82.5392425

Last year I reported a sighting that three of my friends and I saw to Mufon.   However we were not taken seriously. I am aware that the Morristown Hoax has done a great deal to diminish credibility for all future UFO sightings in NJ, but I am not talking about seeing flares here.  I am a writer/researcher and one thing I discovered is that when our government wants to discredit a ufologist, they often create a hoax designed to lure UFO investigators into proclaiming the event is a genuinely unexplainable occurrence; only to have the rug pulled out from under them when the sighting is revealed as fake.  Morristown ruined the UFO hunters (on the History Channel) because the UFO hunter team went on national TV claiming that the sighting is undoubtedly real.  As soon as they did this, the sighting was proved to be hoaxed and the UFO hunters got canceled.  I feel I have to include this in my report because I think it is a big part of why no one seems to take me seriously.  Ok, on to what I saw last night. I am constantly sky-watching because I see so many unusual things up there.  I walked out my front door and looked up in the sky-facing east.  The first thing that caught my attention was a very quiet object with red strobe-lights.  I followed that for a second or two until a very dimly lit object flying west to east appeared in my line of sight.  This objec was shaped like a disc with two small wing-like appendages similar to the alien craft in the movie Independence Day.  The object was moving at an astronomical speed; faster than anything I’ve ever seen.  It flew straight over my head, kept on its course for about 2 or 3 seconds and then pulled a hard 70 degree left turn, and began heading North at that point. There is a house to the east of my house only 20 feet away, so t! o follow the object I had to rush toward the end of the drivew! ay to tr y and get a better look.  Unfortunately by then the object was gone. The night before last, I saw a very similar craft, also dimly lit and flying at break-neck speed in the same general direction.  I have witnessed tons of other amazing airborne activity, which if you are interested and willing to take me seriously, I will describe in detail.  Some of the most outrageous sightings happened when I was with friends or my co-worker in one case.  So I know that I am not crazy, even though I have been forced to question my sanity based on some of the things I’ve witnessed.  Also, I woke up a few weeks ago with a circular crater-like scar on my upper left thigh.  I don’t know how it got there, but I can see that there is something hard under the skin, and extending from the center I can see what looks like spokes on a bicycle wheel. I did some research to see if others have reported the same thing, and I must say I am a little bit frightened by what I found.  I have no memory of how I go! t this scar, but I do know that one night it wasn’t there and the next morning it was.  I really hope I’m not wasting my time filing this report.  I just want some answers.  I am aware that most people go their entire lives and never see a single thing that could be classified as a UFO, and yet in the last year alone, I’ve witnessed dozens.   Thank you for your time.",2010-06-23T00:00:00,,

On 03/26/09 at 21:00 hours I witnessed an oval to circular shaped object moving from the Northeast sky to directly East of my position, it’s altitude was approximately 22° to 27° altitude from O° Horizon (level). I was not able to judge distance except to say that it was far past my digital camera and video camera range. There was no way to focus on this object with consumer level equipment and may have even been difficult for professional equipment to focus on. I tried to photograph it in every way I could think of but could not. When I first noticed the object it was in the area of being North / North-East moving southerly toward a position east of my view.  The only reason I noticed it was due to it’s movement, it was clearly slower then an airplane and going approximately at satellite speed but it’s position in the sky and luminescence was all wrong for any satellite and there are no stars of that magnitude in this area of the sky and no objects that move horizontally without gaining altitude. It also changed appearance with a range of colors from white to bright yellow into deep red and back again. The color shift happened only during the time it traveled but stopped shifting once it stopped traveling. It began, or I first noticed it, at 42.5° N moving to and ending at a point just over 41.5° N or in other words a horizontal southerly distance totaling about 40° along the horizon. It ended up being exactly east of my viewing position. I suspect it also came toward me but had no way to judge its depth other then an increase of magnitude, its size appeared to stay somewhat constant. (Please note the longitude, latitude and angular measures are only approximations; I have not gone back and measured those.)  While it traveled and changed color the red shifting was most notable because it appeared to have a deep red sphere inside of its shape that swirled counterclockwise. The red color was contained within the sphere and was about 30% of the total size, the motion of the red shape was erratic and wild but the main motion was counterclockwise the motion was almost like a pinball machine gone berserk..  Within the first few minutes of spotting this I called my wife to verify what I was seeing, she then said “I see those things all the time, around 3:00am and they are closer to the house”. She takes these things with a very cavalier attitude and doesn’t share an interest in any extra-terrestrial activities and treats these occurrences as everyday events for some reason. If she were to see an E.T in person she would say “oh that’s nice…” and then walk away. After questioning her it appears this has happened before in much the same way only closer to the house and moving faster. She does not understand why I have any level of excitement over this.  The event lasted until the object stopped and remained stationary, it moved for a period of about 15 minutes yet was stationary for at least two hours, anyone seeing it after it now stopped would believe it to be a star, it had no outstanding lighting or motion and stayed in a fixed position, eventually after unsuccessfully trying to photograph it I gave up on viewing it, my wife’s comments took a lot of wind out of my sails, my total viewing time was about 1 hour. Her total viewing time was around 10 minutes and she verified the size, shape, motion and color of this with no emotion. Now that I know this is / was not a one time event I have my eye to the sky more often.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,42.1237,-72.4315

It was stationery and looked to be about the size and brightness of Venus  as seen in the night sky. It’s difficult to say exactly what to place next but the light which did not have a beam pointing to the ground that I could see began to diminish in brightness or rotate forward into the direction that it was about to travel. Once the light was gone what I could now see was what appeared to be a light that you would see on the underside of an aircraft. The craft (in was an airplane) was about 30 to 40 thousand feet in elevation and began moving south and roughly in the direction of the Philadelphia International Airport. I was not able to visually track the craft across the sky as one could normally do because the object was ascending rapidly as it moved forward. Within one minute the light diminished in size so much that I could no longer see it. Very strange behavior for a conventional aircraft. ((NUFORC Note;  ISS??  PD)),2009-04-14T00:00:00,,

Group of objects seen in pursuit of object. Three unexplained events experienced March 28th 2009   The First Event  It was a very late Saturday night, Sunday early morning at 2:00am. After staying up late to watch a few movies we decided to step out on our apt patio to get some fresh air to be alone and look up at the stars. Our 3 yr old son lay tucked away in bed sleeping. It was unusually very windy earlier that day but although an amazingly clear and calm night. We sat there on the patio for a bit, maybe 15 min. I noticed a shooting star off to my left that shot from right to left downward diagonally. As I tugged at my husband I was able to catch the tail end of it as it fizzled out across the sky.  We both in fun, made a wish and then looked back up. I said to my husband looking up, “ It just doesn’t make sense, that there wouldn’t be more out there, it’s just so beautiful.”  As I looked at him I watched as he pointed up to the sky but totally away from where we were looking before. He said, “ Oh my God”. I looked up and was completely frozen solid. I could not believe my own eyes. We both were stunned. We saw a silvery pearl colored spherical shape in the sky that glistened. If you’ve ever looked at the North Star it looked just like that, but a bit larger, maybe the size or thickness around as the pencil lead inside a pencil. We definitely did not notice this being there before on account of how bright it was and my husband and I noticing it so immediately. It seemed to reflect the moonlight, which was to our left in the sky. The object just sat there. It then quickly shot off in a diagonal direction to our left over our building out of view, but something weird happened. It had made no sound, left no trail, and sped up at first, then almost slowed down to a stop and then shot off very quickly again, shooting out a bit slowing down and then shooting out a bit again like it may have been in trouble or something. This could definitely not been a shooting star or a piece of debris coming in from space. It quickly traveled until it was blocked from view because of our patio roof, as we are located on the second floor.  We felt a rush of adrenalin come over us as we both practically jumped in each other’s arms in amazement to what we had just seen. We were so excited we actually yelled out in excitement. This 1st experience lasted maybe about 10-12 seconds from the time we spotted it until it was gone from view. The Second Event  We both immediately redirected our view back to the sky and saw 5 more of these same objects out in the distance. At first they seemed to just be bright stars but as we kept looking we could see them moving strangely. Each flashed very brightly for just a second as they approached after seeming to drop noticeably in the sky. At first these objects were very far away in the distance and in seconds were flying right over top of us in the same direction as the other one had gone. We noticed they were moving much faster and even more rapidly than the first. These as well made no sound. Their movement was much more fluid as they flew in and out of one another, one coming close to even hitting another but then formed up in a random group, in a formation but not. As they passed overhead most noticeably we pointed out one in particular moving just like the first one we had seen earlier. One would shoot out faster like the movements of the first one out in front and then reform back into their clustered formation. It was apparent their clustered formation and randomness were obviously patterned as if to match the randomness of the sky and its stars. At a glance you would not notice them for it not for the moonlight reflecting off of them. It seemed as though one wanted to move out faster ahead but then would have to adjust its speed back to the groups, as the main group stayed one constant speed. This 2nd experience lasted maybe about 12-15 seconds until they were out of view. Again, we yelled out and even jumped up and down a bit as our excitement for a second had got the better of us. This had been the most amazing thing we had ever seen together aside from our son being born it was that exciting. What we saw was unlike anything we had ever seen before in the skies and did not resemble anything natural or man made. The speeds most notably were to sporadic and fast to be changing speed and direction like they did. We sat there for a bit more, like 10-15 minutes, rambling back and forth to each other like excited little kids. Our neighbor in the building to our right and across from us came out to see what was going on, after hearing us and we stated that we had just seen the most amazing thing. That’s when we experienced something so amazing; it would forever change all of our lives. The Third Event  We apologized to our neighbor for being loud and disturbing him. He said it was no problem. As we turned to walk back in the house we noticed he had said something pretty loud, maybe to us. We stepped back out to see he was as well looking up and was pointing at something. I yanked my husband by the shirt and practically tripped as she fell trying to get to the railing of the patio. Expecting to see the same thing we were quickly frozen by what was there. My husband noticed the neighbor ran inside quickly and came back out. I was so excited and scared, all at the same time but didn’t take my eyes off this thing. It’s hard to explain how I felt. Looking at it did not scare me at all. My husband said later he couldn’t even move or talk at first. He also said that he didn’t know what to think of what he saw and that he didn’t really want to talk about what it meant. What he saw actually scared him a bit. Just in the last week he has been acting a bit different because of what he saw. Traveling in the same direction again, but much slower and closer was an object that was approximately the size of dime in the sky. It was the shape of a jellyfish or mushroom and had brighter light emitting from the center and bottom that was reddish orange. Its sides were almost translucent like a jellyfish and more solid reddish orange in the center. It looked like its sides were moving in on themselves like a mushroom cloud does from an atomic blast with its billowing reddish smoke. It made no noise and traveled at a very slow speed, like about 4 inches in the sky, for like every 5 seconds and then just stopped. This thing just didn’t make sense. It was amazing. My husband pulled me down just below the railing and out of the moonlight where we both now crouched and watched it. For some reason during the event I put out my arm to grab the railing.  My husband quickly grabbed my arm down in fear. We both sat there in the dark motionless looking up at this thing for about 3-4 minutes. We were very afraid there for a second there almost hardly breathing. Then suddenly calmness came over both of us when it started to move again. The large object slowly again started to move from its fixed position and slowly in the same direction prior, headed over our building like the others. We have a huge central train yard just about a ½ mile away, in Roseville. You can always hear the cars booming together and crashing in the distance, sometimes very loudly. Sometimes it’s very quiet. This night we would hear them about every 5-10 minutes. You get pretty used to them after a while and block them out. We could hear off in the distance a few pretty loud bangs and then suddenly this object sort of flashed and made a few crackling noises. Like wood burning in a fire. The sounds actually did echo pretty loudly. As the train cars thudded it looked effected by the sounds of them crashing together. It suddenly became very translucent not emitting any form of light. Almost like it shut down, for a second. It appeared to look kind of like a jellyfish head in the sky. You could sort of see through it. You could only see a kind of shimmer glare around its edges from the moonlight and a kind of blurriness in the middle. It sat there for about probably 2–3 seconds doing this crackling noise. Then with the next crash of train cars it moved so fast over top of us, we lost it in our vision as it passed over our building. The object disappeared before my eyes could even adjust to see where it had gone. This is the only way I can describe what we saw on March 28th 2009. The whole series of events occurred between 2 and 2:45 in the morning. They occurred back to back in series. These events were witnessed by, me, my husband, and the two neighbors, a husband and wife who live across from us that witnessed the third portion of the event.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,38.76717395833333,-121.3107662202381

I had just spent an hour at a roadside rest area and slept for an hour before continuing on my trip.  Not long after continuing my drive, suddenly I saw what looked like a circular shaped glowing ball of fire. About the size of a Frisbee it flew in toward me out of the western sky. In the total darkness, I could not judge how high up it was. I marveled at it as it flew directly overhead and followed it threw my sun roof.  I did not think of it as a UFO because I kept thinking about how this thing resembled a bright red and orange amber in a fire.  The inside of the circle sparkled with white flashes as the orange color graduated to a cooler red at the perimeter.  The outside of the circle was not well defined and wavered slightly. I did not think of it as a UFO because I had a preconception, from what I so often have heard, that UFOs are glowing white lights in the sky at night.  I also never really believed that there were such things as UFOs. As fast as I could, I crossed over two lanes on the interstate, stopped on the side, opened the sun roof, and stuck my head out to continue looking at this fireball.  To my surprise I saw yet another similar object approaching from the east on a collision course with the first. When they were relatively close to each other, they both made sharp turns to the north.  They continued flying in formation until they disappeared in the horizon.  I was driving a hybrid car so the car engine was completely silent and no traffic was on the highway at this moment. Yet I could not detect any noise from these objects in the sky.  I have seen thousands of aircraft in the sky and live near an airport, so there is no mistaking these items for airplanes. Shortly after these items had disappeared into the horizon, I witnessed what I thought at first was a shooting star. However, as I thought about it, it dawned on me that this could not have been a coincident. This beam of light, coming from space, intersected the pathway of the two flying objects. It appeared to me that if this beam of light had appeared ten, fifteens seconds earlier, it would have been right on top of these objects or even possibly hit one of them. It is also worth noting that these UFOs were in this geographic location on the same day that the shuttle landed at Cape Kennedy.  The shuttle landed at 3:14 pm and this sighting occurred at 11:45 pm. I realize that these occurrences are many hours apart, but never the less it is on the same day and only a few hundred miles apart.

After eating, we laid down on the blanket and found ourselves looking up at the sky discussing the airplane contrails we were seeing all over the sky. From our left (which was north) there appeared to be a ball shaped object (not a disk, but spherical shaped) travelling at great speed and directly overhead. It crossed our field of vision in about 10 seconds and then stopped suddenly at which time it appeared to simply hover and then disappeared to our right which would have been to the south. The shape was a two tone color, being a copper color on the bottom and silver metallic color on the top. There were no protruding features such as wings or a tail – simply round and featureless apart from the color. We both stood up and watched it saying ‘what the heck is that?’ I am a private pilot and this was certainly not a plane or a bird. It was difficult to estimate its altitude but there was no contrail and it appeared to be perhaps 1000 to 5000 feet above the ocean.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

After a few minutes, my mom's boyfriend  looked North East and pointed at a bright object in the sky.  At first he thought it was a star of some kind, but it became apparent after a few minutes that it was too large and bright to be a star.  The object appeared to be a ways in the distance, though I couldn't say the exact miles.  At first it looked rounded in shape and a bright white, though after time it would change in shape and also brightness.  The shape would change from round to almost triangular, would dim and brighten, and would also at time get smaller and the stretch out again. After the three of us arguing about what it could be (approx. 15 minutes later), I noticed more and more that it seemed to be hovering rather than still standing.  From the time we first spotted it, to around 10:20pm it had moved (in comparison) from one end of our house to the other.  After more speculating, I went inside to grab my moms' phone camera and also a small pair of binoculars.  Finally, now having a better view of the hovering object, I honestly cannot tell you what it was.  I've never seen any star, aircraft or anything of that sort like that before in my life; both my mom and her boyfriend said the same.  Using the binoculars the object appeared triangular but seemed to have a faint rounded halo around it.  It was bright with in the center but also had small blue/green ""lights"" (quotation because I don't know how else to describe them).  Every so often it looked as though there were bright red streaks that would flare out from the object almost like what you wou! ld see on a jet of some sort.  After watching it more closely we started seeing it move sporadically up and down, and to the left.  The movement wasn't big, but enough so that it was clearly noticeable. The time now was around 10:30pm, and while myself and my mom were still watching it, my mother's boyfriend got bored and went back into the house.  I really wanted to see if we could get a better view of the object, so I talked my mom into driving closer toward it.  We went down streets and back roads and were able to follow it for quite a ways.  We got a little closer to it, but in the end it was late, and we were too tired to keep driving.  I last saw the strange object at around 10:45-10:50pm when we turned around back toward home.  Once we arrived, now around 11pm, we searched the entire sky around us, (of course including where we first spotted it)  but saw no trace of the strange bright object any longer. It's as if it just disappeared. Even thinking back on it now, It was like nothing I've ever seen before... it was so brilliant and brightly colored, even more than the tiny specks of stars around it. But the shape of it is unlike any air craft I know of. It was and still is incredibly fascinating. Though unfortunately, my moms' phone camera was all we had at the time... So the few pictures we took came out unclear and did not do justice to how amazing it looked with the binoculars aid.  A few photos we did take however, show the relative size as well as it moving (you can clearly see a ""tail"" or steak behind the object.) If you want the photos I will gladly send them to you. And also, any information you may have as to what this object could've been or even if someone around our location reported something similar, we would be most grateful. Thank you for your time.

Location:  North Bend, Nebraska, USA   Direction:  East  Angle of view:  Approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. My family and I spotted a flying object flying almost exactly north, in the sky east of North Bend, Nebraska. The sighting took place on July 4th, 2010.  My wife and I were lighting fireworks in the back yard of her parents' house when suddenly the people at the house started talking and pointing to the east.  They called out to me, ""What is that?"" I saw a light moving far in the distance. Initially I thought it was a helicopter because the light seemed to flicker, like the flame of a candle.  However it was high and very fast and the light seemed to be one of burning, and not an electric halogen bulb like you see on modern aircraft.  Additionally, there were no red and white strobe lights that are standard on regulation aircraft (we could clearly see these on commercial aircraft passing at cruising altitude high overhead).  It continued north (it had first been spotted to the southeast of us), and the light didn't really change as our perspective of it did as it passed (i.e., there was no dimming effect like you might get from headlights passing you as the craft eclipses its lights, etc.). It was flying quickly, at least the speed of a large helicopter or a plane. After a minute or so it was across the sky, and northeast of us, when it rather quickly faded out of sight entirely. This was surprising to us because we were seeing commercial jets far over head and could clearly make out their blinking red and white lights over an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. The object (or a second one, identical to the first) appeared again about 15 to 20 minutes later, again in the southeast.  It followed the exact same flight pattern as the previous, vanishing again in what we can say at best was the same spot as before. A third and identical sighting took place roughly an hour after the first one.  By the third time it came around, we had gone inside to get some binoculars. The object was difficult to focus on, but the characteristics of the light coming from the object was more akin to the flame of a candle than the steady shine of an electric source.  I'd say it was about 10 times brighter at least than the brightest star in the sky at that point, and perhaps three times the diameter of any of the stars.  My father in law was able to track it in his binoculars, and describes that it seemed like a round object, like looking at a disc on its side or perhaps a sphere, with the burning light coming from around the perimeter of the circumference. All in all, the sightings took place between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm, US Central time. There were 6 adults and 2 young children at that house, and we all saw it each time.  After the third one, my father-in-law and I went next door to see if the neighbor had seen the same thing.  She and her two grandsons had seen it during one of the fly-overs.  She thought at first that it was a basket from a hot air balloon, saying that the light's quality made her think of the hot air generator present in such balloons. But she quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be a balloon. The object's trajectory was more or less level across the sky, parallel to the ground for an apparent distance of several miles, except at the end it could possibly have been increasing altitude, but hard to say without any precise measurements. The following day (July 5th), we communicated with some family who live in Wichita, Kansas, and they saw the same object flying in the same direction. Though the light was the brightest thing in the sky (the moon was not visible at this time), we heard no sound from the object on any of the three passes, only the sound of fireworks across town.  Also there was not much wind that day, so the object(s) appeared to have had to be flying under their own power.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,41.5144,-96.7892

I was traveling south on Route 28 at approx. 10 minutes to 8PM.  I exited at the Tarentum exit.  At the stop sign at the bottom of the ramp I looked to the right about 45 degrees.  Out of the front windshield just above the tree line I saw some whispy clouds.  They were orangish colored from the setting sun.  In front of the clouds coming over the trees heading due north was a very distinct chemtrail that was also orangish. (Sun reflection)  I have always been a sky watcher.  Especially since becoming aware of the chemtrails.  I'm the type of person that notices things others wouldn't.  I don't drink or use drugs.  I consider myself a credible witness. I had to make sure I stopped because there was a cop car to my right watching the stop sign.  I noticed I was having trouble focusing on the chemtrail.  Normally they start as two trails coming from the wings and they quickly blend into one wide trail.  This one appeared to blink from one to two tightly side by side.  Everytime I blinked it was one then two tightly together.  At that time I could not see the plane making the trail which seemed odd.  I made a mental note about where is the plane.  It was time to move so I drove on making a left turn towards New Kensington.  This placed my back to the trail. Having to wait for the lights to change it took a few minutes to cross the bridge. My destination was at the end of the bridge.  I pulled in to the parking lot and headed to the back lot.  This again placed me facing the direction of the chemtrail.  I was looking to my left at a 45 degree angle.  It was still orange, thick and very defined.  Now I could see the plane.  It was sorta shaped like the U2 spy plane.  Very odd looking and black.  Normally the planes are white. Thinking back now about where I first saw the trails and their angle in the sky and now looking at them again something seems not right.  It's like they jumped over toward the east closer to my location but were still heading north.  I parked and got out.  I was watching the plane and couldn't wait for it to come toward my location.  It's present heading would have put it directly in front of me moving from left to right.  I really wanted a better look at the plane.  The trail it left was very thick and was not evaporating like a (vapor) contrail.  I knew this trail would last and I wanted to see how it spread out.  I went inside so I could unlock the door from the inside.  This took 1-2 minutes.  I came back out with great anticipation figuring the plane would be just about directly in front of my line of sight. I opened the door and stepped outside and the plane had  vanished.  The chemtrail was completely gone as was the plane.  I looked in front of the path the plane was on...nothing.  No evidence of the thick chemtrail it left behind. Everything was completely gone.  No cloudlike formations and no plane.  The plane with the speed it was traveling would have easily been somewhere in my field of vision without turning my head.  The thick chemtrail from my many previous observations would have lasted hours and spread across a wide area of sky. When I saw the trail after entering the parking lot it looked like the chemtrail started a few inches behind the plane like it may have just been switched on, again a little odd considering the time it took to cross the bridge.  I should have been able to see it stretch way out behind the plane. Remember the trail blinking and changing from one to two?  And the trail seemingly shifting positions to the east?  No plane visible in front of the trail and then it was.  The plane was not as high as they usually fly.  At first I thought it was very high and that's why I didn't see it.  When it did appear it was big and much lower than they normally fly.  And looked black. There is no way the plane changed direction.  I would have been able to see it make any turn.  From that vantage point you can basically see horizon to horizon.  It literally vanished into thin air without a trace like someone flicked a switch.  I think it may have been jumping locations in the sky. Reporting a UFO is one thing.  The government can dish out a swamp gas cover story.  Reporting disappearing planes puts it in a different ballgame.  I'm afraid I'll get a visit from someone. How did they make the chemtrail instantly invisible too?  Stealth on steroids?  Cloaking?  Keep looking up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2010-04-13T00:00:00,40.57260132450331,-79.72744900662252

I was in my hot tub in my backyard watching the dark sky. It was right about 8:10 or 8:15 pm on Wednesday March 31, 2010. I noticed what looked like a dim star or something moving too fast to be an aircraft. I thought maybe I can follow it with my eyes so I looked and sure enough I could see a craft moving at incredible speed. By the size of the airplanes that fly over, I estimate it to be bigger than a house and smaller than a school auditorium. The best way I can describe its flight pattern was a lot like A stunt kite. It moved in from high up almost straight above me from NE to SE but it got bigger doing so. The object then began to move evasively like a stunt kite from East to West looking much bigger as it passed. It was the color of a faint star but as big as a silver dollar at arms length. Which is huge looking in the sky The light eminating from it was lightly visible but visible none the less. (I am stone cold sober always.) As I watched it, I became terrified. I felt something was different about this one. This blurry glowing blob moved at incredible speed. It made no sound. I live a few miles away from the airport but that is some 4 miles to the South from me and all planes land behind me and are much much closer to the ground. This object was straight up 12:00. Flying obviously by something guiding it. Every thing that flies over is a small dot. An airplane. But this was huge. I am a Quality Control Manager Trained by Boeing.

I sat there blinking in disbelief at first but after going over all know Planes and copters as well as military craft, I knew that this was extremely odd or off the charts for other worldly craft in comparison. the way it zig zagged,at a high mach speed. (This was not a flying triangle.) It was a much larger indistinct shape. I have seen strange things in the sky before but this time I am going to do something about it by reporting it. Thank you for help. Sincerely, anonymous.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,34.17664012738854,-118.38102866242039

I watched it for about 30 seconds and at that point told myself that this did not appear to be an airplane due to how the lights looked now. So I decided to get my jacket on and just step outside for a momement. Now looking at this object I knew by seeing the lights moving across it and what appeared to be some kind of red laser type of light on the bottom, that looked like it was hanging quite someway away from the lights on top, that this was something that I have never seen before. I observed this for approx. 45 min. At times the lights appeared to be in a cross shape but most of the time it was just straight across with the red light on the bottom. This red light appeared to be going in a circular motion and just not oneway, in some kind of scanning mot! ion back and forth. The light that appeared from this object was white and sometimes blue lights running through the white. There were times that both ends of the light were lit up in blue also. I know this seems crazy but I truly know what I saw and maybe there is an answer.

It was moving very fast through the sky and blinked out over the Army Training Ground. The color was the same as the full moon.

He reported to me that he saw a very large, round, bright light in the early morning sky fly over his car. Seconds later, his car stalled out.

So i step outside and look up to the west and see the jet and the jet trail, but i'm still hearing the nose and notice almost parrell is a second jet. some distance away i would have to say but seeing to jets matching speed and general direction strikes me as odd, and as they fade away under the tree line the noise i can still hear, and i look to the east, to 2 more jets. They're not to low, normal distance from ground for normal everday jets. Exceptthey're cruising quit fast, with both direction and speed i know they're niether circling to land at bradely nor west over.  I notice with the one now diretly over head from the wing span, general shape, and th! e spilt in each jet trail after the exuast that these birds have 2 engines per wing, and the cool flat grey of the air force, maybe a c-5 or a c-17 again not out of the ordinary, except they're going fast from an odd to vector to an unknown destination and even wehn we first entered the war in iraq i've never seen more then 2 of these in the air like this at the same time.  Thats when i noticed a 5th? aircraft for the last set as they head west in between the 2, this one was either smaller or higher up, no sign of the ussal jet trail and was matching speed. However as they're heading towards the sun i figure it could just of been a glare as it soon disapeared.  In the Last year when comes to air traffic, i've seen a few things out of place in terms of military aircraft.  most things are ussal, A-10's flying either from bradley air national gaurd or from West Over (both currently deployed in the middle east)C-5,s C-17, C-130/ac=130s, black hawks (CT home of skikorsky afterall) and chinooks.  but then theres times were things are odd, i remember seeing here abotu a report in neiboring enfield about 4 f-15s flying overhead, and i remember that night with my brother seeing and hearing them but with being night i could not identify them as f-15's but just airfighters in formation minimal lights on them going rather fast and low in both a residential area and a general area for comercial airfact to circle.  Back here in somers myself and a friend witnessed in daylight back in janruary a fligth of 3 f-15's crusing low enough to read USAF on each wing headed towards west over, and last summer my self and my neighbors got to see a little ar! iel show by a lone f-22 doing barel rolls and the short at high speeds and low altitude.  I know of not, in terms of air bases, anywhere out here that support f-22's.

I saw flashing red orb like lights that seemed to almost come together and then moved quickly away from eachother, meanwhile, in between there appeared to be a falling star!

It flew overhead as I watched from my balcony, and was then out of view. I kept on trying to tell myself that it must have been an airplane, but I didn't know what the other orb lights were all about in the distance. And if that were not enough!!I then heard what sounded like another approaching plane or craft overhead, flying in the opposite direction heading towards the west valley, which was a huge, triangular shaped craft ( as I saw that it was indeed a solidly shaped triangular craft ) with maybe three lights. But as it was gliding over the valley away from me, it appeared to have onlt two white flashing lights, that then dimmed one the lights as the other light kept flashing on and off.

I am 37 yrs old and the mother of two teenage boys. I have been married for a little over 10 years to my second husband and a little over 8 years to my first husband. I graduated high school in the top 10% of my class. Over my lifetime I have spent a lot, or more than average amount, of time looking at the stars at night because they have always fascinated me. What I have observed I started noticing about two weeks ago but I cannot tell you when the events actually started. While going outside at night to smoke, I ovserved some bright lights in the sky. These lights were brighter than any I have ever seen. They were also closer to the ground than any I have ever seen. Upon seeing the first one, I scanned the sky and I noticed that there were more and they were all doing the same things. I guess what caught my attention more than anything was the pattern that they were moving in the sky and that they strobed a light which at first glance reminded me of a plane in the night sky. So, because some of them were so close to the ground and moving erraticly and flashing funny, I started watching them. I then observed that these lights were not and could not be planes. They seemed to be moving back and forth and up and down and sometimes in a circle pattern and flashing a red, blue, white, and green lights. They were fast moving as well. Faster than anything I have ever seen. After about a week of seeing them I mentioned the matter to my husband. Later that day I mentioned it to my 15 yr old son. That same night, I went outside about 1am to smoke and my son was still up. I can inside and got him. He came outside with me and I pointed the lights out to him and he sat outside for more than 2 hrs watching them with me. He observed the same things I noticed. I had him tell me the specifics about their movements before I told him what I was seeing in detail because I wanted to know that I was actually seeing what I was seeing. He also noticed the exact movements and flashes of light that I was and he also observed that they could not be planed due to the fact that they were moving too fast and not in patterns that a plane makes or even could make. I laughed at first because I thought I was dreaming or just was not seeing what I thought I was seeing. I could draw a picture of the shape of the objects but typing or trying to put it into words just doesnt do them justice. They are beautiful and seem to change shape. They are in different areas of the night sky and seem to be operating in pairs. For everyone I see I will see another one close by making the same erratic movements with the same flashes of light. And sometimes they just disappear and reappear in the same spot in which they vanished. That about sums it up. I could keep typing but I would just seem to be repeating myself, so I will stop. I would like to know what these strange lights are. They have me worried about what is going on and at the same time fascinated as to what may be going on. I know what I see and I know that it is different from anything I have ever seen before.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,36.5817,-86.5164

I even subscribe to an astronomy magazine so I am familiar with things in the night sky, but had never seen something like what I saw in the early morning of October 26. I was with my husband and we had just parked out in the country to look at the constellations. We were facing east when I saw a red light, not blinking or leaving a tail, come up from the southern sky and head north. It looked like it was going in a straight line. I could not tell if it was in the sky where plains fly or in outer space. It basically looked like a red star but moved across the sky like a plane. It took about 30 seconds for it to go across the sky. There were actual planes flying around that night and this did not look like any plane I have seen. I know this was not a meteor because it did not have a tail and stayed in the sky longer than a meteor would.

I was curious and continued to watch it, and then noticed there was an identical object a short distance behind it.  They moved at a moderate pace in a straight line and did not waver, which confirmed they were not birds.  Then the second object started moving underneath the first one, but stayed the same distance apart and neither changed speed.  It continued rotating around the first object until it was in front.

I was on the lawn of a mountain resort in north central Washington state, having a telephone conversation with my brother.  The area was being prepared for a corporate dinner by the hotel staff.  The jet passed 1000-2000 feet over the hotel at high speed in a northerly direction and began a near vertical climb.  The jet had vapor trails off its wing-tips and behind it. Just as it began its climb I saw a circular/oval shaped object above the jet at about a 75°.  At first I thought the oval object was just slightly larger than the jet but then realized at the speed it was going I couldn’t tell how far in front of the jet it was. It was climbing much faster than the jet and seemed to accelerate at an impossible rate until it disappeared in the blue sky. Both the jet and the object seemed to be the same light color in the bright sunlight. I did not see any markings on the Jet or the oval object. The jet climbed to 20,000 to 25,000 feet before leveling off in a westerly direction. I only heard the sound of one jet, I could not discern any noise whatsoever from the oval object. As soon as I saw the oval object I yelled at my wife who was close by in the swimming pool area. Her view was blocked by trees and she could not see the jet or the other object. There were three women close to me who had the same view as I did. I asked one of the women if she saw it too and she said she saw it but she did not know what she saw. I asked her if she saw any wings on the object and she said she did not.  A waiter appeared and I described what I had seen to him. He said that he had seen things like that before in this location and had assumed the jets were practicing with some kind of remote controlled aircraft. I told him that the object had no wings and travelled at an impossible speed for any known aircraft.  He seemed nonplussed. The entire time this took place I was in cell phone contact with my brother so he heard the events unfold as they happened.  This is a photo of my location when I heard the jet approaching. these pictures were taken shortly after the event. You can see the weather conditions were mostly sunny at the time. The temperature was in the low 80’s. I have a lot of experience around military aircraft at air shows around the country,  I am very familiar with military aircraft sounds and maneuvers, I am used to working very close to operational military aircraft of all size and description.  I spoke with a friend of mine who was a fighter pilot and described my experience.  He said that if the military was training in that area it would be a restricted air space which he doubted it was. I checked online and saw that it was listed as MOA (Military Operations Area) temporarily through August 4. I believe this is the type of aircraft I saw and about the same color.  This photo has been flipped horizontally and rotated to a vertical aspect. My view was somewhat similar to this.

It was about 10:55 or so and I just got back from the movies. Everything was fine. My uncle dropped me off and he stayed outside in the front to chat with my step-father. I was inside getting dressed when my uncle calls at me to get outside. I run outside and so does my mother and we see these red and blue lights blinking. The lights (we believe it was some type of aircraft) were close together and moving at a very fast pace. Every time we blinked, ""the craft"" was farther than before. I blew it off and said it was only an airplane. My uncle kept telling me it wasn't an airplane, though. I stayed outside with him while my mother and step-father went inside. My uncle searched the sky while I just stood there. Then he told me to look up and that's when we saw it. It had white and blue and red lights. It was very close. Every time the lights blinked, the outline of a saucer could be visible. I was in shock. I had always wanted to see a UFO and there it was before my eyes. I couldn't believe it. It passed us and then we really started searching the sky. After 15 minutes, we saw two more. These looked triangular shaped by the way the lights were fixed. They were a little far but the aircraft were very close to one another. After about 20 minutes then, we kept searching the sky and we did indeed see two real airplanes and that was that. I had to go inside and my uncle decided to go home. As soon as I got into my room, my uncle called me and told me to look out the window. Indeed there it was again. One more triangular shaped aircraft. My uncle tried following it but he lost track due to keeping his eyes both on the road and the craft. When he got home (took him 5 minutes), he saw one above his house and he called out my grandma who saw it. She said it was impossible to be an airplane because it flew so low and had way too many blinking lights. It was about 11:40 and my uncle saw one more above the St. Peter and Paul church. We believe this one was one of the many we had seen before. My uncle we! nt in ba ck inside his house due to a skunk being outside and he looked outside his window and saw one more. Same triangle shaped. Back at my house, I saw one more. One white light and it traveled fast. I have no idea what that was.

Date: August 1st, 2008 Time: 23:45 pm MST Location: 23rd floor, Crowne Plaza Hotel  Description of object seen: Began as a blinking, red light in the sky, which would shift over to a white color, then back to a red color.  Near the end of the sighting, the one light changed into 3 lights, colored red, green, and yellowish white. And, when bathed in the street light below, one could make out a cross like shape before the craft made it's exit from view. Object's Behaviors: Began as a blinking, red light in the sky, which, after seconds of sighting, began to drift to the left slowly then would STOP, change directions, STOP, and change directions again in a very erratic and sudden fashion, changing directions far too much and too fast to be of any known aircraft.  The red light would, at times, shift, or slowly turn into a white light at times, and in both modes, the light would suddenly flare, or would brighten drastically and then dim back down at random intervals and would appear to have sudden lashes of light whip from it, the color corresponding to the current color of the craft. Craft would not stay in just one general area, but would at times, move over to another area, fly about in that area, and would then return to the previous area to seemingly wander that area some more.  This was observed for approx. 14 mins. before the craft suddenly multiplied for a total of three 3 lights, a red, green, and yellowish light and began to approach closer to the western end of the town at a very quick speed, much quicker than most civilian helicopters I've seen about town.  And after a moment or so, I saw that the ambient light from the streetlights below had illuminated the underside of the craft, showing a white colored cross-like shape, before the craft swiftly flew far off over the horizon. Number of objects: One  Shape and Color: White cross shaped craft with red, green, and off-white colored lights. Duration of Sighting: approx. 15 mins. Witnesses: One, myself, station monitor in radio station on top floor of hotel building. Notes: All range estimates are based on pure conjecture and should not be considered to be ACCURATE data. It should be noted that I did call a friend during the sighting to describe the event.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,45.75458535031847,-108.50157707006369

Just beyond the clearing there was an intense Blue/White light that was pulsing.  At first I was thinking it might have been an airport light off track. But the closest airport was 20 miles away to the north.  I noticed it was keeping pace with us at 45 mph.  The light was so intense you could not look directly into it. The light tracked with us for 12 miles up highway 53 north and it took a due west heading out of sight.  I proceeded to drive highway 53 another mile and right before my turn. I spotted the second light floating right above some ones house on the west side of the rode.  I was able to see the light pulse from the first sighting off in the distance so this was a new light I drove to my turn onto Biss road. I pulled over to get a better look to my south approximately 25 yards away from us this light was above a home. I shut the truck ! off and rolled down the windows. There was no sound at all the light burned your eyes to view.  We sat there maybe 15 minutes and decided to go on our way. I drove 5 miles up the rode and decided I had to get another look we drove back and watched the light for another 10 minutes.  It appeared to me to be maybe 5 feet around.

They were the same colour and similar size.  When the three lights reached the same point as the two lights they disappeared.

This brightness caused a halo effect around the object which tapered off into a streaking tail which dithered behind it. When I say this object was bright I mean that it lit up the sky and the buildings in first hill. It was bright enough to illuminate the facing walls of the taller buildings, the roofs as it passed over head and to silhouette the buildings as it passed to their opposite sides. The brightness was enough to catch my attention away from my computer screen and I had just enough time to stand up in disbelief and watch it cruise past the buildings as stated heading east. The angle of entry was more level with the horizon than steep otherwise I am convinced it would have hit the tallest building in my view. Of course that is dependent on my relative position and perspective to the event, I actually do not know how high or how big this object actually was though I relate here to you my best account of what I viewed. It was enough though to scare my cat out of the window and into hiding. The event lasted 5 to 10 seconds I estimate and I did not have time to photograph the event. I make no assumptions as to what I saw.

Off to the right front I noticed far out a series of orange/yellow lights in the darkness. I thought perhaps it was a fire, on a mountain... but I realized there is no mountain in that area.  At this point I just kept glancing at it, and noticed it started to become an oval of lights.  Then the thing moved... slowly to sit over the freeway.  At one point it started to move down the freeway (headed West.)  The lights I could see now.  The lights were rotating and they looked like the animated lights on a blimp.  This is what I thought it might be, but it was kinda low... and the thing that was really odd, the rotating lights were on the bottom of whatever this was. Since it was dark, I could see no body to the thign, just the animated lights, that were moving in a direction.  Let me try and describe.  On the bottom of this thing, it looked like 5 lights in a row, and this row of lights, would turn off and the next row on... so forth. so it looked like a panel of five lights animating.  There was no sound... and the traffic was reacting to it.  traffic slowed, etc.  I did take video off my iphone... but the iphone uses such a wide aspect that it only appears as a small set of dots... and i'm shaking the phone a lot as i'm driving...",2009-12-12T00:00:00,34.1066,-117.815

I am not exactly sure what took place other than I am certain that what produced the very loud explosion, came from the sky. Time: Approximately 1:22 PM on Thursday, December 3, 2009. Location: North Port, Florida  I was sitting in my bathroom applying makeup, almost directly underneath the bathroom skylight. I did not have the bathroom light on and was applying the makeup with the natural lighting. Suddenly, something crossed over the skylight and dimmed the room substantially. Within approximately 2-3 seconds, there was a very loud explosion, as though something very heavy and large, hit the ground. The sound shook the house and sent all three of our cats into hiding. Initially, when seeing the dimming only, I thought it was a bird, although it would have had to be rather large. I also considered an airplane but did not hear one single sound, such as jet engine or other noise. I then went out to see if I could find anything. The explosion so quickly after seeing the dimming, made me consider an airplane due to the severity of the noise and the fact that the house shook. Note: Our house is surrounded by dense woods on both sides, as well as in the back. I went onto the back lanai and checked, however, did not notice anything in the immediate backyard. I did not notice any additional or unusual sounds, nor did I notice any smoke or fire. For a very brief period of time, I did note a very odd odor, which I cannot identify. It dissipated rather quickly. It was not strong, but was something that I have not ever smelled before. I returned to the house after my initial inspection. At approximately 1:26 I telephoned the North Port Police Department. I was transferred to Dispatcher Martin and asked if anyone had reported seeing/hearing anything. She stated that yes, other people in the neighborhood had contacted the North Port PD about the noise. She also stated to me that there were two officers en route to our general neighborhood. The call with Dispatch ended. I returned outside to look around some more. Upon returning to the front of the house, I observed that all power lines/transformers seemed to be in tact without smoke. At that time, two NP PD officers pulled in front of my home and my neighbor’s. Three neighbors then emerged from their respective homes. One officer spoke with the neighbors across the street from me, while the other spoke with me. I was asked what transpired and told the officer exactly what I witnessed. I pointed to the skylight and told him that I was almost directly underneath it when the room dimmed considerably, followed very quickly with a loud explosion. All of my neighbors and I thought that the noise came from a slightly different location, but all agreed to it being extremely close to our three houses. To my knowledge, I was the only one who “saw” anything, in addition to the explosion. The officer asked if I would be home for the day in the event that he had to come back to speak with me, of which I told him, “yes”. The officers did not go into the woods, nor the side/back of my home. The officers remained on scene for approximately 10 more minutes and then left. I returned to my home and once again, went to look out in the back/side yards, of which did not observe anything unusual. Note: It was approximately 2:00 PM when the cats came out of hiding. At approximately 2:11 PM, I made another call to Dispatch Officer Martin and asked if they had found the cause of the explosion. She stated that despite dispatching “several officers” to the neighborhood, they did not find a cause and said it was strange. Again, I did not actually ""see"" anything, but noticed a considerable dimming in the lighting as something passed overhead while in the bathroom, putting on makeup underneath the skylight.  Oddly enough, within  2-3 seconds, there was a huge explosion, that shook the house.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,27.076209523809524,-82.22327976190476

Smoking a cigarette , and talking to my girlfriend. i have been staying up all night lately, because i have been seing and Filming Slow Pulsing UFOS for the past week. I believe what i saw may 25th at 2 30 am was one of these same crafts But closer, lower, and brighter. At 1 00 AM, my girlfriend stopped me mid sentence and exclaimed ""What the heck is that"" i turned around and there was a tremendously  bright yellowish white light...looked to me at the time that it could be a plane coming Straight at us...{i watch the sky alot and im familiar with planes and what we have in our skys} but as i  watched it i realized, a plane would have moved a bit more by now....this object was barely moving visible to the eye. That was the first thing that raised my suspicion about this light...we watched it hover for a few minutes...and i decided to run and grab my camera... just to get a better look at it...my girlfriend decided to go to bed...i felt compelled to stay up. When i got back outside. the light was no longer white/yellow, But it was Pulsating ALL colors green red blue white purple, {same as the other lights i have filmed} - when zoomed in these lights have a colored aura ive seen the aura double in size and pulse vibrantly...I noted in my log it looked like a contained Aurora borealis Over AZ...I watched this light and filmed it briefly...i noticed this light was pulsing Inteligently...with a pattern so to speak...this is the first time i have observed these pulsations in an intelligent pattern.every 15-20 secconds the light would pulse solidly blue then solidly red. i thaught this was indeed a sign of life connected to this object.after 2 minutes of filming this object i put my camera down...lit a cigarette and just watced it. This was at approximitely 1 30 AM    I watched it for about 30 minutes and at about 2 00am it seemed much closer and much brighter. I decided to take out my camera again. What i saw when i zoomed on this object at 2 00 AM may 25th took my breath away. What before looked like a pulsing sphere was now...a 2 toned sphere of light.by 2 Toned i dont mean.. 2 colors i mean the bottom 2/3 was bright light and the top 1/3 was solid object. when i zoomed on this orb You could see the top 1/3 of the object was dark...or solid,the bottom 2/3 had a Glowing Core of moving light with Red and Blue Lines of light shooting or swimming all around it, like NOTHING i have ever seen on earth. on the video you cannot see this...until i expiremented with color settings i found. sharpening this image and turning contrast down to eliminate any kind of glare you can see what i saw.  here is a link to a clip i posted on you tube    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vp6IEdhCRk&feature=channel_page  this Light hovered slowly Moving twords me for a very long time i went to bed at 5 am because the sun was coming up and the object seemed to be moving Upwards after 4 00 am. it was back near that area -South of the Usery mountain range- May 27th 1am. but not this morning on the 28th.

I could not tell exactly how far away it was, nor how fast it was going, because I have never seen anything like this is the sky before. The craft seemed to be spherical or circular, and was the brightest a biggest thing in the sky by far. It was also completely silent. It proceeded to fly out over the water and after a bit, it seemed to stop. What happened next I still am not to sure of, because once again this is not an everyday thing...The craft began to glow brighter and bigger. I'm not sure whether it was stationary and just glowing more intensely, or if it was coming directly towards us. After about 10 seconds of this, the craft took off in the exact opposite direction, simply fading away and disappearing over the course of about 15 seconds.

I happen to live on the Eastern side of the city or just outside loop 20. By 10:00 P.M. much of the lightning and thunder had passed us by and only a few sprinkles remained.  While observing the weather conditions outside, I noticed a white puffy cloud immediately to the west of my location.  As I stared at this cloud, I noticed four white lights chasing each other within the cloud itself.   I immediately called my wife so she could witness what I was looking at.  I also called my brother who happened to be visiting family in the vicinity of Nixon High which is located NW of loop 20 from where I was.  He was able to see the same lights inside the cloud going around in a circular pattern.   I tried to apply all logic as to the origin of the lights.  There were no airplanes in the vicinity nor was there any beams of light coming from the ground up. The airport beacon light is approximately 2 miles from where this cloud was.  The lights seem to be chasing each other and never collided with each other.  At some point, the lights would come to a complete stop and would begin rotating in a counterclockwise pattern.  The best way to describe the lights is by imagining that your inside the cloud with a flash light and moving the light around or inside the cloud.  I could see where the light was hitting inside but the beam never broke through the wall of the cloud itself.   This sighting went on for approximately 30 minutes until the cloud moved out towards the East.  I am a law enforcement officer and I have never seen anything like this in my 26 years of service.

I was sitting on the back patio with my husband as we do nightly.  In the Northwestern sky I stared at a light that was flashing looked to be a constant white and red.  I then pointed it out to my husband, at which point we noticed there was a triangle shape of two additional bright, flashing lights. I went inside to get some binnoculars to get a better look of the image.  When I returned the brighter light of the three I initially saw now was a constant white with a red flash on the left of the light, green flash to the right and the occasional yellow/ orange flash.  There was at times a set pattern and at other times no noticeable pattern.  About 15 minutes into the phenomenom there was a sudden brilliant blue almost indigo light that emitted and the object moved slightly up vertically.  The object then went back to the original light flashing of alternating the multi-color flashing. It was at this point I called my sisters that live roughly 3 miles away to see if the could see these lights.  I called neighbors to see if they too, were still awake and could see.  All that I was able to get a hold of, confirmed that they too saw what we were seeing.  My sisters stated that they could see 2 additional triangular shaped flashing lights of 3 in two different groups.  We looked to the southern sky and could immediately see two more triangle shapes with the same flashing.  Those were further out than the original that was still staying in the same place. We live just south of Louisville which is a huge UPS hub, roughly 11pm is a very major time for a lot of incoming airplanes.  All of these planes didn't appear to react in anyway to the flashing lights.  It also helped give us an estimate to the altitude, the planes were much higher.  The flashing lights were just above the tree line from our patio. Tried on multiple occasions to use a camera to photograph but all we had was an iPhone camera which isn't of good quality and couldn't pick up anything on the image.  We drove closer to where we thought the light was directly overhead to get a picture but could never get a decent quality shot.  When we came back home the original flashing light was much dimmer and had moved quite some distance away.  While watching it, faintly in the night sky I watched as it appeared to zip over to the other two points of its triange shape and then all three immediately disappeared. It was a fairly clear night, tons of stars out etc, but in the triangle masses there was nothing but pitch black.  No stars inbetween or clouds.  I believe.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,38.0417,-85.5753

After we got ice cream we proceeded to sit at some benches at the perimeter of the park and eat each of our ice cream desserts there. As we were beginning to eat the dessert My daughter (age 6) asked me , “what is that light in the sky Papa?” I took a look in the direction that she was pointing and noticed a very bright object approaching from a distance (It came from the direction of Westmont, another suburb of Johnstown) towards the direction where we were standing. (Note: The four of us were not the only ones out at this time of night.  There was another family, eating their ice cream desserts beside us as well. They did not seem to be paying attention to what we were looking at)  My initial answer to my daughter’s question was that the object was a helicopter, possibly with a spotlight on. I mentioned the spotlight, as the light the object was emitting was extremely bright, orange, and looked like what you would see, if looking at a spotlight head from a distance. I stated to her that the helicopter was probably coming in for a landing at the local hospital (Conemaugh hospital). As I continued to observe the object, it came to a gradual stop. (Note: as it approached our location, it did not “fly” very fast at all, which led me to believe it was a helicopter)  We continued to watch the object and as time past, I came to the realization that it was not a conventional aircraft. The object remained stationary for a period of 30 minutes or more. (The length of time we were at the location eating our ice cream). I became perplexed as to what this object could be.  It was a pretty clear night, and many stars were visible.  This object however was in our atmosphere, much brighter then even the north star, or planet such as Venus, and after having seen it move initially, it remained stationary for an extended period of time. My girlfriend mentioned at some point during this event, that there was in fact quite a bit of  “aerial” activity in the vicinity of this object.  We both notice several smaller aircraft flying in what I call ""an observation flight path"" at various locations in the sky near to each other and in the direction of the object. I will say that after looking at the smaller aircraft for some time, and following their flight paths, At least one of the aircraft came to complete stop mid air and seemed to be observing the object that I am reporting on.  The smaller aircraft looked to be a “conventional aircraft”, as it had both white and red blinking lights. The only abnormal behavior that this small aircraft exhibited was the “hovering” maneuver it was able to do when “observing” the bright object. I will mention that I was able to take some photographs and video footage of this event with my smart phone.  As you may already know, the quality of this media is not very good. I also do not have flash on the camera, which definitely did not help my cause in attempting to capture good footage for the purpose of evidence. You are welcome to this footage if you so desire. After at least 30 minutes of observing the object, I packed the family in the car and took them home.  After being home for about 20 minutes, I decided I needed to go back to the location where I saw the object and ensure that what I saw was indeed not a star or planet.  When I arrived at the exact location I had initially seen the object, it was no longer there.  There was no aerial traffic either. The skies remained clear of clouds, allowing me to see the stars. This object was most definitely not a star or planet.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,40.31809857142857,-78.90465428571429

It was a clear night sky so we decided to pull out a couple of chairs in the back lawn and chat while the dog did what dogs do outside.  Within five minutes of looking at the night sky I noticed what appeared to be a satellite or a plane at a very high altitude moving steadily across the sky.  The object appeared almost indistinguishable from a star except for the fact that it was moving.  I turned to my girlfriend to ask her which one she thought it was and when we both stared back at the moving light it was sitting in the night sky stationary.  I was immediately a little spooked because I was unaware of any plane, satellite, or other flying object that was capable of moving and then coming to a complete stop.  My girlfriend thought I was just seeing things but I convinced her to keep an eye on for a few minutes.  It is important to note that the light that was moving! was now sitting still at about an arms length distance, from my vantage point, of a small bright star.  We watched the object for what seemed to be five to seven minutes, and just when I convinced myself that I was just seeing things the object clearly moved another arms length distance north of its current position.  My girlfriend confirmed this movement and as we were talking about what it could be the object quickly moved east of its position.  The object started at a six o’clock position, in relation to the small star near it, and when it became stationary again it was hovering at about a ten o’clock position from the star.  We were so intrigued by what this could be that we watched the object for a total of two hours.  Within this two hour time period, the object made several more movements, displayed a red tint at times, and changed the level of brightness it was emitting several times.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,35.13888709677419,-90.15471451612903

I decided to lie on top of my car and look up at the sky to watch the clouds pass by.  I sat there for about a minute before a saw a red light out of the corner of my eye. It grabbed my attention so i sat up to get a better look. At first, I dismissed it to just being a plane; I see a couple pass pay each day.  Then, as I continued to watch it I realized it couldn't have been a plane because the entire object was red, almost glowing like a light.  Then, I tried to say it was a a meteor, or some type of fireball, or a flare; but there was no trail of smoke left behind, nor was there a tail on the object.  It was just an glowing, oblong figure. It flew at a relatively constant speed; a little too slow for a plane, though.  It was high enough so that it was above some clouds, but below others. When I initally saw it, it was fl! ying from the north-west and headed towards the south-east.  However, I lost this figure behind the clouds for a moment and when I regained sight of it, it appeared to be headed east; at least a 30 degree change in flight path. I lost it beyond the horizon shortly after. I'm reluctant to call it a UFO just because I like facts and tangible proof.  I wasn't able to clearly see this object, nor was I up close to it.  The I'm posting this report now is because it seems as though there is no other explanation. When there are planes flying overhead, I hear noise.   There was no noise. It was too bright for there to be stars out.  Plus, it was much to large and oddly shaped for it to be a star.  It was moving too slowly to be a meteor or a fireball.  And, there was no trail of smoke as there would be with a flare. As much as my logical, fact-based mind hates to admit it, I think this could have been a UFO. The thing that really made me post this report, though, is perhaps the most unsettling thing. I came inside to research what it might have been and all that kept appearing in my search results were links to people talking about UFOs. I ended up on this website and decided to look at what other sightings have happened in my state. I came across a report in which the poster said they were on States Bridge Rd. near a subdivision named Double Gate.

After I quickly explained it to her I ran to the door of my house and called for my stepdad to come outside being he was the only one awake, losing sight of the object for less than 10 seconds. It was moving a steady pace but seemed extremely slow in comparison to how low the object was in the sky. It also made no noise. It had the motion of a helicopter following a high speed car chase but the lights seem much too far apart to resemble a helicopter, and again it made no sound! .  My stepdad came out,  watched it for maybe 15 seconds, dismissed it as an airplane and went inside.  At that point it was a little past our house and I was losing sight of it so I jumped up on the roof of my car and watched until it disappeared into the tree line.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,42.8987,-88.7991

A I watched this object, just to the left of it what at first I thought was a plane flew right into it.  I looked to the right thinking it was going fly past it and it did not. That is when I jumped up and told my son something is not right with that object I think it is a UFO.

We watched as its movements were irratic at times and at one time before it completely disappeared it came closer and then backed away and then disappeared. Within about 5 minutes it reappeared in the same area and to the right of it a red object appeared in the sky. The red object moved faster than any jet we had ever seen. It was if it was encircling the the white object. Then all of a sudden they disappear and we see flashes of white light as if someone was taking a picture and the flash was so bright. By now our neighbors were outside watching the activity and we noticed all the planes coming into our airport were circling away and we noticed jets taking off in the direction of the ufos.

For size perspective they looked rather like low flying aircraft lights, but there was only one light per object and the light was all I could see of the object. The lights were grouped roughly in a V formation. At first I thought that there were two irregularly shaped disks leading the formation but as objects raised and lowered in altitude as they moved south it became clear that the fairly low (but light) cloud cover meant that as objects raised above the cloud cover the light from the object reflected down below as a dark disk shape through the cloud. The objects were moving fairly slow and not as steady as I have seen most aircraft fly (more of a bobbing motion). They were moving not in unison but definitely as a group of some sort. I did not get a firm count because I would loose/see more as they changed altitude. This took place in an urban area and I lost sight as the objects moved out of my line of sight into the tree line/buildings. About another 10 or so people witnessed this in the parking lot that I was in.

The glow of the object made it impossible to identify, almost like an entire plane was engulfed in fire, but holding a consistent altitude.  It’s sound was low, unlike an airplane and resembled a  pulse.   After it was out of view, I ran back into the house and called 911 to see if there were any other reports.  The operator checked with the sheriff’s office and said there was no boat distress flares reported.  I guess, when I described it flying, the operator decided it was a flare since I didn’t describe the size or just thought I was out of my mind  and  didn’t want to be part of an U.F.O. report.",2010-07-10T00:00:00,37.98853003802281,-121.7887855513308

This thing lit up and we could see lights all around it when it powered up to move,Santa Paula,CA,2009-07-25T23:00:00,disk,4 hrs,"Occurred : 7/25/2009 23:00  (Entered as : 07/25/09 23:00) Reported: 7/26/2009 1:12:06 PM 13:12 Posted: 8/5/2009 Location: Santa Paula, CA Shape: Disk Duration:4 hrs",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71335.html,"This thing lit up and we could see lights all around it when it powered up to move Last night at approximately 11pm my friends and I saw what we know was an unidentified flying object.  There were multiple households watching, I know that because when we would scream a little they would too.  We would literally jump like you would when something loud scares you, but it was the lights that were terrifying.  First off let me say that not only have my friends and I lived in this town for our whole lives, 2 of us, including me grew up looking at the very mountain range we saw this happen on.  This WAS NOT normal activity.  There are some oil lease roads, and the California Condor Sanctuary is right on the other side of the mountain.  These lights were hovering together almost like a boat tucked away in a cove.  These mountains have basically sheer cliff faces, and just unimaginable terrain.  I mention this because these lights were perfectly even with one another across a great span of the mountain, with incredibly bright white light that would app! ear much more to the left of the lights that caught our attention. I was the first to notice them, we had just BBQ’d some burgers, and brought my friends little fire pit into the back of his yard. The reason we did was because this is a rural area right outside the town and there is far less light pollution so the stars would be brighter. My two other friends were talking, and I was away from the fire and looking up and what caught my eye first, and was my proving point in  getting people to look at what I was saying, was the brightest blue LED type of light I have ever seen. Then there were two white lights that flashed, and then a red one on the left. These are the lights that we continued to see. But it was a vast array of flashes, and faint lights, all perfectly even across the cliff faces. It was so amazing, I had to go get my girlfriend out of bed at around midnight to come and watch. We live about a mile from where we first saw it, and on the drive down I saw the lights the entire time. This is what scared us: the lights were in a flat line 98% of the time flashing and glowing the most incredible white lights you could ever see. I’m familiar with off road lights that are at between 250,000 and 1,000,000 candle power, and these were so bright at that range it would be like staring into a welder’s arc flame at 10 feet. These lights when you shut your eyes you could still see them. But then lights behind lit up and you could perfectly see a huge disc shape. There were two rings of light, a smaller ring on the top that was a perfect disc shape, and the large ring of lights was a perfect disc shape as well. We could never see the shape until it lit up in all directions, and it floated up, spun itself around about half a rotation, moved back a little then went back down. All of us were scared to our core. We all screamed and were VERY scared. The lights continued on for another 2 hours after  that, but it never lit up again like it did when we COULD CLEARLY SEE ! A LIT UP DISC SHAPE IN THE SKY THAT MOVED.	 There were 6 adults and one 8 year old kid that saw what we were seeing, where we saw it. Everyone there would talk to anyone you’d like to send out. I called 911 and the police told me that it was a Sheriff problem; I called the Sheriff and was told it was a local police problem. Dogs throughout the valley were barking, people were outside smoking cigarettes watching this, kids were walking down the street in packs and asking me if I saw it too. If you start knocking on some doors here, I think you would find that maybe 50 or 100 people, probably more, saw what we saw. My dogs were in the front in my truck, and I would go check on them because they were very nervous, by the way they are good sized Pit Bulls that are afraid of nothing, and they were scared. I believe all the animals were. There is a good amount of livestock running around up on the mountains and on all the surrounding ranches, but oddly enough I didn’t hear a horse whinny or a cow moo, not once. Two Ventura ! County Sheriff’s cars flew by me a very high rate of speed, and flashed a side light at me, I had a big 4 cell LED Mag Light, and I flashed at them, but they just kept going.  It was very surreal, and at times terrifying. Please come and investigate this. Contact me anytime day or night.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,34.4014,-119.0753

At around 10:45pm, for some reason, I looked up at the sky and noticed 3 orange lights in the sky.  They were in a triangle formation.  The light on the left point faded out.  The light on the right point started to slowly rise up towards the top point.  At this time, my husband got up and stood next to me.  I asked him if he was seeing what I was and he said yes.  We watched the left point rise until it passed the top point.  Then the top point faded out.  About a minute later, still rising, and brighter than before, the last point (which was on the right in the beginning) faded out.  We didn’t see anything else the rest of the night.
