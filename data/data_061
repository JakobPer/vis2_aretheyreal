Please see below.  PD)) From 9:46PM until 10:22PM, 2 unidentified objects were witness by myself seemingly ""dancing"" in the cloud covered night skies.  These 2 objects were circular, with lights ringing the outside perimeter of their circumference.  Their movement was eratic, ranging from hovering, to then quickly darting about while flipping and rotating. As the objects flipped in abrupt directional changes, the top of the disk appeared to be a dark metallic.  The lights surrounding the craft would ocassionally flash brightly.  It appeared as if the objects were ringed with 8 white lights, and 1 larger red one; which by watching the movements of the objects, would indicate being the 'front'. The objects were visible this entire time just barely under the low slung clouds.  They would dart in and out of the cloud cover, and then stay for extended periods below the clouds.  It appeared that their relative distance from the observers did not change that much, only altitude. Photos will be forthcoming. Observers were:  Myself:  Corporate President My Girlfriend:  Mathematics Teacher  (Irvine High School) Neighbor:  Custom Home Developer Neighbors Wife 2 Visiting Relatives of Neigbors 1 Other new neighbor, apprx 25 yrs of age, name and occupation unknown ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Apparently, this report is in all likelihood a false alarm.  I called the Irvine Police Dept and they stated that there is a local resident that conducts experiments from time to time that have in the past generated similar reports of UFO's.  They continued to state that he normally reports in first, before conducting these experiments, but that tonight he did not.  However, the are reasonably certain that this is probably the source of our observations. Given the late hour, I will not press my neighbors to compile the photos and video tonight, however, will retain the information awaiting you verification of this mundane event.  If for any reason this was not what actually happened, all materials will be available for you. Thanks!",2008-10-31T00:00:00,33.68653500837521,-117.79240477386935

Saw a single bright diamond-shaped light suspended about 10 ft above my car, shining inside the front windshield. I watched it for about 30 seconds. Couldn't tell if there was any object there as my niece's garage was blocking my view where I couldn't see anything else but the light.

A friend of ours came with us and was helping us with the bait. While watching the sunset I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, which I first dismissed as a plane because they are a very common sight. But the longer I looked at it I realized something about it was different; it was completely silent, going far more slower than a plane would go, and it was shaped like a pancake with no wings. I pointed it out to both my sister and my friend and at first they had the same thoughts as I did about the plane theory, but then started became curious because the longer we looked at it drift thought the sky, the more it became clear that it was nothing we had ever seen before. It had no trail behind it like most planes and jets. It was just a shiny silver pancake shape object drifting along. Within a few minutes we spotted another one, and watched as the first one disappeared into seemingly thin air. In total we saw eight of these objects over the course of an hour. At one point my friend said he thought he saw lights coming off of it, and sure enough, at least 3 of the objects had lights. There were two to each craft, extending the whole length. They would become extremely bright, then slowly dim until it looked as though the lights would shut off, then complete the process. The possibility of it being some sort of balloon is just not possible. This whole event started at 7:30 PM eastern standard time, and ended about an hour later. My friend, my sister and I are all 100% sure that the crafts we saw tonight were Unidentified Flying Objects. My sister and I are both in our twenties, and our friend is in his teens.

Something odd was flying around in the Gulf Breeze area. On June 26, 2008, I noticed a somewhat bright, solid, reddish light stationary in the sky that was probably 500 yards off the ground. It stayed in that position for at least five minutes never moving or doing anything else. Earlier that evening, there was some helicopters flying around, and they never stopped and hover in one position. I suspected the solid red light might be a helicopter, but I never heard any noise coming from it. I estimate the distance the object was from me about half a mile and located North-East in direction. I had a camera in my car and I went to get it. That took about five minutes. When I tried to locate the object in the sky, I could find it. The event took place around 9:00 PM. The next day, my friend and I went fishing again at Bob’s site bridge. I didn’t think to bring the camera with me. Again, I saw the red light around 9:00PM situated in the same area in the sky at the same height and direction. I hurried to my car again which took at least five minutes. Again I couldn’t locate the object which appeared to be stationary in the sky for at least two minutes before I left to get the camera. On July 16, 2008, my friend and I went fishing at Bob’s sites. This time I had my camera with me. We fished on the pier instead of the bridge.  There was lots of people fishing which is unusual for a Wednesday.  The sky was clear and the almost full moon was rising . I was facing North and it was about 8:45PM when I noticed an object coming from the North. I watched the object as it made a turn to the North-East.  It wasn’t a passenger jet.  As the object made the turn like a jet, I clearly saw for a brief moment the shape of the object. It was triangular in shape like a B-2 stealth bomber. I also saw five separate white lights in a triangular formation beneath the wing-like structure which also appeared to be part of the craft structure.  After that moment, I got my camera out. The object was now heading North-East. I could only see two separate light orange/red in color and fading slowly.  I put the camera in available light mode and zoomed in at max, but I couldn’t see the object in the viewer.  I took two pictures anyways hoping that maybe I get something. After downloading the pictures onto my computer, I was not able to see the object or lights.  It might had been a military jet, but that is the fist time I saw a triangular shape object flying around in the area of Gulf Breeze, and I lived near this area practically my whole life.  There was no strobe lights, red lights, or green lights on the object.  Nothing to indicate that it was a commercial jet.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,30.3843725,-87.016175

I would like to think that this is just some crazy hoax.  I have 6 cats, two dogs, and live in a rural area. Our property is 1-1/4 acre deep. We live in a desert area and have some natural growth (sage, yucca, Joshua trees, etc) along one back corner of our yard. We left it for privacy reasons. There is an electrical pole in that particular corner, as well, but situated in the lot behind us. The lot behind us has no home on it. It’s one of the few vacant lots in our neighborhood, and is full of natural growth.  I stayed up late the night before last. Yesterday morning I woke up at 5:15 am to my favorite bunk buddy (cat) digging at my face. He does this on occasion and it is usually an annoyance that lasts for a few seconds, until I get him to lie down, so that I can resume sleep. Yesterday morning he kept doing this nonstop until I finally just decided to get up.  I walked out to my kitchen, fixed a cup of coffee and lit a cigarette. It is on rare occasion that I get up this early, as I am not a morning person, I like to go outside and take in the morning sunrise. Something about sunrise is just so peaceful to me.  Well, yesterday morning was just kind of eerie, I felt a slight headache coming on, as I started to head out the front door, but then decided to go out into my courtyard instead. I have a table and chairs out there where I can sit.  The sky was kind of eerie, without any sunshine. It was more like an overcast morning, but without the clouds.  As I stood, looking at the back of my yard I saw some bright red flashing lights in the back corner of my yard, lots of them covering about a six sq. foot area, through the overgrowth and underbrush. I thought perhaps it’s a fire truck or something, or an ambulance. But what would an ambulance or fire truck be doing in a vacant property. I started walking toward the back of the property to the lights. He lights were obviously on the outside of my fence, by an electrical pole. I started thinking maybe someone is getting ready to do some electrical work, but why 5:30 in the morning? The closer I got (My property runs deep.) the more I could hear rustling in the bushes. Then I saw my two dogs, one was running back and forth along the back fence sniffing, but not barking. The other dog was sniffing around outside the bushes. I yelled for both of them and neither of them acknowledged my call. They never even looked at me. This was very much out of character for both of them.  I frantically started yelling for them, as they suddenly got interested in what was going on behind the bushes. I didn’t want them trailing in because I had no idea what or who was rustling in the bushes. Both dogs headed into the bushes right away. My two dogs running up behind me, from the front of the property, smiling, tails wagging as usual distracted my attention. I looked back in front of me and everything disappeared, as though nothing was there. No red lights, no dogs on my side of the fence, nothing.  I don’t know if anyone else has had an experience like this before, but I would sure like to know about it. I know that I am a sane human being. I know that I was not dreaming. Incidentally my headache lasted almost all day long. I don’t drink, and do not do drugs. If anyone else has had anything like this happen, please list it because this is really bugging me. I was never afraid during the episode; except for thinking my dogs were about to get involved with something or someone in the bushes. Afterwards, I was a little confused, and reluctant to tell even my husband.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,34.42715,-117.51310625

The object would move, stop on a dime, and immediately change directions with angles nearly as sharp as 180 degrees.  The object (its lights) were frequently changing, and/or blinking.  I saw red lights, white lights, and at least one other color.  At one point, when the object was stopped, I counted the white light as it flashed 26 times in approximately 3 seconds.

Then whilst the first object moved along the same way as described above, two more objects arrived, but at immense speed, stopped near the hovering object, and shot off again in the opposite direction it came from.

I found in the city Newspaper Insight \Section.That on August 3rd,2002 in the early morning.Farmers in Howick ,Quebec found strange crop circles.The formation being called a Qua! druple formation.It now confirmed to me of what I had witnessed that same morning on Aug.3rd 2002.There was a something intelligent and large over the skies in southern Ontario/Quebec that early morning to confirm.Just to note some other strange observations on the ground here at the time during camp Peter.My car clock was 13 minutes slower.Earlier in the week at camp.I heard strange animal sounds near 1:30am.I have never heard these sounds before-high pitched squeaking.Even a cottager across the river shone their high beam flashlight at the strange sound's location described.Here's the kicker to this story of paranormal.My 9 year old son said he saw a Koala Bear in the day.It was the same area as the shrinking that late night.He knows his animals-so what was it ?? The day I came home at camp.Near midnight, when I went to bed.I could hear this same type of sound I heard at camp, now here at home.My body felt highly electrified.Like all my body hair stood up ^ . I was so tired from the late nights before .Previous to 2002,I have witnes! sed othe r aerial anomalies at camp since 1999.It was this sighting and experience that sparked my interest to research and understand.What's going on here ? I feel it possible that I have been abducted numerous times-since childhood.It's almost like it follows you.I do believe this is a life time conditioning.Making it easier to except a intelligent presence around us.Lessening the fright factor.I will include the newspaper article concerning the crop circle formations found in Howick Quebec.Thx again PMS ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports submitted by same source.

Approximately a month later, I believe it was Nov. 7, 2007, I saw something unusual in the sky.  I was miles away from others (except for an elderly woman I was caring for.)  She didn't see this. I was outside shaking out some scatter rugs when I saw an object floating overhead pretty high in the sky. I'm estimating a fourth of a mile in the sky.   I was in the country at an isolated house, and it was a sunny day, clear sky, and here was this thing floating in the sky overhead slowly.   I was near my car, and I had a digital camera in the car, so I got it, and took three pictures. By the time I got the camera out and took the first picture, it was some distance away from me, still just floating in the sky soundlessly.  It appeared to be the good year blimp, way far up in the sky.   By the time I took three pictures, it was hard for me to see the object anymore.  The odd thing was, all of a sudden this object created a noise like a large plane (I am not into aircraft but the sound I described at the time was a B1 bomber sound).  Its as if they were floating above, enjoying the peaceful landscape, and then they saw me watching them and they wanted me to think they were a common airplane. It is as if they flipped a switch to create the noise.  Incidentall, I've seen blimps, and this really wasn't a blimp, just resembled one. I didn't want to send the pictures because I was disgusted at your website for putting down another person who had reported sightings at approximately the same time I did.  You more or less accused him of being a hoax.  I felt he was telling the truth.   All the time, I knew I would send it to you at some time, because I wanted you to enhance it and see what you could see. Tonight I saw Larry King Live and three gentlemen were discussing UFO's, and the lack of evidence.  I got on my computer to see the photos, and this is the only one I can find.  I think it was the best of the three, but I still wonder what happened to the other two photos, they were in my Photo Library, now none are there. I may be wrong.   This was in one of my documents.    I decided to send it tonight in case  this photo  disappears. I may be wrong on the date and time, but I know it was in the afternoon and I'm pretty sure it was Nov. 7th.  I know it was 2007.

The object first appeared in the southwest bearing northeast.  The sun had set at about 8:31 p.m. and some ambient light remained near the northwest horizon.  In addition to this light, ground light also added light to the night sky so that the sky was not totally dark. I first noticed a rippling in the sky out of the corner of my eye.  Drawn to what was causing this phenomenon, I looked at that area of the sky and was able to discern the object. It was impossible to judge the size of the object, however the appearance of its width in the sky was approximately slightly larger than the width of a full moon. The craft was completely silent and no exhaust could be perceived.  It had no navigation lights.  A very slight perturbation was visible surrounding the craft--a rippling of the atmosphere.  This phenomenon was similar to that observed when heat waves are rising from asphalt on a hot summer day. Shortly after the craft passed the zenith, it turned towards due north with no perceptible change in speed.   Unlike a conventional aircraft that would have had to bank to affect a turn, this craft simply turned without banking and changed its vector smoothly and rapidly towards the north. Based on my observation -- which lasted no more than 12 to 15 seconds -- I believe this craft is an advanced U.S. Air Force stealth platform designed for secret aerial reconnaissance missions.  It uses an anti-gravity propulsion system, perhaps electro-gravitic.   When it changed its vector it was obvious that the ""wings"" were not used to keep the craft airborne.  The wings were not needed to provide lift or employed as an aerodynamic airfoil.  This was demonstrated by the fact that it did not bank when executing its turn.  Three dimly lit gray circles under the ""wings"" were what seemed to provide its ""lift"" and propulsive force. Because of the luminosity of the night sky the object was easily discernable once I spotted it.  The craft seemed to slide rather than fy through the night sky. What is also revealing is that this craft flew directly through the TCAs (terminal control areas) of two major airports:  Chicago O'Hare Airport and Chicagoland Executive Airport (formerly Palwaukee Airport) the nation's busiest executive airport without any alert that I heard of later.   I'm familiar with both civilian and known military aircraft having attended flight ground school and obtained a private pilot's license for fixed wing single-engine aircraft back in 1977. I made a drawing of the craft in photoshop shortly after my observation so the details would be fresh in my memory.  I will email a JPEG of it to you.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,42.031,-87.8112

Again a few minutes later it blinked straight out in front of us to the south and we could see that it was 5 or 6 lights that looked sort of like strobe lights. It was blinking a redish orange color and was a very lazy blink. It was not fast or slow but a very lazy light up and dim back down. It was also dead silent and was obviously hovering because as it would blink it was stationary and not flying by like an airliner. This blinking went on for several more minutes revealing a new location every time it would blink which would be several miles away from where it had blinked the first time. It blinked one last time to the south west and disappeared. Immediately after it disappeared a U.S. Coast Guard Helicopter flew out over the water where the UFO had been. It flew back and forth very briefly and then returned inland. Although I am a believer in UFOs and life on other planets besides our own my father is a skeptic and doesn't truly believe in UFOs. We can both agree that was we saw out there was real and no hallucination on our part. It was no weather balloon or a plane either.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

She asked me to come look at this.  I looked up and saw what looked like bright stars moving from northwest to southeast across my night sky. She pointed out three of the lights in the middle of the group that were moving in a diagonal row.  There were scattered clouds that night moving west to east. The lights just kept coming and coming. There had to be at least a hundred of these lights in all. They were all moving at the same speed and direction, maintaining the same distance from each other, across the night sky. The lights were slightly different in colors and brightness, some were pure white and bright, some were slightly orange-red, and some were blue-white. To us they all appeared to be at the same altitude moving swiftly, taking over a full minute to cross over our entire night sky. It was just amazing how many of them there were, and the speed they must have been going. I’ve seen many satellites in the past moving across the night sky and these lights were moving at twice the speed of them. Once the fleet had moved past us there were no more lights trailing behind. The next morning I thought about the three stars that my wife had pointed out to me when I had first joined her outside. Then it hit me, Orion, the constellation of Orion, the belt!  That night I showed her the constellation of Orion in the sky; I asked her if anything looked familiar? Without hesitation she pointed to the three stars of Orion’s belt. I printed out a picture of Orion and held it up over my head, as strange as this might be, I feel that the fleet of lights was moving in the formation of the constellation Orion.

We, myself, my friend, and his mother-in-law, were driving down I-90 heading into Orchard Park and the animal hospital to pick up his mother-in-laws sick Keeshond.  I was looking out the back seat window and was sitting behind the driver. I happened to notice something just out of the corner of my eye and turned to look at it more fully.  At first I thought I was seeing some sort of reflection in the window, so I adjusted the way I was sitting.  It didn’t change.  It was still there. I watched it for maybe 2 or 3 seconds in total before it disappeared.  It was a silver/chrome colored, highly reflective/metallic, circular shaped object in the sky.  It was moving completely parallel to the ground at a decent rate of speed, since it seemed to be keeping up with us. It did not appear to be a traditional air craft since it was the wrong shape, there were no additional lights, it was flying too low considering there was no airport near us, and it was completely silent.  I noticed no additional noises of any sort and my experiences with airplanes and helicopters when they are close by has lead me to believe they are normally quite loud. Just when I had determined that this might not be something normal, the object reached a patch of trees and vanished.  I say it vanished because the trees were completely bare.  So even if the object had simply gone behind the trees, I should have been able to see some of it between the branches.  But I saw none of it; it was just gone as soon as it touched the first branch. It was a bright, clear, afternoon and while there was a breeze I wouldn’t say it was particularly strong.  It couldn’t have been a balloon of any kind since those tend to sort of bob up and down in an irregular path when they are pushed in the wind.  This would have been additionally true with the different lanes of traffic. I would guess that it was few (2-3) hundred feet away from us and might be three feet in diameter if it had been up close.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,42.7442,-78.7442

The light looked white, and was not moving. I watched it for about 5 minutes to make sure it was not moving. Then i went inside my house to get my girlfriend to come take a look at it also. It was very cold so we went back inside and I checked on it again about 15 minutes after I first seen it. It was still there but it was getting pretty cloudy and the light was getting dimmer, I am not sure if it was the clouds making it dimmer. But when i went to look if it was still there about 30 minutes after i first seen it, it was not there. But it was really cloudy by then, so i think maybe the clouds was hiding it. The reason i find this light to be so interesting is because this is not the first light I seen like this. Sorry my computer does not have Microsoft word any more. Around this time of year, last year I seen a light just like this one, only this one was close and i knew exactly where it was. I lived by a Mountain i use to run up all the time, it has those towers with red lights that blink at night. One night around 3 a.m. at night i went outside to have a smoke, and right above those towers there was a huge bight white light. I say its huge because it looked way closer then this last one I seen, but i did not think ""UFO"" at that time. But I knew that there is no reason a light like that should be there at that time of night. It took me about 10 minutes to finish my smoke, but i watched a little longer to see if it would move. By then I knew this was not normal and wanted to go grab my cell phone to get it on camera, so i could show my girlfriend and others. So I went inside my house to get it all the way down stairs, and went back out and it was still there. I was able to get it on video, I could of went on forever but i can only send 15 seconds of a clip to my girlfriend that lived in Minnesota at the time. I sent it to her, but the light was very smal! l on my cell phone cam and did not look like anything i was looking at. Now since I watch UFO Hunters I know these type of lights are while known, and would like to know what it is i am seeing. I wish I knew what I know now or i could of simply called 911 and drove over to that light and got really close to it. The one that i just now seen looked pretty far away and I did not want to drive in the ice we got out here. This one I don't really know what it could have been since it looked so far away, I am thinking maybe a planet may have been really close, but I don't know. The other light I seen was a ""UFO"" for sure. But I will keep watching maybe I will be lucky and see a light like my first one.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?

It was 300 – 500 feet in the air, and flying in a triangular formation at a very slow, but still “cruising” speed. It was completely silent and headed Southeast. About 2 seconds past and the made a spin move around eachother one time, then went exactly back into the triangle formation.  Then the light blue/gray orbs turned into just light gray and immediately, but very slowly, faded out. I could no longer see the orbs. I let my dogs in and I then had a very strange/ eerie feeling as if someone were watching me, or having a sense of someone in the room.

It was about 9pm. We noticed a light in the sky. It was a very clear calm night; it looked like a ball of fire like a hot coal. The closer it got to us it looked more like a football or possibly saucer shaped thing, which was hot white/yellow in the center and got orangish gold toward the outside. This thing flew from a distance away toward us and above and beyond us across the sky. Approximately 500ft up?  It was totally silent. The size to our vision would be similar to if you held a children’s “nerf” football out at arms length. Being at the height that I assume it was, it was very big. Bigger than my moms house easily. I have seen the EXACT SAME style craft on a ufo show. the one where craft hits the desert then bounces back up then hits again and explodes into a million firey lights, its pretty popular i think. Here is the weird part, we had my moms camera up there to use like a scope (kids ya know) it was an old 80’s rectangular style one. Anyway with camera in hand I saw all this. Never once thought to take a picture at all. It was too strange for me to do anything but stare at this thing. It didn’t move super fast either. 100mph? Now that im almost 33 im a better judge of visual speed applied to something at a distance and 100mph for an air craft isn’t that much I think. We had our parents look through the news papers to see if a meteor had hit or other people reported seeing it. it was really big. There was nothing. Ok, years later, when I spoke to my friend about this again, he said something I didn’t remember and still barely remember. Within 5 min of the sighting, he said 3-5 military style helicopters flew across in the same direction. This could have been at the point that I jumped off the roof and frantically tried to explain to my mom what had just happened. Since those days, I have become a huge ufo enthusiast as well as other unexplained things. All stemming from personal experiences like this one.  I will post more sightings I have had over the years right after this one too because the form wouldn’t let me use “various” under times and dates.

I tent camped next to my car overnight on April 26, 1990 at the San Francisco Hot Springs near Glenwood NM. It was a windy night and I actually had to get up in the darkness to put rocks inside my tent to keep it from blowing away. (I had tent stakes for earth not for sand). I got up early since I wasn’t really sleeping and decided to leave early in the predawn to drive back home to Santa Fe. I drove in the darkness on Hwy 180 north through Reserve and past Datil to catch Hwy 60.  On an open flat stretch of highway where there were absolutely no other vehicles and as the dawn gave some light to the land I caught the flash of silver in the distance to my front/right. I noticed a silver object flying in the sky parallel and low to the land but headed for the next set of mountains to the north. As I look now at Google Maps I see a section of the Cibola National Forest that rises up from flat valley where I was driving. Once again, it was on Hwy 60 just past Datil. I was driving north and the UFO was flying north. I would say that the UFO was at least 10 miles away and of course in the New Mexico desert you can spot things over some distance. Now I have been an amateur astronomer since my youth in the 1960s and I’ve seen all manner of natural, normal sky phenomena including weather balloons and also identifying Venus and other planets. And I’ve often observed planes, jets and helicopters. But the way this UFO approached the mountain was unlike any earth based flying machine I had ever seen before or since. It did not gain altitude in advance of the mountain which I would expect a jet plane to do but rather stayed low, hugged the mountain and then quickly flew out of sight. I found a safe place to pull over about a mile or two later and just waited and looked to where I’d last seen it but it didn’t reappear. I continued my drive and passed the Very Large Array Telescopes and a few months later I read in the Santa Fe Reporter that other folks had reported UFO activity near the VLA.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,,

I looked up and seen this circle object come into the sight of the windows. From the distance of the house it was probably about 50 ft away. The size of the craft was about 20 ft wide and about 4 feet in length. The color of the craft was a shiny silver. But the lights going around the outside of it were very bright and lit up the area where it floated. It just hovered there for about 1-3 minutes. I don't really know how much time passed but it seemed to be there for quite awhile. I got the attention of the other girls in the room and we all just stared and awed at it. Just as soon as it came, it jetted out of sight with no sound made. Even while hoovering in the grove of trees there was no sound. We ran across the street to my moms house and told her about it but she didn't believe us. This is the first time I have mentioned it.

While walking south from Albany avenue in between Ashley street and Collins street I looked up into the night sky. I noticed a solid light ,  from a close distance I immediately thought it was a helicopter. So I listen for the noise of the motor but the object made no noise. I tried to alert my friends of this strange object with no sound but I could not because I felt in a trance or mesmerized by the sight. So I thought to myself it was heading in the south direction so it should pass over the Collin-Bennet building and the reflection of the light should illuminate the building and the object because it was passing at a low altitude so i stared. Continuing to walking down the sidewalk my friends was talking. I was so amazed with what i was seeing i did not hear a word they were saying. With anticipation the object finally proceeded to pass over the building and truthfully what i saw next is indescribable but i will try my best. The light hit at a very close proximity and it looked very dim and controlled the light illuminate a very small portion of the building almost like a beam unlike nothing i have ever seen before. I believed the object was no more than 10 feet from the top of the building. So the light should have been more visible. The light from the object was only visible within a diameter of no more than 5-10 feetin a controlled space. I never seen that in a beam of light. After the object passed out of sight range i immediately turned to my friends and said"" DID YOU SEE THAT ""?. They looked at me with such confusion it still effects me to this day. Its been seventeen years and i still think about that day. I cant get it out of my head so i decided to write you. This date has an emotional connection because a week later my uncle ((name deleted)) died of cancer so that’s why i am sure that it was in April of 1992. No later than the last week of March 1992 for any skeptics. The object moved slow, steady, and balanced about 5 mph when it passed over the building there was no type of vibration or movement.

A light flashed by a man at close range.,Hawthorne,CA,1997-04-15T10:00:00,light,2 seconds,"Occurred : 4/15/1997 10:00  (Entered as : 04/15/97 10:00) Reported: 5/13/2009 1:30:54 PM 13:30 Posted: 6/9/2009 Location: Hawthorne, CA Shape: Light Duration:2 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70028.html,"A light flashed by a man at close range. 2009 05/13 These notes are just for me.  They are not intended for others to see or judge me by. Please forgive me for writing down these observations.  I am a hard working man focused on making a living for my wife and family.  I do not make things up.  The observations I am writing about actually happened to me.  I was never going to write about them, but then today I decided to make a few quick notes about my experiences.  I have two college degrees in science and have worked in the medical field for over 30 years.. About 10 yrs ago, I lived with my wife in an upstairs apartment. I was the only one home that day. It was a spring day at about 10 AM.  I went to the bathroom and as I was leaving the bathroom, a bright orange object shot by me faster than my eyes could follow it.  It was about the size of a dime (0.25” diam), it came from my left(east to west) (bathroom window sill on left is about 5’ above floor and window was open) and went to my right at about shoulder height (decending at an angle of 10 deg toward the floor).  When I looked to the right to follow the object, it was gone in less than a split second and all I could see was the closed bathroom door. Needless to say, I was startled; the object came within 1 ft of me.  My eyes only gazed at the closed door for a second and since there was nothing to see, my eyes returned to the center (normal position).  Then, to my surprise, the orange ball streaked back in the opposite direction (to my left going west to east) toward the bathroom window.  Again it went so fast that my eyes couldn’t follow it.  I looked to my left and it was gone. The incident shook me up.  I have to admit that I was frightened and shaking for a few minutes. I immediately went to the bathroom window and looked down and up.  There was no one down below, all the surrounding buildings were only one story, (so no one from another building could be playing a prank on me with a laser pointer), and there were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky above. I left the bathroom and looked around the apartment and noticed that all the the windows had the drapes closed.  I immediately ran outside the building and looked around.  No one was there.  I wanted to knock on doors and ask neighbors if they saw anything, but I stopped myself.  I would have made a fool out of myself. I calmed myself down,  I had a busy day of work ahead of me.  I tried to convince myself that I was just seeing things that weren’t really there (an optical illusion or a malfunction of my optic nerve, or brain).  But, the fact that the object came back and went the other way made me think it was real.  Still, to this very day I refuse to speculate on what it could have been.  The only thing I know for sure,is it did occur, and I try not to think about it.  I am only writing this down for my own notes about life.  About how things happen to people that can’t be explained. I had this same bazaar experience a few weeks later, while I was walking out of my bedroom  in the hall between the bathroom, bedrooms and living room.  The orange ball flashed by me at about shoulder height. I can’t remember the exact direction it came from, but I do remember it was a different direction than the event in the bathroom.  I don’t remember if it went in front of me and then came back the other way as it did in the bathroom.  It occurred at about the same time (around 10:00 AM).  The hall was dimly lit as all the drapes were closed.  I was the only one home.  I was startled but not as scared as the previous time.  I looked around inside and outside the apartment as and found no one or nothing out there. I even went to get my eyes checked after these experiences.  The doctor told me that a detached retina would be a blinding flash of white light over my entire visual field.  So this anomaly was not caused by a detached retina.  I don’t fantasize or make up stories to entertain myself so this was not the result of that.  In fact, I wish I had NOT experienced these events. Nevertheless, it did open my mind to the possibility that there are things going on around us that we may not be totally aware of. Nothing like this ever happened to me before or since then.  It has been more than ten years since I observed this anomaly.  I was too busy to write down what happened at that time and I really shouldn’t be taking the time to write about it now.  I didn’t want to scare my wife, so I didn’t tell her what happened until a month later.  I just wanted to know if she had encountered anything like this.  She told me she had not seen or heard anything unusual.  At first she thought I was joking, but when she realized I was serious, she became frightened.  I calmed her down by telling her since nothing bad had happened to us, there was nothing to worry about.  This experience, changed the way I look at the real world.  It made me ask myself many questions: •	What if the orange ball that flashed past me would have me hit me?  Would it have damaged my body?  What if it had already hit me on another occasion and I didn’t know it? •	Why did I see it?  (I do not believe I was chosen to see it, or there was a message to me in seeing it, I think it was just a random event) Why did it flash by and then come back the way it came?  Why did I experience this anomaly twice?  It is pointless to speculate on the causes of this anomaly, so I try to put it out of my mind, but something tells me I should record these events. •	Have other people encountered anything like this? •	What other things are going on that people observe, but dismiss them as illusions, or say to themselves, “What I just saw couldn’t have happened, so I must be seeing things.” Or people might think to themselves, “ It didn’t really happen, so I should just forget about it.  I better not tell anybody else about it, because they will think I am weird or crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My parents still tell a story about how when I was about to start 2nd grade during our family prayers I jumped up crying and hid in the closet in the room that me and my sister shared.  I told them that I was afraid to go to 2nd grade when in fact I was scared of what I had just seen out my window.  My bed was right next a large, nearly full wall window that faced our backyard in the room that I shared with my older sister.  My parents sat on the floor and my sister was in her bed and I was in mine. I remember being bored, per usual, and staring out the window when this...pyramid I suppose floated casually past the window.  It wasn't like any of the pyramid's I've looked up online.  I guess those are like black triangles with lights on their corners?  This was covered in little metallic/chrome-ish rectangles that were either silver or lighting up different colors.  I remember pinks and yellows and blues so nearly primary colors, but you could tell they were still metallic silver underneath.  It was weird and seemed to lazily float past.  It didn't seem to be propelled by anything and didn't seem to be in any sort of hurry. Ok and I get it, I was little could have just been my mind messing with me and I can't remember if it was four sided (feel like it was) or three because I only saw it in profile and in my memory it looks like it floated right between my house and the gazebo on our deck which is only about 25 feet or so, so there are clearly some missing pieces.  Also I remember it was completely silent.  The thing that has finally brought this up in my mind again after 15 years is that my brother is a sophomore in college now and lives in my house here and we were talking about random weird stuff that happened in our old house (which was a lot...I don’t know if that relates either) when he told me that when he'd been in about 2nd grade he'd been woken up two nights in a row by multi colored lights outside his window on the 2nd story but facing the street not the yard. He said he didn't see any object making them the 1st night because it'd been so bright but that the 2nd he'd seen a pyramid type object. I'd never told anyone about what I'd seen and neither had he till we had this conversation.  Now we just want to know if there’s anyone else who possibly has seen something like this because after looking it up forever and all over the internet I can’t find anything.

Living in a small canyon about five miles from and just out of sight of the Pacific coast, it wasn’t uncommon to see small planes flying over about five hundred feet up.  They were visible for about ten to fifteen seconds.  But without a sound this time, a flaming crop-duster appeared from over the ridge tumbling end over end about a second a turn toward the setting sun.  I called to my mother, ""Look out of you front sliding glass door, Mamma!""   She was too old & slow to see it while I described to her.  Before the object disappeared over the hill I saw the flames flicker out, but with the setting sun shining on it, very visibly was a huge coal black potato shaped, eyes and all, rock still tumbling at the same rate until it faded out of sight. I should’ve turned it in then, but better late than never.  Now I figure it came into our atmosphere keeping its course enough to flame until it passed on through.

After learning to track the moon as it moved rapidly across my field I started focusing on the surface.  I used the craters as the reference as where to focus.  After looking at the area on the periphery of the lighted portion of the moon (I used this because it seemed easier to actually see terrain distinctly and in focus). Almost immediately I noticed an object traveling North by North East (upper right direction as my vision would orientate.  It traveled in a precisely straight line for close to one minute.  During this time I tried to determine if this was a just a surface phenomenon or something on my lens.  I quickly determined that it had to be on the surface as it did not appear until I had complete focus on the surface craters and features. After I had established that fact, and continued following the object it stopped for a few seconds (I mention this only because it was a distinct period however short).  It then turned left (almost) 90 degrees to the left and traveled for another 5-10 seconds before stopping.  It remained at that position for well over a minute or so.  I followed it until the moon disappeared behind the trees and the house I lived in - Mountains of Colorado. I tried again in the back of the house (to bypass the blockage that the house and trees had presented) but was unable to establish exactly what or where the spot was. My observation was that the shadow did not elongate as a shadow would if it were to rise and fall on the landscape (because it was on the rising or setting light source).  It remained in clear focus during the entire time and also remained as a spot and did not become an elongated feature or blurred image.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,39.74054676258993,-105.26999208633094

In July of 1999, my ex-husband (at the time my fiancé), his father, and myself decided to take a fishing trip to a nearby lake. We packed up and left at about five in the afternoon and went to get bait and snacks, then proceeded to our favorite fishing spot. When we got there we unpacked and walked over to a culvert and sat down. My ex was on my left, his father on my right, leaving me in the middle. The fish were biting good until around dusk. Then suddenly it got real weird. The birds stopped chirping, the crickets and frogs were quiet, and the fish stopped biting.  My ex’s father looked at his watch and it was a little past 7 pm. Suddenly from the left side of the lake from behind the trees we ALL saw a bright huge ball of orange light. There was only the one ball of light.  It was about 200 feet off the water moving really REALLY slow. It kept at a steady pace though. It was not quite in the middle of the lake but at times seemed more towards us and at other times more towards the other bank.  I could see the reflection of it off the lake also. It light up the area around it but nothing more. It was like it got a little brighter in the area. The other thing that I noticed was it didn’t make one single sound. Nothing, not even a low rumble. I remember thinking why isn’t this thing making any noise also. The air got really thick as well. It was like it was slightly harder to breathe but there wasn’t any smell in the air either. The other bank I would guess is only about a football field length away at the point we were at. On the other side of the lake are mountains that go straight up.  It kept going until it was a little past my ex’s father and then made a sharp hook and came back the way it came. I jumped up and watched it slowly go back the way it came until it disappeared behind the tree line on my left side. When I looked back at my ex’s father, we all noticed at the same time that it was very VERY dark out. My ex’s father looked at his watch and noticed that it was well past 9 pm. It seemed to only take a few minutes for the thing to move across the lake and back. I freaked out and was really scared and couldn’t figure out where all the time went to. We packed up quickly and ran to the car. We threw our things in the trunk and I sped back to our house. I remember both on the ride home and when we got in the house talking about what we saw. We all agreed that we saw the same thing but we couldn’t agree on the color. I KNOW I say orange but my ex’s father is insistent that he saw a big white ball. Needless to say even though I am remarried, to this day, I REFUSE to go back to that spot. I have never told anyone but very FEW personal friends what I saw that night and I know to this day it did NOT take two hours for that thing to move across the lake like that!!

I was at Prospect Park in Altoona with a friend of mine to hang out.  It was early in the evening. We started walking through the park and decided to play around.  We got started getting rough and wrestling around.   He was holding me down when I happened to look up.  He was facing the opposite direction I was, when I saw an object in the air pretty low.  It was too low to be a plan or such. I knew it wasn't a satellite either.  After a couple seconds of looking and focusing it became clearer. It was a round saucer that looked silver at first until it started giving off a glow of white light.  I immediately tried to get my friends attention. I yelled his name, he proceeded in trying to hold me down, I yelled it again and got his attention. I told him to look where I was pointing. He had something in his eye, he took a second to clear it up while I was yelling look!  look!  He finally looked up. But couldn't see it at first for a moment. I was looking at it the whole time.  It was going a little slow at first as it was when I first seen it.  It was heading over our direction over us.  It kept the same level the whole time in the air.  My friend finally caught it and was watching to as it just started to go faster.  At that point it was only visible as it was going faster until it took a tremendous increase in speed and just warped into disappearing into the distance.  My friend saw it at the last moment, but however he did seen it for the 15 seconds he did.  I don't know if we were the only ones to see it in the area.  Another one of my friends was walking by the park fence moments after the sighting happened.  I had told her what we just seen. She said that she believed me, but I don't know.  I have told a very limited number of people about this. I don't care who believes me or who doesn't.  The fact is, I know what I seen.  I have photographic memory and remember ever detail.

Her older brother was to be meeting us at Outback with his girlfriend to celebrate my friend having been released for one of what we though to be her final two week breaks before she was to be cleared for being in remission for the cancer she had been suffering with for the last year. We all gathered and had a wonderful time at dinner, and when we decided to leave we had to sit much longer than expected because the battery in my friends parents’ van had died. Her brother helped jump start the battery and her dad was to take the brother and his girlfriend home for some reason I can’t remember. Well, this left myself, my friend, and her deaf mother to go together back to our home in a different city (about thirty minutes away), since my friend was to be spending the night with me that night. Finally we got on the road and about ten to twelve minutes after we got on the freeway Amy and I saw an odd light out of the corner of our eyes and both looked up to see what it was. We both saw what looked to be an oval-shaped ring of various colors (pink, green, blue, orange, yellow, purple, and white) that was titled at an angle and seemed to be spinning counter-clockwise. It was dormant in the sky, staying in one place and not moving. Suddenly it began, very slowly, to move in a ‘cross’ pattern (up, down, up, left, right, down). We weren’t the only one who noticed because we saw people sticking pointed fingers from their cars and honking their horns. Finally, it seemed to just lower behind the mountains we were headed towards and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date above, to reflect a date in ""Fall 2006.""

The aircraft was approximately 20-30 minutes south of Sacramento. i was sitting in the window seat on the left side (facing forward) of the aircraft looking out the window trying to pass the time. i often have my nose glued to the window looking out during flights so it's not unusual  or random that i was gazing out the window at that particular moment. i observed the first sphere traveling above the ground heading south westish (based on the assumption that we were indeed traveling North). it was very difficult to determine speed and size of each sphere because I was tra! veling in the airplane. the airplane i was in was traveling about 10-12K feet, or however high those airplanes fly during travel(horizon airlines). we were at cruising altitude, that is, we never appeared to go any higher than that for hours at a time, and only descended for landing. The first sphere was like a ball of light, likely emitting light rather than reflecting (although if this ball was chrome or mirrored as was the second, it COULD also have been simply reflecting sunlight). since it never lost its brilliance, i assume it was emitting light rather than reflecting. i got the brief impression that it was lite-green in color.  this sphere was farthur from my eyes and closer towards the earths surface so i could observe it for about 6 seconds before it flew out of line of sight from my little window. i was taken by slight surprise by this because it was the first one and moderately gained my attention. it seemed to be traveling quickly, faster than the cars traveling nearby. i would approximate the size of this one to be slightly larger than a minivan. if one were to crush a short school bus into a sphere that would be about the size, approximately. again very hard to determine considering that i was in a moving airplane at about 10K feet. Continuing to stare out the window, i was eager to see it again. between this sighting and the next i could see a small small recreation/agriculture airplane and make out the fusalage from the wings. so i'm very confident that this first object (along with the subsequent 2) was a perfect sphere, not birds or planes. and i'm very confident that the first object was in motion. so after a brief minute or two another one flew by, this time it was headed directly in the direction we had come from. this second sphere was what really got me intruiged, this one appeared to be less than 300 ft away from the aircraft. Way close! it traveled at the same altitude, didn't go up or down, it was traveling in a straight line directly south.  this sphere was definately chrome in color, about the size of a minivan. it was very hard to determine if it was just floating there or traveling rather slowly. if it was floating in place and the airplane passed over it (not directly because i could st! ill see it from the windows on the side of the plane) it would appear to the observer to be moving. so it's difficult for me to determine if it was moving in a straight line south or whether it was simply floating. i asked several people in front and behind my seat (same seating oreintation) if they ""saw that?"". i was frustrated that they hadn't and I had caused a minor disturbance on the plane because i was frustrated that nobody was looking out the window because they would have also seen it. i was mad that they missed this event because they had their face in a book. i was essentially trying to find another witness but nobody else claimed they saw it. accepting that this was likely to be a personal experience i let it go and continued to press my nose against the window.  several minutes later i spotted the final and most distant sphere. this was bright in color, no hints of green, only white, bright white. this one was traveling West, of the three seperate objects, this one appeared to be closest to the ground.  upon landing, i found a pilot sitting in the small Sacramento Airport that we were awaiting our flight transfer at. i asked him if he knew what a chrome colored sphere shaped object would be doing in the air? he immediately suggested a balloon and i was disappointed at the thought that a balloon makes sense. weather balloon or party balloon. so i then asked him how many balloons he has seen in the air during his career (excluding hot air balloon), he responded with zero balloons. i described our flight path and he said, ""aah, yes i just flew on that flight"". unspecific to whether he was pilot or co-pilot, i will never forget his face, broad jaw like Elvis, i could spot him anywhere. he also admitted to having not seen the objects (or at least the up close chrome ball) for himself. i was the sole witness.  3 spheres, one at a time, first one was lite-greenish headed opposite direction of plane, the second was way close and i got a very good look at it for the breif 2 seconds it was in sight. my eyes were able to lock on and focus on it before it dissappeared out of my line of sight, it was traveling in roughly the same direction as the first. and the third was faint, bright white and headed westward towards Pacific ocean. i have seen footage of an identical chrome sphere in a ufo clip filmed in Ventura California. i had always been intruiged by ufo's but after this sighting of mine i became very interested for approx 7 months before i was satisfied and no longer interested in persueing clips online or reading such books. i was 20 yrs old. I have a difficult time believing that it (second Chrome sphere) was a balloon, a little girl would have to run into a random farm field and release it. im not sure if balloons remain inflated at that altitude. NOAA uses whether balloons that look very very similar to it, but i doubt that NOAA would release such a balloon in a flight path especially considering that they are aware of wind direction and speed, if this was a whether balloon, it definately posed a danger to the propellers. too close for comfort.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,38.39446941580756,-121.37185910652921

I have been observing similar lights over the last two years in this area.  The lights have the ability to emulate small aircraft navigation/strobe lights (green/white and red).  When they are no longer visable from cockpit crews the lights return to their normal blury red/white strobe pattern.  I have never observed these lights mess with any commercial or conventional aircraft.

The four lights are 1000-1500 feet apart two lead center with wing men trailing outside and Aprox. 500 AGL over Lake Mead.  The four lights have returned to red/white light pattern as the commercial flight passed overhead.  The Pilot/First officer probably requested a verification from Nellis AFB if they were painting any other aircraft in the area.   Whatever the communication, the four lights went from their position and elevation to the commercial flights elevation/airspeed/position in Aprox. 3-5 seconds and climbed out with them.  One lead light 500 meters off Captain's left window, second lead light 1000 meters off Co-pilots right window with the wing men lights 1000 meters from leaders and off commercial flights wing tips.

It was a slower day and I was parking a vehicle behind the hotel in the parking lot.  As I was walking I was looking up across the top of the hotel for a hawk that usually picks off pigeons and stuff.  I then noticed an object, not directly above the hotel, but from my line of sight I can surmount that it was just a little bit further out over the city.  The first thing that popped in my mind was that it looked as if someone had placed a black gumdrop in the sky.  I am a college student and I know what things are, this was no helicopter or anything that could have been produced with our current technology.  It was clear as day right before my eyes, almost as if I could reach out and grab it.  I attempted to take a picture with my phone but could not get a distinguishable shot.  From what I could see there were no openings, lights, windows, or protrusions of any kind; just a solid be! ll/gumdrop shaped object.  There were cirrus clouds that day so I was able to gauge if it was moving, it wasn't.  I watched it for about 3-5 minutes then I ran inside, down to the maintenance room to see if the engineering guys had any binoculars.  There weren't any so I ran back up to the front to see if any guests had arrived, everything was clear so I immediately ran to the back again because the sun and trees obscured my vision in the front.  When I got back, I searched for it and was able to find it again, still there not moving.  Total time elapsed so far would of been about 8 minutes.  I watched it for another 2 or so minutes until I was interrupted by my radio that a guest needed assistance in the front.  When I was done with that I ran back again only to find nothing there that time.  I waited for a few minutes watching the sky around me but could not find it.  When this was over I went back to the front and about ten minutes later I noticed a very high altitude je! t going over, heading roughly north to south.  Then after that! one had passed, about 5 minutes later, another high altitude jet flew south to north.

He spoke in a strange accent(even though his english was perfect), the way it came out sounded very monotone and far away.  He didn't turn away from his magazine and wouldn't look me in the eyes, which I also found strange.  I will tell you this, as a person who is experianced in meditation and telepathy, the man gave off a very strange, unearthly energy that I cannot describe.  I felt hypnotized by his words.  I couldn't read anything from him except th! at I felt as if I was pulled in by his strange energy.  He told me that he wasn't from here and couldn't help me.

I told ((woman's name deleted)) about it and she insisted that she speak with him herself as her psychic powers are natural and mine are more developed.

A few nights ago I was in my front lawn around between 2am and 4am smoking. I was gazing into the sky and saw what looked like a very bright star. I knew it could not be a star because it was so close and the color of the sun. I went online to see if there were suppose to be any visible planets that night, which it said there was so I figured it was a planet. Last night July 12 2009 at 4am I was outside again and saw the same star object in the same place so I assumed again it was a planet in the eastern sky. What caught my attention this time as I was gazing at the planet/star it was moving. I was startled and confused to what I was seeing. It was the same object as I saw before a few weeks ago round bright orange and kind and a lower point to it but not exactly sure, but this time i saw it kind of swaying back and forth. This time I knew what I was seeing was not a planet or star and was not a helicopter because it was way to big to be one. My step dad was here asleep and I decided to wake him thinking maybe he should take a look at this. I woke him and had him follow me outside to show him what I was seeing and it was gone! I told myself planets do not disappear in five minutes and they do not sway back and forth. The night was a clear night, no sign of clouds and this sighting was over a highly populated city. Now that I have seen this object twice I am going to set up a video camera and hopefully will get the chance to get this object on camera.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

The neighbors were not keen on the dog as he was a pitbull therefore I put the food out in the wee a.m. hours.  As I was coming back in the house/front door, a light caught my eye to the NW horizon over the cul de sac.  I stopped with my jaw dropped and just stood there to take it in.  I said to myself I am witnessing a close up view of a UFO so I better take this in as I knews it was most likely a once in a life time exp.  It was VERY close, very large and actually just sitting, as parked in the sky. It was actaully quite beautiful, one large craft-appeared to be 3 stories and I know this will sound weird, but it was like somoene had taken the top tier of an office building and parked it in the sky..it had windows...much like you see when you look up at a highrise office building.  It was all lite up with bright white lights-penetrating...as I said quite beauti! ful to take in.  It just sat there and did not move, the back drop was nothing but the black sky...it looked so close that I was tempted to walk towards it to the culdesac to get closer, that is when as I was standing at my front door got a bit spooked and thought I should go in.  I wanted to wake a neighbor to witness but it was the middle of the night thru the week, school-work, and I thought to go upstairs and get my camera, but the batteries are always weak and thought it will be gone when I return...so I went inside, looked out the window and it was still sitting there...then I went back to bed....stupid!!! So wish I had stayed to see it move, but as I mentioned I had taken it in , in great detail, no one to share it with and didn't want to stay outside any longer by myself.  I didn't tell any neighbors lest they think I was crazy, and really my prioirty at the time was attempting to rescue the dog (which was a succuss a few days later).  I did share the sighting with ! my immediate family and my best friend and then just filed it ! away as I have never known who to report it to that was reputable and where I could remain annonymus...so it is almost exactly a year later and on my mind I googled and found your site.  I hope this is a reputable site.  I can tell you I have watched, googled many sighting shows etc. since my siting and I have yet to run across anything that was as large and close with such a clear view of what I witnessed.  I would love to be able to share more details of my sighting to the appropriate personnel.  It was quite amazing, astonishing and etched in my momeory.  Oh, one other note...a couple of days later I drove behind our neighborhood to where I thought approx. it was sitting in the sky, 1/4 of a mile no more and it was over desolate wetlands...nothing around where it would have been in the sky....thought that was interesting.

I will be honest, I had a couple to drink, but two of the other three were sober. I was staring into the west night sky when I saw a very dark shape with two lights in the front section, which were solid spots, and two whitish, almost rope light lights on the tail this thing flew completely silent. I sat up and said ""holy sh!t a UFO!!"" my cousins turned around and looked into the sky, as they saw it, we all stood up and were hysterical over the occurance. My cousins and I all saw the same thing, and it seemed like it was a triangle shape. As I was watching it fly from the SW to the NE, I attempted to take a picture with my phone. I looked at the phone to find out the screen was black. I watched it fly over a line of trees and disappear from my sight, and my cousins turned toward me and each other and asked ""where did it go?"" I told them it went behind the trees, so we moved about 20 feet to be able to see it again, but it was to no avail.

I was sitting at the top of my stairs at my apartment. (Let me just say a week and a half ago I saw the same thing around 4 in the morning, I told my mom about what I say but she did not believe me. It was a very bright light, white bright light and had a small red light above it moving around, it was be there than vanish than come back.) Anyways back to last night. So I saw something moving in the sky when I looked up. The way it was turning was so quickly and smoothly that there was no way it could be a plane or a helicopter. It made no sound at all. It had 2 blue lights and one red light. I screamed for my mom and she came running out of her room to where I was, I looked up at the object, oh yeah and I couldn't make out the shape because the lights were too bright and it was still a little too dark, anyways, my mom got over there and at this point it was just flying straight and looked pretty normal. My mom was like you called me out here to look at a plane in the sky. I didn't say anything and we both kept staring at it. All of the sudden it started moving up and down like it would drop 100 feet and than go back up again way to smoothly and easily to be anything like a helicopter or plane, it was turn very quickly also, like it'd be going in one direction and in a split second it'd be going the opposite way. Me and my mom were speechless. I looked at her and asked her to explain what that could possibly be and she just laughed. She did not have any idea what that could possibly be. She started nervously laughing. We watched it for another 5 minutes and it started flying away towards the west and all of sudden it completely vanished. About 2 seconds later it showed up in a completely different part of the sky. So it vanished and than popped up on the opposite side of where it vanished. IMPOSSIBLE thing for a plane or helicopter to do. My mom looked at me and was like how in the world could it d! o that. We stayed out there for about 10 minutes watching this thing vanish and come back and do turns and smooth flips making no sounds. Than one of our neighbors came out who lives below me. He looked up and me and my mom staring into the sky and was like what are you guys looking at. We didn't say anything so he looked up in the direction we were looking at. He was like Oh a plane. The object was again flying straight so looked kinda normal. Than it started doing those 180 turns and going up and down the guy stared at it and pulled out his camera phone and was freaking out. He tried to take a picture but of course it didn't come out good. Being a cell phone camera. I can't even take picture of a full moon on my camera phone. Anyways. It started getting far away and vanished behind trees. The guy ran out into the parking lot on the phone telling his friends what he saw looking for it. My mom still didn't know what to say, and I went inside to call friend and tell her. I came back out and my mom was still staring in the sky, I looked up and the object was gone but now smaller lights that were further away began to pop up in the sky. They were sparkly to the point where they looked like they were on fire. Again with red and blue lights around them. I don't know what this was. It was DEFINITELY not a plane or helicopter or jet or anything like that because those can't vanish and pop back into the sky or morph around like that.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,33.247651756440284,-117.33448852459017

Wobbles and tracks across the sky for hours.  Been watching it for 2 weeks now. My wife and I have noticed a bright white light in the southeastern sky almost every night for the past 2 weeks.  It is low in the sky.  From my second story bedroom it appears just above the tree line.  The trees are about 20-25 feet off the ground.  Not every single night but probably 60-70% of the time.  It appears around 11pm-12pm and appears as a bright light.  At first, I thought it was a bright star but as we studied it, it appears to wobble, move up and down and side to side.  I am a very novice star watcher but I am not aware of a bright star in the low southeastern sky.  This all happens as it hangs in the sky basically in the same location for long periods of time – hours.  I watched it until 3am a few times before going to sleep. I started watching it again last night.  I picked a land based reference point and watched its movement across the sky. Over a 45 minute period it moved very slowly across and higher in the sky appearing to stop along the way and continuing to wobble. The movement was very subtle but it is definitely moving – miles – very noticeable distances over the 45 minutes.  I can’t estimate the distance because it is so far away.  I have been thinking it is a star but based on my limited experience, stars don’t track across the sky this fast (based on the Earth’s rotation) It is not like watching a constellation like Orion or anything like that.  Also, it appears much closer than a star.  It is above the cloud deck but appears to be well within the atmosphere. My wife thinks it’s a satellite but again, based on my experience; it seems much closer and again does not move like the satellites I have observed crossing the night sky.  It appears in almost the exact same spot every night we see it.  Not sure what it is but it definitely is something we have not seen before.  We have been living in this location for almost 8 years now and I have been observing the sky out my bedroom windows at night for years now.  It’s something that I have never seen before.

It then moved slowly to the left and then came towards us at a high rate of speed and changed direction again and disappeared behind the roof of the house next door. We moved back to try and find the light again but it seemed to be gone. I have seen strange lights before but they had always turned out to be a plane or some kind of aircraft.

My husband and I were in the Sierra Nevada Mts between Lake Tahoe and Grass Valley California.  It was about midnight and we were walking on the top of a mountain when suddenly there came a noise that sounded somewhat like a very loud generator engine.  Doug and I discussed the possible origin of the noise, concluding that there were no buildings within two miles. The noise became louder and louder as I looked into the sky to see a circular object just above the tree tops (probably 60-80 feet).   We never saw the top of the craft, but clearly saw six bright white circular lights shining from it's bottom surface and it was probably fifty feet in diameter .	The craft hovered above us for less than one minute and during that time Doug and I both ran downhill as quickly as we could.  I was not watching the craft as it departed, but did hear the noise end as quickly as it had started just about two to three minutes earlier.

A spec. 4 and I were on guard duty sitting in a 5-ton truck at the guard entrance in the desert.  There were other brass (officers) standing around with their jeeps parked in the area.  I remember her eating some raw onions and I was questioning her.  I decided to role down my window some more and saw a very large dark object from afar slowly moving towards the back of the truck.  i saw it in my side view mirror. it was not a sand storm. I saw other people turn their heads towars the object and told the spec 4 to look in her mirror. when it got over top the truck, it seemed like it was so close that if there was a building in the way, it might have knocked it over.  I looked forward and could see the light of the horizon, but I could no longer see any horizon on the sides of us.  but then when the object was completely over all of us, our area became pitched dark.  the spec 4 started to hollar for jesus and I told her to lock all of the doors and roll up the windows.  I did not hear any noise.  We turned on our flashlights and there was no reflection on the flashlight or our headlights or anybody elses headlights.  i could only see the circle of light from the flashlight, but it could not shine on anything. we could not start our engine. It seemed like a very long time, almost like a half hour.  I knew that it happened about 1500 hours because i could not wait to go off duty at 1600 hours.  I remember telling the spec 4 to be very quiet.  I was calm, but nervous.  It seemed like a real long time, but it was only about 3-5 minutes when i looked at my watch again.  I am not sure if my watch stopped during that time or not, but it was a few minutes after 3pm, then i looked in my side view mirror because I saw a glimmer of light.  I could see the horizon behind the truck,come back again and then I could see the sides of outside light again.  I could not see the top of the object, only part of the underside which was very flat. ! It seeme d like the object was a mile wide because I could not tell how big it was.  Looking at the beginning edge moving over us, it had a slight bend like a spherical shape.  The color looked like dark copper underneath the object. It looked kind of rigidy like symbols too.  The object was moving at a very slow pace over us. I rarely talk about it.  I had always wondered if anyone else ever spoke of it in the blogs, but I just learned about using blogs this year.  It was only one mothership of an object.  Afterwards, one of the brass (officers) approached us and was just as baffled as we were about the object.  He said that if he wrote home about it no one would belive him anyway.  I agreed. I did not want anyone to think I was bananas too.  Okay, that's it.

On the above date and time approximately, I and two of my cousins', one female and one male.  We were returning home to Oglala, South Dakota from Rapid City, South Dakota.  My female cousin was in the front with me and my male cousin was in the back seat. We were driving in a newer model Geo Metro, only about two years old or newer.  About a two or three miles before we got to the junction to start making our south on the tribal road that we were traveling on.  We were traveling through the Badlands on the north-west side of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota coming from the town of Red Shirt Table.  This road is part of the Ellsworth Airforce Bomber Training Run(B1-Bombers and Stealths?). We hear them but when you look they are already gone. They are fast and loud. Anyway, about a few miles before we got to the junction, the radio on the car started to fade in and out, it was weird because the car was new and had was inn great mechanical condition. The needldes on the dash started going all over, like the gas gage looking when the tank was three-quarters full. The motor started to act weird to, like stuttering or startling. The car seemed like it was in the wrong gear and was lugging. I tried to put it in a lower gear and give it gas. But nothing happened. I looked at the radio and the clock read a few minutes before 17:00. Then, that went off too. It was scary, and I tried not to panick as my cousins' were a year or two younger than we, I felt responsible for them as we were out in the middle of nowhere. I tried to stay as calm as I could. It got really bright inside the car. I could see the fibers of the carpet in the car. I could see the dust in the car moving in the air of the car. Things started to go in slow-motion then. Things started to move really slow in the car. I could hear myself breathing, and feel my pulse. We seemed to sort of float or leave the ground. I looked over at my female cousin in the passenger seat and she was screaming to me to go and she was hitting the dash. I looked back at my male cousin and he had his head between his knees' and was screaming too. He was grabbing my shoulder and trying to shake me. It seems like we were playing on slow-motion, time was slow. Then, finally, it seemed like a few seconds later the car slammed down on the road and started back up. It went back into gear, a lower gear and the motor revved up really high. The headlights came back on and so did the radio. I could hear my cousins' now screaming and crying irradically for me to go. The were scared and so was I. It felt like we went over a big bump in the road, because we bounced really hard. I got control on the car and put it into third gear. We picked up speed really quick like we were going that fast already. I just happened to glance at the clock and the one on the radio said 20:30. The radio came on really loud, the light was still above us. I tried to slow down to see what was going on. My cousins' were screaming for me not to stop. The were screaming at me to go fast. I looked up on my side of the window to see what was up there and it hovered above us and kept our speed. The light was so bright, I could see the weeds in the ditch plain as day. Then, just as quickly as it all begin the light went ahead of us about twenty feet and took off, really fast. It was gone. That was a whole hour and a half that was missing, as I kept telling my cousins' to remember the time. They just kept crying and were not talking to me. I was scared and I have never spoken to anyone about this except to my cousins' who get scared when I even mention what happened. I have been having dreams' and weird nightmares'. My female cousin refuses to tell me if she has the same thing going, and my male cousin will not listen to any talk at all about this. They get this look in their eyes' and they actually stand differently body language-wise. We have had people on the reservation talk about these lights' and things that race those bombers' and those other planes' that fly out there. These jets', bombers, and etc. make their runs at all hours of the day and night. People have experienced things' and seen things' out there in the middle of nowhere. Alot of them refuse to talk about what they have experienced or seen, for fear or rejection or ridicule. I need to talk to this as it is a part of my PTSD(post-tramatic stress disorder) I need to tell somebody and get this out of my head. It feels like somebody is always' watching me, I asked my cousins' and they say the same thing too. That is one of the reasons' that they are afraid to say anything. I'm not afraid, whatever happened changed me and changed my physical body and how I handle diseases, sicknesses, and etc. My cousins' are the same about this too. We feel watched. A few weeks before this about ten miles out of Rapid City I had car trouble, and I saw a big triangle. It was shiny,like gun metal. I thought it was one thing, but another one split off of it and they were floating or hovering or something. They were headed north towards' Rapid City. They came out of the Black Hills' from the west heading towards' were I was in a easterly direction before the turned north. The were quiet, really quiet. I never talked about this either until what had happened to me and my cousins' in the Badlands'. Again, I have never spoken to anyone except my cousins' about all of this. Out of fear that I'm being watched or listened to. I don't know maybe I'm just paranoid about all this. But thanks for your time. With respect. Thank you reading this.

Approximately 200 yards away, and no more than 1500 feet above us a very large, almost intimidating triangular shaped object emerged from above the tree line of the woods behind our home.  In a methodical and gradual fashion the object passed over us, stopping momentarily directly above us, and then erupting in silent force took off at an incomprehendable speed and vanished into the sky rapidly climbing in altitude.  The object must have been between 80 and 100 yards long, and at its widest point near its base between 60 and 80 yards proportionally.  It's base, which we saw, was illuminated with 9 orange lights which were bright but unabrasive, and were in a 4-3-2-1 pattern from the base to the tip.  The corners of the object were rounded and appeared glossy or metallic in material.  The sighting occured around 7:00pm on a very clear evening on a dark and rural street. After it dissapeared, my father simply looked at me and said, ""it's the not the first time you'll see one around here, so get used to it, but don't tell anyone, they will all think you're crazy.""

Although I am a firm believer in the UFO phenomenon I tend to NOT discuss it with the ""average Joe"". Ok here goes. It was 10/31/99 approximately 6:45 PM I was taking (my then 5 year old daughter) to her aunts to meet up with my wife (her mom) so she and her cousins could all go trick or treating together. We hopped in our Plymouth POS. and headed for my sister in laws house, at about 7:00 PM we where just about 5 miles from her house when we crested this small hill running between two very large corn fields, as we peeked the top and headed down the other side our car stalled, now I must inform you that our car had a tendency to overheat OFTEN so this was nothing new to me so I threw the car into neutral and let it coast down the hill until we came to a gentle stop at the bottom. Once we stopped I got out of the car and opened the hood as to release some of the heat, it was a cool night so I decided to light up smoke and wait my daughter was asleep in her car seat in the back and I never smoked near my children so it was kind of a perfect situation for a smoke. As usual as soon as I lit up it started to rain (not a heavy rain but a light sprinkle) but enough to send me into a retreat into my car so I threw away my cigarette and as I grabbed the door handle the rain stopped and I remember feeling aggravated and thinking dam I just threw my smoke away and that’s when I realized it was still raining, I could hear it raining all around me then I came to realize also that it WASN'T raining on me or my car that’s when I looked up. To my utter shock and surprise there above my head was this absolutely huge... how else can I say it UFO it was triangular shaped but not a normal triangle shape the sides of the triangle were curved and I could also see some detail, for instance the bottom (that was really the only side I could see) I saw curved indentations and grooves cut into the surface but the weirdest thing was that nothing appeared to be uniform it all appeared to be random if that’s the word I can use, and there was NO SOUND none at all man it was really strange that it was totally silent just sitting there in the sky motionless and that coupled with the fact that it was raining all around me but not on me I’m getting goose bumps remembering all this as I’m typing this. As if all this wasn’t enough, while I was standing there taking all this in a light turned on and shown down on top of my car that’s when my daughter woke up she called out to me and I got in the car, once in the car I instinctively locked all the doors then I noticed that this light that was shining down into my car was shinning everywhere, now when I say this I MEAN IT WAS SHINING EVERYWHERE it was like looking at a negative...everything my daughter, the seats, the dash, everything was like looking at a photographic negative it was so very strange and just as quickly as it came the light was gone I quickly rolled down the window of the car and looked up and this huge object floated away to my left ( I’m not quite sure of the exact direction ) north I think, and there was absolutely no sound, once it was over the cornfield the light shown down again this time illuminating a rabbit that was out in the field, the rabbit started to run the beam followed it for a short time then it turned off again. I slowly got back out of the car I was standing there for just a second and then it left so fast I almost couldn't determine what direction it went, I mean it was just gone and not a sound not even a peep to this day I have dreams about this incident and I have even talked to my daughter about it she says she remembers something but I think she just humoring me she was just to young to remember but I appreciate what she’s trying to do. Well that’s my story I have other sightings but none as dramatic as this one thanks for reading this.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,42.5348,-73.5937

I’ve never really been compelled to write or talk to anyone about it, since nobody else saw it, nor would they take it for truth. It didn’t have any fancy lights, no sounds, and nothing was really extraordinary about it.  I’ve read a lot of reports of sightings and seen a lot of videos of people who have apparently filmed UFOs, and they all seem really exciting.  My sighting wasn’t very spectacular, but nonetheless, I know what I saw. I was 15 years old at the time, and we were on our way home, heading west from Havre, MT.  We were driving in an extended cab pickup on US Hwy 2.  It was a wonderful summer night.   I can’t remember the exact date, but I do remember it was during the summertime.  It was warm outside and the stars were all shining brightly, but unfortunately there was no moon.   I was sitting in the backseat with my mom (whom was sleeping), and my sister and brother in law were up front; my brother in law doing the driving.  Everyone was quiet and we were listening to the radio, but I’m not sure what was playing at the time   At some point, I had gotten tired of watching the boring road ahead of us and decided to look out the back window at the stars.  The stars were really bright, since we were in the middle of nowhere and it was such a clear night anyway.  We had just passed Joplin, MT and it was about 10pm or so when I saw it.  It was moving slowly about 20 feet from the ground and on an interception course with our pickup.  It was heading SW.   As we were traveling there was a light nearby next to a radio tower and between us and the tower, the UFO moved past the tower, becoming invisible as it passed by the light.  It made its way, silently, across the highway behind us.  I could barely make out what it looked like.  It was definitely pyramidal in shape, as I could see it from the side.  It looked black in the night sky, but when it passed the light, it was invisible.   When I first saw it, it seemed like my eyes were playing tricks on me, until it passed across the road.  It happened so fast, I didn’t even know what I saw until after it had disappeared into the night.  None of my family believed me!  That partly discouraged me from telling anyone else.  The duration of the sighting also discouraged me. Like I said, it was completely silent, nearly invisible, flying slowly (same speed as we were driving), partly moving in tune with our direction, keeping up with our vehicle for a short time. I never saw anything like it again, but wished I had.  Ever since that sighting, I have been interested in other people’s UFO sightings.  Unfortunately, I haven’t seen many convincing videos or convincing stories.  I’m sure a lot of people make up sightings for fun, however, I know what I saw, and it is the truth.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,,

We were both looking  at about ""10-10:30 o’clock"" out over Long Island Sound and simultaneously we caught sight of a very fast moving light that blinked and zigzagged and then disappeared.  It was probably in our visual field for no more than 3 seconds.  It was quite out of the ordinary and we both commented on it at the same time.

The fireworks are set off in a field located behind and to the left ( if you are facing the front of the school) of the local high school, and to the right of the middle school and were slated to start at 9:30 PM, but in the end were not set of until around 9:45.   My family and I decided to take seat in the field which is across the street located in front of the high school to view the evenings display.  There were many people around us.  Just to include some background info, they had already set of several ""test"" fireworks at around 9:15 PM.  Again these fireworks, when viewed from our orientation, were located behind and to the left of the high school. As we were waiting for the display to begin, at around 9:25, I was looking at the sky and noticed a red, circular object, with a kind of haze around the outside edges.  It lined up with the left corner of the high school, however much farther south than the school was, and was just floating there.   I alerted my husband and sister to the object (my son is 2 and took no interest), and it began to move in an east to west direction, but could also have been moving away in an east to south-west direction.  From our viewpoint it seemed to travel the length of the school (east to west).  It was also slowly climbing in altitude, which quickly made us realize this was not a flare.   The object also seemed to be pulsating, as in the light would grow smaller, get bigger, and grow smaller again,but was not blinking.   Once it reached about the middle of the high school, as it was climbing very slowly in altitude it began to disappear. It would flicker out, then reappear and flicker out.  It did this very slowly.  Eventually, it either shrunk and disappeared or flew so far that the light was no longer visible.  This object was visible for between one and two minutes.    I have tried to calculate the distance away and altitude just now, but find it hard to triangulate it without going back to the site and using proper tools, less I give and improper estimate. After viewing the object, we were all puzzled as to what it could be.  There were people behind us whom I know noticed it, and were confused also because I heard them saying, ""What in the world is that?""   We did not discuss the matter with them, however.   This object was in no way a plane, helicopter, flare, or firework.  It moved too slowly to be a plane or helicopter, and was like no fire work I have ever seen.   It also did not originate from the area where the fireworks were being set off at, and it went in a direction against the wind.  I am able to remember this because the fireworks were being blown toward us to the north, and the object was moving to the west.  The object seemed to just appear all the sudden, also. I would have though it was possibly a flare, being happy to arrive at a known solution; however it traveled in a direction, and lasted an amount of time uncommon for a flare.  Usually a flare will still be lit after it travels upward and begins to fall to the ground. This object at no time fell in altitude, it rose. I have seen flares before, and this was not a flare.   I am at a loss as to what this object was, and it has bothered me since.   I hope this report was of service, and if there are any further questions, feel free to contact me.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,39.7559,-77.5778

We gathered together in front of the large cross right before midnight and both said some kind of prayer and set intentions for ourselves, others and the world for this next year.  We gathered together all of our negative energy and offered it up with appreciation for all the wisdom we gained from its challenges.  As soon as we offered them up towards the sky, we instantly noticed 3 Bright Circular Red Beacons in a triangular shape in the sky slightly north of our position on the hill.  They were just floating without any sound whatsoever and the light remained constant.  My friend said he noticed some flickering of another color (possibly green and red) as he zoomed in with his digital camera but I did not notice this nor was this apparent to the naked eye.  We thought! they might be helicopters at first but they seemed way too high, stationary, mute and close together to be so.  After a couple minutes or so, they began to slowly float directly above our location and then slightly past.  Their triangular shape began to grow smaller as the Beacons moved closer to each other.  Then, at approx. 12:15am, one Beacon began to move off in the distance towards Downtown SD and the waterfront.  The light eventually disappeared in the distance - again, no sound, no other blinking lights and very high up in the sky (nothing like a helicopter).  The other remained for about 2-3 more minutes.  Then they both began to fade as they seemed to travel farther and farther away from the surface of the earth.  By this time, the lights were in between the constellation Orion and the Blue Moon.  The lights, according to our best observations, did not simply dim and shut off but actually ""flew"" or floated farther and farther away from Earth until they finally dis! appeared from our view amongst the stars.  We did not see any addition al sightings afterwards.  We have short video clips from a Digital Camera of the lights throughout various times while they were present.  I am not sure what they were, but they were not frightening at all.  We both felt it was somewhat of a sign or response to our prayers for guidance that we started the night off with.

This UFO (meaning Unidentified Flying Object) sighting occurred in the four-year interval starting mid-year 1952 to mid-year 1956. I was 16 to 20  years old at the time.  I am now 73.  The observation occurred in Pasadena, CA. My mother was working  in her garden behind our house in mid-afternoon on a beautiful sunny day.  There were no clouds, the sky was blue, and there were no winds.  She called me to come out of the house because there was something in the sky she wanted me to see.  Her voice was urgent. According to my mother (now deceased), the Unidentified Flying Object was heading South, made a 90 degree left-hand turn and then was headed East.  When I came out, it was headed East. The object was incandescent white, like a light bulb, and had a perfectly circular cross-section.  There was no exhaust of any kind or any vapor trail. It was completely silent. The object was flying very close to a jet aircraft.  After 50+ years, I’m not completely  sure of the following, but I believe that the object was trailing the jet aircraft and to its right.  I could see very clearly the swept wings of the jet aircraft, one jet engine under each wing, the two horizontal tail stabilizers, and the fuselage. When jets fly at 35000 feet, you can hardly see them. This one was much closer, possibly 10000 to 15000 feet. If you placed the circular object on top of the jet, I believe it would be just large enough to cover up the jet. Since the direction and distance from the jet to  the UFO did not change, I believe both were at the same altitude. As the UFO was traveling  toward the eastward horizon, it ejected a smaller version of itself (maybe one-quarter of the diameter, incandescent white, circular cross section) to the South. It moved South through a 30 to 45 degree arc in about 3 seconds. It stopped at this point and just faded away. Possibly because it was moving radially away from me. The jet aircraft and the main UFO continued until they disappeared over the eastern horizon. I have never seen anything like this UFO. It was either from this Earth or it was not. I wish I knew.

The object had extreamly bright lights. Though the binoculars, it looks liked rows and rows of windows on a circular object.  The lights appeared to be coming out of the rows of windows, however, the locations of the lights would change which made the object appear to change shape.

My wife and I were recently on a NCL cruise when I spotted something strange from the balcony one night.  It was 10:15 PM local time (11:15 PM EST), and we were approximately ½ ways between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.  My guess is we were 25 miles north of the two islands, traveling due east and closer to Puerto Rico than the Dominican Republic.  The sky was crystal clear and the visibility excellent when viewing the horizon.  Looking straight up was diminished due to the ships lights. I went out on the balcony and immediately spotted a pulsating white/red/green light to the south, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.  The object was stationary and appeared to be rotating.  The color changes were at regular intervals of approximately 1 second each.  There also appeared to be a solid white light just above and attached to the color changing lights. After a few minutes my wife came out and I showed her what I was looking at.  We both confirmed the color changing and the stationary aspect of the object.  We continued to view the object for 15 to 20 minutes.  In that time the object did not move up, down, or side to side at all, nor did the intensity of the lights change.  What ever it was, it was definitely in a stationary position. The object did not appear to be close.  I would guess it was 10 to 20 miles away as its relative position did not change in relation to the stars in the background and the motion of the ship.  I was very tempted to call the bridge and ask what they thought of my sighting, but eventually never did. It is worth mentioning that my wife and I live in New England, close to the ocean and just a few miles from a major airport.  We have seen thousands of airplanes over the years and often watch them come in over the water from 20+ miles away.  Never has one appeared like this.  Airplanes at a distance at night start off as a solid white light, move left/right/up/down, and then as they get closer the red and green wing lights come into view.  The object we saw that night did not move at all and was easy to reference to the stars in the background.  The red and green was also just as bright as the white. I am a casual astronomy enthusiast and fairly literate with the movements of the planets and constellations.  The object we witnessed was far below the planetary arc and could not have been Venus or any other planet.  In luminosity though I would say it was as bright as the brightest Venus I’ve ever seen.

To whom it may concern, On the night of June 4th , I think, for an unknown reason I looked up and said Good-Lord I’d like to offer a Male Alien a glass of water if there are any.  I then filled a glass of water and left it on a counter, then went to bed around 10pm.   Around 2:00 am I awoke with a tingling sensation all over my body,  Standing just outside my bedroom doorway, there were two figures standing in my hallway.  I went to get out of bed and couldn’t, I seemed to be paralyzed with my head turned toward them, I went to point to the sky, couldn’t, tried to roll out of bed and couldn’t.  During all of this there was a brighter than usual light coming in through a far bedroom window, behind them but towards me, with a blue-ish tint to it.  The two figures I saw were gray in color with dark, large eyes, nostrils but no visible nose, and a small mouth, but there was no sound of any kind, except the frogs and ducks outside.  My bedroom is on the second floor, on the back of my townhome, the light was coming from the front.  I fell back to sleep, until about 10am the next morning, bad dream right.  Went to turn on my cable tv in my bedroom and the cable was out, tried down stairs, it was out too.  I then called my cable company, they ran a circuit test and said everything was fine on their end, so they came to look at my boxes. The cable tech said he had to reprogram the EPROM chips in my boxes with another computer and did, worked fine after that. We talked, there was no lightning or storms the night before that we knew of and I informed all my equipment is on surge protector anyway shouldn’t have blown or wiped like that.  Then I went out to my front yard and there was and still is, a tear- dropped shape of discolored, almost burnt grass in my front yard about 30ft wide and 30 ft long that wasn’t there before, pointed from where the light was coming from.

I watched the ""satellite"" come south to north, heading towards Monroe, NY, and then it flashed brightly and disappeared.  It was simply a white spec, like a distant star, until it light up bright & was gone.  I thought maybe the ""satellite"" was so high up, the sunlight bounced off it.

However, after I stopped walking to get a better look at the object, I realized that it wasn't moving, but rather drifting ever so slowly, and at times, it would remain stationary.  I stood staring at the object for a number of minutes trying to decipher what it was that I was looking at.  I thought to myself, is that a balloon?  I just couldn't figure out what it was that I was looking at.  It was just a sizable black object high in the sky, about the size of an aircraft, but shapeless.  It didn't make a noise, or have any lights, but it did seem to have a whitish hue or ambience to it at times.  After a number of minutes staring at the sky, I said to myself, I must look ridiculous, so I decided to move on, not to mention that my dog was ge! tting very impatient.

I looked away for only a second or two, probably took three or four steps, and then glanced back up at it, but it was gone.  It simply disappeared.  I immediately stopped again and stared in disbelief.  It was nowhere to be seen.  There were planes flying all over the place, but no black object.

Driving at approximately 8:45PM on Friday, March 5th, with my 2 daughters (6 yr-old in the front and 2 yr-old in the back), my 6 yr-old suddenly became eerily quiet in a manner that startled me. After about two minutes silence she slowly muttered a statement such as, “Oh wow” and expressed she saw the blinking lights of alien spaceships in the sky! I was on a busy highway so I didn’t glance her way. Of course my reaction was disbelief and we spoke of stars and such for the remainder of our 5-10 minutes drive home. East of our home lies an extinct volcano with a prominent observatory and to the west, the ocean, while we live in a small urban area. The sky was crystal clear, a typically pristine and cloudless Hawaiian evening, yet, when she and I hopped out of the car (it is a large outdoor parking lot), I spotted in the sky, a lone, transparent cloud hovering about 30 feet above us. As far as I can tell, no one else is around. I see around 30-50 lights moving and blinking and “dancing” very quickly inside of the cloud. Both of us rub our eyes wondering if our vision is messed up. The cloud is maybe the size of a small, one story home and doesn’t move but the lights are bouncy and wild, like we were watching a light show, but nothing I could imagine projected the lights, onto the solo cloud, from below; it was absolutely illogical. I viewed it for maybe 2 or 3 minutes and it “felt” “celebratory”. My daughter studied the phenomena in the car for 10 minutes, and described it as 4 round spaceships that initially rotated super fast, clockwise and then, counterclockwise. One of the discs stood apart, however and didn’t move like the others. The 3 disc’s movement altered from circular to a more randomness, when we were in the parking lot. She also explained the cloud with ships, didn’t have a “top” (lid) to it. I’m not certain if she meant the cloud or the ships or both. As I was looking at it, my feeling wasn’t of fear at all. My 2 yr-old needed to be retrieved from the car so I decided to attend to her and then watch the strange cloud after I gathered up my baby, but in a manner of about a minute the entire thing had vanished. My six year-old had been looking away, too, so missed its disappearance. I told her it was an “angel” so she wouldn’t be afraid, and every trace of lights and ghost-like cloud substance, dematerialized within under a minute.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,20.6989,-156.44299999999998

I was driving south at approximately 8:45 PM on March 5, 2010, and my 6-yr-old daughter was in the passenger seat, singing a song. Suddenly she stopped singing and because of the sudden quiet she emitted, as a Mom, it sort of startled me. But I was driving on a busy highway and concentrated on the road instead of attending to her. After about 10 seconds she finally expressed a sound (she'd been staring intently out the window). She said: ""Oh, wow"" or something similar and that she was watching a UFO!   Of course my initial reaction was to totally dismiss it, like she was being childish and I told her there was no such thing, it was just twinkling in the stars.  In Hawaii, of course, the clear night sky is utterly spectacular and pristine. I never glanced in her direction and we talked about space for the remainder of the ride. We pulled into our apartment complex's parking lot, about 5-10 minutes later and we both got out of the car.  I still needed to get my 2 yr-old out of the car, who was sitting in a car seat in the back, but something made me look up in the sky first.  The sky was completely sparkling clean with no clouds.   Directly above us I saw a large cloud with a bunch of multiple dancing lights inside, as if someone was projecting a light show into a cloud.  My 6 yr-old can describe it more accurately since she watched it longer than I did. I couldn't believe what I saw.  It didn't make any logical sense. A lot of my mental energy went into attempting to process the meaning of it all, as I was watching it.  The only possible explanation I could think of, was that a big light show was happening on the beach about 100 feet below me and being projected into a cloud.  The lights were dancing quickly and there were many lights, like a show.  The only other answer was that it was a UFO. My 6 yr-old's description, is better since I needed to attend to my 2 yr-old abruptly:  She said it was 3 to 4 circles of lights (like a craft) in the transparent cloud (the cloud reminded me of the material a ghost would be made out of, invisible, yet, not invisible).  When my daughter initially saw the thing in the car she said the circles, were dancing around in circles really fast, going first, clockwise and then, counter clockwise, in rhythmic motion.  Later, when we saw it in the parking lot, the lights changed movement and direction: blinking sort of haphazardly but with purpose, not clumsy, and not going in just circles any more and they were ""dancing"" quickly.  To me, ""dancing lights"" fits well because the ""feeling"" I received was that of a kind of rhythmic motion and almost celebratory, as if a light ""show"" was taking place. My daughter saw the lights as: about, 4 circular crafts, with fast blinking lights. Neither my daughter nor I could ""believe"" what we saw, we kept rubbing our eyes to see if our vision was messed up, but it wasn't, it was real!   I'd turned to retrieve my 2-yr-old daughter out of the car and proceeded to discard of some rubbish in a nearby trash can, and the thing had totally dematerialized! My 6 yr-old hadn't seen it vanish, either, for she had looked away momentarily, too. The weirdest disappearing aspect, was the fact, the wispy cloud the lights had been projecting from, was gone, as well.  Not a trace of a cloud was left in the sky.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,20.6989,-156.44299999999998

I travel this road everyday, taking it to school and to work. I am used to seeing airplanes fly right over the highway to come in for landings at the airport, which sits just off the highway. I also know what an airplane looks like when it is flying at night, and am aware of the blinking lights that an airplane has on its underside and on its wings. Tonight though, on my way home, something strange happened. I was coming up on the airport like I said, and I saw a very bright white light off in the distance to my left. I thought it was just an airplane that was on its way in to land, however; at times it seemed as if it wasn’t really moving at all. Like it was almost hovering off in the distance, but the lights were very bright, even with it being a ways off in the distance. I saw it began making its way closer and closer to the highway eventually, all the while still thinking that it was just an airplane. But once I traveled past the airport on the highway, I realized that it was coming it at such an angle that it couldn’t have been heading to the airport, because the airport was now behind me and this object was traveling perpendicular to the highway, not back towards the airport at an angle. As this object got closer to the highway, and was about to fly over the highway, I was making my way underneath an overpass and I was directly under the object and I looked up and knew immediately that this was no airplane, or any other aircraft that I have seen before in my life. It was traveling directly above the road that was the overpass and continuing to my right down that road over some trees. I believe it was Moon Clinton Road. It appeared to be rectangular, but also could have been a saucer shape, due to the brightness of the lights I could not tell. The best way I can describe its shape was maybe rectangular on the sides with roun! ded corn ers. It had very bright lights coming out of it. I became very frightened by it because I knew this was nothing I had ever seen before, and sped up. I looked away at the road, and when I turned back to look at it again, it was gone. I called 911 and reported it right away because I was freaked out by it, and knew it was not an airplane, and also due to its close proximity to the airport, I did not know if it was of any harm to anyone or any other aircraft. I thank you for taking the time to read my report, and hope that someone has an answer as to what this was that I saw tonight.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

I was driving on Hershel Avenue in Hyde Park when I looked up and saw three orange and red objects that were round in the sky.  I said to my female friend “what is that.”   A few seconds later another one went by and another one followed closely behind.  My female friend said “stop the car I want to get out.”  With that I looked to see if there was a car behind us but nobody was on the road.  She got out and I also got out looking in the general direction of the objects.  There was no sound as they flew by.   They appeared to be 50 or 80 thousand feet in the sky and flying a low speed.  The sky  was clear and there was a moon with no wind.   The objects were moving from the east to the west.  We got back in the car and drove west.  In the distance we could still see the objects forming a circle and following each other in sequence.  They continue to glow a orange/red color and were spinning yet not moving very fast.  As we headed down Erie Avenue towards Hyde Park Square we could still see the objects then they vanished. When I got back to my female friend apartment we got out of the car and went down to the street level.  I looked to the east and saw one more object coming our way.  The object was smaller than the rest but had a red and orange glow.  There was no sound as it flew overhead at a slow speed.  Then a second later after it passed it vanished. We went into her apartment and called Lunken Airport but they didn’t see anything or heard of any reports.  Then we called local news stations, District Two Police and the Cincinnati Enquirer.  All the news agencies said they never heard of anyone else seeing anything. I called the UFO Center to report my sighting and Mr. Peter Davenport answered the phone.  He told me to write down what we saw and we both needed to file a separate report to this agency.  Then Mr. Davenport said see if there is anything on the news about your sighting or if anyone else saw it.  The next day I looked in the papers, and looked at all the local news and there were no reports. In Hyde Park there is an observatory not far from where we first spotted the objects.  I fired an email to the head person there and they respond saying they had guests in the observatory that night but were looking in the direction of the moon.   The gentleman said that there may have been a meteor shower going on at the time or what we saw may have been space junk.  I have seen a meteor shower before, but the meteor past very fast overhead.   I never seen anything that was red and orange that looked like a ball of light flying a low speed.   It was very weird. So far nobody has seen anything to my knowledge or nobody is saying anything.  We live about 60 miles south of Wright Patterson Air Force Base,  10 miles from Greater Cincinnati Airport and 5 miles from Lunken Airport.  We could not hear any sound from these objects so therefore they were not aircraft related.    We both saw them and I must say it was very interesting.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

It was over a residential area moving right to left towards homes. It had no lights on at the time but it was close enough to see that it did have them. It flew too fast to be a helicopter but too slow to be a jet. were maybe 100 to 150 yards away from it but it made absolutely no sound. It was way too big to be a remote controlled toy, I would guess it was a one man craft. It looked like the classic saucer design from old alien movies. It was dark so it was hard to make out an exact color but I would say it was a dark metal gray. As far as size I'd say it was 15-20 ft. in diameter.

A number of objects with flashing lights moving erratically.,Clarkston,WA,2008-07-16T23:00:00,changing,at least 2 1/2 hours,"Occurred : 7/16/2008 23:00  (Entered as : 07/16/08 23:00) Reported: 7/17/2008 4:05:27 PM 16:05 Posted: 8/12/2008 Location: Clarkston, WA Shape: Changing Duration:at least 2 1/2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64616.html,"A number of objects with flashing lights moving erratically. 	 My friend and I drove to a remote area last night called Granite Rock, which is a 30 minute drive from Clarkston, Washington.  While star gazing we witnessed some unusual lights in the sky that were unlike any that we’d seen before.  We felt that it was unusual enough to report, and we also hoped to learn of anyone else who may have seen this. Granite Rock is a rock formation found on the shore of the Clearwater River.  The moon was full and very bright, but many stars were very visible being so far from city lights.  Hills surrounding the area created an echo effect.  We heard the usual sounds like crickets, bats, and fish splashing in the water, but it was otherwise very quiet.  We were leaning back in our chairs looking at the stars when we began to hear something that didn’t sound as if it belonged way out there.  It was a low pitched mechanical humming or buzzing that emitted different tones.  The sounds were faint but easily audible.  We wondered about it, but didn’t think it strange enough to dwell on, because it stopped a few minutes after it began.  Several minutes went by, when we were startled by what appeared to be stars in motion.  We were looking in different parts of the sky.  One of us saw two stars that aligned vertically and of similar brightness. The lower of the two stars slowly descended behind the horizon of the hills.  Flashing lights were just visible beyond the hill the object went behind.  They appeared to be distant, not just over the hill. At the same time, the other of us saw what appeared at first to be a very twinkly bright star, but it began to move in erratic patterns.  The twinkling seemed to be coming from a bar of alternately flashing red, green and white lights.  We both alerted the other to what we were seeing.  We resisted the impulse to cut and run, as our curiosity was stronger than our fear.  We looked all around then and saw a lot of other activity. There were several other “stars” that looked like and were behaving in the same way as the moving, flashing object.  They seemed to be spinning and tilting as they would go slowly to one direction, maybe suddenly freefall then move quickly in another direction.  They were moving in loops and straight lines, back and forth, hovering, moving up and down, but never straying outside of their immediate area.  They appeared to be different distances away as some appeared fainter and smaller or larger and brighter, easier to see and more visibly detailed.  One or two of the closer ones seemed to have moving shadows just behind the lights.  The shadows changed shape, as if when it moved in different angles it would appear to have different shapes. We kept an eye on the horizon over which the other “star” descended.   The object dipped behind the hill and glowed blue and white and then reappeared without the flashing lights and left a dimmer silhouette which glowed green.  It then glided very quickly away from us still glowing green.  We looked away to watch some of the other flashing objects,  and once when we looked back at it, it was flashing blue and white lights above the horizon, dipped behind again and reappeared in the distance with the green glow again.  It remained there, dim but visible floating back and forth just over the horizon.  It didn’t move like the other objects.  It just floated slowly and steadily back and forth and up and down just above the horizon in the glow.  We noticed at one point that it had risen back up almost to the level of the star that it was below initially. It should be noted here that the moon and identifiable planets and constellations were also clearly visible.  They were stationary in contrast to the moving objects.  Over the 2 ½ hours that we watched, the moon and stars moved across the sky as they should, slowly and steadily, but the flashing objects never moved out of their initial territories and never stopped moving within them. We tested each other to see if we were seeing the same things.  One of us would describe the different movements of the objects (for example: “It’s moving left, left, up, left, real quick to the right….”), and we would find that we were indeed seeing the same movements.  We also made it a point to stop often and rest our eyes and walk around to avoid eyestrain “hallucinations”. Before all the action, we had opportunity to see an airplane fly over, so we had that image to compare to the flashing objects.  They did not look like airplanes.  They did not move like helicopters or like anything else we could know about.  We observed them for quite a long time, but left while they were still there, and that was at 1:30 am.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,46.369,-117.2288

July 17, 2008 between 2052 and 2106, I captured 47 images on my digital.  These images were in what I believe is the east sky of Shanghai, Pudong New District, PRC.  The time stamps on the images are 2152 to 2206 hours because my camera had been set to a different time than where I was taking the photos.  At about 2035 hours on Thursday July 17, 2008, I was in the study of my apartment where I frequently go to view the beauty of the buildings in Shanghai Pudong.  Within a couple of minutes I noticed what appeared to be slow a reddish color light from my vantage point about 40 degrees up from my position.  My first reaction was do to nothing, but after a couple of minutes of city gazing, the light was in approximately in the same location.  I went to my desk to get my binoculars (power of 15 X  60 X 63) and see if I could get a better view.  To my surprise the view was very clear.  I saw an array of lights that formed a “V” shape.  The color of lights ranged between reds, blues, purples, greens, and at time some yellow.  They were flashing randomly and they were randomly changing colors.  In my estimate there were about six to ten lights on each side of the apex of the V.   This “object” for lack of a better term seemed to hover, and every once in a while made almost floating moves, certainly not “darting”.  After a few minutes of watching in amazement, because I am not a particular believer of UFO’s, (but I had never seen anything like this) I considered getting out my camera.  However I thought that it may not get a good shot and/or the object may disappear.  When I finally decided to get my digital camera (Nikon D80)  it took about a minute or so to change to my telephoto lens (80 X 300).  I have not used the camera too often in the manual mode, but I knew that if I left in automatic mode, that the flash would be used and I did not want it because I was inside looking through a window.  So, I switched the camera to manual mode with auto focus enabled.  In the beginning I could not see the object, so I first focused on a building within my site then directed my lens back to the object in the air.  I actually took three shots (two which captured nothing and one of the spire from the building I focused on, before I auto focused to the spire).  On my fourth attempt I was able to capture the object.  I believe that I set the camera to manual focus before my fourth shot, but it may have been auto focus, because at some point in time, I changed the focus mode (on my 28th shot).  Over the course of 13 minutes I clicked every so often.  However, I was holding the camera in my hand, leaning on the window frame and doing whatever I could do to keep it steady.  I am not sure that the F stop setting was, but I can obtain that because I have not changed it.  At one point in time I actually changed the camera to a second manual setting which took a longer exposure.  I finally decided to get my monopod and set the camera on it so I could have a bit more stability, however by the time I set my monopod up (within a minute or so), the object started moving towards the south and then further east.  I continued to shoot until the object was no longer within my sight.  As of 2157 hours, at the point when I am writing this sentence, the object has not reappeared.  As I state above, I am not a UFO believer, however I did see something, and I did capture some very interesting digital images.  As soon as the object had disappeared I opened my Web browser and searched for a web site to report this event.  Images available on request.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

Please suggest explanations. We were sitting in our local pub (about 50 people outside) when one of us pointed up to the sky, drawing our attention.  A rather large orange-red, very vibrant pulsating light was visible moving straight across in an airplane-fashion, about the same speed.   We had limited visibility through bushes and pub-inventory, when we noticed that there were additional objects with the same appearance that floated farther away from the one we just spotted.  At first glance it seemed like a helicopter, however the number of objects and the rather intense light and color would not have justified that conclusion.  I went on to a better spot to examine these objects and a friend followed me.  Surprisingly no one else of the few people we had made aware of the objects followed, after the incident they explained it was due to disbelief.  We´re not sure how many of the guests in the pub had noticed them as well.   We gained full sight of the sky, about 2 objects were flying to our left, with the rest in no particular formation to our right, in front of them.  They were flying level, apparently with considerable distance between them (the first one we noticed was just glowing so much, seemed much closer), and at normal, aircraft-comparable speed.  After watching them for some time and taking a photo via a cellphone, one after another began to disappear.  The size of the glowing balls began to shrink, until there was only a very small but shiny star-like glow visible, then they disappeared completely, one after another.  It did, to me, not seem like they were speeding away as it is common in ufo reports, but rather that the light got smaller until invisible (it did not dim out). We are examining the possibility of these objects being candle-balloons, however from our observation that does not seem to be a possibility due to a) the extremely bright orange-red color of the objects and b) the straight level flight of all of the objects (horizontal, not upwards).

I woke up a 02:19 and made myself a cup of coffee and sat outside on the front patio enjoying the peace and quiet.  From the patio which faces east I have a 180 degrees view. At approximately 03:15 I was looking to the north and noticed a dull yellow/orange light moving from west to east across the Rio Puerco valley.  I estimated that the aircraft/light was 6 to 8 miles away and moving much faster than the normal aircraft on  approach to Albuquerque International Airport which is nearly due east 19.5 miles to the control tower.  I am guessing that the altitude was 5000 AGL.  This is only a guess. I followed the object with the naked eye until it entered a low thin cloud.  I was curious about the fast moving light so I got up out of my chair and search for the object.  After a minute or so the object appeared out of the top of the cloud.  At this point the light began to flash a very bright red and white strobe.  The object headed west again and seemed to trace it's path back.  I went into the house and got my 8x35 filed glasses and video camera. I returned outside and followed the light with the field glasses. Then the light began to jump around.  Up and down and left to right.  At first I thought I might be moving the field glasses.  There was a large star in the northeast that was in the field of view and it was not moving, so it was the object that was jumping around. I went to the north patio to follow the light's westerly track. The light moved across the Rio Puerco valley at a rapid pace, but not beyond current F16 military aircraft capabilities which operate out of Kirkland Airbase (ABQ International). At this point I tried to video the light, but the battery was dead.  The valley is approximately 5 miles wide where the light made its westerly track and it took approximately 5 minutes to cross the valley.  As the object crossed over the Rio Puerco River it began to jump around again.  The erratic movements covered the entire field of view of my field glasses.  Again I tried to make sure I wasn't moving the field glasses, but there were no stars visible in the west, northwest because of a slight cloud cover and the brightness of the moon high in the south, southwest, but I did use the edge of the western horizon as a reference point when possible.  Same results the light was jumping around. During the period of erratic movements the object was flashing a red and white strobe light similar to conventional aircraft.  I followed the light/object for several more minutes as it seemed to pass over the north lava fields of Mt Taylor.  At this point it was not moving oddly, but the red and white strobes continued and I returned into the house. The temperature was approximately 70 degrees and there were clusters of thin clouds.  Visibility was very good.  Humidity was high for the Rio Puerco valley.  A near full moon was high in the Southwest.  Winds were from the north at 1 to 2 knots.

It was dark out and there was no other cars or buildings around. All together the road has four lanes two going one direction and two going the other with feeder roads on both sides. We had just left a pretty busy area but now there was nothing but thick trees around.  We were driving for a few minutes in the darkness with our windows down without talking or listening to the radio when we heard a weird sound shoot through the car behind us.  It sounded like a sound effect you would here in a pink floyd song.  It sounded very sharp and fast like a lazer type noise cutting threw the air. It went from the passenger side where I was to the drivers side behind us and then made a ""ding"".  When I explain it, it probably sounds like something flew in a hit something.  My mom asked, ""Are you sure someone didn't shoot at you?""  Not only is the highly unlikely but a bullet does not make that sound.  A bullet sounds like something cutting through the air, yes, but not like a weird lazer type sound effect.  And the strange ding at the end sounded like something hitting hollow metal...or tapping a glass with a spoon or something.  Also, I looked in my car for any type of object that could have came in through the windows or any kind of damage from som! ething flying in and hitting it and found nothing.  Nor could I find anything that would have made a ""ding"".  When I heard it I thought to myself ""what the hell?"" because it was so unexplainable, something I never had heard nor thought I would hear in such a place. I said to my boyfriend, ""Did you hear that?""  And he replied, ""You heard that too?""  I said, ""Yeah what the hell was it?"" He had no explanation either.  So of course we went home and told everyone we came across. I am still really confused by the noise, I'm not saying it had anything to do with aliens or whatever but I do know for sure that what I heard was so strange that my boyfriend and I can not even register what it was in our heads.   To me it was like a crazy sound wave cutting through the air with no object or anything just a crazy sound. Something you would hear in a Pink Floyd song.  I have thought of seeing UFO's and ghosts and all the other unexplainable things but I never even dreamed of hearing an unexplainable sound. I could go on all day and never be able to give someone a good mental thought of what it really sounded like because its hard to understand if you didn't hear it.  I never even knew i could hear something like that until that night.  I would love to know if anyone else has ever heard and unexplainable noise.

With no reason for light onboard the vessel (even the cargo on deck was trucks) I sent the lookout seaman to check the cargo but no way that the light was coming from the cargo. I reported to the captain and another check performed with no sign of light from the cargo, the captain said its ok, as long as we don’t have problem. I and the lookout seaman are sure that it’s abnormal light and we stopped talking about it because no need to talk about unbelievable issues.

It may have been separate objects or lights on one very large circular or oval shaped object--- it reminded us a lot of the phoenix lights- just glowing orange. There was no sound or ""jet trails"".  They looked similar to paper glowing air lanterns-- but I do not believe they were because the wind was blowing in the opposite direction, and the objects kept their shape and stayed true. They were moving in a northwestern direction, traveling at a speed similar to geese flying. I can't believe someone else saw this too I blogged about it and received no response.

My wife was driving, the incident occurred to the left side of the road somewhere between Orinda and El Sobrante, on Camino Pablo Rd..   In this area there is nothing but a single two way road with a bunch of trees that spreads for many acres of land. To the right is a lake/reservoir.

It wasn’t like a flash in the sky, it was almost like fireworks with the flames descending. The distance from our vehicle to the sighting was roughly 300 feet.  We ruled out the possibility of fireworks because if it were fireworks we would have heard them. With the amount of light produced, if it were fireworks I would have heard it with my stereo all the way up.

As I walked into my backyard I was looking at the long contrails extending north to south across the deep blue sky. I soon noticed a lower flying aircraft flying from the northeast to the southwest. As I watched the aircraft I soon noticed a small white object following close behind it. Stunned at first, I starred at the object trying to figure out what this object could be. After a few seconds of observation I noticed the object was white in color and disk or orb like in appearance. While I watched the white disk it started swinging back and forth behind the airplane in a left to right type fashion. I wondered at first if I was seeing a big white bird, I quickly realized this was definitely not the case. As I watched the object swing left to right it all a sudden dove or dropped straight down and flew underneath the airplane for a few seconds, it then swung just under the plane to the left side and amazingly completely circled the airplane and then again trailed behind it. I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing, it was at this point I thought to myself, do I have time to run inside and grab my camera. I hesitated at first thinking the object would be gone by the time I got back. Than I thought, I have to try because know one will believe me if I don't get a picture-so off I went running. I grabbed the camera, ran back outside and was just able to take a short video as the object disappeared over Haymarket toward the Bull Run mountains. I have tried to consider other explanations for this object but have been mostly unable to do so. The only possibility could be a in flight refuel for the air combats that are deployed to protect Washington DC airspace. I don't think this is much of a possibility since the aircraft the object was following was not military but a passenger plane. The white disk I saw was also not a conventional military aircraft. There wasn't any wings visible on the craft and the craft was more disk/orb like in appearance.

It looked like a planet or rock just suspended  in the sky and as I stared ,it appeared to begin moving upward and just when I started thinking it could be the moon rising or something of a rational reason it rotated and a reflection of light from the setting sun bounced off of what appeared to be a bronze window or panel part of it.   I kept staring at it and trying to keep my vehicle in my lane while watching this thing as long as I can and every time I looked at the road in front of me and return my attention back to where it was just a few seconds ago, I had to find it again because it had moved higher each time.   I was excited and also trying to reason as to why it would be hear and then I realized that it was directly east of the nuclear power plant that was about 10-15 miles west of me and the highway I was on. It was as though the plant was being observed. It rose up without a sound vapor trail or anything and within a minute or so it was completely out of sight, straight up.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,42.27738134206219,-89.04477790507364

Three separate sightins which ocurred in rural south Texas between 01/01/03 and 03/01/09.,San Antonio,TX,2006-01-01T23:00:00,triangle,1: 45 minutes,"Occurred : 1/1/2006 23:00  (Entered as : 01/01/06 23:00) Reported: 6/7/2009 1:50:36 PM 13:50 Posted: 6/9/2009 Location: San Antonio/Laredo (between), TX Shape: Triangle Duration:1: 45 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70393.html,"Three separate sightins which ocurred in rural south Texas between 01/01/03 and 03/01/09. I have lived in various towns South Texas since 1999.  Since 2004, I have worked outdoors most if this time, mostly at night with minimal light pollution from large cities.  I have three separate sightings to report with no specific dates, regrettably.  All I cab say is that the first sighting occurred after 01/01/06 before 2007.  The second sighting occurred between 01/03/09 and 02/20/09.  The third sighting occurred between 04/01/09 and 05/15/09.  The first two sightings occurred while I was working.  The last sighting occurred during my off time.  I will recount my experiences here. All three sightings occurred in the rural Texas landscape in between Del Rio, Texas to the west, San Antonio, Texas to the north, Corpus Christi, Texas to the east and Laredo, Texas to the south.  In between these four cities are smaller, rurally populated towns.  Outside of the towns are millions of acres of privately owned ranch land that is inaccessible to few consisting of ranch owners, their families, hunters and in areas closer to the Mexican border, the U.S. Border Patrol. I’d like to emphasize that this area in between the aforementioned cities is sparsely populated and dominated by private land.  Also, after I had observed the objects in all three sightings, I believed the aircraft to be military.  The cities of Del Rio and San Antonio have Air Force installations.  The city of Corpus Christi has a Naval Air Station.  There is also a bombing range approximately 30 to 40 miles east of Cotulla, Texas on Farm to Market Road (FM) 624. I will report these observations as clearly and accurately as I can, devoid of any opinion or speculation.  I did mention earlier that I believed these objects to be military, but that’s based on the fact that these events occurred within the triangle of those installations where there are several remote miles to operate in without many eyewitness accounts. FIRST SIGHTING: I was with a coworker traveling westbound on the FM Road 133 which connects Artesia Wells, Texas (LaSalle County) to Catarina, Texas (County).  Both towns are sparsely populated and are surrounded by dense brush for several miles.  Artesia Wells is a town of probably 20 that is approximately 50 miles north of Laredo, Texas, outside of it’s city limits and maybe 90 miles outside of San Antonio, Texas.  Artesia Wells is on IH-35 in a heavily traveled stretch of highway that is relatively clo0se to the Mexican border. FM 133 is maybe 15 to 20 miles long and only runs from Artesia Wells to Catarina.  There are no tons in between Artesia Wells and Catarina.  Catarina has a population of maybe 50 or more, if not less. I am not certain as to the time of year, and do not want to speculate.  I do remember that I initially observed the object approximately 10 miles west of Catarina and thought that it was a low flying aircraft.  This was about 45 minutes before sunset.  Approximately 5 miles outside of Catarina, both my coworker and commented that the aircraft did not appear to be moving.  The object was several miles west of the FM 133 and Highway 83 intersection just south of Catarina. The object appeared to be black in color, triangular shaped with no lights or visible markings.  The object did not make any sounds that I could hear.  Also, the object appeared to be hovering.  The object’s hover was not consistent with that of a helicopter in that a helicopter moves up and down and side to side as it hovers.  This object appeared to be perfectly still.  I did not notice and type of exhaust emitting from the vehicle. My coworker and I attempted to get as close as we could to the object via dirt roads.  The dirt roads we were on took us due south and not west.  The object appeared to be hovering over brush.  From my position, I couldn’t identify any land monuments to pinpoint the object’s location.  There were only trees and plants below the object.  I still would like to say that my coworker and I were still around about 10 miles or so from the object. We watched the object until the sun set.  The object remained stationary for the duration.  My coworker and I attempted to get the object’s attention by pointing flashlights at it and using flashing lights while we were stationary. At sun set, the object became impossible to see with the naked eye.  I used night vision goggles to view the object.  With very little sub light being used as a light source, I could clearly see the object at the same location, still stationary.  My coworker observed the object through the night vision equipment as well. It was at this time that we left the area.  The object was not visible after sun set.  The object did not appear to have any lights. SECOND SIGHTING: I was working alone near the Artesia Wells area between the hours of 2200 and 0100 hours when I observed lights in the sky.  I was traveling westbound on a rural ranch road one mile south of Artesia Wells and approximately one mile from IH-35 when I first saw a bright light in the sky. On this night, the sky was clear and there did not appear to be any clouds in the sky.  I was I was traveling westbound, a bright light that I can best describe as resembling a headlight caught my eye.  The light was very bright and flashed on and off before disappearing.  There appeared to be lights north of this light’s location; these lights seemed relatively close to the first light. I observed the very bright “headlight” and the others for only a couple of seconds.  I continued traveling west until I reached IH-35.  I parked my vehicle, got out and attempted to signal the area where I observed the light with my flashlight. I was at the intersection of IH-35 and FM 133 when I attempted to signal this light.  At this point the light was not visible.  I scanned the sky and observed a high flying aircraft that could have been a plane.  This object was traveling southbound on the east side of IH-35 but crossed over IH-35 traveling westbound.  Shortly after crossing over, the object began to travel north.  It took the object between 8-12 minutes before it disappeared out of sight due to distance.  Another aircraft appeared to be several miles behind it. I turned my attention back to the west sky where I observed three high hovering objects.  These objects appeared to be in a triangular formation.  I could not make out any shapes or sizes.  The lights on these objects appeared to be consistent with conventional aircraft.  They omitted a white beacon every couple of seconds or so.  These objects did not appear to have the typical red port side light or green starboard side light that many aircraft and vessels have.  They remained stationary for several minutes, flashing. I attempted to signal these objects as well, to no avail. To characterize the initial object, I’d say it was about the size of a military flare.  I did not emit smoke and a shadow like military flares and did not appear to be descending under a parachute like a military flare.  It is best described as a single vehicle headlight in the sky.  This object was not a radio or cell phone tower light and was not a vehicle.  It was too high in the sky to be mistaken for vehicle. This entire experience lasted about 30 minutes. THIRD SIGHTING: On this particular evening, I was traveling home from a shopping trip in Laredo, Texas with my family when my daughter, my wife and I observed an object in the sky.  I was at about the 27 mile marker of IH-35, two miles south of the Border Patrol checkpoint when I observed 4 to 5 bright lights, lined up within three to four times their width from each other.  These objects appeared to be in a much disciplined formation.  These objects appeared consistent with the object I saw in my second sighting.  The objects were very bright and appeared similar to headlights.  They flashed off sequentially, starting with the southern most light.  These lights were in the western sky. I immediately notified my wife and daughter and they too saw the lights.  I did not stop to investigate or signal to them.  I continued traveling northbound until arrival at the Border Patrol checkpoint. The 27 mile marker is approximately 27 miles form the Mexican border.  The lights appeared to be hovering over rural densely brushed and sparsely populated ranches.  There are no major towns or cities northwest of Laredo, Texas that would line up directly west of the 27 mile marker.  The nearest town would be Catarina which is several miles north of Laredo on Highway 83.  The next nearst town would be Encinal, which is 39 miles north on IH-35.

I was renting a house in the town of Thrall, Texas with several friends in Oct. 2005. We were evacuees from Hurricane Rita. It was a  very rural area, our nearest neighbor was the Lutheran Church in Noack, which I do not believe is an official ""town,"" but more of the name of the area. All there is in Noack is a church and a bar, and nothing else. The nearest decent-sized town was Taylor, Texas. One afternoon, shortly after taking up residence, I was taking clothes off the clothesline, as we had no appliances yet. I was facing south, and when I turned around, there was something hovering over the house. It looked like a shirt box, like the kind you use to wrap a present. It looked EXACTLY like a  plain-jane, no-name shirt box. Nothing else. Just a shirt box. It looked proportionate to a shirtbox, and seemed to be hovering about 40 feet over the roof. It could have been larger or higher, but it is hard to tell with no reference whatsoever. It just didn't seem to be very high up. I looked at it for a minute or two, not believing my own eyes. There was no sound. As I stared at it, I realized it was not hovering, but very slowly moving from a Northeasterly direction towards the Southwest. The day was clear and crisp, and the sky was cloudless and very blue. I hollered at the other 6 other evacuees, who all came outside and confirmed the sight I was seeing. We stared at it a while, and the others  got bored, it moved so slow, and they went back in the house. I watched it glide at a snail's pace over the house, across the side yard, and off over the pastures to the West of the house. It took a long time. It was very boring, I admit, but it just made no sense whatsoever, and I was fascinated. It never sped up, turned, or moved up or down elevation. It just kept gliding silently over the house and yard, and over the pastures. It happened nearly 5 years ago, and I still remember it like it was yesterday.

These were not burners, they were visibly flaming and left 'tails' as they moved. It was an irregular motion and I watched them until they moved out of view. There was a lot of other aircraft activity in the sky as well, including a low flying(and fast) military aircraft that was discernably terrestrial and several civilian aircraft mentioned above that flew much higher and served as a point of reference for both fireballs and military plan.

From my position in North Carolina, the moon was in full lunar eclipse; weather was ideal- ""clear blue and 22"" as we say in aviation; the moon was approximately 55 degrees South/ Southwest overhead- in other words, I had a clear unobstructed view of the lunar eclipse from my position on my front porch in Fayetteville, NC. I normally wouldn't be looking at the moon except this Lunar Eclipse event had been widely publicized on TV that evening. I was enjoying an event with unobstructed view that few will ever witness in their life time. Approximately 10 minutes into the full lunar eclipse, about 22:40 EST, I noticed on the left side of the moon (as I was facing it), a very bright, round object resembling a satellite; a bright pin-point of light object; clearly not a naturally formed object appeared suddenly, traveling in a straight line from the left side of the back side of the moon- it was clearly traveling in a straight line towards Earth. In about one to two seconds, the object made a 90 degree turn to my right, directly in front of the face of the fully eclipsed moon.  As quick as it appeared and shot across in front of my unobstructed view of the eclipsed moon, it disappeared off to my right side of the Moon and became invisible almost immediately of passing out of the Umbra shadow of the Earth eclipse of the Moon.  The entire event was less than 5 seconds. I am a US Army trained combat helicopter pilot, Desert Storm veteran of the Gulf War.  I'm accustomed and trained to look for things, especially at night.  This was not a naturally occurring object. This object made intelligent turns and in relation to the position of the moon, was traveling at as fantastic rate of speed. I am not a UFO nut.  You may even call me skeptical.  I have been able to observe a great deal of objects while flying with night vision goggles at night in various parts of the world.  I have witnessed many naturally occurring and man-made events in the sky normally not seen with the naked eye.  But this object appeared from the back-side of the moon with my un-aided view and flew directly across in front of the moon was of intelligent design and flight path.  It probably would not have been visible during the lighted or visible, not eclipsed, moon, by an un-aided human eye.  But during the eclipsed darkened view of the Moon, it was so clearly visible to the naked human eye!   I truly believe the object I observed was not of natural origin but of intelligent origin.  I am capable of distinguishing the difference between a circular type orbit versus a straight flight path.  This object was of the latter. And I know of no known human-made objects that could have produced such incredible speeds and turns based upon its observed position that night from the back side of the moon, making an instant 90 degree right turn in front and across the eclipsed moon that night. By the way, I was 47 years old at the time of the lunar eclipse and my eye sight has been evaluated as 20/12 & 20/15 in each eye during every one of my US Army Flight Physical Evaluations for the past 20 years.   I honestly believe I witnessed an intelligently driven object not of man-made origin.  I have reluctantly not reported this event to anyone before now because it was so incredible to believe myself.  And I do not want to be labeled a ""UFO Nut"".  But I witnessed, regardless of scrutiny, a truly incredible event that evening on 20 February 2008 during the Lunar Eclipse.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,35.03683522123894,-78.92246247787611

I was on a Delta Airlines flight that left Mumbai and connected in CDG airport in Paris, France. I was in a busines class seat that had the option of watching the plane's location on a GPS map on the seat-back in front of me. It was dark and in the middle of the night; most everyone on the flight was sleeping at the time. I had a right window seat near the front of the plane. Since I have trouble sleeping on planes, I routinely looked at the GPS and then out the window. The route took us north through Iran, then turns left at Tehran and heads NW towards Europe. While still heading north through Iran (before Tehran), I noticed a light to the right of the plane, not too far away (less than 1 mile I'd guess), and slightly behind us. It was a white light, but soon it pulsed into a green light, then pulsed into a red light. It alternated between those 3 colors, but sometimes appearing yellow. It did not change colors in an pattern (white, red, green, red, white, green, yellow, green, white, and so on), nor were the times in a patern...sometimes it would go 10 seconds before turning colors, other times it would go 2-3 seconds. It was definitely pacing our plane, but would sometimes pull even with us nd other times fall back a bit. It was flying at the same altitude. Since Iran is hostile to the US, I began to get concerned that perhaps it was a military aircraft with malicious intent. I got the attention of a flight attendant and pointed it out to her. She too was surprised to see the other craft. She said she'd ask the Captain about it. At that point I'd seen it for perhaps 15 minutes, and then we began the left bank to head towards Europe - we were over Tehran. The light fell back and out of sight. As we straightened out and began an even flight again, I kept looking back. Sure enough, about 5 minutes later the light reappeared, catching up to a spot in about the 4 o'clock position. It continued to pulse and change colors.  As the pre-dawn light started to lighten up I thought I could make out a shape...it looked like a rounded triangle - kind of like a football, cut in half, tip up.  The lights apeared to be spinning with the craft, but very slowly. The flight attendant returned and said the Captain was too busy to discuss it at length, but he wasn't aware of any other aircraft flying with us and he couldn't see it when he looked (maybe we had just turned).  I pointed it out to her again, and she gave a ""hmmm"", then added she was sure it was nothing to worry about. I continued to watch the thing for a combined hour....then suddenly it quite changing color and remained a bright white for perhaps a minute, then blacked out and I couldn't see it.  As the sky totally lightened up over the next hour or so,I continued to watch for it but never saw it again. I've done that flight route over 15 times, both before and after that event, and have only seen the thing that one time.

I am sending this on behalf of a witness, who works for a law firm in Tennessee, and relates an alien encounter.  I am including her contact phone number in the appropiate section. Alien Encounter - Alien Encountered in Cheatham County, TN  I reside in Cheatham County, Tennessee, and observed an alien in my yard in February this year. The reason I am coming forward is because the description the woman in Georgia provided of the 3 alien beings she observed at a campsite where she and her husband were camping the latter part of 2009 is almost exactly the same as what I saw. It was approximately 5:00 in the morning.  There was still snow on the ground from the last snow.  I had gotten ready for work and was sitting in my Suzuki in the drive letting it warm up before leaving for my job in Nashville, Tennessee. I caught movement out of the corner of my eye in the area of my garage (which is used for storage and not to pull a car into).  At first, I thought it was one of the neighbor's dogs. I turned to look and saw something which very closely matched the description of the alien creatures which the woman in Georgia observed. Its body, extra long arms and hind legs were so thin.  Its head was very large and bumpy. It was pale in color and hairless. It was very cold outside, and the creature appeared a light grayish color (I'm not sure whether the cold temperature would have affected the appearance of the color). The only difference in my story and hers is that the 3 creatures she saw were upright.  This was moving on all 4's, however, the way it was moving made it appear like a monkey or gorilla that are oftentimes upright, but then use their arms in conjunction with their legs to propel themselves forward. On all 4's, it was about the height of a large dog, and I observed that it would be considered short, compared to most humans, if it stood upright. Its legs were short, quite a bit stockier than the body and arms, which were long and skinny. It kept looking back as though it thought it was being followed, and so it was surprised to see me sitting inside the automobile when it looked around, directly at me, for the first time. I got a good look at its large, round eyes which were darkish in color.  They appeared a dark brown.  It was as though it sensed I wasn't going to hurt it, and it continued on across my yard, across the road, and continued out a connecting road which is directly in front of my home. There are lots of wooded areas in the direction it was traveling, and lots of wooded area behind my home. I am not comfortable just ignoring this occurrence. Questions are racing through my mind - questions which need to be answered. What are these creatures doing in our wooded areas, hiding out by day and wandering by night?  Where did they come from?  Are they depleting any of our resources?  Will they become dangerous if someone acts aggressively toward them?  (I was so busy looking at its eyes and bumpy head that I cannot describe a nose and/or mouth.)  I am a sane individual who is employed at one of Nashville's most prominent law firms.

I thought this was very odd so I hurried home and turned down the unpaved road which I live on.  When I turned down the road, the light was still high in the sky but a little lower then before (the color of the light was still orange). I decided to flash my high beams at it.  I flashed my lights three times. I then noticed the object flashed at me once or twice but still remained the same color orange.  This really startled me.  I got home and the light was behind my house and extremely low in the sky (about the height a helicopter would be at to view a police pursuit). I told my dad about it and he came out to see it.  We were looking at it through th! e trees and he also thought it was strange.  So he went back inside to put his shoes on.  As he went in, the light flashed yellow for about 3 seconds, then back to a really bright orange.  He came back outside and we observed it for about 20 minutes.  Then it slowly turned red and then the light went off for about 5 seconds.  Then at that time it was noticed the craft was a metallic looking sphere.  Then the red light returned on the craft.  It still remained stationary, then as we looked right over our heads a different white light (which looked like a normal airplane from a distance) passed slowly over our heads making no noise what so ever.  It only had one white light on the bottom of the craft  (There was no red or green lights on the craft like you would see on a normal airplane)  Compared to the craft with the red light, it moved perpendicular across the sky.

My friend, who was riding in the passenger seat, said,  "" What the hell is that?""   When he said that, out of the corner of my right eye, I saw something dive down out of the clouds.  What I saw and my friend said he saw were two different things. What I remember seeing, was a long, maybe 20ft. in length, and ten feet in width, flying object. I was going about 60 miles per hour, and the object after diving down out of the clouds, leveled off and seemed to be going faster than we were driving. I could see the outline of the object, but the middle of the object seemed to be translucent. While trying to drive and look up at this object, the object, even though flying straight, seemed to turn and look towards us. I remember I saw what I can only describe as two eyes, that were about the size of can of pop in circumference, and bright blue, look back towards us. Whatever I saw, then flew back up into the clouds.  I believe the cloud cover was not too high that night.

My friend and I were outside in his backyard having a cigarette at about one in the morning when we noticed a strangely-lit object making a steadily-paced arch from left to right across the sky.  Too fast to be a plane, also the lights on the object were like nothing I've seen before on any aircraft.  The object was slightly disk-like, but more substantial.  I would say more oval-shaped than anything.  The lights moved in a horizontal line across the object in a dotty pattern and changed colors from pinkish-red to light green to white. For a short time it was very close but it moved further away, still in our sights but not as clear.  As it moved, the first thing that occurred to me that was odd about the flying object was the sound.  It was completely silent except for when it was closer at first, but even then it didn't sound like any kind of engine at all.  All we heard was a soft whirring wind noise.  Also, its movements were eerie and very strange.  Not like anything I've ever seen or heard of before. When it moved further away, it stopped traveling and started hovering in place.  The lights continued to revolve around itself in that dotty pattern and the only movement it made was a slow swinging from side to side. My friend and I were really weirded out and this point.  We kept trying to verbally convince ourselves that it was a plane or something of that nature, but it was becoming more and more obvious that it wasn't a plane at all. Then we both saw the object vanish into thin air without warning.  But almost a second later it reappeared in a new place directly to the left of its original spot.  We watched it do this several more times, disappearing and reappearing in new locations that were all relatively close together.  Its movements appeared very erratic, but effortless and swift at the same time.  Then the object started traveling towards us.  My friend and I were just staring at it, freaked out.  It looked like it was coming straight for us.  The object was rapidly growing larger in size as it closed the distance between us.  It was then that I noticed more things about the object.  There seemed to be a pinkish-purple haze surrounding it.  Also, the object didn't look remotely metallic or industrial.  It merely looked like an extremely dense concentration of energy in that oval-disky shape with the lights continuing to revolve around it.  I can't say for sure that the object even looked solid.  It was definitely substantial, but it looked to have formed out of a material that I couldn't begin to fathom, even now. It stopped midair and remained completely still for a long ten seconds.  At this time I could clearly make out its shape and the light patterns and color changes.  Then it shot directly over our heads to the left and traveled an insane measure of distance in about half of a second.  I wish I had a better sense of distance so I could be more accurate about this...  Anyway, at this time both my friend and I were convinced that this was something not of this world.  The movement was like no manmade aircraft I've ever seen.  The movement was precise and liquid and smooth when it traveled that fast.  Also, there was no sound.  A plane, number one: could not have gone that fast, and number two: would have made a very loud noise when it was that close to us. It then hovered in the left section of the sky, repeated the same swinging movements from before.  It was slowly moving further away.  My friend and I watched it for a little while longer until it disappeared from sight for good. Needless to say,  I really regret not having a decent camera function on my phone.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,33.8205,-116.4586

Started looking for wings, couldn't see any but that's not really unusual because sometimes the angle of the plane makes it impossible to see the wings.  Then I realized that the ""plane"" or ""object"" was in the wrong place for the flight pattern - too high for just taking off or landing, and too low for passing through. No contrail at all.  As I watched the object, which was flying east to west at about 65 degrees above the horizon, it appeared to just simply fade out. I was looking right at it (still looking for the wings on the thing don't ya know) as it slowly dissappeared! The effect was like a plane going behind clouds that are thin at the edges but get thicker towards the middle - I'd say about 8 to 10 seconds from the time it started to fade, to completely gone. But there were no clouds in the sky. I don't know if my eyes were playing tricks, but at the last place I saw the object - the spot where it completely vanished - there appeared a faint dark smudge - like smoke - in an otherwise clear blue sky. It dissapated in a few seconds, making me wonder if I had actually seen the smudge. I continued scanning the sky but saw nothing more.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

It took about a minute to get from where I first saw it on the right of the sky, to the left, where it slowly faded (which took about 10 seconds) then disappeared. It was a very clear night with no clouds. It couldn't have been a plane because it was moving so fast, plus it was too bright to be a plane, and it wasn't flashing either. I thought it could be a satellite but it looked too low (unless it was in very low orbit?) and too bright (I see satellites all the time and they're not very bright at all). Thought it could be a meteor (or shooting star) but they only last for a couple seconds, this lasted for about a minute. Then as it got to the other side of the sky it slowly faded then disappeared. From where I live in Exmouth you can see planes flying past towards the airport in Exeter, and from a certain angle you can't see the flashing lights on the planes, so at first I thought it could be that. But it was WAY too high to be a plane, and much too bright, and it went from one side of the sky to another so I would have seen the flashing lights if it was a plane.

When I saw it, I knew what it was; at the time I really didn’t know much about UFOs and Ets.  But after that day, ever since I’ve looked up everything I could about them.  I don’t think it was a alien space craft, I do think it was a government imitation ufo not the real thing.  Ill tell the story now so you can understand why I think this. I was in school at the time and every body had to go inside.  To go inside you would have to line up in front of the door.  Then the teachers would count the students.  While we where lined up a kid on the side of me said “hay what’s that” and he pointed to the sun.  At first I didn’t see it the sun was really bright and the sun was right behind the ufo so I had to squint my eyes to see the ufo but a cloud went in front of the sun and I got a really good look. It was just sitting there not moving no sound.  Ok hears the description it was silver it had metal plates with bolts holding the metal plates on, there was no window or door or any way to see who was in side the ufo.  The ufo was not spinning like in the movies it just was very still no noise it was very right over the play ground. I could of through a ball and hit it but I wasn’t allowed and I didn’t want to get it mad because I didn’t know what it could do.  The teachers by that time where scared.  See this was a Christian school but I don’t go to a school like that any more it was like a one time thing for a year.  The teachers where scared because I don’t think they believed in ufos so they quickly rounded us up and sent us inside.  Later I came out to see if the ufo dropped anything but there was nothing there and the ufo was gone. IM NOT ASKING ANYONE TO BELIVE ME OR IN UFOs JUST LOOK UP ONCE IN A WILE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU WILL SEE  thanks for your time.

I was only able to see it for a few seconds before it went behind a tree line.  The sun reflecting off of it burnt the retina of my eyes from being so reflective.  Someone else I know has seen it on two separate occasions, where when they saw it during the night time it flew past some trees and the next day when they went back to the same location the trees were burnt around where it was at.  Attempts that she made to take pictures of it resulted in all the film in her camera being totally ruined as if it'd been burnt.  She reported that during the night time it has red and blue lights which I think at another time years before the time I witnessed it in this account, I saw it as well but at night judging by the way she described it.

It was a clear night and we were all enjoying looking up at the stars, pointing out patterns, spotting satelites, and even a shooting star.  As we all sat gazing for the next object to spot, a saucer like object with multiple lights on it flew over head. We watched it fly for about 10 seconds and it was gone.  Immediately following the incedent we all turned to each other in amazement asking if we had seen the object.  It was definetly an UFO. It moved quickly and silently through the air drawing little attention.  The object was fairly close and appeared larger then an airplane.  We could definetly clearly see the shape of the object and that it was nothing man made.  Myself, my brother, and two best friends all witnessed and described the same exact object.

It flew through the sliding glass doors as if they werent even there. I was just amazed...I stood there for about 10 seconds as it just hovered about 4 feet off the ground. It was about the size of a basketball and it was bright bright blue around the outside while the inside got progressivly lighter... a very pale blue...almost white.It was pretty much a basketball sized glowing sphere of light. I didnt feel scared, I had a sense of calmness once I snapped out of being completly in awe I slowly walked closer to it until I was about 2 feet away from it. I slowly reached out my hand to touch it for some reason..maybe because I felt that I had to know it was really there. I got about 3 inches from touching it and all of a sudden it went crazy! It started flying around the room in all sorts of directions up, down,  left, right.. at a very high speed. Then before I knew it, it flew back out the sliding glass doors and up into the sky. As soon as it left I turned to my friend and said ""DID YOU SEE  THAT!?"" since he was to busy looking around in the fridge he missed pretty much the whole event except for seeing something light blue fly out of the corner of his eye.

I stopped and adjusted my backpack and looked again at it and it seemed like 2 or 3 led lights that were together (but orangish colored) close together and I couldn't tell what it was-looked like it was staying in one place which was weird. So I started moving toward it and walked down the trail after it.  It stayed there slightly off the trail.  As I got closer I couldn't see it because it was hidden behind the trees that were along the trail. When I got closer to the left hand side of the trail I put my back pack down on the side of the trail and walked up and over the side of the trail and though the woods -when I got to the top of the hill on the side of the trail and was in the woods I could see in this big field (for cows -but they have no cows) this column of light. The column of light was an amber and light yellow.  Similar to a column (about 20-25 ft tall and about 1 1/2ft wide) Within the column were vertical 2-3"" beams that were amber and yellow in color.  The whole column slowly rotated from the left to the right, in place and smaller beams the same (2-3"") would move from the center of it like it was scanning the grass bellow it from the column out around it about 3-4 feet out -from the center about ten feet up.  It hovered above the ground by a few inches, it slowly moved within a small area along the field less than six to ten feet that I saw it move.  I don't recall it making any sounds. There was no metal or glass, only beams of light. An amber & yellow column of lights (like a information or energy gathering satellite device) I don't know, that's my best guess. I thought it was gathering information or energy from the area below it-I was so frightened that I only could watch it for a few minutes once I found it doing that.  I wanted to run and was scared it would follow me.  I calmly and briskly walked away from it and kept looking back.  I don't know how it got there or what ever happened after I left. I always look toward that side of the trail even to this day.  I know it wasn't anything supernatural.  It was a far more intelligent being than us that was in controlling it.  I just thought someone should know what I saw. If there was a way in this medium I would for you.  It would take less words. When I noticed this site I thought it important to explain what I saw to a credible place and have it documented.  Unfortunately I had no cell phone back then with a camera with me.

My mother, brother, and I were driving back to my mom’s house when I saw a very bright light in the sky in the midst of all the tall leafless trees. It caught my attention because it was bigger than anything else shining in the sky and a lot brighter.  I had to interrupt their conversation twice so that they could take a look at what I was seeing. My mom’s house was located in a large area where the only lights you could see outside were the front porch lights if that. As we got closer to my mom’s, which meant more darkness, the one bright light seemed to change into about 8-10 colorful lights all blinking in a row. This caused my mom to stop the car on the road and we all proceeded to get out of the car and look up at the object. It was a round shaped, saucer like object, however only half of the circle was lit. It seemed very quiet and it was right above our heads in the sky. It almost seemed like it was planned for us to be right underneath it. After we snapped out of it, I told my mom “Let’s go tell the guys, they will never believe us! Hurry before it goes away!” I wanted my step-father and husband to observe this UFO so that they wouldn’t think we were crazy when we told them about our sighting. We rushed back in the car and drove to my mom’s about 7 seconds away from the sighting.  As we ran out of the car and made it to the porch the UFO flew off at a speed I had never before seen in my life of anything in the sky. It was in the next city in a matter of 2-3 seconds I believe.  Of course as we came inside to explain what we had just witnessed they laughed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As usual, there were small aircraft occasionally flying overhead and several private fireworks displays going off nearby. I pointed out to my wife a steady, orange light in the sky, slightly smaller than Venus, in the west. The object was moving at a steady rate from west to east, unblinking, without changing apparent direction. After watching it for about 5 seconds, the light ""winked out"" and very briefly returned to view, continuing its course, before ""winking out"" again. The sky was not yet fully dark, but the light source of the object was distinct and bright. The ""winking out"" seemed to be consistent with a 90-degree turn along the plane of sight, but there was no continuation of sight after the second ""winking"" episode. The light did not flash, nor were there any standard airplane colored lights (red, green, or white) associated with it. I am unable to judge the distance of the object or its actual size. In shape it appeared to be circular, perhaps because of distance. I have taken courses in astronomy and have seen many satellites and meteors over the years. This object was too bright to be a satellite; it was not yet dark enough and the ambient light should have been sufficient to block a satellite from view. The sudden ""winking out"" was inconsistent with a satellite. It moved too slowly to be a meteor.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,41.45230000000001,-79.8608

I observed this at approximately 9:30 pm CDT.   I live in an area where air traffic is common (near Forbes Field) where the 190th Air National Guard Refueling is located.  It is not uncommon to see Refueling aircraft fly over, as I live close to the flight path.  I know what an aircraft looks like at close range and what I saw was not an aircraft (plane or helicopter).  I first observed this object and quickly noticed it was unusual.   At first it appeared to be a meteor. I called to another family member to come see this object.  It was a bright orange and appeared to be somewhat triangular to diamond shaped.  It was hard to distinguish an exact dimension or shape because it appeared to be flying in a haze or smoke from fireworks.   Our weather that evening had been stormy/humid and there appeared to be some fog or haze in the sky.  However, the object was first vis! ible many miles away, and was clearly seen, so I am not sure why there appeared to be this ""haziness"" to the object when it was overhead.   As I stated earlier, the object was moving from due west to due east.  It flew directly overhead.  It was hard to determine its height, because I really couldn't determine its size and make a relationship guess, but it appeared to be 800-1000 feet high.  Again, because it was difficult to determine size and height, its speed is only an estimate...approximately 300-400 mph.   Again, I watch aircraft coming and going from Forbes Field (mostly shortly before landing and after take-off), and I'm judging the speed of this object in relationship to those observations.  I heard no sound from the object at any time.  I observed the object for 30-40 seconds, then went to a different location and watched it continue moving east for another 15-20 seconds.   It appeared to go into a cloud bank because it disappeared quickly and somewhat unexpectedly. ! It didn't just fade away but disappeared abruptly, either int! o a cloud bank or whatever.  It did not quickly change directions...just disappeared suddenly. When I first observed it, I thought it might be a meteor.  It's speed, however, was too slow and it was relatively close to the ground.  There was no tail or anything that trailed behind.   My immediate impression was that I had seen something I couldn't explain.  I thought, because so many people were out with fireworks that evening, that I would here something about this on the local news that night or the next day.  I've heard nothing...until out of curiousity I ""Googled"" it.   I had been thinking that all those drugs as a kid finally had taken its toll and I was seeing things..lol.  Anyway, I was somewhat releived to see that other shared the same experience.   Hopefully this description will help you. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me and I will try to better explain my observations.   Good luck.....",2010-07-19T00:00:00,39.03386902439024,-95.75722975609757

This is about 8 miles North of Omaha, Nebraska. On the night of the fourth of July, I was standing out at the end of my driveway taking pictures of fireworks with a Canon 40D SLR with a digital image stabilizing lens that is 70-300mm zoom.  (About $3000.00 worth of equipment). I was not using a tripod, but hand held so I could move around to catch the fireworks. The front of my house faces straight West.  The night had a broken cloud base, more open than clouds.   At approximately 9:55 pm I noticed a reddish orange light to the South, South west from where I was standing about 2 to 3 miles away coming from the Bennington Nebraska area.  It was moving very slow to slow to be a plane and heading almost straight North.  It had no blinking lights at all. It was just above the cloud base.   I had my camera set on manual mode and was running the shutter speed between 4 and 8. I took a few pictures of the light and after zooming in on it I could see that it wasn’t one light, but three real close together.  We have had helicopters come by and at about that distance before and we could not hear a thing when normally we could.  After watching it for about 5 minutes, I went back to the house to get my wife and show it to her.  Of course she saw it also. They continued to travel North until they were just South of my location, then took a 90 degree turn to the East for a very short distance (guessing ½ to 1 mile) then another 90 degree turn back to the South.  Looking at the night sky it would be like the directions of the eraser end of a new pencil.  After watching them head back South about ½ the distance from when I first noticed them.  It was like someone threw a light switch and the lights went out.  Gone.  Way before they would have flown out of sight. About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw them again straight in front of my house, looking West.  They looked to be about 1 to 2 miles out.  There were different times that through the camera I could see that they didn’t stay in a group, but would spread out in a line.  If it was one object I would see a leader and then a trail, with the lens settings I was using,  However you can see the trails, but with three balls in the trail.  A leader, one in the middle and one towards the end.  I took 55 pictures of them in all.  They kept heading in a Northern direction and it looked like they would have gone just North of Blair Nebraska.  Some pictures came out pretty good, some not, due to the speed of the lens or my movement.  The entire time that they were visible was about 20 to 30 minutes.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,41.455,-96.023

At the edge of this band of light the sky turned very dark.  In the dark area there appeared an unusual “disc” of gold or orange-colored light.  It stood out in stark contrast to its nearly black surrounding.  The disc stayed in a fixed position at about 75 degrees up in the NW sky for several minutes, then appeared to “drift” several degrees – perhaps 10 – upward and northward, then stopped again before fading away.  The night sky was cloudy and it looked like the disc faded out, it was not covered up by the clouds. The disc reminded me of the symbol for a hurricane on a weather map.  It was round, but had one point instead of the two found on the hurricane symbol.  It was also blurry and indistinct. The diameter of the disc appeared to be between a quarter and a half of the diameter of a full moon.

Roughly 60 degrees above the horizon, to the NNE, we noticed a large orange orb (mag of at least -8) moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  Looking closer we also noticed an other smaller object, white in color in front of the orange object.  The smaller object was visually typical of a satellite with a mag. of +4 or more, barely visible.  I was intrigued as it was not the space station as it would pass on the Southerly horizon. Mid way across the sky the two object disappeared.  This was also not a meteor as the two objects appeared to move much slower than a meteor.  There was no sound.

It was myself, a 31 year old female and my five year old daughter, my brother and his two children ages three and five, and my parents who are both in their fifties.  We all live next door to each other  in a very rural development at the base of Green Mountain which is known locally for UFO sightings.  It was about 10:35 PM and we had just finished lighting our fireworks.  The sky was clear and we were just catching one last glimpse of the fireworks being lit by the neighbors and getting ready to round up the kids and to say goodnight.  As we were watching the eastern sky we saw a round object very similar in shape to a balloon appear and it was heading in a westerly direction.  It was mostly red with a bright orange glow on the bottom third of the circle.  At first, we actually thought that it was a helium balloon that someone had lit on fire and set free.  But, ! the object was not acting like a balloon would.  It would speed up, slow down, hover for a bit, change directions slightly and then suddenly veer off.  We watched it for about three minutes over my brother’s house and then we noticed that coming in from the south was another one exactly like the first.  This one was moving very quickly and heading right for the first one.  When it was next to the first one they hovered silently together for about five minutes before they went straight up into the sky.  Needless to say we were very disturbed but frankly we weren’t sure if we had seen a UFO or some strange balloon trick by Fourth of July pranksters.  It wasn’t until last night when my brother was fooling around on the internet and found some reports of sights that we were sure of what we had seen.  I personally have not read any other accounts or seen any videos of similar sightings, but I will be looking at them once I get this report filed to see how similar other sighting ! were to ours.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,47.599319157088125,-122.6697122605364

It made no sound. There were no other people around and everyone I told the story said ok and rolled their eyes as though I made it up.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,

I was camping with my mother at Gavins Point Dam near Yankton. South Dakota.  We were in the first camping area above the dam on the South Dakota side.  I was young. it was at a time that women didn't work and many mothers and children were camping.  I looked at the road across the dam to see my dad (I was looking for him to come to camp from work) and the sky which had been full daylight turned black.  The sky was completely black there was no daylight.  From the sky came down a beam of light.  Not like a flashlight but slowly down to the river. The beam of light then went scanning the up the river and then the beam came back towards where it started still focused on the river.  The beam went back up as it had come down and the sky became blue.  Everyone at the campground was yelling UFO, UFO.  And then it happened again.  The entire sky became black and the beam came down to the river it scanned the river up and down.  And then the beam went back up and the sky became blue.  Everyone was yelling UFO, UFO.  And then the park rangers drove around with a blow horn saying ""what you have just seen was a rare phenomenon in the weather ""over and over. And that night or afternoon when my dad came home from work we (my mother and I) didn't tell him what happened.  We had forgotten, I think everyone forgot. About a year later I was in Omaha, NE and I saw the movie ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind"" and while watching the show I remembered.  After the show I asked my mom if she remembered and she said she did but I think she was humoring me. When In college I went to a lecture on ufos and they talked about the beam of light.  It was the first time I had heard anyone talk about it.  They invited anyone that had seen a ufo to talk to them after the lecture.  I wanted to but I was afraid. Later in  college I was taking a course in meteorology and they talked of rare phenomonens in the weather and I wanted to ask about what I had seen.  I was still confused by the rangers then.  I was to afraid to ask and also I knew sort of that it wasn't a weather phenomenon that  I would have been asking about. Some time later I was at a ufo convention in Lincoln, NE.  Stanton Friedman was there and I told him my story about what I saw and about my memory.  And he said there was a lot of government in South Dakota which I still don't understand. Besides having my memory stepped on I believe I was given a fear program.  I think it was to cause me not to talk about what I saw if I did remember.  The first time I told my story at the UFO bookstore to a group I was really unusually scared to say it.  After I told my story for the first time there was no fear of telling it again. I would love to hear from anyone that was camping that same day and saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,42.9359,-97.4405

Me and my 2 brothers were heading back home from playing tennis in a small town about 12-15 minutes from where we lived.  We were heading due west on county road 318 into a small town called Flemington Florida, SW of Gainesville Florida approximately 20 miles.   My 17 year old brother was driving his Impala down a slight hill and I was in the passenger seat and for some odd reason was looking to my left, which is the driver's side and seen a large oval bright white object heading in a south to north direction which would have put it directly in front of my brother's car.   I said to both my brother's look look what is it?  Nobody knew, so I told my brother to pull over to the shoulder of the road and he did hesitantly.   The car was still running and in park, as the object go closer he said I am leaving, and  I said no I want to see what this is, I than grabbed the keys out of the ignition put them in my hand, got out of the car and sat on the hood of the car while this object came closer and closer.   It was oval shaped, no lights, but a very bright white glow that did not hurt your eyes.  By this time it was moving right over the front of the car at a very slow rate of speed, and was absolutely quiet.  I would estimate the object was about 100 feet in diameter and it nearly directly over us and I could hear my brother saying lets get out of here.  My response to him was why if they wanted to do anything to us we couldn't do anything about it anyway.  So while I was sitting on the hood looking at this thing I had a really weird feeling that they knew everything about me.  It's hard to explain.   So then after a few more minutes as it started going away from the car to the north of us I noticed it higher in the sky and in a blinking of an eye it flew off.   It was a clear evening right around twilight when all this happened!.   We finally got home about 5 minutes later and I remember the first thing my mother said as my 17 year old brother walked into the house (my god you look like you have seen a ghost).

So i left and started back home and decieded to stop at the people's house who owned that piece of property to tell them what i had seen. I wanted them to know in case something had happened to any of their cattle. Well finially when i got home and ready for bed, because i had to go to work the next morning. I heard this humming, buzzing sound over the top of my appartment building. I thought to my self, oh no that UFO followed me home. I grabed my little dog and covered both of us up with the covers.

I don't know the exact date because I was only around 12 years old at the time.  I was in the family room watching TV with a few other family members which included my father. My older brother was out in front of the house trying to make time with his girlfriend. He saw something in the sky and came running into the house to tell my father to come have a look. Being a big fan of Star Wars and Close encounters at that time I wasn't going to miss a chance to see something that maybe out of this world. We grew up down the street from a Dallas navel base. To this day my brother clams that it was directly over the base. I remember it being directly over the house. What we saw was not a disk or craft of any kind. It wasn't scary to me at the time but has become so, as I have still to this day never even heard of anything like this being viewed by any other UFO observer. It was a cloud that had the center of it's mass erased. In the center was a series of neon blue lines that changed every 5 seconds or so. First look it was parallel blue lines. Then the lines would change direction. Reverb and change into something like dots. Then wavy lines and continued to do this kind of thing for about 5 to 6 minutes. It looked like a TV that was having trouble getting a signal. As if this cloud was one big hallow gram that was having trouble getting the center portion to work.  By this time a crowd of about 10 people where standing in the front yard looking up at this thing. At first I thought it was a blimp. I know that blimps have display screens but at the time couldn't do this kind of thing. I stayed in the front yard looking up for the next 2 1/2 hours thinking I'd see a blimp exit the clouds. Nothing! No noise, No craft, No blimp! I lived with my parents in the house from 1971 to 1993. I've never seen a blimp that large Nor have I seen one in the area because of the naval base being so close (4 Miles). I've been pouring over the UFO web sites to ! try and see if anyone has heard of or seen anything like what I've described. I've had no luck at all. I do have witnesses of the event. This includes 2 of my brothers, A sister and my father.I'm 37 now and It would be great to talk to others that may have seen something like this.

I believe it was Sunday, September 4th 1983, but it could have been a later Sunday that month.  Dan was in his late 20’s at the time, an insurance salesman, married with a 7-year old child.  I was a just a boy in high school, editor of the school paper, active in the marching band and school plays.  I went on to a successful career in radio broadcasting and commercial voice-over. Dan was driving, and I was in the passenger seat of his black 1978 Gremlin.  We were going approximately 50 miles per hour, due west along Washington Street Road between Argenta and Maroa, roughly two miles west of Maroa and Illinois Highway 51 North.  It was sometime past three o’clock in the afternoon, as we were near the intersection of Washington Street Road and Greenswitch Road, just where there’s a junction tower of high voltage lines, where two sets of north-south lines and one set of east-west lines cross.  The temperature was in the mid 70’s so we had the windows down and the radio playing, but not very loud. It was at this moment that I noticed what at first looked like a cirrus cloud--it was a very bright white ""cigar”"" shape, tapering in a very shallow curve from the ends to the middle, the same shape top and bottom, like a discus viewed edge-on.  It was approximately 200 feet above the ground, directly above a farmstead on the left side of the road, about a ¾ of a mile ahead. The shape was noticeably larger across than the farmstead, which consisted of a house, some trees, a couple of equipment barns and large round grain bin.  This would make the size of the object between 100 and 200 yards across, and about 30 to 40 feet thick in the middle, top to bottom.  Immediately, I realized that it couldn’t be a cloud, because it was far too low for a cirrus cloud, and there were no other clouds visible in the sky.  Also, it appeared to be brighter white than a cloud should be.  It appeared to be shining with it’s own bright white light.  In describing it to people, I have sometimes said that it looked as if the sky were a light blue sheet, and someone had cut a horizontal gash in it with a knife, and sunlight was shining through from behind. It was so bright, I immediately thought it might be a glare on the windshield, so I moved my head from side to side, and forward and back, to see if the “glare” moved respectively with me.  It did not.  It just appeared to hang motionless above the farm house.  At this point, I’d been watching it for all of about ten seconds, and I was starting to wrap my brain around it.  I realized that I was looking at a very large luminous solid object floating in the air above a farmhouse.  I felt adrenaline kick-in hard, and I couldn’t take my eyes off it… I didn’t even dare blink. Then I began to be afraid, because we were essentially heading right towards it at 50 miles an hour!  I could hear no sound from it, but with the windows down and the radio on, I can’t say conclusively that it was silent.  My mind was racing, as I could hardly believe my eyes.  I didn’t know whether Dan had noticed it, and I had just thought about telling him to stop the car, when the object moved.  It didn’t seem to accelerate.  One split second, it was absolutely stationary, and the next split second, it was moving at incredible speed, toward us, parallel to the road.  It covered the half mile or so between the farmhouse and the car in less than two seconds, and passed above the car.  Though it moved very fast, I could tell with absolute certainty that it was a circular disc.  It appeared simply luminous white, with no discernable surface features at all.  I lost sight of it as it passed above the car at an altitude of about 200 feet.  I turned around to see if I could spot it out the rear window, but I couldn’t see it.  As I turned back to the front, I caught sight of Dan (a very religious Christian, incidentally.)  He had turned white as a bed sheet.  It was so striking that for a moment, I just sat staring at him as he gazed ahead, eyes transfixed on the road.  Slowly, he turned to look at me.  As his eyes met mine, he snapped his head to the front again.  I could tell he was breathing hard, and his heart was racing. I asked him, ""Dan, did you see that?""  ""That had to be a glare on the windshield,"" he said. ""That was no glare on the windshield, and you know it!"" I said.  He refused to acknowledge what he’d seen, or describe it for me.  He was in an almost catatonic state of denial.  But when I described what I saw, and why I was sure it wasn’t a glare on the windshield, he didn’t contradict my description.  He simply refused to accept that what he’d seen was real. The entire duration of the sighting was less than thirty seconds. I was very agitated and frightened for hours afterward, and I had trouble sleeping for weeks thereafter.  As long as I live, I will never forget the sight of that huge disc above the farmhouse.  I was skeptically curious about UFO phenomena before then, but ever since, I have taken reports of such sightings much more seriously.

It was several minutes until the sun light was gone. She was driving and I noticed to my right a County Squad car was parked on the wrong side of the road on an over-pass above I-94. The red lights were on and I could see the officer looking toward the west (the direction we were traveling) with his hands at his head as if holding binoculars. Traveling further west I commented on how fast the on-coming traffic was traveling. Speed limit is 45 MPH and cars were heading east-bound traveling at an estimated speed of 75 MPH or better (estimated of course). We had crested the first hill and I commented on a low flying what appeared to be an airliner. The ""plane"" and us closed distances after we crested the second hill and I said, ""I think he is going to crash"". I then told her to speed up because I think that he is going to crash on us. It came to a stop above a 20 acre pond and just hovered there. I told her to stop the car and she slowed down to about 15 MPH. I opened the car door and looked up about 250 ft on an obtruse angle. I remember looking from one end to the other judging it to be approximately 300 yds in length and just as wide. At that time two huge bright lights came on shining straight down on the pond illuminating it like daytime. I told her again to stop and she floored it as she was scared and crying. When we arrived home a few short minutes later I grabbed my camera and returned to find nothing there. The object made no sound. When the lights came on you could feel the energy in the atmoshere. It reminded me of tank xenons. The craft appeared like cutting a 747 in half then adding that like fron section to the rear pointing backwards. The width of the craft was the same and intersected at the middle of the first described assembly. Light from the center of these sections (starting half way up from the center-line toward the top) graduated from dim to quite bright at the ! top. Thi s is what made it look like the cigar configuration. I called the Sherrif's Dept. (anonymously) and asked if anyone had seen anything that night. The answer was, ""No"". I then called the Eau Claire Municipal Airport and asked if they had any traffic that night. Again I was told no. That airport has not had any airline (large planes) for years. People laugh when I tell them the story but I know what I saw quite clearly and I also know what I did not hear.

The last issues of the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda published a series of five articles under the loud headline ""KGB Unveils UFO Secrets"". These publications were based on materials from the so-called ""blue file"" that the KGB once compiled concerning the activity of Russian ufologists. However, the newspaper unveiled no secrets at all, the publications mentioned just several instances when UFOs were registered over Soviet military objects. What do these KGB documents testify to?  Do extraterrestrials actually exist?   Or, is it possible that the truth is more prosaic?   A researcher from the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk Pavel Poluyan tells the story. Liquidation of UFO   I saw a UFO for the first time on April 26, 1989:  there was a large luminous ball flying over the Kama River.  In fact, it was a thin air stratum around the ball that was glowing while some part of the ionized gas was blown away by an onrushing flow, and a short flickering track remained behind the apparatus.  The case was later refered to as a ""UFO over Perm"" and was described in the press many times as lots of witnesses saw the phenomenon. It took me several years to outline a practical scheme for explaining the phenomenon that I saw.  As it turned out, everything could be explained without any fantastic hypotheses, just simple rare aerodynamic effects.  The effects are perfectly known more or less now; at least nobody recalls antigravitation when they see the flight of a disk-shaped mini-plane designed by the Saratov EKIP concern.  How does it fly without wings and propellers?  When my article on the principles of UFO flights was published in Komsomolskaya Pravda on November 1, 1995, the editorial staff illustrated the text with the picture of the ""UFO"" produced in Saratov, the mini-plane I've already mentioned. Later, Afontovo TV, in the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk, produced a video where the story that I narrated was supplied with material filmed in the laboratory of superlight aircrafts in the Siberian Aerospace Academy and in the laboratory for experimenting with strong magnetic fields in the Krasnoyarsk Physics Institute.  In 2001, I brought my materials to the editorial office of the popular Russian newspaper Top Secret, but instead of getting my material publicized, I was met by a strange man.  Some man found me in Krasnoyarsk and asked different questions in exchange for generous financing.  He wanted to know whether I knew what material the UFO bodies are made of, if it can land on water; what is more, the man wanted to find out with what scientists I cooperated when I wrote my materials.  After that I understood perfectly well that my surmises concerning secret aircraft designed in the USA (and later in the Soviet Union as well) corresponded to reality, and that I must expound my version in detail.  This is how my book ""Liquidation of UFO"" appeared; now it is available at many Internet websites. You may ask why the KGB left me alone and allowed me to publish my works.  The problem is that I already guessed and publicized the scheme of the first UFO, those that the USA tested at the end of the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s. Modern models are more complicated, as I learned from those who were somehow connected with design and production of such aircrafts. The recent publications in Komsomolskaya Pravda has come in handy. My opinion is that it's high time for the KGB to ""unveil the UFO secret"" so that people could learn the truth from Russia, as it obviously cannot be obtained from American mystifiers. Some romantic readers may think that what I'm going to say is just one of the many versions. However, what you are going to read right now is the truth. But first of all we must separate real ""flying objects"" from other unidentified phenomena, as such cases are observed as well. A group of ionospheric UFOs can be singled out from the unidentified phenomena: these are many-colored lights zigzagging the sky at an unbelievably high speed. These are not objects in fact, but ionospheric spots of reflected light that appear as a result of gas glowing in the spot where two radar rays with specific characteristics cross. Synchronized movement of the rays produces the spots of reflected light that cross the sky at any speed and along any trajectory. Such experiments on modification of the ionospheric environment draw the attention of the public. Another group of UFO phenomena is made up by those which psychologist Cal Jung has described. The fact is that a visual picture produced by the brain is exactly a picture. In other words, it is not transported from the retina into our consciousness, but appears as a result of processing of the information that the brain receives. Sometimes some alien images can intrude into this picture, just exactly the way when some uninvited banner comes up on your computer monitor when you surf the Internet. For example, when a child sees a dwarf going out of a wardrobe, he actually SEES the dwarf, as his brain cannot yet protect the visual picture from other signals. The same can be observed with adults: the brain's work is disturbed under the influence of high-frequency radiation, and strange objects invade the visual picture. It is no wonder that visions of this kind occur when people see ""flying objects"". Unlike pilots who are in a shielded cockpit, accidental witnesses are not protected from microwave radiation that is emitted from these aircrafts. And now let's speak about real ""UFOs"". I hope that readers will be able to compare the following kinds of apparatuses with those that are described in the ""blue file"".  Counterintelligence agents collected only actual facts and knew perfectly well what kind of objects were flying over our military objects. We all remember the old newsreel in aviation history where some strange apparatus, something like a huge umbrella with an engine and a pilot, was demonstrated together with antiquated biplanes and gliders. The ""umbrella"" twitched up and down; when it went down, the apparatus took off and when the umbrella moved up, the aircraft went back to the ground. The umbrella plane was tested by inventor Chance Vought in America in 1911. This very flying device was the ancestor of ""flying saucers"". The first flying saucers used the same scheme but on a higher technological level. The very form of the first flying saucers is flat from below, prominent and streamline on the top; which means that it was very important for these objects to be oriented  with its flat surface down and with a higher head resistance. This fact alone is enough to understand that such discs rest upon the air. As Zhukovsky, the founder of Russian aircraft construction, once said, there is someplce to rest on everywhere in the air. The umbrella plane from the old newsreel is certainly very funny, but do you think that practical Americans spent money on construction of the craft just for fun? Certainly not. The principle of flight based on formation of compression under a vibrating surface is not worse than that used in traditional planes, where the lift (the difference of pressures) arises at the expense of asymmetrical streamline of a wing's form in the oncoming air. In 1911, there were no technologies to use the principle of flight it's maximum. During WWII German aviation engineers employed this principle. But they managed to create only models of one meter long; however, those ""UFOs"" scared American and English pilots very much when glowing balls appeared right before their bombers. At the end of the 1940s, the first flying saucers resembling telephone dynamic speakers appeared: their huge membranes vibrated at a supersonic speed, and a streamline top part consisting of two spherical segments guaranteed the difference of the drag from above and below. A thin metal membrane was set to vibrate with a system of impulse electromagnets. (Later Russian engineers employed this technology in electropulse de-icers, on the wings of Il-86 planes for example. I can name the siberian impulse electromagnetic seismic sources too.)  What is the essence of the aerodynamic effect?  As long as a flying saucer doesn't push out anything like rockets do, there will be no lift. This something can be a ring whirl-vortex of air, as it doesn't draw the disc back. The disc must rest on the vortex just for a couple of microseconds because another vortex is formed within this period. Air rejection gives rise to reactive force, and the disc takes off, and a vortex that appears under the disc prevents the disc from dropping down until another vortex is formed. The time between these vortexes is insignificant. The vortexes draw in much air as they revolve, consequently, a saucer can give it a bigger impulse within the period when a vortex is being formed, and the disc then moves higher. However, the first flying saucers had many defects. First of all, the push surface couldn't resist and broke, causing catastrophies. It was this ""elastic foil"" that US Air Force Captain Jesse Marcell found on a farmer's field; this case gave rise to the sensation about the Roswell incident in July 1947. Secondly, the disc was unsteady and it fell sideways as it slipped off the vortexes. Thirdly, flying saucers with impulse electromagnets were heavy, with high power inputs and couldn't cover long distances (as one source told me, the American military had to deliver their flying saucers to the Soviet shores on submarines). Certainly, this kind of aircraft was improved, but another generation of apparatuses appeared by that time; their airframes were not shaken with electromagnetic fields. It was made of piezoceramics and vibration appeared as a result of the piezoelectric effect. Apparatuses of this generation were no longer in a disc shape, they were balls, ellipses and other volumetric figures surrounded with a halo of ionized gas. Finally, the third generation of flying discs consists of dark objects in which only small zones, vortex activators, are glowing. The light goes downwards when the disc takes off, to the side when it is to move sideways or the light shines in the form of a pointed bracket when manuevering. The zone of vortex activation appears in any part of the airframe covered with cells and contacts. Uneven cells are joined together (this is the base), and voltage is sent to the other cells through a regulating switchboard. The airframe is monolithic and doesn't vibrate, but the adjoining air is artificially ionized, and current impulses that slip by at a megahertz frequency make it expand. The principle of thermal sources of sound is known rather well, but it wasn't effectively used in other scientific fields. Now I would like to mention ""the mysterious material ray"" that flying saucers emit. Ufologists say that with the help of this ray extraterrestrials take people on board their aircraft. The situation is more simple in fact. Molecules are centrifuged and separated in the vortex whirl zone, moisture is frozen out of the air in the cooled area and as a result small crystals form. The light emitted by the activation zone is shining on the crystals. Thus, a UFO 50 meters high described in the article in Komsomolskaya Pravda of February 11 is not an object itself, but the area consisting of vortexes that is illuminated. The glowing zone stops where the lowest vortex loses energy as it expands and ceases to freeze moisture crystals out of the air. When the Soviet borders grew weaker as a result of perestroika, American spy UFOs flooded the sky over Russia. Unfortunately, they were not only collecting information. In December 1989, policemen in the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk saw that several dark flying discs were trying to experiment on electric mains going to the Krasnoyarsk aluminum plant. However, we should also feel for Americans as they have been fooled with extraterrestrial fairy tales all this time, and the misinformation was spread intentionally. I tried to demonstrate how it is done using  the examples from the book ""UFO FBI CONNECTION. The Secret History of the Government`s Cover-Up"" by Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D. however, when a part of my book was published in English, the author emailed to me to express his disagreement. So, the childish fantasy about extraterrestrial beings is currently being turned into a real spy novel. I would like to add that the disclosures I've made were not inspired and financed by the FSB; they are the result of my private, years-long research. I used my personal finances to conduct the research. It is certainly very sad to give up the myth of extraterrestrials. But it's time to grow up and say good-bye to fairy tales. I am not saying so as a confirmed skeptic rationalist, simply as a grown up. Be sure, dear readers, there are more interesting things in the world than extraterrestrial beings. The immortality of the soul and its post mortem fate for example. And those who have been spreading lies in the information sphere and fooling humanity for 60 years already must remember this.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,,

My tour is the night shift 10p to 6a. I wrote down on a note pad as it was happening so the details of what I wrote here are accurate. On 2/17/2009 at 20:47 I was driving to work on Route 80 east in New Jersey when I noticed a group of RED lights up in front and to the left of me. My first thought was radio tower lights, but these didn’t blink.. I then noticed as many as 6 or more cars pulled over on the right shoulder. As I slowed down I seen the drivers of the cars looking in the direction of the lights. Were I pulled over was highway marker 40.5 east bound about ten feet in front of me. Searching a internet map service, I determined I was facing EAST, slightly SOUTH. Sitting still on the highways shoulder I could tell that these nine (9) lights were not moving. They were bright solid red. In a pattern of what I could best describe as a bent letter H. Four (4) slightly curved to the right to make the left side of an H. Two (2) across, but a little higher than the middle as the line of an H, and Three (3) lights slightly curved to the right as the left side of the H. My estimate of their hight was later determined by the cloud formations that night. Altocumulus clouds stay between 6'500 and 20,000 feet. Theses lights were just under the clouds, to a point that the right side of the H patterns 2 lights seemed as if they were slowly pulsing. They were simply going in and out of the cloud formation as the clouds moved. I took a photo 20:48 with my cell phone but it just looks black on the phones screen. I am keeping the photo to open latter on my PC. I called my son at 20:48 to tell him what I was looking at, and yes I did get the (can you see little green men in the windows) attitude. Mind you there was no body structure, just the lights. As I was talking to him a Jet plane passed from South to North (right to left). Clearly saw the planes flashing lights on both wings, which told me he was banked an turning. He was about an inch in length and clearly visible. (Not sure how far away a jet is that looks an inch in length to the naked eye). Newark Airport is close by. As the plane passed under the lights, just to the hight of the lowest light. I would say that the RED lights were closer to me. I then yelled to the two men standing out side of their car if they knew what we were looking at. They were just as puzzled as I was. In searching the internet, my best guess as to the location of these lights is over Boonton Town Reservoir, New Jersey.  Being late for work I left the area and lost sight of the lights at first.  I caught them again just after the 43 mil marker.  They were to my right side of the windshield top, only now in a wavy line of eight (8) across and one (1) was half the distance to the ground below and centered on the line.  Just sitting there.  I lost them as I drove and looked at my clock and it was 21:12.  Please E-mail me and I will send further info/drawings if needed.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

The UFO was only a couple of hundred feet in the sky.  It moved at walking pace and looked like it had a dome on the top of the disk which was faintly illuminated red/pink. It made a quiet noise, similar to a jet engine, but much quieter.  As well as the beams of light it had what looked like green glow-sticks on the rim of the disk.

The color was white it was so far. the more we got closer (my girlfriend and I were running) the more I could focus on it and I began to see it tilt in the air exactly looking like an oval shape but slanted like 40 degree angle.   So we just stared at it(just in aww trying to decipher the thing) because it was quite signifcant to the plane that was flying near it.  The plane turned around for some reason, I dont know if that had anything to do with the ufo thing.  But it was obvious that it was some type of ufo compared to the plane.   For about one minute and a half it was the same slanted oval shape but it began to disapear, fade away, diminish.  Two seconds later, to the left, about thousands of feet away it reappeared but in a regular horizontal oval shape.  Same color, white with just a touch of shine. It was just there doing nothing just! being white and shiny for about 5 minutes.  It started to fade away,  As it was fading away it turned into a small light blue colored dot just diminishing.  We looked all around us for another shape but nothing.   I've never seen anything in the sky like that and I look in the sky quite often seeing falling stars quite often, the stars and astrology type things are amazing.  My girlfriend is the same way.

It appeared to be coming down. It was broad daylight and I have to wonder if other drivers saw it as well, or how they could have missed it. It was matte gray and almost appeared fluid in its movement.  I thought it might be a weather balloon, but I am not sure a weather balloon would be rectangular.  I thought it might be a slowly falling satellite or something.  The rectangle had one vertical side slightly longer than the other.

While doing yard work somewhere around 8pm I heard an airliner flying over. The plane was flying east along a common route. I noticed just above the craft, maybe a few thousand feet or so an orange oval object. The object did not change color or shape, and was flying slower than the airliner. I quickly looked around to see if it's a reflection. The sun had already set, and it was still too bright for satellites to be visible. I am an amateur astronomer and astrophotography, I often track satellites. I continued to watch the object till it was too far away to see. The brightness and color remained the same the entire time. The orange color was similar to maybe an afterburner flame from a fighter jet, or from a rocket engine. The size and shape when I first saw it was similar to an oval pill held at arms length. It was moving too slow to be a fireball, and with its consistent speed and shape there is no way it could have been something burning up.

Our friend (35 yrs. old) was in the pool, facing northeast, talking to my girlfriend who was facing the rest of us, southwest.  It was about 9:30pm or 10pm.  This was July 18th. My girlfriends son and I were facing my girlfriend and our other friend who were in the pool.  The pool is surrounded by condos and palm trees.  As we were all talking, I saw a neon glowing, oblong object ""fall"" from about 500 feet or less at a 45 degree angle, right over the building and palm trees, from right to left. The object was about 50 yards away from us. It disappeared behind the building.  Two of the others saw the same thing, except for them, it started out as a red object that turned green.  I thought I saw yellow inside the green and a black dot inside the yellow. The funny thing is, there wasn’t a trail behind this object and it didn’t make any noise coming down and didn’t seem to crash into anything.  The size was very hard to determine.  It could have been the size of a basketball or it could have been the size of a small car. Nothing went up in the sky, like a flare. No sound was heard from it. No sparks.  Just a closed looped, oblong shaped, red, then green/yellow/black object. We weren’t drinking or anything else. No missile testing. Three of us saw it.

As we watched it travel almost directly overhead toward the East-to-NorthEast direction, we both noticed very clearly that there were no navigation or strobe lights on it as are always on aircraft.  Sky conditions: It is a very clear night tonight but with considerable light pollution in our area so very few stars are visible. The moon is only about 10-15 degrees above the horizon in the South-Southeast, and above and to the right of that is a bright star which may be Saturn (we're not astronomers, but a neighbor had been talking about viewing it with his telescope and it seems to be about in the right direction and time).  We would estimate the brightness of the light to be approximately 2-3 times greater than that of Saturn (or whatever that brightest star is in the S-SE) with a great deal of ""clarity"" and precision to the light, a very bright, pinpoint-like light.  While it very well could be a satellite or the ISS or something else, we felt it worth mentioning here because of two primary reasons:  1)  Complete lack of normal NAV lights or beacons per a standard aircraft configuration.  Only a very bright light, and we noted as it traveled away from us that they also couldn't be landing lights, since it was as bright going away from us as it was overhead.  2)  Apparent speed:  Altitude is almost impossible to guess at here since there was nothing to give away the size...again, it could have been at a normal-high altitude (10K ft. or higher) or in low orbit like a satellite or the ISS.  The only clue to altitude was any sound, and there was none, which gave the impression of a very high altitude (20-30K minimum).  With that altitude, the speed just simply didn't seem right; it was traveling at least twice, if not three times, as fast as any comparable commercial jet that we normally see at that altitude.  Since these two things made it very unusual, we watched it travel the complete distance almost to the low horizon in the distance before it was out of sight.  That took only about 2 to 3 minutes maximum - again, much quicker than the usual commercial or military jet.  It did not change course at any time, altitude did not seem to vary either.  We're mentioning it here primarily for the interest of correlating it with any other sightings tat may coincide, or to see if possibly the ISS or a satellite is the reason.  Background:  Wife and I don't drink, don't do any recreational drugs, not ""UFO-holics"", married 18 wonderful years, in our late-40's / early 50's, wear corrective lenses (glasses for her, contact lenses for me), no regular medications and in good physical and mental health (knock on wood), she is a lab technician and I am an engineer with a lifelong interest in aviation and a few hours towards my private pilot's license, essentially a wanna-be pilot and ""airplane geek"", so have a very fair degree of experience in observing and identifying a very large number of aircraft at different altitudes, positions, and sky/weather conditions.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,38.8175,-77.6308

We (Me, My mother and my brother) were the direct evidences of this event, the next day I heard anothor one who has seen this. On July 18, 2008 at about 10.00PM Tehran time, me and my family have seen two strange V-shaped objects flying up in the Tehran's sky coming among north-east to our position in north-west. At the first sight I thought it's just a lighted kite but after a while I seen that one of the objects disappeared and the other one stopped in the skye in the altitiud under 2KMs. It was compeletly silent and had no identific sound, when it stopped I discovered that IT'S NOT A KITE because there were no wind on that night and if it was a kite and it used the and there were wind on that altitude it should move a slowly and even it was to high to be a kite. After that I brought my telescope and digital camera to take a shot from this object and look at it in a closer view. First I looked on my telescope and I saw that it's a V-shaped objects with 9 colored lights which I can't see the body of this object becuase it's too bright. The color of lights was Blue, Orange, Green and Red and they was blinking. I set up my digital camera with tripod and took some shots from this object with 15x optical zoom (5 MPxl of resoloution) and I also took an IR shot of it to check weather it use Jet engine or not but I saw nothing as a heat based engine in my IR photo! The sky was absoloutly clear and there were full-moon. The 2nd object which I took a shot of it stoped for about 20 mins in the sky and started to move to north-east and it suddenly disapeared. It's movement was not too fast and wasn't too slow either. I saw this object again on the next night on July 19 but just for the short time and it disappeared quickly and I lost to take any shots again on that night.  After then I started to take a video from that object in a normal and IR mode. I have a plan to upload this fully-detailed video to Youtube for public view!  After that night I searched the internet for the same evidences and I found the same thing which have sighted in Tokyo in 2006:  http://www.ufodigest.com/news/1006/tokyoufo.html  I searched again and I found that in 1976, two Iranian Airforce pilots and the tower chief of Mehrabad Airport and many of the Tehran citizens experienced the thing which is partly similar to what I saw that night. Gen. Parviz Javari, was the direct witness and the 2nd pilot who tried to distroy that object but the weapon and control tools of his fighter jet (F4-E) was disabled after trying to target that thing.

Friday night, July 18th, around 11pm just south of the Discovery Bridge on Missouri Highway 370 in St. Charles County, Missouri. I was driving westbound across the bridge around 11pm on our way home. We had been in the car since 9am that day as we had left Panama City, FL after finishing a week's vacation there. That morning we (me, my wife, 2 sons and a neighbor boy we had brought with us) had all tried to guess what time we would arrive home that night. My oldest son had guessed 11:23pm and as we crossed the bridge around 11pm we were only 15 minutes from our house and it appeared he would ""win"". As we passed the sign on the bridge saying ""Entering St. Charles County"" someone made the comment that the Missouri River looked weird. I looked up ahead and saw three white lights shining in the air just south of the highway up ahead. It appeared to be a large plane that was apparently travelling east on its way to Lambert airfield to land. It seemed to have one light on each end of its wing and one on the nose of the aircraft. Although I couldn't actually see the aircraft in the dark, the lights seemed unusually bright or powerful. For some reason I tried to get a rise out of the boys sitting in the backseat and I inexplicibly blurted out, ""If you think that's weird, look at those lights up ahead. It's a UFO!"" Immediately everyone yelled, ""Where?"" Then I told them I was only kidding, it was just a plane on its way to Lambert. As I said this I kept watching the object to see how big of a jet it really was because it seemed to be moving very slowly. The neighbor boy asked if those lights were on a lightstand because they weren't moving. I told him no, it was too high in the air for that but then I realized he was right: it wasn't moving.  The only reason the lights appeared to be moving was because we were approaching the object. As we came off the bridge, the object was absolutely motionless and appeared to be triangle shaped because the three lights were now marking the outline of a triangle. I would guess it was at the most about 500ft in the air. As we passed next to it (below it to the right of it), I kept glancing up at it and now! what I saw were a total of 6 white lights (the three marking the outline and three more at the midpoints) and one red light in the middle. The lights were not as powerful as we passed the object and none were blinking and somehow the object didn't look as big as it did when we were on the bridge. I started shouting, ""it IS a UFO!"" I wanted to pull over, but I was in the passing lane and couldn't get over to the exit. Amazingly all the cars were just driving by like everything was normal. Looking back though, it WAS very subtle and could have been easily missed. The object was absolutely still. No lights were blinking. It looked like headlights from a large plane and if I wouldn't have kept watching it after I made my UFO joke I would have missed it too. Everyone in the car saw the same thing, a black triangle outlined by three white lights and a red light in the middle. I was the only one who saw the three additional lights at the midpoints. The neighbor boy also saw only one of the ""midpoint"" lights. My youngest son thought there was a slight indentation in the rear of the craft. I didn't see this. It looked like a perfect equilateral triangle to me. That's the one thought that kept racing through my mind was how perfect a triangle it seemed to be. As we passed at the closest point, I could actually see some depth or height to the object too but it was essentially very flat. My oldest son tried to take a picture of it with his cellphone out of the rear window, but the headlights from the approaching cars behind us prevented him from finding it in his viewfinder.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,38.772866865671645,-90.55506208955224

The light was white and moving fast and what appeared to be very high, as high as the satallites.  The light would get bright and dim very slowley and seem to disappear but only got dim.  You could still see it through the binoculars while it was dim.   Then as it got overhead we were both surprised to notice at the same time there where more than one and all going in formation and all getting bright and dim at different times.  No noise, no trails and thay kept going north until thay disappeared in the sky.   At that point we saw two aircraft lights coming from the west (Fargo) and head north as if looking for something.

I was with friends but didn't think to tell them as everyone would say they were fireworks (which would be a very logical conclusion, given the time and place). It wasn't until I read reports here on the NUFORC website that I even thought twice about the event.  If people from various parts of Washington all saw these lights at roughly the same time, the lights must have been higher than flares or fireworks.

(Western end of NFR 1020.) 46° 33' 25.95"" N 121° 11' 47.53"" W   This is the former site of a fire lookout tower and has an unobstructed view facing west.   Elevation of the site is about 6500 feet. This is accessible by 4 wheel drive or ATV from Tampico Washington about twenty miles to the east. (Yakima is 30 miles to the east)   We had seen occasional air traffic throught the day, the latest being a C-17 overflying the area from west to east at approximately 1900. I was  preparing dinner around when my friend asked me to identify an “airplane” he was watching.  He pointed out a dark colored triangular flying wing with a span of about 25 feet and a depth of around 6 feet.  When it was pointed out to me it was coming toward us from the west (traveling west to east)  at more or less our altitude. It approached our position eventually overflying us at an altitude of about 500 feet AGL and made a rather leisurely turn to the north and continued along the ridge line eventually moving out of sight in the general direction of Rimrock lake which we could just barley see about ten miles to our north.  Through the whole encounter its speed remained quite low.  I estimate it was moving about 50mph.   My impression was of more or less highway speed.  If I'm correct this is most likely too slow for aerodynamic lift. We passed the night uneventfully and returned home the next day. I at first assumed this was an unmanned aircraft but it had no marking or visible control surfaces. When it turned it did not visibly bank.  Even from directly underneath it was completely silent and its surface showed no visible details of any kind, no jet exhaust, no intakes, no landing gear doors.  When it was approaching I got a decent look at it through binoculars and saw no obvious intakes anywhere. In my opinion it exceeds the state of the art, and I have no idea what would posses anyone to operate such a craft in that time and place unless they are trying to be seen.  thus my decision to report it here.

Hot summer nights,deserted fields between south TX and Mexico always at sunset around 8:30pm to 9:15pm ~ on my way back from work. I have seen these white lights on many occassions (maybe 4 or 6 times), I never reported them for fear of being called silly. The white lights would always take the same pattern; a triangle shape~five white lights total.  The lights would change colors from light blue, then light orange then back to a white light but they would always stay in their pattern. The lights would hoover in the distance over a field, in a very isolated area between the two countries.  This area where the lights hoover, no one travels into, not even the border patrol~it's just too isolated; not even cell phones work out here. The lights would hoover for minutes then as they speed off, two lights would go off north, two would go off south and the lead light would go east (S/E)~this is way I say it's a formation of five lights. My last sighting, this eveni! ng, my son's flash light and binoculors where in the back seat of my vehicle. I used the binoculars to get a closer look at them, at the same time I used the flash light to signal them.  As I focused on the lights (crafts) I could sense they were looking back; I flashed the flash light to get their attention and one of the lights(craft) flickered its light back. At first, I refused to believe they were focusing back at me or signaling me with thier lights.  I continued to focused with the binoculars but the next time I flashed the flash light,I came up with a particular pattern; three long flash, followed by two short flashed, then one long flash and then one short flash.   However, this time all five lights (crafts) flashed their lights at the exact time and in the same pattern!  Now, my self preservation heighten I no longer wanted to play with the lights (crafts)so I put the flast light back in the back seat, but I continue to look with the binoculars at the lights ~ but! longer I looked the stronger the feeling I got (they were loo! king bac k),till it became overwhelming and I put the binoculars down!  I must have looked at the white lights (crafts)maybe 2-3 minutes; during this time frame ~ the five lights (crafts) flickered their lights back to me twice in the same pattern I made up.  When I looked up without the aid of my binoculars the lights were gone, I didn't see them fly off like I normally seen them and this freaked me out.  Even though I couldn' see the light(crafts), I sense they were still around. I didn't want to stick around to find out. On my way home, I stopped at HEB and went shopping, then I stopped at an ice house to buy a beer, went the long way home ~ I guess to throw them off (right!).  About a mile or so from my house, my son's flash light starting blinking(flashing)!!  I really would have chalked it up as being nothing, but the flashing light pattern was the one I made up for those crafts in the sky.  Of course, I through out the flash light and the binoculars, I bought my son some other! ones.  I pulled up to my house, about 10 minutes later, stepped out of my pick-up and looked up into the night sky to see a beautiful Texas' starry night.  I took a second look into the night, just before I stepped into my house; I saw a triangle pattern of no stars over my house maybe the size of a football field, my front door closed. I immediately open my door again to take a third look but the dark triangle silohuet was gone, the stars were back.  I just wanted to tell you my story, you know~just in case.  I have not been out there since this incident, I have been taking my wife's car to work and taking another route home, but I am willing to make another trip out there to take pictures, video and sound track if it would help?  Just do not mention my name. You can email, but I will not talk or see anyone. Andromeda",2009-08-27T00:00:00,,

In the evening as we were heading north on I-5 about 10 miles south of the Corvallis exit, we saw a strange cloud-like shape in the sky.  It was strange because it was darker than the few other clouds in the sky that were lighted from behind due to the setting sun.  It was also much, much lower and a had a very distinct full shape as opposed to the other clouds that were high, thin and flat in the sky that are typical in Oregon on hot summer days.  We both saw the object and began to discuss what we thought it was.  At first we thought that maybe it was a cloud, and then maybe a helicopter, but it was difficult to decide at first.  As the object got closer we realized that it was distinctly changing shape.  It would be wide and round and then stretch and thin out.  Then after about 5 minutes of watching it, the object distinctly began moving away from us.  It headed north, which we were already travelling 70 mph in the same direction, which shows that it was! moving at a significantly high velocity.  Then over the span of about 5 seconds the object disappeared.  It did not move out of sight due to distance but faded or dissolved from sight from the edges in. This was very clear and when we realized that what we saw was not normal and not anything that we could identify except as extraterrestrial.  As a skeptic I never thought I would ever see a UFO, however I cannot explain what I saw in any other manner than something beyond this world.  I have tried to find others who may have also seen this because I-5 is a very busy freeway and was so close to the city of Albany.  If we had not both witness this strange experience then I may have not believed what my own eyes had seen.  It was strange to think about this other possibility of UFOs, those that do not emit light and appear to try to blend into the surroundings.  It greatly changed what I think about the possibility of something out there that is from beyond our world.

It looked like a star, but it was red, and far brighter than any star I have ever seen (besides the sun). It was too bright and did not move like a plane or helicopter, too slow to be a satellite or a shooting star.  Similarly, the red light’s movement was erratic thus eliminating any-other known celestial body following a constant orbital path.  It was just above the trees down the street, in the southwestern sky. I called back to my friend, who was walking back inside, to come look at the light. We watched the light for approximately 20 minutes. Over the course of the 20 minutes the light grew fainter and fainter.

It was dimming faster than it was before. It would flicker, get slightly dimmer, then brighten again. Every time it flickered it would become slightly less bright. Then when it became as dim as the stars around it, it started flashing and falling towards the earth. It moved faster than it did when it was moving in the previous 20 minutes.

After a short time it passed directly over the top of us.  I turned the radio off and let me window down as my father opened the moonroof on the car and slowed.  It was maybe 500 ft. up and moving VERY slowly, approx. guess would be 40 - 50 miles and hour, with ABSOLUTE silence.   As it passed we could vaguely see the outline of the craft in the dark sky, which we can only describe as somewhat ""stealth-like"" and in the rough shape of a B2 bomber.  It had a very bright light on ! the front of the craft (or at least the part that was in front) and a light on each other corner.  All were white.  It did not spin or move off course in any way, almost appearing to have been fixed in its course, but once again, in dead silence and a constant speed that could have easily been kept up with in our car without breaking any speed laws.  It was very dark, I could only guess black.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,33.5547,-84.1872

Sky was very clear, usual air traffic (there's a small airpirt in Apopka, Orlando International and now Sanford Intertnational, so we're used to plenty of planes in the sky). Stars were also clear. As I passed Wekiva Springs Road intersection, I noticed two very bright lights in the sky. My immediate thought was two abnormally bright stars, but they were moving towards me, so I assumed jet plane. Then I realized how big (wide) this plane had to have been, and there were no blinking lights or red/green lights. Only two bright white lights. It seemed to be descending, which I thought was odd, and then it started to bank hard left. My heart dropped, because I thought for sure this huge plane was about to crash land. But then I realized it stayed in the same path. Then it changed directions and banked hard right, also staying on same path. That's when it started looking like two lights rather than one object. It then spun in a complete circle while still traveling and descending, and that's when I lost it/them behind the treeline. I looked to my right to see if any other drivers had seen, but they were distracted on their cell phones. I rushed home, my husband was outside, and I asked him if he heard or saw anything, but he did not. It's still difficult to tell if it was one large plane with two bright lights on each wing or two separate light spheres that were flying in some sort of formation together. All I know is that it was no ordinary plane, and they were not stars. I thought the other planes would have seen them for sure... but I haven't seen any other reports yet. This is my first time looking, though... still new to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Please use revised addition. Last night, Nov 13th, 2009, was the only clear night I've been able to use my telescope in over 3 weeks.  At approx 11:15 pm I saw three low flying silent green orbs traveling from east to west at low altitude. They followed the normal flight path that commercial aircraft use to land in Vancouver.  I am very familiar with commercial aircraft, however I was not able to identify these objects.  The last of the three appeared to be a glowing disc flying through the night sky as if a green halo around the craft itself. Now I am going to speculate and offer my own explanation.  Stealth aircrafts have their afterburners turned up so that they are not heard easily from the ground at low altitude.  There also might be a green light on the top of the aircraft.  As the afterburn of fuel from their engines is directed upwards it might have caused condensation to form thus appearing as a glowing green object from the ground in the cool temperature.  I guesstimate the speed at approximately 700-1000 miles per hour yet no sonic boom which is curious indeed.  However we know this technology has been worked on for years to what level of success I don’t know.  We also know that a condensation halo can be formed around an aircraft at speed depending on atmospheric conditions. I am an amateur astronomer and have been for years but I've never ever seen anything like this before either prior or post military.  I don’t want to say that they were extraterrestrials but I really don’t have any explanation for this at all.  I always like to error on the side of caution.

The weather conditions were clear skies at dusk - but with plenty of light in the skies to make out objects - blue skies, not complete nightfall. The object appeared to be approximately one mile in elevation and perhaps about two or three miles away from my location - straight shot.  Skies were clear, there is little to no air traffic over southwest Virginia and if there are planes then typically at very high elevations - so lights normally appear very small. The light formation was composed of three large, horizontally oriented, oval shaped lights that were relative close to one another, like my depiction below with parentheses, and the lights appeared to wrap around the structure. (                    )(                   )(                  )   Three things stuck out about the lights:   1) Lights made the structure appear much larger than any aircraft that would normally fly into the private airport that is located in Blacksburg - any aircraft that would be flying that low would be flying into or out of that airport;  2) There were no red and blue flashing lights indicating the wing tips that would be required  3) The lights made no movement, they appeared to remain at the same point in the sky even as I drove closer towards them. Finally, the three lights simultaneously dimmed down, like a light dimmer switch you would have in a living room, rapidly until no lights remained.  At this point the sky was still light enough to make out the shape and color of any craft had the lights just been turned off, or if the lights were on the front of the craft and they had just turned a new direction that would not allow the lights to be seen anymore - but nothing remained in the sky.

I am posting this because neither of us can think of who you call and there have to be other people who saw this. It was over our neighborhood near a large shopping area, but our neighborhood is still darker at night which we guess is why we could see the object. It was black-ish with what looked like moving/flipping panels that would catch the light as it moved or reflected some light we could not see. When he first saw it he thought it was birds, but there was no bird sound and then we both realized how large it was. And that it was diamond shaped. Plus it was blocking out the sky as it moved. As it moved away I could hear a hush noise, like snow flakes or a low white noise sound. He did not pick that up, but we both know my ears are more sensitive and he is getting over a cold. Also as it moved away it turned into a triangular shape and we could really see the tile-like things flipping. The object was moving overhead toward the downtown of the city we live outside of, so a straight line following a major interstate seemed to be its path or to pass over the interstate at some point. East-Northeast(emphasis on East). It left behind a massive white trail similar to what planes can leave behind but huge. My husband wants me to add that it was not like an exhaust trail, but more like displacement? No other way to explain how it looked or felt but displacement. Also as it was moving it passed in front of a plane that was much higher up and the object totally blocked the light out of the plane. I always carry a strong flash light when we walk at night and it did not even reflect off of this object. Either it was much higher up, which means it was even larger than we think, or it was non-reflective. We watched it from tonight 7:07 pm until 7:09 when it moved out of our field of vision. It became a straight line like this but massively thick ______. It seemed as though one of the diamond's points flattened to make the triangle and then the the front point of the triangle flattened to make a wide line. If you have ever seen ticker tape or confetti that was how the tile thing looked when they were moving. Birds do not have exhaust and that trail was not there until the object went by. No air craft we know of is that quiet, I am a Military Brat and have grown up around planes so I know their sounds. It can't have been a Stealth because we would have felt that and it would have to have been really low to block the sky in the way it did. No way we could not have felt it were a low flying Stealth! Also we realized after we saw the trail that in fact there were two other trails spaced evenly and parallel to the one this craft made.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,35.96156134085213,-83.98011528822055

The speed they flew appeared to be much faster than that of an airplane or other type of air craft.  The objects were all circular, bright lights, but were dimmer than stars.

We did not hear a sound when we saw them flying in the sky, like you would from any type of aircraft. They first flew in a formation.  The middle UFO then  flew slightly ahead of the others, and at times the other two would also briefly get out of formation.  When they shifted out of formation, it appeared quick and had a slight bounce to them.  They were very fast and flew slightly lower and higher in the sky, but all stayed near each other the entire time.  The path they took was not a straight line like you would see a falling star or an airplane do. After heading northeast! , they quickly dimmed and simply disappeared.

UFO Report:  February 27, 2008, 6:00 pm at Lee Vinnings, CA   This is the second UFO sighting I have had in my 61 years. The first was when I was 15 in New Jersey, and I will report that another time.   However, this more recent on was last year in 2008, occurring in Lee Vinning, CA, on Feb. 27th, around 6:00pm  as my wife and I were driving north on Hwy. 395.  I have to estimate the time because it was just starting to get a bit dark, and we were probably a bit north of Lee Vinning as well, but this is the general time and place.  I remember the date exactly because we were driving from Georgia to my son’s wedding on the 29th of Feb. in Fremont, CA. two days later.  Also, the reason I wanted to report it now is because I saw the exacted same thing a few nights ago on the History Channel’s program UFO Hunters.  They had a sighting around 3am around Needles, CA of a blue-green glowing rectangular craft streaking across the sky and coming down, which was later picked up by 4 military helicopters and taken away still glowing.  This occurred only three months later in May of 2008. As I was saying, my wife and I both saw this blue-green glowing rectangle streak across our field of view in front of us from West to East, or left to right, since we were heading north.  It took about 2 seconds, maybe only one actually to cross our field of view and it was gone.  I was amazed to have seen such a thing and do not believe it was a meteor because of the unusual color and rectangular shape.  Also, it appeared to be arching upward rather than down.  I guess we assumed it was a secret Air Force vehicle, being that Edwards and Area 51 were not that far from us.  But after the UFO Hunters story, I feel as though I would like to add my sighting to your files. As an artist, I did a quick drawing of our sighting in Photoshop and my wife just now confirmed that this is what she also saw that night last year.  I will attempt to attach the drawing to this report.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,38.035,-118.8256

J. and C. were drinking beer, but still not nearly drunk. I was completely sober when this occured because I hadn't acquired a taste for beer at the time. I'm more of a wine enthusiast, but I didn't have any alcohol in me at the time. We were stargazing, and there was an unusual number of shooting stars because of one of the meteor cycles. If I remembered the date, I could be more specific. Unfortunately, I don't recall the exact date or time of this occurance and I didn't have a camera handy because I don't just sit there with a camera expecting odd things to happen. Nor do I expect that any camera I've ever had before my newest one could take a clear picture of what I'm about to describe. Anyhow, me and J. were laying on our backs looking up at the sky while C. was laying on her chest facing the other direction. Suddenly, an array of about 6 lights flew overhead. Excitedly, both J. and I sat up. ""Did you just see what I saw?"" I asked. ""I'm glad you asked. I thought it might've been the beer,"" said J. ""No. It definitely wasn't,"" I said. ""What did you guys see?"" C. asked. J. and I just looked at eachother and we both said, ""A UFO.""  ""Or maybe more than one,"" I thought aloud. J. agreed. Anyhow, C. was ticked off because she believes in UFOs and aliens and the like but J. and I are more skeptical but open-minded. Still, I can't deny that I saw something strange that night. It couldn't have been a usual airplane or helicopter because the lights were just wrong. They weren't blinking, and they were in sort of a V formation, but offset like a flock of birds and in the same sort of flight path (diagram below), but making no noise. *---*---* | * | * | *  I know there's a Gov't nuclear site called the INL (previously INEEL) nearby, so perhaps it could've been something in connection with that, especially since whatever this UFO was seemed to be heading that general direction. I've been on the INL site before, but it was in high school for a field trip and there were limits on where we were allowed to go because a lot of top secret research goes on there. I know they've had connections with the air force before though, because of stories from a previous employer. I understand that seeing a unfamiliar aircraft can make a person uneasy as make us start thinking about aliens and all sorts of things because the members of his community had the same reaction when they saw the first airplanes flying overhead and then their first helicopter. Anyhow, back to my story.... As these UFOs came in, they slowed down and nearly came to a stop (though not directly over us, and I have the feeling whatever they were, they were entirely unbothered by our presence). They were heading s/sw, but shortly after passing over us and slowing, they abruptly changed course about w/sw. To me it seems they were either headed for the INL or attempting to just barely avoid it, or waiting for directions to a landing site. Whatever the case is, they made some sort of course correction, so I highly doubt it was just a group of shooting stars. In fact, that possibility is entirely implausible in my opinion. I think it's important to also state that there is an airport just minutes from my apartment, nearly due north, but this UFO appearance was heading the wrong direction to have either taken off from the airport or to have been heading for it. It was flying low enough that we should have heard noise and I could almost make out the shape of an object, but not quite, and any shape I might have seen might have been an optical illusion from the lights. My best guess is that if this was a single object though, it was either triangular or even in cube shape, though a triangular object seems more aerodynamic and thus more logical to me. It seems to me this was more than one object though and that they were ""connected"" but not by any physical means, if that makes any sense. Either by some magnetic field or a programmed flight path.

Idaho UFO history includes Cougar Mountain, Smiths’ Ferry.  I have noticed that much of Idaho’s UFO history from before 1970 is totally missing now unless you happen to own a copy of Frank Edwards’ book, ""Stranger than Science.""   I cannot find my issue, if I even still have it, but I know one of the entries from personal experience. During the summer of 1957 my Dad and my Uncle Paul worked together in a post and pole business located one mile west of Donnelly.  In mid-August of that summer they had an order to fill one hundred miles south near Nampa.  The flatbed truck was loaded and they left early one august morning.  When they returned late that night both were filled with an incredible story. When returning from the Nampa-Boise area they took the only route available which was Idaho State Route 15.  Years later the road would be widened and made a bit straighter and renamed SR 55. Uncle Paul was driving and my Dad was the passenger. Traveling north the trip was uneventful until the moment they turned onto Rainbow Bridge just north of Smiths’ Ferry. By the time they reached this area it was twilight or past 9pm. Also, there was no other traffic on the highway at the time. This area is also known as the Cougar Mountain area. At least once a decade, when traveling through the same area, I would ask my Dad to tell the story and point to what he saw. Most recently was in 2003, not too long before he passed away. The story never changed. In mid-August, 1957 at about 9-9:30pm, northbound Hiway 15 (55) passes Cougar Mountain Lodge and the road continues following the Payette River.  Both the road and the river become narrower with some zigzagging prior to reaching Rainbow Bridge.  The road makes a sharp right onto the bridge.  At that point my Dad yelled “STOP!” and the old flatbed truck was nearly in the middle of the bridge before coming to a complete stop.  What my Dad had seen was something large and glowing coming right up the river at about the same level above the water as the bridge. As they came to a stop the large object rose slightly to avoid the bridge and missed the cab of the truck by mere feet. Once over the bridge it dipped about 30 feet down to the river then pulled up in a high arc reaching about 500 feet higher than they were, then dove straight down onto the top of a hill. They watched a bit of an explosion, but did not notice any burning of the dense forest. The land had not been logged and th! erefore no roads existed leading to the crash site at that time. My Dad described the object as circular and shiny on top with a nearly flat bottom. The entire disk glowed with a bright purplish color and was traveling up the river and through its arc at about 60 mph. It was half the width of the bridge making it about 100 feet in diameter.  My Dad would seem to be a good person for observation. He was retired from the Air Force with the rank of Master Gunnery Sgt. He had been in the Flying Tigers and when evacuated from China he was sent to school for the Norden Bomb site and spent the rest of the war in the Flying Fortress. He told stories of “Foo Fighters” and the first momentary glimpse of this disk coming up the river immediately triggered his old reaction to those earlier foo fighters. Unable to do anything about the crash, the two men continued north for a half hour reaching Cascade, the county seat for Valley County. There they stopped at the police station and filed a report. During the evening of the next day an Air Force Officer dropped by the house and explained to my Dad and Uncle that what they saw was no more than a missile that had been accidentally launched from a jet out of Mountain Home Air Force Base, southwest of Boise. The officer added that “You have no reason to be concerned and should just forget about the incident.” I remember looking at the smiling officer and then at my Dad just staring at him for a moment. My reaction was to try to melt in to the background and be out of site for a while. Very calmly my Dad explained to the young smiling officer that he was retired Air Force, added a few details, and knew a missile when he saw one.  He then invited the officer to change his story or leave. That was the last we heard from the Air Force about that incident. The crash at Smiths’ Ferry was at 44º 20’ 11.57 N and 116º 03’ 27.54 W and by the following day, the Air Force had the entire area stripped clean.

To whom it may concern, I recently captured video of lights in the southern sky during late evening one day. They exhibited behavior not typical of airplanes or aircraft of any kind. They also did not exhibit behavior of falling debris such as a meteor or other object entering our atmosphere. I'm hoping the video i did capture will be of some use, but i will admit it's not very good. it was taken with my Canon Powershot digital camera while in video mode. At times i tried to zoom in and the picture would get blurry so i would have to zoom out and recenter on the lights  A light would appear..and something would seem to ""shoot off"" from it and then another  would appear next to it...in almost a perfectly straight line. At first this was slow, then at the end the lights would appear more rapidly and closer together. And then it stopped.I did not count how many appeared altogether as i was in awe. I have never witnessed thes lights in this type of formation, appearing one after another next to the other in a line. Myself and my father have seen these lights, or something similar in the same area of the sky at different times for the past 15 years or more.They do not appear often at all or for very long. Sometimes they just appear in different places and blink off and on, and sometimes they move. Thats the best explanation i have for the events that i witness. I also would like to apologize for the end of the video because i did not capture all of the event. It started a few minutes before, and as i was attempting to capture, my memory card became full and i had to stop to get another. When i did, thats when they started appearing in rapid succession and closer together and then suddenly they stopped. At all times and during every occurence there has been no sound coming from the direction in which the lights appear. If you are interested in this video i could send you a copy on cd-rom or dvd format by mail, however the file itself is much too large to email.it is approximately 102 megabytes in size as i have my camera set to maximum video resolution.

I guess about 2 months ago is reasonably close. I've talked to several people about what I saw and was litterly laughed at each time. And reasonably so, I've stopped discussing it with anyone at all. That is until finding this section on your website. So here goes. 	 My wife and I were late getting home one nite so I suggested we put a couple of steaks on the grill and have a quick and simple dinner and hop into bed, readying for another days ordeal. I had just fired up the grill and was still holding and folding the grill cover in my hands. I was staring out into the night sky looking at the star formations as I usually do when out at night. I suddenly noticed a rather strange light going across the sky in a West to East direction rather high in the sky. At first I thought it was merely a commercial plane at that altitude but soon realized I saw no usual vapor trail nor jet exhaust sound. But the thing that caught my attention foremost was the fact that I saw no flashing navigational lights. I thought that was especially odd. I knew it was proceeding across the sky because I could see the stationary night stars behind it. I continued to gaze at the moving light as it maintained what appeared to be a constant speed when suddenly it starting becoming brighter in appearance. As I continued looking at it, it actually took on a more distinguishing look about itself. The light started turning a brilliant beautiful color of blue, a shade of blue I'd never seen before. Almost like an electric arc from a plug wire. Ok, here's the crazy part, as I watched it, it developed a wide looking ring around the outside diameter of itself. This ring was a much brighter shade of blue than the inner section appeared to be. It litterly gave the appearance of what Saturn with it's rings looked like, except it was oval shaped in it's center. The two individual and separate colors illuminated its shape completely. 	 I know what I saw, and this is what I saw. I continued to stare at it, half thinking that if I dropped my gaze it would disappear from me or I'd loose a visual on it. I decided to call my wife to come and take a look, not taking my gaze off it, so I called her several times but she didn't hear me in time. 	Then I did the most stupid thing of all, I decided to lay the grill cover down and walk out in the yard to get a better viewing of this object. Laying down that cover took no more than 1 second for me at the most but when I gazed back up in the sky where it last was, there was nothing to see. I mean nothing at all. Not a trace of it could be seen! From initial first sighting until it vanished was perhaps 8 seconds. But I know what I saw. My lasting regret  even till now was taking my eyes off it and missing how it managed to disappear from my line of sight. It's completely impossible for me to have misplaced it in the night sky when there were no other aircraft in the sky at that time. And how did NORAD not pick it up either, as I can see the military installation from my front yard! So call me crazy if you will but what I've written here is the absolute and complete truth as I would derive no personal satisfaction in fabricating such a wild story just to make myself look crazy in the end. I believe with all my heart what I saw that stary night was actually a craft not from our planet but rather from some place outside our Solar System and will continue to believe so until the day I die. I thank you for reading my story and hope that you will believe me. Again, Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My husband had died 4 months before. It was the 4th of July, 1973.  The young boys wanted to sleep so I slept out with them on the front lawn of our country home.  We had fun looking at the stars and we were tired.  The boys fell asleep but I couldn’t, because I was thinking of their Dad and wishing he was here with us.  I did things like this with them hoping it would help them to not be so sad. As I lay there I looked up and saw a large ""fireball"" floating over the trees and continued over the house, coming from south to north.  After it passed over another one came from the same direction but slightly off the same path but also going in the same direction.  And as soon as it passed was over my shoulder I saw a 3rd one came over.   Their color was orangy-red and looked on fire and they were complete silent.  No noise at all..  It took about 10 seconds for each one of them to pass overhead until the next one came.  I was so shocked that I didn’t turn around to see how long it took them to go out of sight. Also, I tried to compare their size with the moon.  Comparing the almost full moon in the sky to the fireballs they were three-fourths as big as the moon.  It’s really hard to tell how high or low they were.  I’d say they were as big as a saucer held at arm’s length.  This probably doesn’t make much sense but it’s the best I can do. When I went to work the next day I told co-workers about it and they said it was being announced over the radio if anyone saw something strange in the sky last night to report it to the Sheriff’s office.  I did report it and sent the diagram I had made right after it had happened. My only purpose in reporting this now is just to let someone, somewhere know that UFO’s are REAL because I saw it ""with my own eyes.""

While attempting to write a book for the first time ever (which is not about UFO’s but will include my UFO story),  I am once again recalling the past by searching for the time frame again, I come up with a related article that inspires this report. I’ll just get right to the point here. It was the evening of August 16, 1974. I was about 16-17 yrs old.   After picking up a girl in my car, we went to the local parking area. At that time it had the nickname ""Pregnant Point"" (how appropriate). This area is located in Somersworth, NH between two roads that run parallel to one another:  Salmon Falls Rd and Rt 108 (the old Rt 16).  No more than a mile between the two.  This road today starts at the corner of a local tool crib and almost across the street is a gas station that once had the name Agway.   From Rt 108, going towards Salmon Falls Rd, there is a dirt road to the right and that’s where we had parked that evening.   Backed into the woods on the left hand side perpendicular onto this road we sat talking (completely sober) and while talking we noticed what appeared to be a star way off in the sky that would just grow bright and then fade and continue to do this for awhile.   We at first thought that it could have been a plane but didn’t move at all.   After a few minutes we had just ignored it.   While looking at one another and talking, I glanced back at the sky and went into a sort of horrific shock by the presence of a huge saucer hovering no more than 40 ft or so just above the tree tops across the dirt road we were on and no more than 25-30 ft away.  It was aprox. 75 yds or so in diameter, silverish from what I remember and had numerous lights revolving around the bottom rim. I was in such a state of shock, that I couldn’t even speak with tears running down my face and trying to speak but only had an open mouth with no words.  This girl whom I have no idea to this day who she is, didn’t see it at all at this time and kept asking me what was wrong.  She was kinda freaked by my state of shock.  This saucer made absolutely no noise and vanished in about 5-6 seconds maybe a little longer but not much. As soon as I was able, I started my car and still unable to talk, took a right back onto this dirt road and then another right back onto pregnant point (this girl kept asking me what the matter was).  I still couldn’t talk at this time. As I turned left onto Salmon Falls Rd, she screamed like a blood curling scream from some horror film.  I knew then she had just seen it.  When I turned onto Salmon Falls Rd., she had spotted this UFO out the passenger window over the Salmon Falls River and the swamp next to it. Once in Rochester and no idea where I had dropped her off, I went home and called the Rochester Police to report what had happened.   All they said was, ""Thank you.""  I was a little set back by the response but being young, I just let it go.   Who would ever believe me anyway?   I had told no one else until the next day because it was a little late that night. The next day, I was driving my car on Central Ave in nearby Dover, NH, and I tuned into the local radio station WTSN in Dover.  I hadn’t talked to my brother ((name deleted)) at all.  ((name deleted)) had just come on WTSN because he was at that time, he was the Strafford County ((deleted)). He had reported UFO sightings in numerous areas; Exeter Police reported sightings from officers themselves, Dover Police had sightings over the Junior High School, Somersworth Police had sightings over the water tower and Rochester Police chased a UFO up Rochester Hill Rd which is actually Rt 108 (the old Rt 16) just a few miles from where I was. To top it all off, a friend (whom I had no knowledge of where he worked at this time) was in the local newspaper: ""Foster’s Daily Democrat"" and had reported a confirmed sighting that night.  He was working at the Agway gas station no more than ¾ of a mile in parallel to where I was parked. A few years ago, I had called the Rochester Police for police reports of that time and they told me that there were no records of my calling.  However, at the time of this writing I have physically gone in and put in a request for records. I later on had researched that time period and found ((name deleted)) report in the newspaper of Foster’s dated August 17, 1974.  Some years later his brother and I were at coffee and he remembers his brothers sighting who now lives out of state. Since that time, I have told my story to WTSN in the late 1990’s on a live call in show called, ""The Open Mike""  program and have also told my story to  ""The Bay"" (98.7) radio station on an early morning show. What I saw is as real as you and I my friend. Today, the trees where I had spotted this UFO appear to have not grown as tall as the others nearby.  I hope that you can add this to your archives. Thank you for time for what this is worth. ((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting is not indicated by witness.  We have assigned an arbitrary time of ""19:30 hrs.,"" to reflect an evening sighting.

As I reached for the door handle to get out of the car my ! ex grabbed my jacket sleeve and said, ""no! Don't get out!"" I pleaded with him to back up so maybe I could see it better...as he put the car in reverse and slowly startED back the object stopped scanning the ground and the light was immediately extinguished like a camera shutter closes.

It was very dark, I don't remember if there were stars or if the sky was clear.   There was a very bright orange saucer shaped object very high up in the sky.  It was stationary for about 30 seconds and then it dropped down very quickly and then shot back up at a V and disappeared.  I've never seen anything like it again and have always wondered what it could have been.   The strangest part was that it went from stationary and then dropped and shot back up so quickly at an angle.  It couldn't have been an airplane, or any other type of aircraft I've ever seen, and it was definately not a shooting star, etc. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was dark out, being aprox. 9:00 in the evening. I would estimate around 30 people were also in the area that I could see with folks on both sides of the street we were on. What got my attention was the whole area lighting up suddenly as if someone had turned on amber colored floodlights that illuminated the street and buildings as if it were suddenly day. The origin of the light came from above us. There, hovering above the UT Tower was a triangular shaped craft aprox. 100 yards in length with amber colored glowing half-bulbs at each corner underside of the craft. It made no noise and hovered for about 20-30 seconds. Everyone on the street saw it and we all pointed at it. I was very excited and the feeling I had was one of pure elation. The object moved silently towards the south and downtown area of Austin and then seemed to accelerate and was out of sight within a fraction of a second. The next day on the local rock radio station KLBJ, they announced that if anyone had seen anything unusual the night before it was because the Air Force was testing something. I later became a weather technician for the Texas Air Guard and even though I was already familiar with most military craft I became an expert at recognizing all atmospheric phenomena and different types of aircraft as was required by my job. I do not believe nor have I ever believed that this huge, silent golden triangle was of a terran origin. I have only found one other witness online to this event who saw it 30 miles to the north of Austin and he stated that he saw several small shapes flying around the triangle as it headed south towards the Austin area.

On 7/14/09 at 9:20 p.m. I was sitting in my easy chair watching tv when something caught my eye from the patio door to my immediate left.  The door has a full length glass pane in it with a sheer curtain over it.  I could clearly see a brightly lighted object in the sky as it was dark enough outside by then.  I could not tell the shape, but it appeared to me to be a straight wing with no fuselage, though it feasibly could have been a frisbee shape on its side with no curve, and about 8 or so bright flashing colored lights straight across it.  They were red, blue and I think white and orange and/or green.  I thought it was a jet plane about to crash. I was very startled because I don't live in a flight path so my mind was really befuddled by this time trying to make sense of what I was seeing.  The position of the object was very close and low and slowly passing just beyond a 2-story apartment building about 100 yards beyond my building in the same complex of about 10 buildings.  I did not see from which direction it came, but it could have possibly passed right over me before I saw it. I'm not sure of the altitude, maybe that of a roughly 30-story building.  To me, it appeared as though it was slowly going into a landing pattern where the wheels come down and touchdown is imminent.  If I extended my arm it would be about the length and width of my pinkie finger framed between two buildings. I jumped up and got on my slides so I could step outside to get a better look.  By the time I got out on the patio the object seemed to hesitate for a fraction of a second; I thought it was trying to pull the nose up because at this point my mind still thought it was a plane, however, there was no engine noise and I assumed the engine had been cut off.  It then veered slightly to the right and disappeared behind a building. I waited for an explosion or flames and smoke shooting in the air, but nothing like that happened.  In fact, it was just gone and I heard nothing about it on the news afterwards.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,32.32767214076246,-106.75489560117302

I was sitting in the front passenger seat while my girl friend drove. The other two sat in the rear. The craft was traveling at extreme speeds so it was difficult to see any real detail. The best description I could give was something like a Tomahawk missile. I was a police officer in the Air Force for ten years and have a great deal of experience surrounding air craft. The craft traveled from right to left across the highway (US 93). The terrain dropped to my right and rose to the left. I was fortunate to see it as it approached. My girl friend witnessed it as it passed to her front and above. If it was not a Tomahawk, (which is what I could have sworn it was) I have no idea what it was. The size was difficult to determine again due to the speed, but the fact I witnessed it and judging from the road and surrounding area I would speculate it was the same size as a Tomahawk or larger, most likely larger (it is difficult to see a Tomahawk at full speed passing directly in front of you). I looked at my girlfriend and she at me. She said what he fuck was that? I did not want to poison her thought process and simply asked her what she saw. She thought she saw a missile and kept asking me why would a missile be going over the highway and where is going and so on. I explained I did not know any of that and told her maybe it was a test rocket or such. To this day it troubles me whatever it was.

Then the object then turned 180 degrees towards the North West and began scanning the mountain top with a shapeable bright white search beam. The mountain top is estimated to be about 4 ½ - 5 ½ miles away from my home.  The object was moving very quickly compared to conventional aircraft and was completely silent.  Normally I can hear helicopters from that distance very clearly as the sound echoes of the canyon and mountain surface. The object had to be moving or jumping from mountain peak to mountain peak in less than a seconds. It did not appear to be in a hurry but searched quickly and lit up ¼ mile sections of the mountain top almost as bright as day with its search beam.  I could very clearly see the rocky surface and trees present on the mountain surface. I watched it move from place to place along the south side of the mountain top and ridge as if it were searching for something. It probably covered about a 1 – 1 ½ mile area east to west then seemed to go north again just over the mountain crest out of view.  The strange thing is that when it went out of view it appeared that its search beam was penetrating the mountain with a blue hue as if it were translucent or the beam were actually shining through the mountain as it searched both the north and south sides. Because of this translucent appearance through the top area of the mountain crest it was very difficult to gauge if the object was behind or in front of the north side of the ridge. Very strange indeed, because the object was not visible when it went over the ridge but the beam was. Just when I thought I was wrong and that it just had its search light pointed away ! to the n orth it ascended upwards over the ridge to the south side again and the translucent looking beam spot looked as if it came up over the top surface of the north crest and then down the south side again only to get brighter and whiter. I then immediately began feeling my pockets for my cell phone to take a picture and remembered that I had a flip camera in the house.  I started to walk backwards quickly and then the object stopped dead in its search, I had a feeling like you get when in the back-country and you spot a deer and realize the deer has spotted you too. The object then pointed its search beam down the mountain slope in my direction but the beam only ended about halfway down the entire mountain ridge. I had a feeling that it knew I was aware of it now and quickly walked backwards towards the door while keeping an eye on it. It then resumed search of the area with its search beam as I dashed in the house to wake my parents and get my camera to film the event.  I woke my parents, grabbed the flip camera and ushered my parents outside to whiteness the event (about 30seconds). When we got outside it was nowhere to be seen and I stayed outside for the next hour long after my parents retired back to bed in hopes it would return so I could film it. It never returned.  The whole event only lasted about 2-3 minutes. I have seen strange unidentified objects when I was younger but nothing like this that was so bizarre and so visually active that lasted more than 45 seconds.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

There was a large, bright half-moon that was very high in the sky (~80 degrees of azimuth) to the Southeast; several bright stars were visible although most were obscured by scattered high-level cloud cover. Weather:  Generally clear skies with very light clouds between 20,000-30,000 feet and a second layer of scattered clouds higher up (~50,000-60,000 feet).  There was no significant wind at ground level but the scattered clouds above were moving briskly towards the southeast. Other Aircraft Visible:  A large commercial jetliner (737,757, 767 scale) was visible at a bearing of about 120 degrees true at an estimated 35,000-45,000 feet in elevation.  The aircraft’s structure and contrails were visible to the eye as were the white strobe warning light and red & green running lights. Observers Background:  I am a retired Navy Commander who served in the Navy for 21 years on both submarines and surface combatants.  I have been involved in both nuclear power and nuclear weapons and maintained security clearances above the TOP SECRET level.  My most senior assignments were at Fleet Forces Command (U.S. Atlantic Fleet HQ) NAVSUPSYSCOM as Director of Supply Chain Management for all Navy and Marine Corps conventional ammunition. My educational background is in chemical, mechanical and petroleum engineering and I hold a Masters in Business Administration.  Currently I work as General Manager for an industrial manufacturing company.  I have excellent vision, am taking no medications, have never had delusions or mental illness and am not a stereotypical ""UFO fanatic.""  I have a significant knowledge regarding aircraft available in the current military inventory and have observed aircraft exceeding mock 1 in relatively close proximity.  I have observed a night-time launch of the space shuttle when my submarine was in Port Canaveral, FL.  I have not observed a definitive UFO or made a UFO sighting report previously. Sequence of Events:  Initial Observation:  I existed my front door at exactly 5:30 AM to start a typical 5-mile walk.  I always check my watch to verify my start time.  It was still fairly dark outside with only a faint hint of sunrise on the extreme eastern horizon.  I immediately noticed a very bright group of lights to the southeast at approximately 140-degrees true and about 10-degrees above the tree- line.  These lights caught my attention because I had never seen anything like them before as they were extremely bright.  To my naked eye, they appeared as three glowing balls that were close together or perhaps touching.  At first I though I must be seeing the moon through clouds but as I glanced up I could see a very bright half-moon well above and to the left of the object.  I also noticed several stars were out and that there was a large commercial jet at about 100-degrees true and very high up (~35,000-40,000 feet) that was traveling east-to-west.  As I glanced back at the three lights I observed that they had traveled a significant distance in just a few seconds and seemed to be moving at great speed.  I couldn’t see any typical aircraft lights (white strobe or red/green running lights) and had a gut feeling that this was an unusual event.  I bolted into my house to get a pair of binoculars.  This initial observation took 5-7 seconds. Second Observation:  I had a pair of 10 power binoculars readily available for an upcoming hunting trip and it took me no more than 10 seconds to retrieve them and return to my front porch.  I relocated the object in the sky at about 190- degrees true, about 15 seconds after first seeing the object.  Obviously it had moved from the southeast horizon to southwest very quickly.  I observed that it was about 25,000 feet in altitude … about the same height as a few light clouds that were close by the object.  I also estimated it was 2-3 miles to the south from me horizontally.  As soon as I looked at the object in 10-power, it was clear there were 6 distinct bright lights.  I looked hard for any visible structures (wings, fuselage, etc.) but saw nothing, nor could I see any typical aircraft lights (white strobe or red/green running lights).  The lights were circular and arranged in a symmetrical pattern of a circle or an imaginary hexagon with each light being centered over each of the corners (see diagram).  The lights were all the same size and color (white & yellow) and were moving together.  It could have been six objects moving in formation but my impression was that the lights were located on a single object. Not seeing any distinguishing features, I put down the binoculars as I wanted to try to gage the size of the object using any available reference. At this point, it had been about 20 seconds since I first saw the object.  It had continued moving west and was at about 220-degrees true and still at ~25,000 feet.  I quickly estimated it had traveled about 10 miles in 20 seconds.  This computed to 30 miles per minute or 1,800 MPH.  Clearly it was moving at 2-3 times the speed of sound and confirmed my impression of extremely high velocity (I had directly observed military aircraft at supersonic speeds below 500 feet in elevation in the past … the military can do this on the open ocean just not over populated land). I then compared the object to the half-moon still to the southeast and above the object.  In comparison, the object would have covered 25% of a complete FULL MOON in size (see diagram).  It also equaled the half- moon in brightness when seen with the naked eye. I also remembered the large commercial jetliner to the southeast and thought to compare size with this as well.  The jetliner was still plodding along at 500MPH or so and had moved about 10 degrees to 130-degrees true.  I could see the jet’s structure clearly and estimated that the diameter of the object with 6-lights was approximately 2.5-3 jet-lengths or 250-300 yards across--obviously very large. I had a thought that perhaps I was seeing the international space station or Hubble telescope and that I was catching a reflection off of solar collection panels as sunrise hit one of these orbiting structures. Final observation:  I had been observing the object for about a total of 30-35 seconds at this point when the object came to a rapid stop, or at least stopped moving west.  I then looked through the binoculars again and picked up the 6 distinct lights in view.  After 2-3 seconds all 6 lights rotated about 30- degrees to the left, like a door knob that was being turned.  The object then began to climb vertically--it was no longer moving west, just up, straight up.  I also observed that there were definitely clouds above the object telling me that it was not in fact in orbit around the Earth but in fact in our atmosphere and between cloud layers.  It appeared the object was accelerating quickly, as within 4-5 seconds it looked to have shrunk to less than half it’s original size.  Within another 3-4 seconds I observed it breaking through the upper cloud layer and it immediately shrank from view. Comments:  The total observation period was about 50 seconds with a 10-second break while I retrieved the binoculars. I did not hear any sound from the object (like a sonic boom) but I also did not hear the commercial jet when it passed overhead about 2 minutes later.  One possible explanation is that higher level winds were moving briskly to the southeast and taking acoustic energy away from me.  Also, there was a loud freight train about a mile away that was generating a significant volume of low frequency rumbling masking noise. This object was definitely moving at a high rate of speed, appeared to be substantially larger than man-made aircraft and was maneuvering.  It moved from the eastern horizon to the western horizon in about 25 seconds and then straight up and out of site within another 10-15 seconds.  Initially, it was somewhat below the commercial jet (also moving west) but the object was moving much faster.  It took the jet 2-2.5 minutes to traverse the same distance that the object traversed in ~25 seconds. The brightness of the 6-lights was so intense that it was impossible to see structural details beyond the glare. The object was definitely between cloud layers and not in orbit around the Earth.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,39.7991,-77.754

I continued to watch the sky and saw another flash several seconds later in a different spot.  I extrapolated to the south to where I thought it would be for the next flash and neither the time nor the trajectory stayed the same.  The last flash was to the southwest of the second flash.  It took longer and did not travel as far across the sky.  I thought maybe I was seeing shooting stars coming right at me.  I had never seen that before, but maybe.

It had about 5 or 6 parallel lines running the long way inside of the rectangle and seemed to appear and disappear just that fast.  The rectangle lasted longer than the flashes but less than a second.  The long sides seemed to be well defined but the short sides were a little fuzzy.  Maybe the parallel lines just ended evenly and the length to width ratio gave the appearance of a rectangle.  I can’t say the rectangle appeared to be a craft but it was bizarre.  Neither the flashes nor the rectangle are anything I have seen before.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,46.6632,-123.8046

Orange/Amber Light seen from Cypress over Orange County Sky, then moved towards the beach.  This is my fourth time seeing it, always after 11:30pm PST... Many people thought I was making it up until they got to see it too! (yes, I ran and got them so I wasn't alone starring at it.) Tonight my parents finally witnessed it! I ran through the house and woke them up. I rarely look to the skies at night searching for strange lights or objects, but it seems that when I check out what I think is Sirius (the brightest star I can see from our crappy smog infested, light polluted skies here in SoCal.) late at night,  lately I have seen this object... I just happen to catch this Orange object sometimes when I look towards that star. It flies higher than a normal plane would, has NO blinking lights, it sometimes changes from Orange/Amber to Red-ish color then back to Orange/Amber, and then blacks out for a few seconds then lights back up. The third time I seen the thing, it was hovering and flying lower than the second time, it change from like a round bar shape... to a perfect circle, (It would help to mention that I ran into the house and grabbed the binoculars before hand, so I was lucky enough to watch it change shape.) The object (if it is the same one over and over again?) has no wings, makes no noise, and moves in different directions and sometimes hovers in one spot for a little while.  I was so glad my friend ran to my house to let me know it was back out in the sky, because THIS TIME I could grab my parents so they don't think I'm nuts anymore. I know this won't be the last I see of it, because it's been 4 times already in less than 6 months and I'm not searching for it every night... There has to be someone else out there besides us who have seen this thing... especially over Huntington Beach area where it seems to fly over sometimes. Once, it dropped/emitted 2 bright blue-ish white objects from under it that fell straight towards the ocean water, yes, it had to be over the water, it was far far out there. I was NOT the only person to witness that, and we both were like, did you see that!? What ! did it s hoot out?! It seemed like it shot out the bright objects because they looked like they went downwards faster than a falling object. It was fast... We were on my roof at that moment trying to get a better look at it through binoculars.  No noise... this thing was quiet as can be and when it would pick up speed, still no noise. I'm not saying aliens, but it's for sure not a satellite because it moves in different directs and hovers, it's not a plane, it hovers and has NO blinking lights and no sound for the speed it goes, not a helicopter, flies way to high and fast with yet again, no noise..., not a balloon, not a chinese lantern, and not a blimp, NO WAY, I'm familiar with all of those.  If you don't believe me, I suggest if you live around my area of Orange County,CA., you check the night skies from around 11:00pm 'till 1:00am every now and then, your bound to see it if my neighbors and I have already seen it four times, and two out of the four were just this month alone. From now on, I'm going to check every night around 12:00-1:00am... I wish someone could tell me what we keep seeing. At least I'm not the nut who seen a UFO now, now my neighbors are right with me on this one! ...relief, but still very curious as to what I have seen more than once. Next time I'll be ready with my Video camera attached to my binoculars. (it works!)

I climb mountains a lot – the Cascades are only 30 minutes due east of my house. My instinctive habit is to look up to check the clouds for possible upcoming weather changes. I looked up and noted it was sunny but slightly hazy, with some high clouds to the southwest. Almost immediately after noting the weather I saw a black object gliding from my left to right, which was southeast to northwest. It was about 2/3 of the way up from the horizon to the zenith; I had to tilt my head back to view it. It appeared black in color, but due to the background of a bright light blue sky black may have simply been the default color not the real one. The apparent size of the object was approximately 1 centimeter at my arm’s length. It was shaped like a crescent with end points that extended slightly farther than a classic crescent, to where the points of the two ends started curving into a slight “C” shape. I was tempted to originally say batwing shaped, but it was actually more like a slightly extended crescent. It was thickest up front, then gradually tapered in thickness toward the end points of the crescent. I saw no protrusions anywhere along the object, so the outline of the object appeared as a smooth curve with pointed ends. It made no sound. For about 3 minutes it went relatively slowly in a perfectly straight line on the original southeast-northwest course. As an idea of its speed, it was about half the apparent speed of a commercial airliner flying overhead on its way to land at SeaTac Airport, which was about 30 miles from my viewpoint. 3 commercial airliners cruised through the sky descending for landing while I watched the object. By comparison it appeared to me that the object was smaller in size and lower in altitude than the airliners. For some reason I got the impression that the object was about half the size of the airliners. However if the object was bigger than an airliner its true altitude would have been higher. After about 3 minutes the object turned smoothly to its left. It now traveled on a nearly due west course in a straight line. Its speed did not change. The turn was not 90 degrees like a classic UFO description, nor was it a long curved turn as I would expect from a plane or a bird. It was a small, tight little curve as it turned. Maybe an 80-degree turn. The object continued west at the same speed in a straight line for about a minute, then did another small, tight little curve to its left that put it on a nearly due south course. Again it moved in a straight line at the same speed. It continued on this southerly course until I lost it in the distance after about 2 more minutes. During each turn I observed no apparent tilt. The object’s appearance remained exactly the same during the turns. The object's speed remained constant from the beginning to the end of the sighting. I see military and civilian fixed wing aircraft and helicopters on a somewhat regular basis in my area. This was not one. It did not appear to be a bird either flapping its wings or gliding. I spend about 30 days a year in the wilderness and I see many hawks and other birds gliding through the air. At Lake Sammamish, a mile from my home, bald eagles nest and I see them gliding through the air fairly often as well. Their wings are always extended in a roughly straight angle as they glide. There is no crescent shape to their appearance. When a bird turns, I see the tilt in the direction of its turn and I see a relatively wide curve as it turns. The object I saw was not in the shape of a bird or an aircraft. The turns it made showed no visible tilt, and the turns were much tighter than those of a bird or aircraft. The object’s appearance was simple enough that I drew a rough example as it appeared to me and I will mail it to the National UFO Reporting Center. I will also send a map pinpointing my location as I viewed it. My background: I am a lawyer and a lobbyist, a father of two, an avid mountain climber, and an amateur astronomer.

My wife, two small children, and I live in the north Georgia Mountains in an airpark community that sits approximately 3000 feet in elevation.  Being far away from any major city, there are no nearby lights to brighten the sky, so I can usually see numerous aircraft pass above, mainly jets.  On this particular night, we had been sitting outside approximately 30 minutes, when we saw a light passing from south to north at a speed that I estimate 20 to 25 times faster than the airliners flying overhead.  I said to my wife and children that obviously this was a satellite because there were no jets that I knew of that could fly at this rate of speed.  Also, we heard no sound and didn’t see any navigation lights. Anyway,  as I was telling my family what I thought this light was, it came to a complete stop right above our heads for a split second, then  made a right angle turn to the east at a speed as great  or greater than we observed  before it stopped.

Out of nowhere, in the middle of the sky, a round white light appeared, it seemed to be as far away as the stars. Then as fast as it had appeared, defying all laws of motion, aircraft, it looped extremely fast and dissapeered in a trail. Very far from the city, nothing but trees, mountains in the distance, and a glassy lake reflecting it all, everything we see is plain as day.  the best i can describe, is it appeared in a white flash, then blasted into a U shaped motion, leaving a white haze trail litterally as if it went into hyperspace. and it was gone. As i turned to my brother to say ""did you see that?"" he spoke the same words, and we instantly knew we saw somthing extraordinary. However, my brother's account of the event, and mine, are different. I saw a flash of light that moved in amazing rate and direction, he said he saw a massive object, appear, then dissapeer. Maybe it was his angle, i did not see a large actual object, but for me to see this light if it was as far away as i think it was, must have been very large. This was not a flare, or a plane, or anything i've ever seen in the sky before. i don't know of anything that can change it's course without being acted on by an outside force. Not looking for an investigation, we just want to help with the search for the truth behind all of these sightings, so I wanted to report this thinking maybe there were more sightings like ours in upstate NY.

We were not the only people to see them; there were probably dozens of people who saw these crafts in the sky. Whatever they were they were not conventional satellites and they appeared to be beyond the Earth’s atmosphere (about the same range as a standard satellite).

He said that he looked at it for less than a minute trying to figure out what he just saw, when what appeared to be a star in the same area moved in a circle.  My brother then called me, so I went outside and looked but failed to see what he was (mind you I live only about a mile away from him).

We had stopped in Tucumcari for a family bathroom and stretching break; this had been a 2000+ mile journey and we were on day 5, the home stretch. It was still light out and the sun was preparing to set in the hour  when we left Tucumcari; the only thing unusual observed in the sky was multiple ""Morning Glory"" cloud formations that we passed under, on route 40. This in itself was unusual because ""Morning Glories"" are very rare. As it grew dark on the long stretch of road called Interstate 40, which cuts through from the boarder of the Pan Handle of Texas; straight through to Albuquerque, a 217 mile 3+ hour journey, at 9 years old you wonder if this trip is ever going to end. I can only approximate the time as being about  8:00pm when somewhere between Clines Corner, New Mexico and Tijeras, New Mexico on Interstate Route 40 an event that was observed by all 4 members of my family that we will never forget. Off in the distance a tower with anti-collision lights could be observed, it was on the left hand side of the road; it must have been a large tower because, the outline obscured in the darkness was visible from quite a ways away. But there was something peculiar about this tower, above it was what appeared to be 3 spinning flashing lights; which when viewed at a distance were not attached to the tower. My mother then asked my father:  "" __________  is that a Helicopter?""  My father answered:  ""Maybe, but, My Mother:” But What???” 	My Father:” I don’t know  ____________ , ,,,,, its too windy,,,, I don’t now what it is..”  As we drew closer to the tower, (possibly a weather or communication station, no cell towers back then) we observed 1 or 2 smaller structures under the tower from a distance; and an unidentified  air craft maintaining distance above the tower itself. At this point we were still a ways away from the tower station, but we could notice that this object was spinning; the approximate spin was about 90° per second or one complete revolution per 4 seconds. As we drew closer to the object we could see a distinct triangular form, which was in my estimation at least 100 feet across. It was at this point that this object began to gain altitude and loose altitude like a bounce on a trampoline. This increase and decrease in elevation was effortless and smooth, and at first it was in increments of maybe 20 feet;  vertical up and down on the top part of the tower, and at no time did this object stop spinning. On this particular stretch of road it was very windy, the sheer alone was blowing tractor trailer trucks all over the road; but this object displayed no lateral vectoring what so ever, every time it raised in elevation or lost elevation the object did so in a straight ballistic line.   (My father’s last duty in the Navy was a chopper trainer, he said that it was impossible for a helicopter to maintain position like that in those winds and not experience severe lateral vectoring) The closer we drew to the object the more distinct it became,  the object  then moved slightly away from the tower and stopped in the center of the  tower –yard; at this point the object began to bounce gracefully in approximately 50 foot drops  and 50 accessions, all the time still spinning. My mother tried to take some pictures of the object but as far as I know they never came out. It was now clear to my parents and I that this was no helicopter. My father and mother opened their windows, in order to try to here if the sound of a copter was present, but the only sound heard was road noise; and at this distance, if it was a helicopter one would have been able to hear the roar. As we were passing the tower station, the object leisurely and effortlessly moved and began to follow the highway; particularly our white suburban truck.  At this point, my mother began to flip out, and begged my father to get off the highway, but we just kept driving. This is where the events of this night become weird, as we were driving the craft took up position above our truck and started to flash bright, and I mean bright flashes of directed light into our vehicle, particularly at me. They were brighter than any police or emergency vehicle or anti -collision light I have ever seen. First flashes of:  yellow, than flashes of red, than blue, than green, than blue than red, than green and finally blue. After a while the object flew slowly away east bound in to the sky and out of sight straight up. This whole event from start to finish lasted from 20 to 25 minutes; I have tried using Google Earth to locate the precise location of where this event occurred, but much of the topography there has changed since I was a kid. What has bothered me over the years is that there were other witness to this event  on that stretch of interstate 40 that night; none as far as I know, have ever reported this event. My current vocation is a Licensed and soon to be Ordained Pastor, there is a big risk for me to even speak out these events, but they must be told. This was not the only experience my family and I had in New Mexico;  there was another one, just as weird.",2010-07-28T00:00:00,,

Then, I realized that didn't make sense--they moved much faster than hot air balloons.  Since they appeared to be a fair distance away, I then assumed they might be planes from Portland airport or the military base nearby.  Although, I didn't know how far away they were, they seemed to be too close together to be planes (I'm guessing 1-2 miles apart).  The color of these objects never changed, and no other lights or anomalies were seen.  Also, I never heard any sounds other than a few final fireworks going off or voices of our guests leaving.

I was camping with my girlfriend and another couple that were friends of mine. In the early hours of July 7th, just after midnight, my girlfriend and I had decided to take a walk to the lakeshore area to have a view of the stars.  We had left my friend at the campfire alone, his wife had recently retired for the night in their tent.  It had been fairly cloudy the previous night and this particular night was much clearer, so I wanted to get a good view of the stars before we were to leave the campgrounds the following afternoon.  We walked to the shoreline area and sat at a bench that overlooked Lake Michigan from a distance.  The bench looking north, over the rocks and weeds that led to the vast waters of the lake.  The sky was fairly clear and it was still night. I remember commenting to my girlfriend on how beautiful the stars were.  My girlfriend was looking for the Pleides constellation but couldn't remember exactly! what it looked like or where to find it.  As we sat there, I noticed that some clouds were moving in from the northwest and we wouldn't have much time left with the clear sky.  The clouds seemed to be moving in, fairly quickly.  I turned my head to look at the southern sky and saw a satellite moving across the atmosphere and I pointed this out to her.  I jokingly told her that for all we knew it could be a spaceship disguised as a satellite.  She didn't seem to want to go along with this joke and she repeatedly told me that it was a satellite.  I told her I was just kidding and told her it was a satellite.  At this time, I began turning my head to look back towards the lake.  My eyes quickly caught sight of a very bright white light coming in from the northwest, almost as if it came out of nowhere. Instantly I stated to her, ""What is that?"".   We observed a very brilliant and bright white light coming in from the northwest heading in a slightly southeastly direction.  This light did not pulsate or flash, in anyway.  It was a steady light that moved briskly across the night sky, almost as if it was gliding.  Also, the light or object made no sound.  During its path of flight, it's altitude did not seem to change.  It's difficult to judge how high it was in the sky, but it appeared to be flying very low.  Perhaps a 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  It steadily glided past us.  My girlfriend attempting to tell me that it was probably just a plane, but I saw no flashing lights of a plane that I'm used to seeing.  I could make no shape out behind the light.  It was so solid and bright, that if did come from an object, the light completely engulfed it.  This light continued to glide past us and over the treetops of the campgrounds, directly to the south of us.  From this vantage point we could see the back end of this moving object and the light was just as bright and brilliant from the back as it was from the front.  At this point, the object slowly disappeared into the cloud or mist cover that just hung over the treetops, and out of our sight.  As it began to fade into the low cloud\mist cover, the white light began to fade.  I'm uncertain but I thought I saw some solid form to the object, catching sight of perhaps the back end of an object, but like I said I can't be sure.  I thought I caught view a small orb like object that seemed to be attached to a larger object.  Then, it was gone.  All in all, this episode lasted about 20 seconds, from the time I first saw the object 'til it disappeared over the treetops. Most importantly to me, though, was that there was no sound.  This object was absolutely silent.  This object flew very low, as far as plane standards go and I'm still amazed that there was no sound!   I'm completely baffled by the brightness and silence of this object.  I'm left with something that is absolutely mysterious to me.",2010-07-19T00:00:00,45.12539999999999,-85.62510000000002

Small pinpoints of bright light. The 4th flash of light was a little different than the previous ones in that it was almost like a diffused strobe flash, like when someone takes a flash picture outside at night- that kind of effect. My first thought was that it was some kind of occillating space junk or debris, and was catching the sun at a particular angle.  I thought that, because it was about the same height as a satellite.  I had seen a couple of regular looking satellites later in the evening, as well. The strangest thing about this observation, was that I saw the same kind of flashes the very next night!

It appeared in luminosity similar to a star or satellite.  In addition, it appeared to be of very high altitude, again similar to a satellite.  This was apparent as the jet plane was passing from East to West at a high altitude at the same time I noted the unknown light.  The plane was crossing the sky at an approximate 50 degree relative elevation from my vantage point, and the unknown light was at an approximate 70 degree relative elevation when first sighted. My initial thought was this was a satellite, as I have seen these many times at night and on occasion during the day.  However, this light did not behave as other satellites I have observed.  The light moved relatively slow in comparison.  The light took approximately 30 seconds to move directly overhead.  It then stopped for approximately 3 to 5 seconds.   The light very slightly grew in size and brightness during this period of first sight to the stop over head.  I also had called my wife out to see it during this period.   She also observed the light.  I asked to bring the camcorder to see if we could get the light on video. The light then moved in westerly direction.  Again, slower than a plane or satellite.  We tried to film the light with two camcorders but are unsure if we captured it (we have not reviewed the tapes as of this reporting).  The light continued on its westerly course for approximately 3 minutes before I noted it was moving slightly to the west/south/west (say 15 degrees from true west).  The light was approximately at 75 to 80 degrees relative elevation.  Please note I can assure the light was very distant as it was obscured for a second or two by part of high cloud. I continued to intermittently observe the light for another minute.  The light was dimming and becoming increasingly harder to spot.  It appeared to traveling directly away (i.e. out rather than in a particular direction).",2010-02-14T00:00:00,33.805629234338745,-117.8263324825986

It was a beautifully clear night.  I noticed lights over the I-5 freeway that seemed to be too low in the sky to be a plane and they didn't appear to be a helicopter.  As we approached the object appeared to be hovering.  I pointed it out to my friend who was driving and said, ""What the hell is that!""   At that time we were approaching a stop light on the corner of 3rd and Capital Mall and it was clear the object was moving but very slow.   At that point with all the lights from the freeway and building etc, all we could make out were the lights on the object which I think were red and white.  As we turned left heading South on 3rd Street, the object passed overhead slightly to the rear of the truck and we both clearly saw the triangle shape.  It headed West across the Sacramento River tow! ard the Port of Sacramento which is located in West Sacramento.  We both saw the triangle shape clearly as it passed overhead and we could see a white light in the center of the triangle.  Once it went over the river it tilted to the right and headed in a Northerly direction.  There were no news reports of any kind the next day.  It boggles the mind that something that big and that incredably close went unnoticed. BACKGROUND INFO:  My friend and I are both 54 year old females.

It was about eleven years ago when seven of my friends and I were jumping on my trampoline in my back yard. I was only ten years old, but I'll never forget anything about the night. It was probably one of the clearest nights, and the moon was either full, or close to it. I was playing with my friends, just goofing off, and I jumped in a circle. When I turned I saw something in the sky that, kind of resembled a smaller moon. It was just below and to the right of where the moon was positioned, and it was really close to our houses. I stopped jumping and watched it; I could feel that everyone was still jumping. I didn’t even think to get their attention, because I didn’t want to look away. It was a huge sphere in the sky, about the same color of the moon, but completely smooth. As I continued to watch it, it dipped down, came up again, dipped behind the top of the trees, came up again, and then finally disappeared behind the trees. It never made a sound. I watched to see if it would come up again, but it didn’t. From my point of view, it looked like it had landed in the softball field behind my friend’s house; that friend was jumping on the trampoline with me at that moment. I turned around quickly to tell everyone what I had seen, when one of my other friends said, ""Did you see that?!""  Everyone stopped to listen to what we both saw, but none of them had seen it but us. I think about it now, and I’m so glad I wasn’t the only one to see it, because I would feel crazy.

I have seen UFOs all of my adult life...starting in the Calif./ Mojave desert in 1965/ throughout the late sixties in the panhandle of Texas during college. ....and throughout a college teaching career in the early eighties in the panhandle. I moved to the Aztec, NM area in the late nineties from Durango, Colorado. On October 17 of 1997 two friends and I were driving west on a county road (318) just outside Ignacio, Co. This road is heavily traveled and is on the Ute reservation with a mountain range parallel on the southern boundary...the road then descends into a pronounced canyon before meeting the major HWY 550 Corridor from Aztec to Durango. On this evening at about 8:17 p.m.we had just gone four miles west and looked up in the sky towards the southwest and above the mountains....and pulled to the side of the road to listen and look. Only one other car passed us going east at this time. A very ,very large triangular shaped "" ship"" with extremely long "" pole/legs"" was moving to the southwest....and within these pole/legs were a pink and very red swirling energy of light and motion...as if the poles were ""sucking up the matter/plants/dirt of the hills and mesas near the mountains. There was absolutely no sound and the size and scale of these legs and ""ship"" are still beyond my memory's ability to compute. My friends and I just kept asking what it was...and kept watching and not believing the size of the objects in our view. We then drove three more miles west to get another perspective and to see if the ship was moving...we then saw two smaller (relatively speaking) triangles a little higher in the sky and definitely moving southwest. The larger ship was perceptibly moving and I used a fist measurement I learned from someone to gauge height in the sky...I counted seven fists high the one pole/leg nearest us. We then drove two more miles west to look back...again no sounds, no airplanes overhead, no animal sounds....and we could look back and see all three pole/legs from that view....the legs were so long/large that it appeared that two tornado shapes on top of each other were swirling and picking up matter. We then drove into Bondad canyon and slowed to look back and could not see the objects any longer....and when we reached Hwy 550 and looked east toward the mountains and the canyon...there was nothing to see. We then drove south to our river home and looked back from the driveway....and saw nothing. I called my brother in Albuquerque (167 miles away) just to see if anything was on the news....and we tuned into local radio. I called the airport in Farmington, NM and the college observatory the next day...and nothing had been reported. My friends have really never referenced this event again...and for twelve years I have carried a sense of forever being changed by what we witnessed. I have spent years on the web looking for any other experience similar...especially the pole/legs whirling pink/and red tornado like motions....with no sound. I hope I can speak at length to someone about this event. Aztec has a UFO site northeast of the city on Hart Mountain....when I look at the trajectory of the ""ships"" of October 1997....they were definitely running parallel to Hart Mountain.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,37.1075,-107.66810000000001

We were in the interior of the remote 30 mile wide Drummond island in Michigan`s upper peninsula. With a low cloud ceiling and snowing lightly. We would never expect to see aircraft in the area.  The lights were white-white with the left one being about 2 times in size as the right light. They appeared to be like a tower light not blinking. I first thought it was a plane that was passing by slow and low. They seemed to be moving in the direction we were going maybe slower than the speed we were going, 40 to 50 mph. I could see both lights horizontal.  15 seconds after spotting them they stayed spaced the same distance but started moving left.  After a move to the left the object banked more to the left and I could plainly see its oval shape with one side facing me lighted on the edge. The light around the edges can only be described as like a woman’s ring that has baguettes set in the band. I could see it was lighted all around the outside edge as it turned up sideways. Its movement was not anything I have ever seen in 51 years. This very quickly got right out of sight in what looked like a rolling motion not like a horizontal movement. For just a couple quick seconds it kind of looked like a kid’s sparkler when you make circles without the sparks.  As soon as it was visible as the oval shape to me it very quickly went straight away out of sight. I saw it as an oval shape for about 4 or 5 seconds. We stopped right away a couple hundred feet down the trail. We both said, did you see that?  I said, I did but my family member said he did not see it leave as an oval or circle shape.

I am telling you on my mother’s grave this was nothing short of the truth. My nephew also said there was a collision of a couple satellites and it could have been falling debris. I got the creeps and looked over my shoulder all the way back to the lodge.  It still makes me shiver as I write this.  All I can say is I am glad it went away from us not toward us.

Just as we were leaving the town of Haymarket via the Old Carolina Road I noticed a very bright light in the Western Sky. To the left or South of the light I could also see the planet Venus which was setting in the South Western horizon. The light was fire orange in color and at first sight seemed to be shining from the tree tops on Bull Run Mountain. We pulled over at the intersection of Old Carolina and Hethecote Blvd to get a better look. Now able to see unabated we were amazed to see the orb rising from the top of Bull Run Mountain. As the light lifted, which had to be at least a few hundred feet from the top of the Mountain it started drifting towards us in a Easterly direction. Incredibly as the light drifted it would stop and hover for several minutes than resume moving again, now on a more East North Easterly flight path.

It appeared to stay in the same position (approx. 10:00 position) 30 minutes or better with the intensity never changing.  During this initial observation the object never came closer or farther in respect to our viewing location; basically the object size never changed.  Orion’s belt was viewed almost due West at approximately 11 o’clock position from our viewing position. We heard no noise or saw no indication of a missile launch out of Vandenburg Air Force Base; next launch is scheduled for February 24, 2009 per Vandenburg’s calendar.  The object was than observed through the side sighting scope of an amateur telescope (D: 60mm; F: 700mm) where the following was observed: object had a dark center, with a white band with red and blue colors radiating outward from the white outer band perimeter. Object remained a full round shape 90% of the time.  However, it changed from that frontal view round shape and rotated on its vertical axis maintaining same vertical size, but it changed its’ vertical shape to half the original frontal view; then its’ shape shifted like a saucer rounded on one edge and flat on the other edge; then it rotated and titled some more and its’ shape became an oval and went into a horizontal position. Within 30-45 seconds after changing to that final position the object descended below the visible horizon.  The color lights remained the same throughout this observation.  The view through the main telescope was further validated by one of the observers.  One observer; having worked on highly secretive military aircraft; and that observer understands the maneuverability of aircraft; believes these observations are beyond any known comprehensible understanding of present day aircraft to his knowledge.

Explanation of the time discrepancy: I vaguely remember looking at a clock after this sighting and THOUGHT it said 9:15, but realized the next day that the sun hadn’t fully set by 9:15 on that day and I remember it being dark, because despite the ambient light of the city to the east of my house, I could clearly see stars. This leads me to believe that it was really 10:15 and I had misread the clock the night before. Anyway, on 6/24/2010, as I look up, I glance to the west south west I see a very bright white light moving in a easterly direction (toward me, toward Des Moines proper). The brightness is what caught my eye. It was traveling (as near as I can figure) in a straight line toward the east, perhaps east, north east. No green/red aircraft lights as one would see on an airliner. In fact I saw a jet liner flying to the east far above this object. I am not good at estimating altitude but it, and as such I have a hard time telling you how big this thing was. But the jet liner moving east above this thing looked to be more than twice as high, that's the impression I got anyway. So I figured, it's an airplane with its landing lights on and the landing lights are washing out the red/green strobes so that I can't see them. But as the thing keeps moving east, the light doesn't die out at all. If it were an aircraft landing light, it would be directional. You might see it very brightly as the aircraft was moving toward you but it would become more difficult to see as the plane moved over and started moving away from you. The thing moved over where I was standing, perhaps to the south of my position a little bit but clearly over the city of Des Moines, then it kept moving at the same rate of speed BUT it began moving (or at least the light did) in a slightly, nearly unnoticeable zig-zag manner. Mind you, I can see nothing but the bright white light. I see no craft/structure, no wings, nothing but the light. And the light continues off in an easterly direction until I lose sight of it behind the roofline of the other houses behind mine. It moved in a straight tack and for about 15 seconds, in a slightly zig-zag manner but it stayed at a steady speed. It wasn't very fast at all. The jet liner above it overtook it easily. It made no noise that I could hear but it might have been too far away and it appeared to be illuminated all the way around. In other words, the light stayed bright, no matter the angle at which I viewed the thing. I doubt it was a helicopter because if it was it seemed too high (although I have a hard time judging altitude) and even if it was a helicopter, what's with the 360 degree illumination effect? Even those super bright spotlights on helicopters are directional. I tried taking a picture of it, but my crappy cell phone camera is all I had close and all you could see was a blurry white spot on a black background, it didn't tell the story at all and I deleted it out of frustration (sorry). By the time I could have gone in and gotten my good camera, come out, set it up and get the shot, the thing would have been gone. So, whatever this thing was, I remember thinking that the airliner flying above might not have been able to see it because of the illumination from the city below, but who knows? If the airliner did see it, he didn't alter his course or anything so it must not have concerned him. But the thing was very bright, in comparison to the stars (and the night was very clear), it was easily noticeable at first glance. All told, it crossed the sky (from rooftops to the west to roofline in the east) in about 90-120 seconds. I remember distinctly thinking that whatever I was seeing wasn't normal so I made a point to watch it intently (another reason I didn't go for the good camera). It was right after I made this decision that it started to zig-zag (again, ever-so slightly) and I remember wondering just what exactly I was seeing. The zig-zag was just enough to be noticeable but slight enough to make me wonder if I was perhaps seeing things correctly. Now I am rationalizing and explaining it away as any number of plausible explanations. But the fact that it was #1 so bright #2 had no red/greens #3 moving relatively slowly compared with the air traffic above it #4 IT ZIG ZAGGED. I'm baffled and my logic tells me that it could not have zig-zagged, but I KNOW I saw the thing zig-zag!  So tell me I'm not crazy! Explain this thing to me. I know what it was not...It wasn't a balloon (too fast, steady speed, night, over a metro area close to an airport). I know it wasn't the space station, a meteor or a satellite...a jet liner flew OVER it. The jet-liner above it was further to the south than the light, but from my angle I watched as the airplane disappeared briefly behind this light then reappeared as the plane outpaced the light. I seriously doubt that it was a helicopter. I was a flight medic for some years and I know rotor-craft, especially the commonly seen rotor-craft in this area. The flight path didn't make sense (for a medical helicopter anyway). It came from out of town and bypassed all hospitals and went back out of town to the east. Maybe it was military, but our Air Guard base is south of where this thing flew...it wasn't on approach to DSM International, it was WAY too far north, its course did not change and it didn’t appear to change altitude at all (again difficult to judge & be certain). It certainly didn't just take off from DSM either.  I suppose it could have been like a private plane/jet or even a military jet, but I could hear NOTHING and what's with the light?  Let alone the ZIG ZAGGING!!!???  Once the light disappeared over the roofline to the east and I could no longer see it, I brought the dog back in and went to bed.  I had completely forgotten about seeing the light until the following evening and I shared this report on an online forum where someone suggested that I report the event to you.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,41.6037,-93.8753

It was so bright that I would almost consider it neon blue.  It didn't flash or blink any other lights, just the same solid electric blue color.   It moved straight across the sky at a steady pace moving faster than an airplane at the same altitude would've been.   It's hard describe the size since it was up so high, but from that distance it was about the size of a soccer ball. Up close it would obviously be much bigger.  Right when i saw it I knew it was something unusual and started shouting for the other two to look.  By the time they turned around it was gone because the opening in the trees that i saw it through isn't very big.  It was behind the trees and gone by the time they looked.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,40.295500000000004,-75.3254

I live a short distance from where this incident took place.  This is my report, and I am an expert U.S. Government typist.   On Friday,  June 25, 2010, at around 3:00 PM, I was in town doing some shopping at our local Kroger store on the Scottsville Road.  The day was clear, hot, and humid.  When I came out of the Kroger store I saw a man in the parking lot looking up into the sky, so I decided to have a look for myself.  We both saw to our amazement what looked like a flying disk or saucer-type object traveling straight across the sky.   At first I dismissed it as a balloon, but the longer I watched it I began to wonder exactly what it was that we were seeing.  The object was large, and looked to be twice the size of an automobile.  There were no other around either.  It was about a mile away as close as I could tell.  The object was disk-shaped and was a very shiny silver color.  There looked t! o be indentations or lights around the edges of the object as well.  The main reasons I began to truly wonder if it was a balloon was these.  The object traveled in a very straight path line where as a balloon would wobble up and down and not fly in a straight formation.  As the silver object flew it tilted from one side to the other about a mile apart each time as if showing off.  First it tilted and flew sideways with its top showing, and then it would tilt again and fly sideways with the bottom showing.  The object repeatedly  did this over and over again the whole fives minutes I watched it.  If it was a craft it may have been going out of control.  There were no streamers of markings on, or attached, to the object like a balloon would have either.  It continued flying along at the same altitude.  I put my groceries inside my car, and then looked back up and the object was gone.  I think it may have went behind some cloud cover or fell somewhere.  This may be a coincide! nce, but shortly after as I was traveling home on the Scottsvi! lle Road their was a traffic jam or something holding up the traffic.  Finally we came upon a large semi truck that was stopped dead in the road.  To make it seem weird there was nothing visible wrong with the truck, and I could not a see any truck drivers either.  No other vehicles were damaged either.  There were close to seven police cars that just simply had this truck surrounded, and the roadway cordoned off.  Amazingly, the truck was in a direct path as to where the mysterius disk-shaped object would have traveled over.  Did he see it and stop?  Did something crash?  I don't know.  Did anyone else see this object besides us?  Did the object stop the engine of the truck?  I wonder now.   Anyway, that's my report.   I am a Christian, and this sighting is true and accurate to the best of my ability.   If anyone else saw this object I would love to know about it.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,37.0327077294686,-86.41964444444444

I watched the object move from west to east, I know this as I am familiar with the layout of my parents property. I watched this light for several seconds and determined it was not a plane due to fact that the light was not unidirectional, as would be the case if it were a plane or helicopter.  I called to my nephew who was inside and asked him if he wanted to see something weird.  We both observed the light/object as it continued towards the east.   After a few moments he ran inside to tell his mom, my sister, to come out and look at what was in the sky.  I explained that it was weird because there were no flashing port or starboard lights.  The flight speed and altitude was also odd as it seemed to be drifting and did not appear to follow a straight path.  I thought that it could possibly be a satellite but due to its brightness and low elevation have considered otherwise.  I doubt that it was a small plane as there was no prop noise.

It was about 9:45pm.  I was driving and we were all admiring the full moon. I noticed a red light in the sky at a 5 o’clock position from the moon.  I thought it might be a planet and asked them that.  It was about the size of the North Star when it first appears in the night sky.  My daughter said if it was a planet it would be Mars because of the color.  We were all looking at it and noticed that it was not steady in the sky and was pulsing slightly.  It was not moving in big movements but steady, like when a helicopter is trying to stay stationary. As we were watching it trying to figure out what it was its glow changed in size and its color was a vibrant red glow.  It increased over 20% of its original size and continued pulsing.  I asked my sister to get her camera out of her purse so we could get some video of it.  As she was getting it out of her purse it decreased in size and went to how it was before. I turned off the road I was on and traveled down a residential road with my hand out the driver’s side window taking video of the object.  I had to stop when a car came up behind me.  I turned towards home and that is when my daughter said that it is gone.   When we pulled into our driveway I went to search the sky to see if there were any planes or anything, but nothing was there.  Just the full moon. I don’t know what we saw, but I know it is nothing I have ever viewed in the night sky before. From the time I first noticed it to the time it vanished was close to 5 minutes.

We were outside watching the space station pass overhead, and while the space station was still visible, we observed the small red glow moving up from the horizon.  It didn't look like a plane; it looked too big, and it wasn't blinking, although it did change from red to orange and yellow at inconsistent intervals.  It reminded me of some very slow-moving meteor gradually fizzling out. I suppose it could possibly have been the sunset reflecting off of a plane, although that doesn't seem likely either; the glow moved toward us across the sky for maybe 40 seconds, before finally seeming to slow, stop, and then quickly fade away and disappear.  My father and I waited for a while to see if we saw anything that looked like a plane continuing along the same path, and didn't see anything at all. Also, interestingly, I saw some very distant blinking lights that looked like those of planes, traveling right across and perpendicular to the path of that red glow.  How they were traveling was weird; I saw one set of blinking lights move from east to west, I looked away, and when I looked back, there was an identical set of lights moving west to east along what looked like the same path.  This repeated again; I guess I saw at least four planes traveling on almost exactly the same path in opposite directions, or the same plane changing direction three times. The lights didn't look like those of a helicopter and none of the flying objects made any noise. I'm aware of Wright Patterson Air Force base being about 30 miles away, but it's northeast of my location unlike those strange lights, and I've never been aware of any strange flying objects before.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,39.4792,-84.713

We're right where the Indiana and Michigan state lines meet, and also where St. Joseph and Elkhart counties in Indiana meet.  There were no clouds in the sky and it was about an hour after sunset. We were outside doing fireworks for the kids when my daughter said ""look, a UFO!""  I thought she had seen a plane but when I looked, there was a very bright red light in the east, less than 10 degrees above the horizon and I would guess about 5 miles from us. The light moved from east to west, right toward us.  It only took about 20 seconds to get to us, and it grew in size very quickly.  At its closest, I'd say it was the size of a dime held at arm's length.  There were no flashing lights but it was giving off a VERY bright red light from what appeared to be inside.  It was the most incredible red, like a massive Christmas tree light but it didn't really flicker.  It wasn't just a glowing light because we could see there was some structure to it by the way the light didn't come from beneath it.  There was no sound at all, even at it's closest, which I'd guess to be less than 1/2 mile away. After it got to its closest point to us, it changed direction and turned 90 degrees to its right and headed north over southern Cass county, Michigan.  An airplane would have had to make an arc to change direction.  This thing simply stopped moving west and started heading north.  We clearly knew it wasn't a meteor, which would have been much faster and kept going straight.  I went into the house to get the video camera but I couldn't find the buttons to start it up.

My peripheral vision picked up a low-flying airplane above the freeway, which caught my interest. As I looked to examine it, I noticed it was not an airplane but a darkly-colored (black or dark grey) saucer-shaped object that was moving at what seemed to be a low speed and at what seemed to be a low altitude. It was difficult to tell, as my car was moving past it at 70 mph in the opposite direction, but the craft appeared to be travelling somewhere between 40-70 mph, going north, and only a few hundred feet off the ground.  This would have made the object itself a bit smaller than an airplane, although it is too difficult to estimate a size. What was then even more interesting was a blue light that emitted from the side wall of the craft, moving in a circle around the ! craft, looking a bit like a reflection from a glass wall, but perhaps coming from within the craft. It was then that I really thought I'd seen a U.F.O. I had never seen one before, and I still have my doubts about this one.  The craft was spotted in a densely populated urban area, not far from Disneyland and many other world-famous entertainment spectacles, and it may simply have been coming from or going to one of those places.  But for the five seconds I had to witness it, the craft truly did not look human to me. Many more people saw the object I'm sure, and so I made this report to see if anyone else who saw it also was taken aback by its curiosities.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,33.83243273727648,-117.89132517193949

Im estimating the distance from my location to be around two to three miles. It looked like they came from the area of Wapato, Wa. It looked like they twsiting and wobbeling. They were scattered horizontally behind the light signals, it looked like they were above Union Gap, Wa. a suburb of Yakima city. It looked like there was four but i could be wrong, one or two of them were fading in and out like mirrors twisting. The light turned green and i proceeded east on Nob Hill blvd until i got to the college parking lot areas turned off in a north direction and stoped, got out of my vehicle, looked up and then noticed there were more above. I then got on to stewart, it is the first street that runs along side Nob Hill blvd on the north side it. I then went to my place which isnt very far from both those locations, after parking i got out then looked straight up, i then seen something that was much bigger and non metalic. It was odd shaped, looked sort of like a bunch of objects connected in a mass. I hurried into my place and found one of my sets of binoculars, by the time i got side and back to that same location, i couldnt find it, so im thinking it was lower then i thought i seen. There are trees in this area all over, its hard to say what it did. I then looked for the other ones that i had seen before, on my way home. I did observe two of these metalic ones, to the north. They were very far away, and it looked like they were changing there direction back to the east, towards Selah, Wa. which is another suburb of Yakima, Wa. After several minutes of trying to identify these, they just disappeared, it was like they had split up and went up higher in oposite directions. The lower bigger one that was non metalic, im not sure where that one went. I was wearing sun glasses, up until that last few minutes, then i couldnt see them anymore. It seemed like these sun glasses helped me to see them better then with the naked eye. This could have something to do with the light spectrum, it seemed like they were more shiny with the sun glasses on, when i took them off and looked i found it harder to respot them. This could be a hoax, even thou the lower jet stream usually goes in the opposite direction. One of these looked like it could have been a transparent weather ballon with an instrument hanging under it, another one almost looked like it was a parachute out of control. Three of these objects i cant explain, the big one disappeared, the other two that were metalic, they looked like smaller connected clusters making it look like one object. There could have been as much as six or seven objects, all doing different things. Its hard to say exactly what the sizes of these things where, i was able to spot them better, then a jet liner.

The streak began just above us and to the north and turned into three very fast moving crescent shaped objects then swooped down heading south and turned to the south-southeast. The three objects were almost sliding through the curve in the same manner in which a race car slides around a corner. The objects were a brownish-orange and were shaped like a half moon or crescent with one black window in the middle of each side. The objects didn’t fly like a plane they were flying vertically. The rear of the object had a blackish circle. The objects were flying in formation: side by side, the two on the right had made a smooth curve and the one on the left came close to the one in the middle and had to swerve to avoid hitting him, it also increased the speed faster than the other two and pushed himself ahead as if playing a game with the other two. The crafts seem to come from this weird electrical haze and left short gold orange trails behind them. The crafts disappeared as fast as they appeared and they also made no sound and had no lights.

We were heading North, so we would have seen the objects in a easterly direction from where we were. We were on a long, dark road, and there were no other cars around. I immediately told my cousin to pull the car over, and we watched the objects for about 2 minutes before they disappeared. It didn’t seem like they flew away, they just vanished. While we were watching the objects, they seemed to stay in an ellipse formation, but one of the globes tended to move around. While we were on the road, we pulled over in front of a house and observed these globes at about a 45 degree angle. Although upstate NY is very hilly, the area we were at was surrounded by fields, and we could see forever. There is no doubt in my mind that this/these objects were in the sky and not on the ground. The objects in the sky were red, or giving off a red glow, were it was the most red on the outer part, and it seemed to get lighter in the middle of each little ball. Besides the red globes, we couldn’t make out a defined shape of object, just this little cluster of these 5-6 red balls. I don’t know if it was a coincidence or not, but as soon as we saw the objects, I tried to make a phone call, and my phone wouldn’t work. The area always has service, so it wasn’t a dead spot, but my phone wouldn’t connect. The sky was very clear that night, and the moon seemed to light up everything. Central NY seems to be a high traffic area for airplanes, as they are seen flying over all the time, and at the time we saw this, there were a few planes in the air. There is no possibility that what we saw was an airplane.  These red balls were much bigger that any plane lights could have been, and based on the distance we approximated, there is no way a plane could be that big or move like they did.

When I was approaching the Williamston exit I notice two lights in the sky. I assumed that they were just landing lights from a commercial airliner, but as time passed I realized that it wasn’t moving towards me, but hovering in one spot. It’s hard to recall how high up it seemed to be, but it made me think of how a helicopter would hover when doing a traffic report. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything from it, but there was no sound that I could tell. If it had been an airplane or a helicopter at that altitude it would have definitely been heard. After I passed underneath it, I noticed that it had begun to move off fairly quickly in the opposite direction. It seemed to me that other people on the road had witnessed this as well because some drivers were slowing down, and some were even pulling off the road. There were three extremely bright blue-white lights on the front tip and on the end of each ""wing."" There were also no hints of metal on the object.  Since the moon was very bright I would assume that it would have reflected off the surface, but all I saw was a black mass.  Its shape was a little hard to explain. It was almost like a stealth fighter shape, but the edges weren’t as sharp.  It was a little smoother and more triangular.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,34.49168811881188,-82.64779851485149

A few minutes after 10 p.m. on Tuesday, October 14, 2008, I was sitting on the deck in my backyard in Louisville, Kentucky when I observed a small round object with a red flashing light and a white light which was not flashing moving from north to south across a clear sky.    The object appeared to be spinning.   I was lying on a lounge chair facing west and looking toward the sky when I first observed the object coming from the north.   The northern horizon is not visible from our house due to large trees in the neighborhood.   I observed the object first as it came into view in the sky above the trees obstructing my view of the northern horizon. I am not good at judging altitude, but I would guess that the object was at least a couple thousand feet in the air.  We live eight miles southeast of the Louisville International Airport.   The object did not come from the airport and was not going there-it was not in any kind of a holding pattern, and it was moving too fast to be a plane.   It was too high to have taken off from or to be landing at the Louisville International Airport.    I could not hear any noise from the object, but due to the constant drone of the traffic on my street and on nearby Bardstown Road, it is likely that any noise the object was making was drowned out. The sky was completely clear, and the moon was full.  Visibility of the nighttime sky is never good in my neighborhood.  We live two blocks from a major Louisville thoroughfare, Bardstown Road, and the city lights make spotting even any of the constellations difficult.  Despite the completely clear sky, few stars were visible. As I was watching the object move across the sky, my wife opened the kitchen window and asked me what I was doing.  I asked her to come outside.  She and my 15 year old daughter came out on the deck as the object was nearing the southern horizon.  They also observed the object and were unable to identify what it was. I would be interested to learn if anyone else in the Louisville area observed this object.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,38.21121446765155,-85.68918456444217

OTHERWISE, I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THE SIGHTING WITH HER.  SORRY FOR THE ERROR.  ~Sc'Eric  [State College, PA -- approx. 2008.07.19+03:27]  A hot, muggy night.  I was with 3 friends:  A, B and B's 14 yr-old nephew E.  We had decided to visit the Penn State golf course to cool off in the sprinklers.  The sprinklers were not running, so we just laid in the grass and looked at the few stars we could see through the haze.  At approximately 02:27, near the zenith, I saw something move that made me do a double-take.  Something about the way it moved was incongruous.  About the same time I said, ""Whoa, what was that?"", then B chimed in with something similar.  We lay watching as two white lights (which appeared to be connected) moved from approximatley West to East (left to right, across our field of vision).  We all saw it moving, but I'm not sure how long it took A and E to lock onto it after we pointed it out.  We watched as it traveled eastward (perhaps northeastward) from the zenith toward the constellation of Cassiopaea.  One of the first things we noticed was that there was a light on each end, one leading the other.  This contrasts what most would expect to see: 2 lights moving parallel to one another, as the lights on a winged aircraft.  I recall they were not much larger or different in intensity than the surrounding stars.  I also recall that as they passed over the background of stars, they seemed relatively close to Earth, perhaps within Earth orbit or closer, though I cannot qualify what gives me that impression.  They definitely seem closer than the communications satellites I've seen pass over since I was a kid.  I did not think to observe whether any of the background stars were ""blotted out"" in the space between the two lights.  As we watched, the lights began to change configuration.  B was the first to notice, exclaiming how they appeared to be moving closer together.  I remember commenting that the configuration shift seemed consistent with the notion that the lights were part of a larger craft and that craft was rotating (in an anti-clockwise fashion).  Additionally, the ""object"" appeared to be rotating in multiple planes--hence the lights moving closer together.  In about the width of 2 fists (held at arms length) the alleged object had rotated a full ninety-degrees and continued doing so as it traversed the sky toward Cassiopaea.  It was at this point that I began realising (out loud) what subconsciously made me focus on the object: the fact that the lights were moving in a way that was completely inconsistent with the likes of traditional aircraft.  (And, in retrospect, I would also like to point out that the haze and general cloud-cover would seem to preclude the notion that we were observing an orbiting satellite, as we could barely see the stars themselves.)  The two lights started out approximately one or two finger-widths apart (at arms-length)--their widest configuration.  I specifically kept looking for, but found no evidence of, a third light-source which may have formed a triangle.  Once the object entered the Cassiopaea, I lost it.  B was able to track it about a minute longer before it disappeared into the haze.  In all the entire duration of the observation was about 1 to 1.5 minutes (for me) and about 2 minutes for B and A.  I never thought to ask E about his observations.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,40.78989046391753,-77.86876108247422

I was on a canoe camping trip last week, deep in the wilderness, with my wife and kids.  I was woken up by something really bright--saw three bright lights in the Eastern sky, evenly spaced, but absolutely not moving.  They seemed to me to be too low in the sky for a satellite, plus they were stationary.  The spacing, at that distance, seemed too bright for any manmade object I am familiar with (geosynchronous orbit).  After ten minutes the three lights began fading and glowing randomly, and continued doing so for over thirty minutes. When it went dark you could still see a sort of halo around the area, then the lights woud pulse back on--but not all at once, they sort of followed each other in their pulsations.   I went to sleep, too tired to continue watching.  I initially thought it might be the space station, solar arrays rotating in the sunlight, but then I found out later the space station orbits the earth and would have been moving--this held position! .  My wife and kids saw the whole thing, and my daughter saw it again the next night.  If I had to guess at a location it would be 60-80 miles south of Atikokan, ONT.  Still, it could have been a man-made object I suppose.  But it was unusual enough that I have been doing a little websearching on this subject and now I am not so sure it was man-made.  I did hear a commercial jet aircraft fly by at the time north of my position.  Maybe they saw it too. I screwed up by not filming it.

The time was approximately 1:30 am.  I climbed in bed and closed my eyes, when I noticed a bright light coming from the west.  My bed is beneath 3 large windows facing south.  The light was shining on the blinds and looked as if it were car headlights.  I moved the blinds slightly to see if I could get a better look, and was only able to see a bright orange circular light, behind the trees.  To be honest it looked like what we would call a harvest moon.  It seemed odd coming from that direction at that time of morning.   I got up and went to look out of other windows that I may have a better view of the light and possibly the source.  I finally went into a bedroom facing west and looked out the window and saw the bright “moon” in the sky.  A new cell phone tower had just been put up in town.  The light seemed to be behind it somewhere.   I went back to bed telling myself it must be the actual moon, not really believing it.  The light lasted for about 30-45 minutes and then as quickly as it had appeared, it was gone.  I did not see it leave or how it moved.  I heard no noise.

I first noticed in the southeast corner ahead of our truck a odd yellow light. It came on and then dimmed maybe 5 seconds later, I pointed this first light out to Rachel, simply cause it was kind of weird looking. She missed the first light but then a second light came on to the left of the first yellow light, this one again faded. We both were laughing and wondering what it could be as a third yellow light came to the right of the first one, and again faded. This was right around 6PM, probably no latter than 6:15. After the third light went out nothing happened for maybe a minuet, we were now all watching the sky, Dana who what sitting in the back seat drivers side, then noticed a blue flashing light. This light resembled a tower light, but was high in the sky, right after that, Dana noticed that there were actually three blue flashing lights that were all moving in unison, spread out a huge distance, maybe the size of a foot ball field or so, if you would have connected the “dots”/lights it would have made a triangle. These blue lights, I should specify were rather small, large enough to see, but not nearly as large as the yellow lights. The lights moved across the highway, sill in front of us a ways but coming in our general direction, moving diagonally across the highway. Once the lights crossed the highway Rachel could no longer really watch, she was still driving, (we totally should have pulled over) still watching the lights, now on the other side of the highway there was suddenly a really bright yellow light, same color and warm tone of the other yellow lights, but much much brighter. This light stayed on for maybe 10 or 15 seconds, then went out. I freaked out at this point, screamed “BIG yellow light” at this point none of us were really concerned or worried, but incredibly intrigued. The blue flashing lights that made up th! e large triangle shape were still flashing in unison. Maybe two minuets after the large light came on suddenly many yellow lights came on, and an object rotated. Side note: I’m an art student and part of out schooling is learning how to draw and render space/depth of objects, and how objects really are shaped three dimensionally even if you can’t see the whole object. As this object rotated, the yellow lights that were on the side of it rotated in the way a triangle would. So this object with the yellow lights that rotated was in the middle of the three flashing blue lights. The inner triangle rotated for maybe 10 seconds. At this point I was amazed and maybe scared, excited, it was a weird emotion. We continued driving, now that the yellow lights went out, the blue ones were still present and flashing for another few minuets. Along this part of the highway there were a lot of trees in the way, so I couldn’t tell if any other yellow lights went on or what happened exactly at this point, but when there was a break in the trees we could still see the blue lights, for maybe another five minuets. The whole event happened between Hancock and Coloma and lasted anywhere from 10 to 15 minuets. We pulled over in Westfield to see if anything was still going on, and we couldn’t see anything. 	This was something absolutely remarkable. It was weird and I know most people that hear it that weren’t in the car, and didn’t see it themselves probably wont believe it. I am so happy I was three other people, so I don’t sound completely crazy. This thing was so huge and didn’t make a sound, it moved gracefully, just weird. I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed something like this. Whatever “this” may be. I definitely have some thoughts on the matter.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

As I continued to drive down the road (and be amazed by what I saw) I noticed a black object in the sky coming from the direction of where I lost sight of the “green streak”. The black object continued to move in a westward direction. I arrived at a stoplight and kept watching as the black object slowly moved across the sky towards the west until I could no longer see it behind trees and buildings. When the object was straight ahead of my view, it looked to be a blackish/grayish color with a little red at the back of the object. Here are a couple of things that I am unsure of: It may have had something hanging from the bottom of it with a ball shape in the middle of the hanging “line”. I was really trying to get a good look at it, but unfortunately was still driving a car and couldn't focus on it that well. It may have even been moving to the side left to right-right to left a little, just the front of the object (from my view it seemed like it). When I arrived home, I rushed inside to write down all that had just happened. My little sister suggested that it may have been a balloon, but I do not believe that a balloon could move across the sky the way that this object did. We went outside to see if we could find any trace of it but couldn't. The only thing that we noticed was towards the west we saw a stream of smoke which looked like the remnants of an airplane passing through. Later that night, on the News, there were people reporting sightings of fireballs in the sky and there was a photo of a stream of smoke which was left behind by the “fireball”. It was reported that it was probably a bolide or fireball from a meteor shower. The streak that I saw did not leave a trail of smoke behind it and a later did see the trail of smoke but it was to the west/southwest direction.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,26.8542,-80.0547

Movie makers inform  in advance that a movie will be shot at what time and ask to move all cars. There was no such request,and movies would not make such noise at that time of night.

And we came over the hill for town hall road and saw it still had not moved, we saw that about 15 other cars were pulled over on each side of the road, with everyone out staring at the object with cameras and cell phones.  We attempted to get several pictures but we couldn’t because of the low quality of my camera phone. The object stayed in the same place for a good couple of minutes.  The object began to lift and as it did we all heard something that sounded like an electric engine winding up.  The object at this point was about ¼ mile away and yet it looked like it was right in front of me, I’d guess it was a few hundred feet in diameter.   The lights flicked off and I saw it had the reflectivity of polished aluminum or steel but was so light of a color that I had never seen metal that color before.  The trees below the object didn’t move as it changed from a hover to achieving lift, which was weird because it was not that high above trees directly below it.  The object then got higher and higher then it seemed to disappear.   After the object left (about 2 minutes later), we saw a dual prop plane come from the same direction the object was first sighted in, the aircraft circled the spot a few times were the object was then left back in the direction it came.

I usually stand on the porch itself but for some reason I decided to trek down the four steps onto the dirt drive way below.  I lit my smoke and looked to the sky like I sometimes do and noticed a small blue star to the east. Venus was clear tonight. As I stood there taking in the beauty of the stars something caught my vision. I looked almost precisely north to see a fairly odd ball of light moving in extremely bizarre and unrecognizable motions. I stood in awe for at least twenty minutes watching the very graceful light dance around the sky, I am surely no pilot but I can most definitely recognize a passing plane or helicopter with ease. This I assure was neither. It changed colors from a light florescent white to a light blue and once in a while almost the color of the glow from a fire. It maneuvered in and out of clouds at top notch speeds making turns I have never seen even jets make. Hair point turns around in circles and zig zags… As fast as I could hold my finger up to it and point swiveling my finger around, it moved. I realized I was the only witness, so I ran inside to get my sister. She was skeptic of my claims at first until she stepped outside and witnessed it herself. She could not believe her eyes either! We both made sporadic phones calls; one of witch was to the local News Paper the Kennebec Journal whom witch had nothing to say but plenty to laugh about. My brother suggested I call the state police to document the incident, I obliged.  All the while this light continued to move extremely fast around the evening sky. My sister went in and out of the house as my eyes stayed affixed on the orb. It seemed to travel further then closer, so on and so forth.  One of the last times my sister went back inside I saw something very piculure, the one orb had split into two, both making similar sweeping patterns over a widespread area of the northern and eastern sky.  By this time I had made my report with the police and they said someone would call me back. I went back inside to get another cigarette and my sister to see the now two lights above. When we got back outside we looked up to see at least 4 other lights circling the sky. We watched this event for at least 30 more minutes. My sister returned inside and I followed. I got a drink and received a call back from the police officer on duty saying he was busy but he would be there ASAP. I went back outside alone. This time it was back to just two lights twisting around. One of them seemed very close. I could make out a disk shape siluette in the clouds with the lights illuminating from it. I pulled my phone out and use it as a video recorder, unfortunately it was the only piece of equipment I had. I managed to capture the original disk of light but obviously on my phone it was a tiny ball of light. It moved around my screen as I held my phone as still as possible. I went back inside. About 10 minutes later one officer pulled in the driveway across the street from us. I went out and yelled for him to get his attention. As he turned around I looked to the sky again to see nothing but fog.  He pulled in our driveway and got out and we discussed what my sister and I had seen and I showed him the video. He seemed like he wanted to believe, but he also seemed like he had to see it to believe it.  And then it faintly returned, he watched the strange techniques of the light rome around the sky.  He admitted it was not any form of aviation he had seen, not a helicopter or plane nor a satellite because it was below the clouds.  We watched it together with my sister until it got so far away and faint we could no longer see it. We talked about it a little, he made a small report and left. That was the last time I saw the lights in the sky about 3 hours after it began it was over just as easy. Thank you for letting me post my report here.  Keep your eyes to the sky in Maine and maybe (hopefully) you will be able to verify my reports.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

Have been having these for 9 or 10 years. Anyway aside from that have had many curious and odd things happen. I would like to start with my sighting in March 2005 at 3:00am in Summerland, B.C.. I was visiting relatives in Summerland, B.C. and go there regularly, on this particular evening oddly enough we were discussing UFO's and my comment was, ""How could you not believe there are UFO's or other types of beings? The universe is so big we would be arrogent to think we were the only beings to exist.""   There was some agreements and disagreements and the conversation fizzled out and eventually everyone went to bed. I was staying in my cousins house in the bedroom attic with the head of my bed facing south. I woke up looking out of the north window and it was very bright out and didn't think much of it then looked out the south window at the head of my bed to see if the light was comeing from the south. When I turned to look out of my bedroom window it was anything but bright, in the middle of the sky probably about 1/4 mile from me over the Okanagon Lake was a beautiful black triangle with lights on each corner. I pinched myself and patted myself down to make sure I wasn't dreaming and was stunned and frightened. It was really beautiful and smooth and black. I thought maybe for a moment it was a new type of plane like a stealth but I knew at once it wasn't. I wanted to run downstairs and tell my cousin but, #1. I didn't want to freak her out and #2. I was afraid to move. Anyway It silently hung in the air and did not move, I didn't sense it was hovering at all it was just there as still as anything. The triangle was probably about as large as a football field and extremely smooth and beautiful to look at. While I was looking at this UFO or whatever it was, this huge opalescent ball, (something like a bubble full of soap) came right up out of the top of it and hovered for a few seconds then flew straight up in the air and disapeared. By now I was totally freaked out and ran downstairs to get my cousin and of course by the time I could calm down and tell her what happened we ran back upstairs and it was gone. Naturally my cousin thinks I'm a nut and had too much to drink. (for the record I wasn't drunk)  I have always been a believer of things that are unusal and strange to us that the majority of people refuse to think is possible, this event has totally solidified my belief in UFO's or whatever you want to call them. I know what I saw and regardless of what anyone thinks there is something going on here that our government is well aware of and has been for many years.  My ex-husband and I have also witness ball lightning floating through our bedroom window in 1994. It floated around the room very slowly then left with an explosive crashing sound through our night light. Nothing was damaged, although it sounded like the light shattered . My ex husband is about as cynical and skeptical as they come, so, slightly happy that such a skeptic actually saw this strange phenonema.  Further back in the 70's my aunt and I witnessed a huge fireball in the Nevada desert. We were on our way to Disneyland for a family trip (I think I was 10) I was in our camper on top of the higher bunk with the window facing forward towards the road. My aunt and I were the only people to witness this huge fireball that seemed to come toward us then blow up. The funny thing was that my aunt and I never talked about it until 20 years later. She has also been a witness to UFO's. Although, I have great interest in Ufology, she does not, but certainly cannot deny what she has seen.  To tell you the truth this frightens me a bit and have read alot of books on the subject and have come to a few of my own conclusions, mostly conspiracy. I certainly hope letting you know about this does not open a can of worms for me but have wanted to chat about it for some time. I did report this incident to UFOBC years ago but to me its always at the forfront of my mind and     wanted to share it with whomever would listen.

As this light was moving a plane appeared into my vision from over my house, as soon as the plane got maybe half a mile from the object the light faded out. This could mean it faded or it shot upwards. A very strange and interesting sighting. I couldnt put a distance on the object but it was around the average height of a plane.

Lights circling inside clouds over Nashville  My wife and I were driving on I-40 westbound on Sunday night, coming back to Nashville from east Tennessee. After passing the Lebanon exit, I began noticing lights moving inside the clouds closer to Nashville. As we got closer, I could tell that they looked like spot lights shining down from above or inside the clouds instead of from below, and they were moving in large circles. This night we saw two of them moving in large circles and figure eights from east to west over Nashville. One of the main reasons I became so interested was that my wife and I have seen similar lights before. I filed a report back in 8/03 about lights we saw clrcling around inside the clouds during a big thunderstorm. We had pretty much conviced ourselves that this earlier sighting was a spotlight promoting something, or maybe lights from the Starwood Ampitheater, which we're kind of near (although I don't know why anyone would have continued to shine these types of lights during one of the biggest thunderstorms of the summer). These lights looked almost exactly the same and were moving in almost the same fashion, except there were only two instead of four. So now we had a chance to try to find the source of these lights and prove to ourselves that we weren't seeing anything out of the ordinary. We closed in on the city from about 30 miles out and the lights became increasingly obvious. I'm sure other cars must have seen them, but there's no way to know. I had slowed down a lot because I was fascinated by these lights clrcling and seemingly swooping around just above the cloud ceiling. We kept expecting one to become more visible or distinct though a break in the clouds, but it never happened. They stayed very fuzzy and shapeless. The lights would circle opposite each other, then move together and back apart or do some crazy zig zag. However, we never saw a beam of light from the ground, and that was primarily what we were looking for. We got off the interstate on Stewarts Ferry Pk., when we thought we were finally getting below the lights, and went east. I was driving, but my wife could still see them northeast of us, so I took a left on Lebanon Pk and went north. Now we were very close to the Nashville airport, but the general movement of the lights seemed to be to the northwest and we could never get under them. We were also getting around more city lights and it was harder to see them, and they seemed to be farther away from us. We were tired from our drive so we went on home, but we satisfied ourselves that these lights were not originating from spotlights on the ground. I don't know that it proves anything about the first lights we saw, but it makes me wonder. I know other people must have seen these lights, as they were all over above the city, so I'm hoping someone else will come forward. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I SEEN 4/16/09 (of which I posted here) I feel so much better knowing someone seen the same thing 5 years eariler.  The cloud thing is interesting though.. It was like they not want to go beneath the cloud cover, but I could see them clearly once they connected together in the cloud clearing. The cloud thing is strange, it was between walmart and kroger on the busiest street in Nashville, near a communication tower... odd and very strange... I have calmed down a little since then but I cannot enter my apartment without thinking about what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My parents, who I live with, were at Mass and I stayed home doing my laundry and watching T.V in the garage.  I stepped outside for a minute to get some fresh air and to just cloud gaze and I noticed a white orb in the sky.  I could not tell how high it was or how big it was but I could tell it was white and appeared to be changing shape.  At first I thought it was a balloon or a plastic bag that had somehow got carried up by the wind to an unbelievable altitude but the object did not move.  It was unseasonably windy in L.A that day, which made the clouds coast by at a faster than normal speed but the object stayed stationary with out a sound.  After about 2 minutes of just staring at the object, I ran into the garage and took 2 pictures of the object and about 8 seconds of video. After the 8 seconds of video, my camera lost power for some reason.  The Photos were taken consecutively and the object appears to be in two different shapes.  The video is too grainy too see the object. After the camera lost power I went to the garage to put it back in the case. I went back outside and the object was gone.  I climbed on the roof of the garage to see if it had drifted or moved into the distance but there was no trace.  The timeframe of walking back into the garage had been about 9 seconds. I am baffled as to what the objects are but am very curious.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

Glowing orb sightings occurred April 16-22 of 2009 the other 2 bigger ships showed the 16th and 17th only the one big ship returned April 19-22 but here is the best part on 4/21 between 12 o clock and 1 o clock at night I was actually getting very scared had no car or phone to get the hell out of dodge and I herd a jet so ran on the porch to see what was about to happen and thought I was gonna see something really cool  ha!! Nope the jet flying between 10 maybe 15 thousand ft. flew directly over the house with his burners on and a maybe a mile or 2 away was the UFO  the jet just flew by or just didn't see it either way I felt a little less worried because I thought somebody finally made the call it did take of about 30 seconds later or I thought that just a cloud covering it without the cloud.Me being irrational with the reality of the situation ran to the middle of the driveway with my binoculars I noticed this pain in the back of my head that me and my mother had felt on 16th but she was to freaked out by the whole idea and actually said she was scared she was gonna get picked up and dropped of ha!! so most every night I got my binoculars and watched the orbs circling each other but they came a little earlier each night the 2 orbs were never out with the other 2 UFOs that i could see they always came before the UFOs with red/white light's.Also I'm 10! 0% sure they were not airplanes because most of the time I would be watching the UFOs and planes would go by. Also that area is flooded with air traffic day and night but those first 2 nights there was so many airplane there was at least 1 or more in my sight at all times and no noise at all from the orbs and flight characteristics matched none of today's jets/plains/helicopter hovered like a balloon but picked up to much speed to fast.It was not shooting stars very simple very clear. I also know a few people who live in that area a good chunk of their life who have witnessed UFO activity in the area years ago.These were not my first sightings in the area 2 times before to be exact witch leads me to my next words. 2 people told me they saw a UFO years earlier in the area.I look at the stars since the dish got cut off about a month ago I would not have saw any of it if i had not talked to my grandmother that day .At first it when the orbs arrived I could not be drag in the house all I wanted to do was get that awesome footage and watch it over every night.But each night was a little different but on the 4th day I was doing a lot of thinking and was also filled with excitement fear I just wasn't thinking strait.I would sometimes turn on the porch light before I would go outside or to let dogs in and out so eventually  what ever was flying those aircraft had to see me turning on the porch light the UFO,s returned every night for something they would hover for hours some nights so when they stopped in the sky right in front of the house and they got a little closer as they were circling and dropping altitude slowly closer towards the ground.They knew I was there I just didn't really think about it until the orbs chilled in the air for a couple hours and it was still 4/20 about 10 o clock to top it all of I was by my myself no running vehicle and I finally realized if they/it whatever could build aircraft such as the ones they/it/him/her what ever posses they probably have technology or something that lets them know ! I'm ther e. I ignored my worst fears and the hurt in my head to see if the other 1or 2 UFO,s were doing their thing about a mile or so away the fear is the 2 orbs froze in the sky circling away.I tried to take more pictures worthless attempts the camera sucks so it was another fail.So I sat on the porch looking at the sky above a airplane was passing and a really bright light caught my eye from strait above it was the second UFO from the mountain it's lights shined bright white ember and red  for about 5 seconds then quickly cut of its lights. After that my brain couldn't let me watch any more i had seen to much it could have been right above me the entire time it had demonstrated it's superior capabilities. I couldn't take it I came close to calling the 5-0 to do what.But at 12:32 4/21 I heard the jet and I couldn't help to think what if those where aliens that would mean that this planet could be taken if so pleased seeing demonstrations 1 after another. now for but I know the Crafts could have returned again last night i could not tell you yes or no because i was typing this. I can take a chance and look like a fool or do NOTHING.  4/25/09   pss i wrote this on the 4/24 and 25th and i returned to my house at about 8 or 9 on the night of the 25th and the UFOs did return again about it seen much more UFO activity last night more than what is normally out actually.Not sure all how many or if any other people in the area know about the UFO  activity in the area . But I checked online to see if any UFO had been reported in the area  but nothing has ever been reported in that area till now.But i heard some people on a plane over North Carolina seen UFO in Feb i really wouldn't doubt it  or just t don't care.4/27/09 Saw 3 UFO's within 1 hour. I only watched for a hour or so then retired for the night.  4/28/09 OK this time i saw 3 UFO's circling near an airplane was pretty close to the 3 orbs glowing a ember or copper color . I honestly would not be surprised if people or pilots do not report seeing them.Also 3 extra! UFO's i n where in the sky last night. and I also seen the shape of UFO that was a  triangle it had 6 lights that shined a bright white and I now think it was one like the triangle UFO that landed or just hovered over neighbors yard but to be honest I don't really know the shape of the craft that hovered over the neighbors yard but because I took 6 pictures on the 16th and looked at them on my computer the 17th no good except for I could see something in 1 picture that was above the ground that looked like a silver line but thought nothing of it and deleted it because I thought it was just camera error and another pic with bubble light if that makes since looked like bubbles that were lite up from the inside out all over the picture and i didn't even mean to take a picture I turned around to go on the porch after many failed pictures and it just took a pic but now it would make since because I thought that was 1 of the 2 with the red and white lights I just couldn't say because I only seen the lights on them but now I'm 50% sure that the 2 with the red and white lights were triangle while the other 2 were orb shaped but only from a distance I am still not sure of their  true shape yet but i will try to find out.I've also seen more UFO's but these that i have written about have always came back and hang around in the area for hours or a few minutes at a  time. sometimes they leave and return the same night but there are also many others but are just passing through the area  i do know is that there is a air base or something around  4/29/09 also sorry for not sending this sooner but this is one of the biggest decision of my life and  i fear you guys will come to check it out and the UFO's will have left the area and I will look like A dumb ass.Just contact me by email if you have any questions.1 Last thing i have not really left any specific time records for sightings well I also didn't keep count but if i did it be about 30 just since April 16/09 and i would be happy to take a lie detector test if needed you can! imagine that i am very confused with what I am seeing and for a while after i seen my first real UFO right by house about 200ft in the air and the craft was at least 60ft to 70ft I was beyond petrified and terrorfied my mom was in the next room so I holler to show her and it was moving at about 30mph we got out on the porch and it was going right over the tree line at a near by mountain with only 1 dim white light on and i started turning the flash light on and off and it brighten it's light and froze in mid air over the mountain for a couple of seconds then faded from sight as it hovered the mountain I thought i was hallucinating basically I thought i was going insane my mom saw it to or she says she did.The 2nd time I was at the end of the driveway using the cell phone and this time I was alone but I was talking to somebody who I couldn't exactly tell there is a UFO and the front is visible and the rest is like not there.The guy would have laughed hung up and had me in a padded room within the hour plus I didn't tell anyone mainly because nobody could believe this anyway. So I thought to my self ? there was a front and it was black I thought it was some birds flying in like a formation but first of all it was to even if birds are flying that close together there is gonna be some birds getting ahead even 1ft  movement in fly formation it would look squiggly and no wings flapping and no space between the wings of the birds that's when I started thinking great another UFO maybe I'm not crazy.It was also like 6oclock day time sunny not dark at all.It was only about 100yards in the air and it was moving to slow to some birds flying and I couldn't think of anything else that even looks like that did and still cant.I can only say the front was shaped like an ark it was black and if this was a UFO it was about 120ft wide at least and the rest wasn't even visible I'M not sure why all of this shit is all within 3mile radios of the house.At first i thought they had their own private base somewhere in the mountains that ! was my o wn little crap theory so I remembered the direction the 1st UFO was headed then the 2nd then i figured out if there was a base I got the general direction it might be in but here is the interesting part there is a water fall in the direction I figured the base would be not a base but a person i know and his friend saw a UFO up at the water fall years ago.Another person i know said he saw one out the house window. saw diamond shaped UFO same kind I had seen at my old  house but in a different place 2 times and to top it all of A jet was chasing a UFO right above my head at about 20 to 35 thousand ft. I was gonna send a email to Ktox to show UFO hunters in April but to much pressure and I was moving so instead I just let it eat at my soul if i ever had one. I will fill out a crap report that people will laugh at anyway but if my best friend told me this shit I would have called the nut hut. I also found out that during the days of my April 16th/25th UFO sighting people all over the planet were witnessing the strange crafts I even watched a video of  2 orbs in a different place i didn't really expect that A month later but its crazy. also many left out details and UFO sightings.also temperarly disabled the DVD player with fuzzy black and white picture kinda twisted blackness on 4/20 weak also had 2 pretty weird dreams during those nights maybe caused by stress and fear. Also i forgot to mention April/16/09 I called my friend then called my grandma that lives in Delaware for the first time in 2 years i call her and talk till cell phone goes dead then charge up and go back to the end of the drive way to get cell phone reception.Anyway I didn't tell here about my second UFO sighting just my first and she told me her and her daughter saw 2 orb shaped UFO's that were as she describes circling each other kinda like they were just playing with each other so I was starting to feel not as insane after she told me that but she didn't know how twisted my mind was from the my 2nd sighting and we started discussing how we think the world is failing I said [to be completely honest i don't think the world is gonna make it to long at the rate its going and humanity will eventually kill itself with the pride in the nations starting pride wars  they wont just unit as people and just get it over with and start the road to mega science and eventually humans leave earth to go explore the universe] And she was saying now days it's scary to even consider having  a kid in the world today and I was standing by the mail box and it was starting to get dark but I was just looking up in the sky and i saw i just waited about 5 seconds to think see holy shit mum mum there are 2 orbs just circling each other just like mum mum said like 10 minutes earlier my mind was bent way to far then so i ran in the house got my mom and they were gone I knew then I had lost my fuckin mind i told mum mum they were gone and nobody seen them once again then I told her about my second siting and how crazy I am because i COULD HAVE SWORN i JUST SAW THEM 2 UFOs i said then she says your not crazy and if they just poped up from the sky they will be back I started telling her no they won't because I'm just crazy but i waited a couple minutes and told her that's the biggest coincidence of my life but still not sure of reality untill the orbs show up again I got my moms and her boyfriend to check it out and sure enough they ! were rea l I wasn't crazy my mind untied for the moment just untill the 2 bigger UFOs were chillin over a mountain till later then me and my mom was trying to take the pictures of them in the sky then 1 of the UFOs flew over a mountain it was amazing to even be able to watch it just move at all to even see the damn thing then lights were flashing near the ground I knew if i didn't say anything just give it 10 seconds max and my mom said do yo see that light on the ground she say what the hell is that I was still focused on the other UFO in the sky mainly the lights because they were flashing the same colors and it wasn't the neighbors TV on in the camper.Looking at it threw the binoculars was making my heart speed and hands shake and could see the light on very clear as they flashed different colors purple red blue green i don't remember all the colors but at some point a truck went by maybe 100 to 125ft from the object from the road it lasted about 30 minutes and only got weirder as the lights in the sky were synchronized flashing of colors with those just of the craft that just hovered over the ground a quarter mile away then gone like nothing but it was back over a mountain after that mom wouldn't even go to check out the UFOs with me any other night except 1 more time to see a triangle UFO crawl across the sky and when it went over the mountain she was back in the house she missed the best part after a couple minutes passed the bright white light on the craft looked awesome as it went to fast for my guesses i just know it picked up and haled ass out of that valley and her boyfriend just wants nothing to do with any of that but now he is all about some gay brown mountain lights or something i told him this is maybe once in a lifetime thing you might never see anything this amazing ever again he didn't even respond.these events took place on April/16-17/2009 believe it or not this shit happened and still is happening all over the world is my guess it doesn't just happen near my house and my neighbors front yard! ...1 mor e thing I had a dream and all I really remember is seeing the alien face as i lay on a table or something and it was over me then i woke up and my right eye was twitching really bad I don't think it was an abduction more like fear and stress and some other issues coming out but the other dream well may have been a abduction because I've never felt like i'm awake with my eyes closed but couldn't move I felt paralyzed I knew I wanted my eyes open but I just lay there and I don't know how long but when i finally came to i knew that has never happened and i felt like I was floating and then i felt the couch i was sleeping on touching me and time could not even be measured in the stat i was in I felt violated with life and still do i haven't called any of my friends or spoke to my granny since 4/17/09 and every minute of every day most all day till i go to sleep than wake up with it on my mind it never goes away and not showing my friends was a mistake but what if they got abducted then how would i feel because when i would see UFOs I would give em the finger I used to say if i ever see A UFO I'm gonna shoot at it.THESE ARE THE MOST OUTRAGES CLAIMS YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD well i don't care because every word of it is true.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,,

I am filing this report as an afterthought, and some time after the event, in the hope that it corroborates someone else’s sighting. I am an amateur astro-photographer, meaning I take photos of celestial objects through my telescope every dark clear night of the year.  As such, I am quite familiar with the sky surrounding my area. There are aircraft in their designated lanes, the occasional military plane from a nearby Air Reserve base, and countless satellites.  In fact, I see a dozen satellites visually each night out and capture a handful of their trails on each of my photos, to my dismay.  There are also bats and owls that fly by, hunting with their squeaks and screeches.  I am used to it all. Last month, I noticed a “satellite” moving east across the sky. I thought nothing of it and diverted my attention.  I then heard the sound of a military jet in a hurry to get somewhere, which sounds completely different from the usual passenger planes that fly by.  It sounded like an F-16 tanker escort from the military base. I looked back up to spot the jet and saw the “satellite” make a nearly 90 degree left turn as the military jet rapidly approached it from the south-west.  The “satellite” proceeded north-east, closely followed by the military jet with its wingtip lights flashing away. I watched the chase until they disappeared over and the horizon, during the time span of maybe 30 seconds. This happened last month, near April 18th, sometime around 9:00pm.  I did not take notes at the time because nothing can really be done about a sighting like this. I know I was in communication with another astro-photographer via email at the time, and I remember typing “I’m watching a UFO chase…  So what are you taking pictures of tonight?”  To me, it was just another curiosity so I quickly returned my attention to the photographic task at hand. I don’t know what you can do with this late report; maybe this can be useful as corroboration for someone else’s report of anything similar to this around that date and time.

I continued driving while my eyes were glued to this object. I noticed the object was not moving at all. This was when I realized that this object was NOT a helicopter. I became startled, turned down the radio, and forcefully tapped my friend on the shoulder to get his attention. His first words were ""What the hell is that?""  Unlike me, he instantly came to the conclusion that this object was not a helicopter. I was still driving when I noticed the break in the trees was beginning to close. I pulled over on to country club road and parked my car. Because we were playing an ""assassin"" game, I had binoculars in my car. We then ran out onto the golf course. The object was still hovering in place approximately 1-1 1/2 miles away. I put the binoculars up to my eyes and gazed at this disc-shaped object. It was a UFO. The typical UFO every person imagines in their head. As I was staring at it, it moved slowly to the right behind another set of trees upon a hill. My friend and I ran back to the car and drove into the cemetery where the patch of trees were. When we got to the top of the hill, into a total clearing above the city and everything in the area, it was gone. Completely gone, out of site.

I began to slow down and as I approached, the light began to move away from me at a speed about double of my speed.  I was moving about 65 mph.  It was moving so fast I was trying to figure out how it could be a car.  The light still flashing at the same rate turned +/- 90 degrees and moved west into a very large irrigated field.

It traveled out what appeared to be about a 1/8 - 1/4 mile and turned south now going the opposite direction I was moving.  I followed it visually the best I could.  After it passed my sideways field of view I began to watch it in my mirror.  It went past me a little further (hard to tell how far in the dark and I was still moving fairly fast).  It looked like it turned 90 degrees again and came back to the road.  The light looked as thought it came up behind me and I lost sight of it.

The event date is a approximation only.  I guess I must have been between 10 and 15 years young back then. I am now 32 years of age. Ok, this story has been nagging me for many years, as I have never been completely sure if I have only been dreaming or if it has been real, that is why I have not really told anyone. One night I woke up in the middle of the night, and I got up to go into the kitchen to get myself some fresh water to drink from the sink in the kitchen on the second floor of our house.  I hopped on the kitchen table that was beside the big kitchen window in order to get a better view out of the window.  I had a habit of watching the stars out of that particular window quite frequently when beeing dark outside. So I gazed at the stars when I started to see some lights rising on the horizon of our small mountainous terrain here.  The lights quickly grew to light-spheres while coming down from the top of the little mountain that was straight ahead of the window.  They were moving in a straight decending line directly towards our house, keeping rather near to the ground at all times and very very fast.  So fast that for a moment I even feared they would crush into our house.  In a splitsecond they stopped dead ahead of the kitchen window at only a few, maybe 3 to 5 meters away.  The whole travel could not have lasted more then 3-4 seconds in total.  I just checked from Google Earth that the top of the mountain is approx. 500m bird-line from our house, high-differential of maybe 100 meters. Now I could see the orbs / spheres very clearly.  There were maybe 5-7 of them, each one kind of translucient, still radiating a quite strong light.  Each one in a different color: blue, orange, red, purple, yellow, almost like a rainbow.  The colored light seemed the come from the spheres outer shell only, beeing unevenly distributed.  Kind of like the soap-bubbles having this kind of oily, uneven texture.  The texture now only beeing unevenly distrubuted patters of light.  The spheres must have been about 1/2 to 1 meter in diameter. For a few seconds the spheres where hovering still before my window.  Then they started to move again, spinning around our house, light sipping in from the different windows in the different rooms.  That got me freaking out and I started to panic, as I realized that I was alone at home that night, my parents beeing on some of their parties.  I think i started screaming, running around eratically around the house (of that I am sure). I was really really scared and I don't remeber having any clear thought in that moments. Weird thing is, I do not know how it ended.  That is why I was always struggling with myself, pondering wether it was only a dream or something real.  And I still am. I was wondering if there is anyone out there, having experienced something similar. Although having a strong interest in the matter of UFO, I try to remain sceptic. To this very day I have not seen anyting that has convinced me of UFO's or e.g. dimensional things beeing real. For the above stated reason I will give permission to release my contact info. At this stage I will only hand out a synonym (+email), not my real name of course.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,,

As i began to get closer to this object i realized that it was no air craft.  This object was a large black colored trangle with three huge barrels under the bottom that emitted light from each of them.  The light glowed brightly and then it faded out to a dull glow under each barrel, and it did this several times as we were still approaching the object.By this time we were almost directly under the object in my work van.  I pulled over to the side of the road so we could continue to observe this object.  My work partner was at this point, very afraid of what he was seeing and i admitt i was not feeling comfortable with this sighting because it was so close to us and we were the only ones on the highway during this sighting. This object was totally silent as it hovered above us. This object was just above tree top level which was about sixty feet up.As we were sitting there on the side of the road looking up at the object it began to slowly move to the right side a little further closer to the trees and then we noticed that the object was gone, but we did not see it vanish or move one direction or the other at that point.  Strangely enough, we both had a feeling of missing time or something i just have no way of explaining, but thats how it was.

I had told him about the disc i saw back in 1996 over the s! ears bui lding, but he never believed me until this experience happened to him.

The light was a bluish spotlight that appeared funnel shaped and it was shining down just above the tree tops as it came toward us.  The leaves were all off the trees and we were just about to get into our car.  It dawned on me that there was no noise at all like a month earlier when Coast Guard heliocopters were searching for a lost kayaker on the lake beside us.  Suddenly, the large light went straight up to a pinpoint in a matter of seconds and zig zagged across the sky.   I called the local air control tower and he said no flights were in the area and he gave me the closest AFB in Oscoda and I spoke with their air controller who also said no military planes were in that area at the time.  He gave me an 800 number to call and report a UFO which I did, however, no one ever contacted me about it.  A few months later on the front page of the Record Eagle newspaper was an article about another sighting in Kingsley,MI. about 12 miles from our home.  This time a State Police trooper saw one as big as a huge football field over a lady's barn.  He took some pictures of it (which were never released to the paper) and he and the lady watched it for about an hour.  It was never explained what it was that he saw.

I got excited, downed my lunch quickly, and went outside to the playground.

In the afternoon, the teacher gave us a short recess, and there were still white spheres in the sky, though there were fewer of them, I'd say <10, all seemed stationary.   After we were released from school, I could only see two of them.   When my parents came home a few hours later, I wanted to show them what I had seen in the sky, but when I went outside to look for them, there were none to be seen.

I was never completely sure about what it was that I actually saw, but I know what I saw was real.  I did not want to sound like a nut case, or someone that was trying to get attention through sensational happenings.  However, after years of watching programs about UFO sightings and reading testimonials of others that have described over and over almost exactly, in most cases what I witnessed, I have finally decided for sure that I saw a UFO that did not seem to be anything that could be designed and operated by people from Earth. My wife and I were driving home after checking on our employees that worked late shifts.  We were heading North on I-405 through Kirkland WA.  My wife was sleeping.  It was about 4:30 am when I saw a bright fluorescent sphere moving very slow from east to west.  It had just cleared over the top of a hill to my right and lowered to a few hundred ft. above the road.  Then it stopped directly above the road and hovered there for a few seconds.   I yelled at my wife to wake up and to take a look at what was right in front of us.  The sphere started to slowly move west across the road.  It kept an altitude relative to the slope of the hillside covered with houses, as this area is heavily populated.  It moved slowly out over Lake Washington.  When it was a few hundred feet out over the lake, it again stopped and hovered for a few seconds.   At arms distance the size of the object was relative to the size of a basketball.  The color was about the same as the blue of propane or natural gas when burning.  It made absolutely no sound.   At this time my wife was witnessing the event as well as I was.  Then suddenly the sphere slightly expanded and then rapidly shrank into a pin sized dot that lasted for a second or two, as it vanished with incredible speed to the North, almost as if it just disappeared.   We were both speechless for a few seconds and then we verified with each other that we both saw what we saw and could not put any logical explanation forth to name this as a natural earthly happening. I no longer feel like I need to suppress my feeling about what we saw that early morning.  I know I have seen something like all of the others that have reported seeing something similar.  Unless there is a great secret, being well hidden from the masses, what we have witnessed is not from this planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I believe it is the time to make this report. When it comes to animal mutilations, usually cows and occasionally horses, seemingly it ""just happens"" with no witnesses.  Some say black helicopters are in the area, but I think they were chasing what actually did the job.  A helicopter does not fit my understanding of the event.  Although I was not a direct witness, I was too close. Here is my story.  On Thursday night, August 29, 1991, my late wife and I were camping on Kennally Creek, six miles east of Donnelly, Idaho.  That night at 3AM there was a wild ruckus of coyotes barking.  It woke us up and our attention was on those coyotes wondering why this was happening.  It seemed like all the coyotes in the whole valley were concentrated just to the south of where we were camping. Imagine a hundred coyotes in one place barking and baying.  Then total silence.  By total silence I mean that nothing could be heard.  We were next to a stream and could not hear the stream gurgling. Many know the wonderful sounds that a stream can make to lure you into dreamland when camping.  However, this night, at this moment not even the stream could be heard. Suddenly, there was a screaming-screeching sound of great volume that lasted more than a minute. There was silence again, that same total silence defeating even the natural sounds of the forest and the stream. This time the silence lasted for about five minutes. Suddenly, that same loud noise, the intense lasting screaming sound could be heard once again, and after it was over, the coyotes were barking once again. We were listening to the coyotes in some degree of fear trying to figure out what was happening and then, oddly, we both fell fast asleep. We woke up together at 9AM, discussed the strangeness of the night and decided to pack up and go back home. About a week later we invited my parents to join us on a camping trip and returned to the same place. This location by Kennally Creek had been a family favorite since about 1956. In those forty years very little had changed at the campsite. Not even the tiny pond where my sister and I played with frogs and garter snakes has changed, and where my grandchildren did the same. That night of the first day camping with my parents a local rancher showed up on horseback and told us the story of how, just over a ridge a week before, just 160 yards from our tent, was a horse mutilation. He detailed the usual findings of precision cuts, no tracks, and no blood. It happened on the same night we heard the coyotes and screaming sounds. Some may say we just heard a mountain lion scream; however, a mountain lion does live there, just a few hundred feet to the north and we have heard it scream, and there was no comparison; however, if you need the mountain lion connection, you would have to have several of them in one place and screaming in more than twice the volume as they can do. A little more about the location can be given. Using Google Earth ™ you travel nearly due east of Donnelly, Idaho six miles. The coordinates for the mutilation are: 44º 42' 41.53""N, 115º 57' 39.82W and the coordinates for the campsite are 44º 42’ 41.53” N, 115º 57’ 33.39” W.

The area is closed now.  In 2005 a new rancher up from California fenced off the access road that had been open for over half a century.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,44.6758,-116.0046

I'm 26 year's old with two little girls.... I don't really know who to tell my story to. I've had these strange sorts of events happening to me throughout my life.  They were coupled with different feelings... confusion, fear, disbelief. None of it really made sense until I saw in detail what I'm about to tell you.  I knew that everything I had questioned before was no longer questionable.  It was undisputed in my mind.  It has been going on my entire life and now there is finally an event that proves (to me) that this is real. I'll start by telling you that my cousin ((name deleted)) was with me when this happened...  He has been in the navy now for about 8 years.  He is a trustworthy person and his word means a lot to everyone that knows him.  Not only is it me telling the story, but he can verify that what I'm telling you is true. My cousin and myself were sitting on the back porch of my house (which was also my bedroom).  It was my bedroom at the time because it was a room enclosed with glass walls.  Some of the sections of the glass had been removed and either had screens remaining or nothing left in them at all.  Since it was summer, this wasn't really a problem.  I actually loved being in a room that allowed me to look outside at nature and even the stars. We had a couch-bed in the room that was unfolded at the time.  It was unfolded for most of the summer so that my cousin could sleep over and ""hang out"" with me.  The backside of the couch-bed was placed against the glass, so the unfolded bed occupied the space in the room facing the house. We were laying in bed trying to sleep but we spent most of our time talking instead.  Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a red glowing orb that came into view from behind the house and was slowly moving across the sky.  *See Attached Photo*  I got ((name deleted)) attention and we both watched the orb move across the treeline that was north of the trailer park.  It seemed to not be as far away as a plane should be.  It look to be about the size of a basketball approximately 50 yards away.  I then realized that it was getting closer and that it clearly was not a plane. As it moved across the sky, we watched as this incredible UFO was slowly moving toward a treeline where we assumed it would disappear out of our lives forever. But instead of disappearing into the sky... I could still see it through the trees moving towards the ground. I could clearly see it flickering through the trees and I would estimate it to be approximately 10 feet off of the ground as it entered the field on the left.  It had clearly made a 90 degree turn. At this point in time I realized that it was probably in the field that was on the other side of the treeline.  (Treeline: small patch of woods separating the trailer park and a field.)  It traveled the length of the field before I could not see it through the trees anymore.  I would estimate the length of the field to be about 200 yards. My cousin and myself sat in awe even after we could not see the UFO anymore.  He turned to me and said ""let's go check it out!""  I sternly answered with, ""hell no! are you f**king crazy??""  I was not sure what I had just seen but I had a gut feeling that I did not want to find out. So, we waited...waited... two young boys waiting to see something else as amazing as what they had just witnessed. Then it happened... A flash, as if someone had taken a picture from a camera, appeared at my friend ((name deleted)) trailer.  It was on the other side of her trailer, preventing me from seeing the source of the flash. Approximately two minutes later, another flash... this time, from the side of her trailer. I still couldn't clearly see the source of the flash. At this point, my cousin and I were starting to think something strange was happening. A few moments later, another flash. This time, I could clearly see the source of the flash... nothing.  It appeared as if the flash was angled towards ((name deleted)) house, although there was no source of the flash.  There was absolutely nothing visible to the naked eye that created this OBVIOUS flash.  Bud and myself both KNEW that flashes that are that distinct do NOT come from NOTHING. We waited about five more minutes still staring out into the trailer court through my glass room.  We were now more worried about what was in the court than what we had seen earlier.  Without speaking to each other for what seemed like five or ten minutes, another flash happened. This time it was at my friend ((name deleted)) house - directly in front of my house.  The flash was on the other side of the trailer and appeared to be aimed at his mothers bedroom.  Again we waited... wondering what the flashes were. Another couple minutes had gone by.  Another flash. This time, it was clearly pointed at Tommy's window and there was NOTHING at the source of the flash.  In my mind I could pinpoint, to the INCH, where the flash had started, yet there was nothing there. ((name deleted)) looked to me and said,  ""what the hell are those flashes?""  I had no reply.  I wanted to remain silent and hidden from whatever had been making the flashes. Again we waited. About another five minutes passed when there was a flash on the other side of Mr. Wilson's house.  (That wasn't his real name, but we knew him as Mr. Wilson in the trailer park.)  So, we waited what seemed like forever.  In reality, it was probably 15 to 20 minutes with no sign of flashes or anything similar to them. Quite suddenly, Bud looked at me and said ""well, I'm getting tired. wake me if anything happens.""  He then put his head right down on his hands where he was sitting (propped up on his knees on the backside of the couch bed). I said, ""okay"" but wondered how anybody in their right mind could just fall asleep that fast after witnessing what we had witnessed. In my mind,  I would not go to sleep until the sun was up and people were awake. I started to get the strange feeling that the happening wasn't over.  Then... I started piecing things together that were quite simple and obvious. 1. ((name deleted)) lives with her mother and father.  There were 3 flashes at her trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms… )  2. ((name deleted)) lives with his mother. There were 2 flashes at his trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms, also...)  3. Mr. ((name deleted)) lives alone. There was one flash. I figured that if they had gone through flashing every individual, as they went around from left to right in the court, since Wilson was last they had to turn around and come up the other line of trailers...starting with mine. I almost panicked as I came to the realization of what I believed was true. I turned my head in the direction of where I believed the thing causing the flash to be.  As I turned my head I could clearly see out my window (one that did not have glass or screen in it - open - nothing obstructing my view) an alien.  I had turned quick enough to spot him before I saw a flash come from, what seemed like, his forehead.......... When the flash hit me, he disappeared and I realized I was completely paralyzed.  As I tried to move my limbs, I looked around to realize that I was no longer on the same part of my bed that I had been during the flash.  I was, in fact, at the foot of my bed on my knees staring at the open window as if nothing had happened. Instantly, the numbness was gone. I grabbed the back of Bud's leg (because he was in the same position that he had been in when he laid his head down...)  It appeared that he had not moved at all.  But somehow I was at least 4 feet away from where I was when I had seen the flash...?  When I grabbed his leg I screamed extremely loud ""BUD! wake up!""  His head came off of his hands with his eyes wide as if he knew something wasn't right. We didn't have to say anything to each other as we both jumped up and ran into the kitchen.  We each armed ourselves with butcher knives, not knowing how much time had gone by or if the threat was still around. He asked me what had happened.  The only way I could really describe it to him was ""I was flashed..""  Bud KNEW what I meant by that, which told me that I wasn't just seeing things and that I wasn't alone. After about two minutes of silence.. waiting for something else to happen.. we finally laughed at the fact that we were standing armed in the kitchen with knives... waiting for aliens to come. It seemed ridiculous to us.  Although it had clearly just happened, we couldn't really wrap our minds around it.  So, we laughed it off and this time we went to bed INSIDE of the house, instead of the room surrounded with glass windows. (This event has made me realize that more than one time in my life - for a split second - I have seen aliens and ""the flash"". I have seen them in my bedroom window... I have seen them outside of my tent while sleeping in the woods* the same woods that are between the trailer park and the field I described*... I have had many occasions where, just for a second, I believed that I had been part of an alien abduction. Seeing what I have seen and the fact that I have witnessed a UFO, I have seen that UFO land in my field, I have seen something flash friends and neighbors, and I have been flashed by something that came from the sky... this is not your ordinary alien story because to this day I cannot say that I fully remember ever communicating with an alien or being aboard their ""crafts"". But that doesn't mean that I haven't seen, felt, or experienced something extremely out of the ordinary. My cousin was there as a witness to the UFO and to all six flashes... (the seventh, of co! urse, being my own) I have no explanation as to WHAT exactly the flashes are or WHAT they do to people, but I do think that they were meant for individual people... and to somehow make a person ""unaware"" that something is going on... whether by putting them to sleep... paralyzing them... or wiping out their memory... I don't know for certain. What I do know for certain is that I have had many encounters with them and I believe that I truly know how they arrive. To put it bluntly, I've caught them in the act of flashing people. I believe that they were completely unaware that I had spotted them, until it was too late. I feel as though they knew that they had made a mistake. I had witnessed their mistake and I almost FELT the reaction of the alien as.. panic. For the instant that I saw him, I knew in my gut that he was as scared of me as I was of him. I knew that their ""routine"" was not supposed to have been witnessed by anyone. We are supposed to be dazed and unaware by the ! flash when they come.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2010-06-03T00:00:00,41.8184,-80.3765

It is my belief that what was seen was a helicopter.  My reasoning for this is based on the fact that many RI National Guard Blackhawk helicopters were in the air at that time because it was a disaster area and FIMA was involved as well as other state and federal agencies. The choppers were probably doing security flights as there was some looting going on in the disaster areas.  I am not a debunker. I have filed two sightings with you in the past few years and I believe in what MUFON is attempting to do.  I read a lot of the monthly reports with great anticipation.  I guess I'm just offering one mans educated guess at what might have been seen and mis-identified by someone not familiar with the UFO phenominon or other aircraft that may look like a UFO.

When I saw the small plane fly overhead I saw a strange light due east of the plane about 10 miles, at an estimated altitude of 8000-10000ft. Intrigued I watched the light proceed west in the direction of the small plane. I assumed it was a commercial plane on approch to SEA-TAC international. So I continued to track it until it started to flicker behind the trees. So I waited to see if it would continue on it's flight path to the west. It did not reveal itself so I ran to the street for a better view, to find this bright orange light (once the size of a pinky nail, then the size of a small orb) within seconds it had accended to breaking the atmosphere to exit east of the original sighting. At that time, the light shot out some sort of trail ahead of it's direction to exit earths atmosphere. The best way to desciribe it, is a small meteor with a tail but it wasn't coming, it was going, then gone. This whole experience took place within a matter of seconds and I had no time to get a witness or a video recording. So I hope my testimony is enough to explain this very strange happening.

It appeared to be at a very high altitude and was moving so quickly that I could only see it for perhaps 3-4 seconds before it disappeared into the dark horizon. I could not hear any sound coming from the object – it appeared to be totally silent. It flew in a straight line, heading north, and was moving far too quickly to be of human origin (in my experience). It was difficult to gauge the object’s size as altitude was impossible to ascertain. My guess is that it was very large. Colour appeared to be whitish, or perhaps it was emitting a dull white light. Shape was nothing like any UFO’s I’ve heard about. This one looked like about six standard shaped aircraft joined wing to wing (they were definitely connected - it was a single craft) and flying in a perfectly straight line at incredible speed. Never seen anything like it and cannot explain it. The impression I had was that it was simply flying past the planet on the way to somewhere else because the speed and altitude was so extreme.

My first and only report from Liverpool, Texas was begun with the statement ‘Three large round objects lined up along Hwy 35 and an identical object followed me home’.  Two weeks after I posted that as I was leaving my home on my way to work.  The sun had just come up and there were scattered clouds high in the sky.  I glanced up as I noticed something that glistened in the sky and I saw what I can only describe as a space ship.  It was silver, domed top and a fin on the back.  It rose into the sky, hesitated in between the clouds and then sped off so quickly as if to disappear from sight.  I would say that it was over Houston Texas or just south of there.  I keep wondering what it possibly could have been doing during the darkness of night.  I thought it strange how much it looked like the old Sci-fi movies space ships. The circular object that I saw in our subdivision on my previous experience still appears in the sky and has not left.  I watched until late that night as it moved slowly up into the sky.  It always seems to be in the sky and appears before dusk long before any stars are visible.  As I drive home from work it gets closer, appearing larger.  Stars don’t do that. One night it came down very close over our home and appeared almost as large as that first night that I saw it.  It seemed very threatening. We went 7 hours north of our home to Brownwood Texas and just before dusk I looked into the sky and there it was.  I nudged my husband and pointed at it and he nodded.  We left Brownwood Texas the next morning at 5 am.  As we were driving south there were several strange light formations in the night sky along with the circular object. A co-worker even asked me if I had seen the strange light that appears before dusk.  She said that she began seeing it just before Thanksgiving and it could not be a star since it appears so early and sometimes seems to get brighter as dusk falls. I’d prefer not to be aware of these things as I am becoming very concerned and would like to know what is going on.   Are they just observing us or is there something else?

It was travelling at the same speed as other satellites we had seen but then it stopped abrubtly and headed off on a north west direction.   It travelled in that direction for about 5 seconds and then gave a bright flash, it then travelled further in the same direction for 2-3 seconds and then gave the same flash again, we followed it for a further 3-4 seconds until it disappeared.

It got very bright and then disappeared, which it did a few times until it stayed bright.  (My radar detector went off saying K band like crazy each time that the light appeared and then would stop after it disappeared.)   I have grown up in this area and my radar does not usually go off in that area and it didnt go off the next day when I went back to the same spot so it must've been picking up something that was emitted from the light.  It would also be worthy to note that this light was very close to the ground, and from my perspective I would say it was no higher than a three story building.)   Then, from the original light, came three others that branched out into a diagonal line formation, the lowest light being at the right and the highest at the left...somewhat like this -> \  (we had no idea that there was other lights behind the first until they appeared; it was as if they were ""turned off"" until they came into action).   These lights were redish orange and hovered in place.  When they moved into the diagonal formation it was precise and quick.  The entire sighting happened over a ten minute period or so, and then the lights just disappeared.   After waiting around for about an hour for the lights to reappear we gave up looking and went home.  We all got a very good look at these lights and there is no way that they could have been any sort of aircraft.  Also, I would like to state that my friends and I had/have been noticing very similar lights in the sky that would become very bright and then disappear but this sighting is the only one in which the lights moved about into a formation.  P.S. The reason that I havent put this on here until now is because i had no idea that this website existed!!!  We were all very freaked out and the whole radar detector thing made it even more eerie!",2009-05-12T00:00:00,42.7471,-114.7325

I live very near to the described location of the reported sighting.  Based on the description furnished by the witness, I believe what was observed was a flight of three C-130 aircraft from the Little Rock Air Force Base.  These aircraft fly directly over my home every night with out fail between 8 and 10 p.m..  The usual flight path is from the northeast to the southwest.  Along this flight path, the aircraft pass approximately 3-5 nautical miles west of Arkansas Nuclear One (the nuclear plant metioned in the report).  Additionally, the aircrafts' usual approximate altitude is less than 1000 feet and display the ligting characteristics described by the witness (on one occasion they were so low that they momentarily blocked the signal to my satellite television receiver).  My personal opinion on the reported hovering of one of the aircraft is that if the aircraft is observed flying directly away from the observer it could appear to be motionless or hovering, as I have personally observed this with these aircraft on several occassions. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this comment.  We will post it, such that it is posted together with the original report.

It was silver with red lights along the bottom and shaped like an arrow, hovering about 25 feet above the ground with a light beaming down.  There was a small building beneath it, where the light was shining. We pulled over to the side of the highway to get a better look, but as soon as we did this it sped away and was gone.  There is no way a plane could have flew away that quickly. In only about 5 seconds after it started moving, it was completely out of sight.  There were no trees around or anything else that could have blocked the view.

I turned to close the door and about 150 yards away there was a huge object with colored lights just sitting above the power lines.  The lights were not extremely bright but the object was clearly visible.   I said to my wife come here fast.  The best way to describe the object is oval shaped.  Smooth on top and bottom with an area in between.   On both sides the top and bottom came together and were rounded downward. The object began a slow 360 degree turn.   We could clearly make out windows, and what looked like tubes and barrels stuck to the sides of the craft in the area between windows and the top and bottom.  I guess you could describe it as plumbing.  The window were lit soft white but I could not see in.   This thing was probably three football fields across.

In 1997 while driving to work from Venice, FL, to North Port, FL, via Rt. 41 around 5:45 a.m., I saw in my rear view mirror a light that had just entered the road behind me.  I remember thinking that it was funny that a car would pull out from this wooded area since there is no road or driveway.  It was very dark out but from driving this road every day.  I was aware that there were no roads on that side of the road. Suddenly, the orb which I had assumed was a vehicle light disappeared from behind me, but then noted in my passenger side mirror that this ""orb"" ( the color was slightly more yellowish than a clear headlight) was following directly to the right of my vehicle.  This ""orb"" followed me along the road for approximately 5 miles ""bouncing"" along the right  side of my car.  I also remember  thinking that it looked like the ""bouncing ball"" on the old  Mitch Miller show.  I then remember thinking maybe this was a UFO, but from anything I had ever seen on TV, this was not a UFO vehicle, and my radio was playing and the car was running so I  just couldn’t figure out what this was. Then in the fall of 2004 ( October or November), I was again driving in the early morning, around 5: 15 a.m.,  I was driving south on Interstate 75 and was near the ""Kings Highway"" exit on the interstate, when suddenly to my left and up approximately 300 feet (estimate), I saw this very large plane like object.  It flew directly to the left of me and it looked like a large jumbo jet but without wings.  It was silent, and I saw no lights on this object.  I felt it was a plane that was about to crash because it was so low to the ground and now just 50-100 feet above the road and to my left.   It passed me and I looked in the mirror expecting to see a large explosion/smoke or some evidence of a crash but there was nothing.  I could no longer see anything as the sky was dark.  Again I did not lose any power to my car or radio. I picked up a co-worker in Punta Gorda and continued to travel south to Estero, Fl., that morning, and saw nothing more but did mention my sighting to my co worker, and she just laughed. We returned home the following night (Sunday) around midnight, and about 10 miles south of Punta Gorda, we both witnessed another bright ""orb"" like object high in the sky.  We watched this for about a minute and it didn’t seem to move, then suddenly it was gone.  We did not see it move, it was just there one moment and gone the next.  Shortly afterwards as we were exiting the highway to return to her house, she looked at her watch and commented that it was much later than it should be  when we arrived back.  It seemed to take us approx 45 minutes longer to make the trip from Estero to Punta Gorda that night.

My wife and I were told about him by a female friend living in Chicago, who had become his acquaintance. The call lasted approximately one hour, during which time he explained his origin, how he came to this planet, his people's purpose in being here, and how he currently occupied the body of a man born on earth. During the conversation he also answered a number of my questions: about his view of our civilization, the amount of time he and those of his particular race had been on earth, the number of his people living among our population, and certain questions re: history and current events. The gentleman was astonishingly clear and logical in his expression; almost like a scientist or professor.  He also seemed almost Spock-like in his lack of emotion. Should you wish to have a more thorough report I can send in more detail the topics of our conversation.  It has been about thirteen years, but I believe I can recall a number of points he made.   Thank You  Sincerely ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have met with the source of the report, and we deem him to be a serious-minded source.    PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO SUBMITTED REPORT)) Peter, I am going to break the rules as far as filing this more detailed report of my conversation with the gentleman from Chicago.  I apologize in advance, because I know you are highly disciplined in your work...It is just that I'd like to get this to you via your personal e-mail (In truth, I'm a real amateur on the workings of the internet.) As you will read, I will include the names of both the extraterrestial being, as well as the man whose body he purported to occupy (who is now, as of about a decade ago, deceased.)  I will leave it to your discretion as to whether you wish to include  that purportedly occupied person's name. Tacco and I sat down together to put in place the clear memories of what was shared.  We know that we've lost certain things that were said - to our great regret - but what is written to you is quite accurate according to the gentleman's statements and claims. ---------------------------------- Recollections of A Call from an Extraterrestial Who Gave Us the Name ""Shimikus Etua"" In the summer of 1997 I received a call from a Philippine born woman in Chicago - a long time friend who once babysat for our children - with regard to an older man she had met.  The gentleman, she told us, identified himself initially as a ""Eugene Randall"" and lived in the Chicago suburbs.  She, being of an extraordinary open and pure nature, invited him to her family's residence to take more time to visit.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Randall visited our friend and her family quite regularly after the initial meeting. It was in the course of these visits that Mr. Randall told our friend that he, indeed, wasn't of this world, and identified himself  as, I believe it is called, a ""walk-in,"" by the name of Shimikus Etua. After a number of these visits by the gentleman, our friend called us to share the matter.  At the end of our phone call, I asked her if this person would mind calling me directly.  She said she thought it possible, and that he seemed quite open to share with those who could be open to him, and said she'd ask him.  Several nights later, we received a call from Shimikus Etua. The following is a listing of recollections, and personal impressions I had from the phone call: 1.) My first impression was that I was talking to a very serious and almost professorial individual who didn't express much emotion.  He seemed almost Spock-like.  There was no feeling of his being delusional or inconsistant.  He spoke in measured tones and answered my questions without hesitation or wasted words. 2.) Shimikus (from now on 'S'),  said that he came from a planetary system somewhere in the vicinity of what we call the North Star.  He said that he'd traveled to our planet on one of a few very large ""mother ships.""  I believe he mentioned that he'd actually been born enroute to our solar system. 3.) It was hard for me to believe, but he gave his age as ""about 3000 years old."" 4.) When I asked about his civilization's belief in a supreme being he immediately answered in the affirmative.  He then went on to explain that there was a time when his people were not good (I believe he even used the word ""evil), and that they tended to be self destructive as well as destructive to other civilizations.  However, long ago, before the journey to earth, a ""priest"" among his people began to teach a path of goodness, that, somehow had a great impact for the good.  His people went through a tremendous change, and left behind their negativity. 5.) S mentioned that his people are more than a little concerned with the elements of self destruction on our planet, and wish to help us evolve as a species as they did long ago (I took this to mean, in the sense of 'consciousness' and spirituality.)  When I asked how his people look at us, he hesitated for a moment, and then said that it is how we may look at ""primitive tribes"" in our own world. 6.) He explained that those among his race who are now on the earth have come here with the help of earth people who are aware of them, and who have voluntarily offered their bodies and personae as vehicles for these aliens.  S spoke in glowing terms of Eugene Randall, who had offered himself for S.  (note: I could see that this whole matter of earth people contributing their bodies was entirely of their own free volition, and not anything like a hostile take over, ie, the 1950's horror classic, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."")  S also mentioned a Russian man, who, years ago during the Soviet period, had done what Eugene had done; the same admiration and gratitude was expressed for his courage and sacrifice.  (I don't remember the details of the Russian man's story.) 7.) I asked how many of S's people were on the earth in the capacity mentioned above.  He estimated it to be about 8,000. Living in Seattle, I asked if he knew how many may be in the Puget Sound area.  He said he didn't know, and that they are not all in good contact with one another (I got the feeling that this race of people has been among us for a very long time, according to his conversation.)   He did mention that there was a way for me to find someone if I wished; he explained that there is a symbol that his race uses, and went on to explain it:  It is two squares, one over the other, something similar to the Jewish star of David.  Only the squares are juxtaposed: One drawn straight up and down, and the other rotated so that the corners of the second square extend out past the middle of each of the first star's mid-lines - so you end up with an eight-pointed star shape. S told me that if I put this symbol in my car window, I may be approached and asked about where I learned the symbol...""that may be one of our people"" he told me. 8.) S expressed the serious concern of his race for our use of nuclear power, and said that even the ""peaceful use"" of nuclear reactors is very harmful to the cosmos.  Nuclear war was just a horror, as he expressed it, not just for us but for the others in our cosmos.  He said we didn't begin to understand the problems nuclear energy creates.  He also mentioned a concern for mid eastern wars, and the use of chemical weapons.  Though I didn't learn just how, S said that his people have ways to counteract the weapons we build; he mentioned their spoiling of chemical weapon stockpiles in Iran. 9.) (I had some trouble getting this) The flood of Noah was mentioned:  S explained that one of their larger spacecraft had lost its bearings and crashed in the arctic regions, causing a tremendous and sudden meltdown of ice, and subsequent flooding of portions of the globe (I assumed a tremendous explosion and release of energy.)  This, he said, was a contributing factor to the flood. 10.) Situations of co-habitation with earth people: It was also mentioned to me that there was a history of sexual co-habitation between members of S's race and earth people.  In particular, he mentioned that there were cases of this in the Philippine Islands (modern name), and that quite a few hybrid children were born as a result.  Lineages continue to this day.  An interesting note is that S mentioned our former babysitter who he had first met, and who had called us about him, was of that hybrid lineage. 11.) I asked if there are any other extraterrestial civilizations near earth at this time.  He said that there are, and that, unlike his own people, they don't all have their personal problems worked out.  While his own civilization has only the desire to help us develop in a positive direction, there are others who would use us for cruel experimentation - almost like animal labs, and even  practice self gratifying sexual abuse with our people (certain horrible abduction experiences? - my reflection).  S mentioned that his people try to drive off these evil races when possible. 12.) A humorous incident:  S has a brother, he told me, named Andronicus.  He said that one day, in downtown Chicago, they were in an elevator in a high rise building, and somehow, were in their original forms...A businessman suddenly entered the elevator, looked at them in shock, and blurted out, ""Where did you come from?!"" Andronicus, who was just as shaken up, reacted with, ""Well, from my mother!"" (S did mention that if I saw him in his original form, that I may be startled, though I got the sense that it is not that far from our own earthly bodies.) 13.) S visited our friend, the Philippine woman, many times in the form of Eugene Randall.  She told me in a call sometime after my call with him, that he came to her home one afternoon to help celebrate her birthday.  After a while he expressed weariness and asked if he could take a rest.  She put him on the bed that she and her husband slept in.  Soon, a group of her church friends came by to say happy birthday, and saw this 'unknown man' on her bed.  They became outraged and spread gossip about her.  When she later told S about what had happened, he became sad and upset at the same time.  He told our friend, and I paraphrase here, ""How long have our people been here on this planet working to help you, and still you don't understand the meaning of friendship and trust!"" *Several years ago, our friend called and told us that Eugene Randall had been found dead in his apartment by a neighbor.  What of Shimikus?  I have no idea, nor does she.",2010-07-28T00:00:00,47.604556307692306,-122.16441774358974

I looked up and started to star gaze to pass the time when I noticed that the stars' pattern flickered in and out almost like someone was moving a huge rectangle of glass across the sky.  The size of the anomaly was pretty decent, about the size of a large passenger air plane.  The weird thing about this is that there was no sound distortion in the air, so I knew it wasn't a plane or big helicopter, and there was no wind so it wasn't as if there was some strange item blowing across the sky. I watched the glass-rectangle thing start to cross the horizon, it looked almost as if it paused, then moved again in stops and starts.  I decided then to go inside to grab something to assist in viewing it better like my binoculars or video camera, but when I came out the pattern was gone.

I was aware that there were no roads on that side of the road. Suddenly, the orb which I had assumed was a vehicle light disappeared from behind me, but then noted in my passenger side mirror that this ""orb"" ( the color was slightly more yellowish than a clear headlight) was following directly to the right of my vehicle.  This ""orb"" followed me along the road for approximately 5 miles ""bouncing"" along the right  side of my car.  I also remember  thinking that it looked like the ""bouncing ball"" on the old  Mitch Miller show.

The time was approximately 10:30 PM and I was traveling west on Whitlock just before Kennesaw Mountain Battlefield Park, when I noticed a large, black rectangular object hovering just above the tree line.  It had one red light on the corner and two white lights on the other corners.  I had the window down and I didn’t hear any noise.  As I reached the park, I could see that it was actually hovering at the tree line on the edge of the park.  What had initially caught my attention was that it was not moving at all.  I turned around after I passed the park to get another look, but the object was gone.  We are near Lockheed, so I thought perhaps it was an experimental craft of some sort, if they perhaps have some kind of silent craft capable of hovering in one spot.

I can see planes around that time of night and when they have their headlights on they appear as only one light instead of two.  These were unusual in that I have never seen 4 lights (planes) that close together.  One was ahead and then two, one above the other, and then the fourth appeared to be behind the other 3.  They seemed to be moving fairly rapidly toward the airport and I figured that three of them would have to circle to await their turn to land. As I watched, the lights appeared to stop moving toward the west so I thought they had probably turned enough toward my viewpoint that their forward progress wouldn’t be visible to me.  Then, suddenly they all four went out.  I watched for awhile longer to see if those four planes landed and I saw at least one other plane go into the landing route and then a second but they were coming from the south and were not anywhere near where I had seen those other four lights. I thought it strange that those four planes had not landed and I didn’t see any other lights to indicate where they had gone and since my husband was asleep, I figured I’d tell him the next day.

But with the binoculars even though only 10 time magnification I still wanted to make sure I was just not seeing what I thought I was seeing.  So I layed on the ground found the saucer again I layed there on the dirt driveway for over 3 hours.  To the point my elbows even though on the ground were getting pretty sore.I would look away then go right back and there it was.  Then the clouds getting ready to rain and being very dark.  I thought great now I will lose it.  I keeped watching and it was there under the clouds at this point all thoughts of a star or some form of goverment craft went away.  It was so windy out that if it had been anything I believe we have it would have been blowing around up there.  It never moved.  The light stayed on even in the bright daylight.  I have to say I believe it was watching me watching it.  Just a feeling I was getting.  This was no big giant craft not a triangle no flashing lights the one light just stayed fixed on.

It had a flashing green light on right bottom side, and a flashing red light on left bottom side. Just a few feet apart from each other. As i approached i slowed my speed, and the red flashing light disappeared. I started to drive underneath it as it silently hovered above. I started to swerve my vehicle as i looked up, it was not very far above me whatsoever. Another vehicle was approaching the aircraft on the opposite side of the 4-lane highway with a grassy median, and slowed down considerably as i assume they noticed as well. By this time i reached and grabbed my phone and called a friend to describe what was going on. There was a cross-over in the highway as i turned around to go back and get a better look it started gliding away over the tree tops. I saw it in the distance as I headed back west toward Riverside, both green and red lights flashing. Finally disappearing into the night.

There was a spherical light in the northwestern sky.  It had FLASHING lights of white, green, red, NOT STROBE LIGHTS as on a plane.  The object stayed in the same spot and hovered around for nearly an hour and then moved off slowly to the north.  I thought maybe it was some kind of balloon, but we have been having 30-40 mph winds here for two days, so don’t think that’s it.  As it moved north it did not disappear on the horizon, just got smaller.  Then it changed shape and took on an elongated, cigar shape, with white lights flashing all around it, and blue/green lights flashing on one end.  Directly to the west, as this was hovering, there was another light, hovering, not as close, flashing more red.  I shined a flashlight in the direction of this one, looked away, then looked back and the red light was gone. We see a lot of airline and military air traffic where we are.  I saw planes go by as I watched these objects.  The objects looked to be much lower than the airplanes. I saw this same object, the spherical flashing, in October of 2008.  A couple of weeks before Christmas 2009, I saw this object early in the morning, around 5 a.m., only in the southwestern sky.  It seemed to flash a white light on the ground like a camera flash.  It was brighter that time (maybe closer?), hovered, then moved off to the west/southwest (NOT over the horizon) and disappeared. My husband is a commercial pilot.  I have flown in commercial jets and Cessnas, seen them take off and land, been around them for 20 years.  This object does not behave like an airplane or have lights like one.

They are outside our atmosphere and appear as something similar in size to stars (as we view stars from Earth) but they move in every given direction. I’ve observed them stop and then start moving again, make 90 degree turns, suddenly increase speed until they appear almost a streak, stop just as suddenly, etc.  I’ve seen as many as 9 of them at one time (about 2 years ago), with all 9 of them going in different directions and patterns and “performing” in a manner that I would liken to an air show.  I’m so curious about them that I watch for them any time I go outside at night, just in case they might be there. On December 30, 2009, at about 6:30pm I was outside smoking when I saw two of them toward the south-southwest and moving in a northerly direction.  About the time I saw them, my husband joined me on the porch and I pointed them out to him.  (I would note that my husband was in law enforcement for several years and is skeptical of nearly everything.)  As we were watching them, one of the “dots” split off into two “dots.”  I had never seen them do that before and it certainly got my husband’s attention.  At almost the same time, a 3rd and 4th one appeared in a different area of the sky (slightly more westerly and also moving north).  We noticed them at the same time.  The 3rd one then turned hard toward the east and immediately became incredibly bright – something else I’ve never observed one of them do.  It appeared to be banking in a turn and it grew even brighter as it banked and also seemed to elongate.  It quickly gained speed as it went east; turned a soft red color and ! then faded out of sight.  My husband asked if I had seen it get longer and I told him that I definitely noticed that. Tonight (1.04.10) at about 7 p.m., I went out onto the porch and saw one of the “star dots” very far away and moving very slowly.  I was surprised as I usually don’t see them that close together, with the previous sighting being just 5 days ago.  As I watched it, I caught a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  I called out to my husband “There’s one of them flying VERY LOW this time!”  It appeared, of course, to be much larger than they usually appear because it was so low – somewhat lower than a commercial airliner would fly - but the light of it was too bright to allow us to make out its shape.  It was not flying in a perfectly straight line; it wavered slightly from time to time.  As we watched the low, bright one I remarked to my husband that it seemed to be tracking the smaller, more distant one move for move.  He agreed that that’s what it looked like it was doing.  We lost sight of it as it passed over our house. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD))",2010-02-14T00:00:00,32.4419,-95.6335

As I drove into more darkness I could see what looked like a faint beam pointing down to the lower, more southern light.  Then it appeared the top light began moving up and away from the bottom light, and at the same time it’s bright white light changed to numerous red lights (like the underneath of plane.)

I would like to point out these are not the lights I'm referring to as these have been dismissed as a hoax. That being said, the red lights caused me to notice the sky more than I had been and my husband and I noticed at least a couple dozen stars that flicker, rather than twinkle as a star does. These lights can be either a silvery color, or golden, but they all alternately flash red also. The first couple nights, we just gazed in amazement and didn't notice too many details. But I do know they seemed to move very slowly if you watched them long enough. I don't mean that my perspective on them changed as Earth rotated; I mean that they steered every so slowly to a different position and then stopped. They also seemed to be clustered in one small area around Orion's belt mostly, until Orion's belt moved out of sight. BUT even after Orion moved out of sight these strange fake stars would still be in the same area. They never left the area even after Orion (there are rarely any other stars visible in San Diego at night lately) was way out of sight due to the Earth's rotation. Nights of 1/3-1/5, I stayed out as often and late as I could given that I have three kids to take care of. I peeked out a couple times per hour, staying up late and watching them til 3 or 4 in the morning. They seemed to light in 1 position and stay there constantly for the most part on these nights, with the occasional one disappearing suddenly or shifting slightly. Colors remain same. I have noticed that there is one set that I call the Non-Rectangle, because if it weren't for one ""star"" being up and out a little bit too much, they would form a perfect rectangle. However, they are in a different configuration every night, i.e. the ""slightly off star"" would be on the bottom and left one night, and on top and right the next. Makes me think it's a craft that lands in a different spot every night and thinks we won't notice. 1/6 and 1/7, 2010 I have not been able to go outside to watch their behavior, I have just had too many things to do. I got video, in fact about 10 of them with my webcam since I don't have a regular camera, but strangely, I can't get them to upload to any of the sites I tried to upload them to. I managed to get 1 pic on my cell phone to show up and I will try to attach it. The oddest thing of all to me, is that no one else is talking about them, everyone is concentrated on the sham red lights of New Year's Eve that one guy hoaxed. However, my kids and mom see them, and so does my apartment complex manager, so they are truly there. One other strange detail is that on 1/3-1/5, there have been a highly unusual number of small, low-flying normal planes as well as helicopters, making me wonder if they're ""investigating.""  I have not been able to stay awake and outside to witness them make their ""disappearance"" at dawn so I don't know what that consists of. They are currently still there, although small in number at this precise moment. I can't figure out for the life of me why people aren't interested in them.

My window faces east, and I'm about 7 miles to the SW of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center.  What was so intriguing about the sky this morning was that there was a bright light, that appeared to be spiraling towards the ground.  If it was to be moving through the sky, it would have been moving an eastern direction, however because of the angle, it looked like the light was making movement towards the ground. At first glance, I thought it was a plane crash or a shooting start, but then before the light hit the horizon, the light froze in place.  The light didn't emit any type of trail.  The light was a very bright and was blinking the whole time.  What made me think that the light was spiraling was how fast the light moved from right to left. The light ""fell"" for about 20-30 seconds before it reached it's ""hover"". The light then hovered in place for close to 10 seconds.  Following the hover, the light moved quickly to my right, in a southern direction towards Joshua Tree National Park.  The light started to get smaller as it moved south towards the park.  Then, all of a sudden, it disappeared. There were no clouds in the sky.  A few aircraft could be seen flying in the vapor belt, leaving normal contrails. About half an hour later, I was standing out in my back yard looking at the sky, trying to figure out what I had seen.

Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it got incredibly bright, almost like looking at the sun, and took off in an eastern direction VERY quickly.

After reading some of these reports, I decided to discuss my own sighting.  Unfortunately I can’t remember the date, but I believe it was in 2001. I was driving on Maple Valley Highway near Jones Rd going west, at about 10:30 or 11:0p.m.  The sky was clear, and stars were visible. I saw something in my peripheral  in the upper right hand corner of the windshield.  It was some sort of light that moved strangely in the sky.  I glanced up and the moment that I did, I saw a bright egg shaped light that flashed and grew smaller within a fraction of a second.  It was like when you turn off an old TV and the light goes to the center of the screen, or a Sci-Fi movie where a spaceship zooms away at light speed. I distinctly got the impression that it had moved away at an incredible speed.  This would have been over Renton or 405 depending on the distance.  It happened so fast that I wouldn’t be able to judge its exact location or distance, but I believe it was at least a hundred feet up. The light was such a bright white that it left an imprint in my vision like when you stare at a light source for too long and you see a pink or green blob when you turn away.  I would have dismissed this whole event, had it not been for the fact that I could still see that imprint. I had a strong impulse to pull over and look in the sky in the direction it had gone, but there wasn’t a convenient place, as that stretch of road has no shoulder.

We always liked to sit there and watch for satellites as they passed by and see how many we could find - making it a contest to see who could spot one first. As we peered upward - something caught our eyes, much lower, closer to the horizon.  We were sitting on the deck facing south when an object drifted across our field of view. It traveled from east to west, slowly, not changing speed, or direction of travel, remaining in a straight line. This was easy to determine as it moved in a direct line above the utility wires in the alley, in front of us. It was approximately  twenty degrees directly above the horizon. I could not say how far away or how large the object was. There was absolutely no sound coming from it. Normally, when one of us located a satellite - we would call out that one had been discovered one and point directly above us to show the others where it was.  Most of the satellites were moving in a south to north or north to south trajectory.  However, when we saw this object, nobody said a word.  All of us saw it at once, not like the satellites, when the others would sometimes have problems finding it. All three of us picked it up at the same time, which was strange because normally we were straining our necks to look straight up,  not directly in front of us. As the object crossed us from left to right, each of us turned our heads in unison as it passed.  Shocked, somebody said, ""Did you see that?"",  ""Yeah, what was it?"",  ""I have no idea.""  Now, the hard part.  I have seen plenty of photos and video of strange objects in the sky before.  This was completely different from anything I had seen documented before. It did not have what could be considered an straight edge outline.  I know this sounds weird but,  the only thing I think of that would describe it - is either a giant Amoeba or Jellyfish.  It appeared gelatinous in form.  The object appeared transparent in color because it seemed like you could ""see through it"". If that is not strange enough,  the object had what I can only describe as five very dim lights emitting inside of it.  These were not random lights.  Three of them were vertical, in a perfectly straight line, close together.   The other two were horizontal behind the vertical lights.  The best way I can describe it is - imagine a capital letter ""T"" laying on it's side, with the top or the ""cross"" of the ""T"" in the lead.    The lights did not move -  nor did they twinkle or change color. I have never observed anything like that before, neither have my friend and his son. Of us three, I am the only believer of ""other craft"" but, that night we all agree that we all saw something. Never knew who I could tell this to till I became a fan of George Noory and listened to Mr. Davenport on his show several times over the years since.

On Saturday August 5, 2006, around 10 p.m., a coworker and myself observed three circular lights in the Northern sky in Gregg county Texas.  Earlier in the evening on this date, a large dark rain “cloud” had moved in from the west, moving northeast and was positioned in the Northern sky.  Within this rain “cloud”, which looked to be several thousand feet in the sky, and maybe several thousand feet in area, my coworker and I saw what appeared to be three white lights which appeared to be just skimming the underside of the cloud formation turning in a clockwise direction.  What I mean by skimming is how I think a light source would be observed just inside the bottom of a cloud formation without exposing itself clearly to anyone from the ground.  This view was like seeing a light source in a fog or haze if you can imagen a view like this.  They were dim in places and brighter in other places as they were traveling closer and further away from our angle of view. The three lights were in a triangular pattern circling and synchronized with each other, meeting in the middle of the triangle formation moving in a clockwise direction.  Imagen three circles in a triangular pattern with rings touching each other and you can get an idea of these lights.  My coworker and myself watched these three lights for about twenty minutes before we decided to get back to work to finish up the night shift, which ended at eleven thirty. During this time while we were both looking at this event we were also scanning the horizon trying to find any kind of light source such as spot lights or other lights coming from the ground in this area which could have been projecting these lights from the ground. We were unable to observe any ground effect lights which could have been causing these lights.  Of course this cloud could have been smaller or larger than described.

Earlier in the evening on this date, a large dark rain “cloud” had moved in from the west, moving northeast and was positioned in the Northern sky.  Within this rain “cloud”, which looked to be several thousand feet in the sky, and maybe several thousand feet in area, my coworker and I saw what appeared to be three white lights which appeared to be just skimming the underside of the cloud formation turning in a clockwise direction.  What I mean by skimming is how I think a light source would be observed just inside the bottom of a cloud formation without exposing itself to anyone from the ground.  They were more like seeing a light source in a fog or haze if you can imagen a view like this.  They were white and dim in places and brighter in other places as they were traveling closer and further away from our angle of view. The three lights were in a triangular pattern circling and synchronized with each other, meeting in the middle of the triangle formation moving in a clockwise direction.  Imagen three circles in a triangular pattern with rings touching each other and you can get an idea of these lights.  My coworker and myself watched these three lights for about twenty minutes before we decided to get back to work to finish up the night shift, which ended at eleven thirty. During this time while we were both looking at this event we were also scanning the horizon trying to find any kind of light source such as spot lights or other lights coming from the ground in this area which could have been projecting these lights from the ground. We were unable to observe any ground effect lights which could have been causing these lights.  Of course this cloud could have been smaller or larger than described.  There was nothing really to reference this cloud’s actual size that we could see in this area to give us a true indication of its size, but from past experience observing storm clouds and rain clouds like this it appeared to be very large in area as well as height.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,32.52817399103139,-94.73228206278026

I took a few pictures, and one shot I took facing N/NE I saw a lightning fast streak, and at the time I didn't think anything of it.

While I was driving this afternoon around noon, my husband and I were driving down 441 (thats the name of the road) we were heading to Gainesville to run errands and in the corner of my eye I saw this shiny object in the sky.  I asked my husband what that was and he was like I'm not sure, it may be an airplane, I said no Edward if a plane was down that low it would be bigger than that and it wouldn't be that shiny.  It wasn't a bird nor a place.  This object was like a frisby and it was shiny, may have been silver or white in color, it was at a stand still for about a min or so.  I had to pull over to see if I could get a better look at it, and by the time I pulled over it was gone.  There was no resiadue, smoke or any sort of trial behind it.  I believe what my husband and I saw was indeed a UFO of some sort. I am not one of those people that just go looking for these sort of things, but I know what I saw and it was nothing normal about it.  It was the strangest thing I've ever saw in my life!

I was a passenger on the left side of the cabin, with a view to the north out my window.  Lights in the cabin were dimmed aside from a few reading lights and television screens for the inflight entertainment. It was probably sometime between 11:20 and 11:50 pm.  The weather was mostly clear, with the stars and moon easily visible and a very small amount of light left from sunset at the northwestern horizon.   Our flight was beginning to make its initial descent to the Albany airport, but still very high- as the cruising altitude of the flight was announced to be 39,000 feet.   As a former resident of Upstate NY, I could determine when we flew over Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.   When we began approaching what I believe to be Utica, and possibly Rome to the North, I noticed a bright point of warm white light which at a quick glance would apprear to be a bright star or planet (no blinking ! to indicate it was a commercial aircraft,) to the north.  It was moving significantly faster than our aircraft to the ENE direction.   As it was to my eyes, simply a small, steady light, there was no way to determine how large or far away it was from our jet.  It is entirely possible that it was a high-altitude aircraft, or satellite, but it seemed to be moving much more quickly than satellites I've observed from a stationary position on the ground. I was only able to observe it for a minute or so, as it flew somewhat parrallel and higher than aircraft, then quickly away.  There was no change of speed during the sighting.  The light appeared to be flying in a straight line, although I may have seen it swerve slightly a couple of times- possibly due to air movement between myself and the object, or the movement of our aircraft.  No other passengers that I was near seemed to notice anything, and as I was traveling alone, I did not alert anyone around me to what I saw. I consider myself a skeptic, and I am making this report simply because it was something that I could not easily identify.  It did not look the same as other commercial or military aircraft I've seen from an airplane, and it was thousands of feet higher than necessary for a plane to use landing lights.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,43.11854496124031,-75.1740988372093

Upon pulling into my driveway on the evening of March 12th, 2010, at approximately 7:10pm, I exited my truck and looked up into the sky as usual. I am an amateur stargazer so my eyes are always to the sky. As I looked to the North I noticed a bright light moving across the sky, I would say about 40 degrees or so off the horizon. It was moving from West to East, inside the atmosphere. No flashes, no strobing, just a single white light, much brighter than any stars in the sky. After watching for about 30 seconds, I had determined that is clearly not a plane or a satellite. I couldn't believe my eyes, I ran to the front door and got my mother. She couldn't believe her eyes. We continued to watch for about another minute as it seemed to travel in short spurts (like an inch across the sky to the naked eye, if that makes sense). It continued on and seemed as if it just suddenly got bright and seemed to be stationary for a brief second and then slowly faded away. While watching all this 2 planes passed into our sites, so we could easily compare them to an airplane. My mother also is a stargazer and we used to look for satellites in the sky together when I was a child. I am now 32 and she is 55. I am also a full-time college student (as well, as I just completed a quarter in Astronomy), part-time risk engineer assistant and a single mother of 2 toddlers. my mother is a registered nurse.

I was parked on the street by myself waiting for my sister to come out of my mother’s house because I was picking her up. The street lights were on, and nobody was out on the street. While I was sitting there waiting for my sister to come outside, I experienced something that was very unusual and strange.  I saw everything turn pitch black and the sky turn into a bright light. I know it doesn’t sound like something out of the ordinary but trust me it was. I keep replaying it in my head and it just doesn’t make any sense to me. The best way that I can describe it is like a sudden and instant flash.  The thing that made me wonder if it could be linked to something abnormal is because when the incident was occurring I saw the sky and it was like nothing like I have ever seen before.  The whole entire sky turned as if it were daylight for a split second, while everything else was blackened.   After the incident happened, I kept replaying it over my head and tried to make logical sense out of it, but nothing seemed to add up.  Then I started to look around me to see if anyone else saw what I had just seen, but there was not a soul.  Since I was on my own, it did cross my mind that perhaps it was my imagination but then my sister came out about a minute later and casually asked me if I had seen a flash or if it was just her.  Without me even mentioning anything to her.  When she asked me that, I knew that it wasn’t my imagination anymore, it was far more than that and that this actually did happen.  I am just confused on what I did see because it was honestly something very strange and unusual.  I am not trying to conclude that this can be something related to aliens but I am curious to know if you guys can give me any sort of information regarding this.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,34.17664012738854,-118.38102866242039

My wife and I were driving back to our condo just after eating out.  We were eastbound on Hwy 98 in Destin, Fl. Having just left the restaurant which is at 21000 Emerald coast highway.  After driving about a half mile east, I happened to notice a series of lights to the north of the highway, hanging in the sky.  They were quite bright and stationary, so I thought they were probably some outdoor stadium lights.  They literally lit up the bottoms of some low clouds that were passing above them.  That’s when I realized they weren’t stadium lights, since they wouldn’t have projected upwards.  My wife also saw them and thought they were lights on top of a hill, then realized that there are no hills around here and wondered what they were.  When I saw them, there were three lights, when she saw them, there were two , but then.another showed up to form a triangular light pattern, then two more showed up below and to the west of the first group.  We continued to drive east and talked about them.  At first I thought they were helicopters with their front lights on,  but as we drove along, they got neither closer nor farther away and also seemed suspended in one spot relative to one another.  Also, there was no familiar sound such as 5 helicopters would have made.  Here in Destin, helicopters are flying around all the time and there is no such thing as a silent flight of them.  We continued to drive east, discussing what they might or might not be……all the time they were just hanging in the sky.  Finally we came to an intersection about two miles away at Matthew Road where I could pull off, which I did and turned into the parking lot of a service station.  I grabbed our FLIP camera, rolled down the window and started filming them.  Shortly after that, the lights began dimming, one by one, till they were gone from the sky as shown on the video.  Some observations that are not apparent from the video:  The lights were VERY bright, lighting up the bottom of the clouds more than is apparent in the video  They were absolutely stationary relative to our position, even though we drove over two miles on the ground as we observed them.  The lights were also sharper and better defined than on the video.     That’s about it.  We leave the rest of it up to you.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,30.3979835443038,-86.4573

The larger ship was described as a ""battle ship"" and was much larger than the other ships by all accounts. The objects were described as ""50 oak trees"" high by my son -- so from his account I'm estimating these were close to 500-1000 feet from the ground.

On October 15th, 2008 just after sunset at approximately, 6:30p.m. (18:30) I was having a conversation with my family and friends in our living room. From my vantage point, (on sofa looking through the rear door out onto our deck facing south, southeast) I witnessed an extremely large oval shaped object punch through a low deck of thick clouds. This object traveled somewhat slowly for about five seconds at a 45-degree angle towards the earth. At first I didn’t know what I was seeing and jumped from the sofa expecting that an enormous military craft was going to crash many miles away. I say this because I’ve never seen anything this giant in the sky before. To me, it appeared to be as large as an aircraft carrier and moved with that kind of ‘heaviness’ or ‘substance’. It was big, oval perhaps. Once on my feet my family reacted by asking what I was looking at and I replied that I really didn’t know, but to stay there…in case there was about to be an explosion. By this time…a few seconds later, I was throwing open the back door and was on the deck. I never lost sight of it. The craft began to speed up somewhat, crossed behind a tree close to me obscuring it for maybe a second. Once it cleared the tree (the tree was in my yard,..not far away as the craft seemed to be) the craft stopped mid-flight…just stopped. If there were humans in that thing,…they would have turned to jelly. Then there was a flash of the reddest, red I’ve ever seen and it shot off to the horizon like a lightning bolt. This final movement was at another 45-degree angle to its angle of descent. It was a relatively clear evening with some low cirrus clouds…just before twilight. I have never witnessed anything I couldn’t identify in the sky in my life. I am an avid amateur astronomer and am familiar with objects that appear in the sky…day and night. I am also a professional photographer and have never witnessed or photographed the color ‘red’ that the craft emitted before it jetted off. None of my family saw the thing and that’s why I have not reported it. I know with no proof of fact,..it’s just a story. Yet, my family and friends DID see my reaction to it and they can tell you I’ve not moved that quickly in years. The reason I report this now is that my wife just read today about some sightings in Stephenville, TX. I watched the amateur video footage and saw something that resembled that color ‘red’ in the lights that were recorded. My wife requested me to report what I’d seen. Hope this helps,  Scott Palmer",2008-10-31T00:00:00,35.0854,-87.4208

However, what I saw to night was either a blimp or something out of the ordinary.  I doubt there was a blimp flying over Maine tonight, and that is why I am reporting this.  The object was eithering hovering or flying at a snail's pace- too slow for a normal aircraft.  It was so bright that it must have been very close, thus movement was easy to judge (or lack thereof).  It appears to be one object, but it had two sets of lights. The configuration of the craft adds to my belief that it was something strange that I saw, but I cannot really describe that configuration here.
