This sighting occurred on 25 December 2013 at 22:38 hours Central Time (I have changed the other witnesses name for this record)  I am a taxi driver in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  I was dispatched to pick up a regular customer at a popular large night spot near Grand and Victoria Avenues.  I pulled into the long driveway that goes from Grand to the alley between Grand and Summit Ave.  I was facing north seated in my cab.  I saw John, the regular I was sent to pick up, standing in the patio area.  He was smoking a cigarette and talking to someone.  He held up his finger indicating I should wait a moment.  No problem, John is a very generous and regular customer so I had no problem giving him a moment to conclude his activities. I looked through the windshield and saw at about 25 degrees up two horizontal bars of light. The upper one was red, the lower was green.  They were of equal length. There appeared to be 8 or so ""bulbs"" in each bar, however the both bars were uniformly illuminated their respective colors so they may not have been bulbs.  There appeared to be a small reflection or dim light situated between the two bars.  The space between the two bars (where I saw the dim reflection/light) was about 2/3ds the height of the bars.  I cannot say the length of the bars but If I had to guess I'd say 20 feet, but since I didn't know how high up/far away the bars were dimensions are hard to speculate about. I did not seem very high up in elevation. I could not detect any body or outline behind the light bars.  The sky was the darkest navy blue/black it can probably be.  I have checked, and the moon was on the other side of the planet. So while I am noticing these lights John has made it around and clambered into the cab. I immediately ask John, ""John, what the hell is that?"" while pointing through the windshield at the light bars. At first he glanced and said, ""An airplane.""  I then said,""Doesn't look like any airplane I've ever seen.""  Then there was a very brief pause. John then said,""OH, WAIT."" as he gathered in what he was looking at. Just a second or so before John got in the cab, the red light bar turned off, then turned on.  The green light bar followed suit.  John witnessed the second round of the bars turning off and on in turn. Once again - red off, red on, green off, green on.  At this point we are both just staring.  This is when the really odd bit comes in.  The light bars moved off to the northeast and disappeared behind the giant trees on Summit Ave. Now, I was in the Navy and I have seen, and even once, been on a helicopter. This did not move like a helicopter.  There was no gradient in the speed.  By this I mean it went from completely stationary to moving off at, I'd say 40 mph.  I heard no noise at all. John audibly gasped when it moved, I expect it is because it just didn't look right in terms of that kind of instantaneous movement; it was at speed immediately.  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up when those bars moved off like that. I have done some checking and no aircraft I can find has such illumination.  In fact using these color lights in this fashion is a violation of FAA regs.  According to my understanding green is meant to indicate the right wingtip/side only. John and I looked at each other with a HOLY S**t look on our faces.  I shook my head and put the cab in gear to take John to his destination.  We both scanned the sky to the north as we proceeded toward downtown.  We didn't see anything else in the sky the rest of the way to John's. I dropped John off, he didn't say anything.  He looked a little disturbed by our sighting. About 15 minutes or so after we saw the lights a low bank of clouds rolled in over the city.  This bank of clouds had a very distinct leading edge.  I thought these clouds a bit odd too. I sit here now wondering what it is I saw. Any ideas would be appreciated greatly.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

I couldn't judge distance but it appeared that the lights were possibly 10-15 miles distant.  The lights were striking in appearance in that they were bright and didn't conform in nature to anything normally seen with conventional airborne objects.  I grabbed a camera close by, opened my garage door and stepped out on my driveway.  The lights had disappeared.  However, approximately 10 miles to the south of that position, an orange light appeared very low in the sky. It disappeared and reappeared within a few seconds in that location.  About 60 seconds later, it appeared about 30 miles NW of that position once again as an orange light near the KITT Peak Observatory area.

I stopped and listened more closely and thought maybe it was a train, we have them frequently going through town.  It was clearly not a train, then I looked up and thought that it must be a jet that’s really low, because a commercial jet doesn’t sound like that. I walked around the corner facing due North again, and looking up I saw a flashing light, and said to myself oh, ok, it’s a jet.  Then my peripheral vision caught movement. I saw a cluster of five steady, non blinking white lights moving directly North.  Then three jets which I presumed were F-16s as the closest fighter base in Wisconsin is the 115th Fighter Wing National Guard based out of Truax Field, Madison, WI. The jets were clearly trying to catch up to this cluster of five lights, and they were making pretty good time.  The jets had the usual red and white lights for navigation and strobing. I saw them chase the cluster of 5 lights for about 1min 30 seconds approximately.  Total time of the event lasted about 5 minutes as I heard the jets approaching well before I saw them.

I would also like to point out that I am very familiar with aircraft of all type shapes and sizes as I have a number of years in the military with the specific duty of identifying enemy a/c and vehicles.  I'm absolutely certain that these fighter jets were chasing an object or objects and trying to gain on them as the object(s) clearly pulled away from them.  I would estimate their altitude at about 1 km or so.  I checked the current operational ceiling online and it showed 5600 ft.  They may have been lower.  Relative brightness of the cluster of lights would be about -1 magnitude.  Close to the brightness of Jupiter on a clear night.  Each light was this bright, and they were tightly packed together.  No discernible pattern of flight or shape, they may have been independent of each other or one object.

TIME: Shortly after midnight, 1 Jan 2014. CONDITIONS:  Cold, clear sky, moon light. Nominal northerly winds.  (We could judge wind by watching the ashes of our fireworks drift.)

Orbs moved in a trail pattern spaced about 20 seconds between object 1 and 2 and about 30 seconds between objects 2 and 3.

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I just wanted to give you a little more information about what my husband and I saw on New Year’s night.  We were watching the ball drop in NY on TV.  At midnight we watched the broadcasters hugging etc. at midnight.  We could hear a lot of fireworks going off in our neighborhood ever since it got dark so we went to our back deck  (The Wando River is North West with Daniel Island behind it).   It was about 5 minutes past midnight.  Our deck is on a march that feeds into the Wando River.  All of our neighbors have decks on the marsh and I would think that a lot of them were on them that night but I haven’t asked them if they saw anything. .   We saw some fireworks that looked like they were coming from across the Wando from the Northeast.  We then just started looking at the sky (we have a wide view from the deck).  We both noticed the “orbs” at the same time.  They were sort of in a circle-ish grouping.  I mean not a perfect circle but floating like a group.  They were kind of bobbing around but they stayed together and they floated at the same altitude.  They were bright round orbs.  At first they looked just bright white but then they seemed to be blinking or pulsing yellowish-orange.  We both spotted them at the same time and said jokingly “aliens”.  But then we both thought it was from the fireworks and would disappear.  But they didn’t disappear.   They seemed to be going west and seemed to be over the Wando River.  They floated off together and disappeared behind a cloud.  We tried to figure out what they were?  They were too low to be aircraft?  We thought maybe Boeing was testing some new kind of drone or something since there has been so much talk of drones and airspace below 500 feet?   My husband and I spend a lot of time outside.  We have been sailing in many places where the view of the sky is awesome and clear.   We have seen falling stars, satellites, planes, etc.  But we have never seen these “orb” things.  I did report this to MUFON because that was what came up when I googled UFO reporting.

These birds did not flap their wings, but glided overhead and then down into the valley area below and out of sight.

I am from Horton, Michigan, just south of Jackson, Michigan.  Last weekend I saw something that I will never ever forget. It was the night (or morning rather) of the huge snow storm, January 5, 2014.  I am a security guard and was stationed at Tenneco in Grass Lake, Michigan until 11:00pm.  At 10:40pm my relief called to tell me that he was stuck and was unable to get to work.  I offered to come pull him out with my 4x4 F-150, but I also got stuck.  We made it back to our work and were going to wait it out when I found someone to pull my truck out.  After getting un-stuck,  I got on I-94 via exit 150 heading west towards my house.  I realized that it was 3:45 am (January 6, 2014 at this point) and that Coast to Coast was on, so I turned on the radio and started to listen. After a few minutes of driving, and after passing exit 145,  I noticed that I could see what I can only describe as columns of light in the sky.  At first I just saw one, and thought it was a spot light.  But then I notice a couple of others.  It seemed strange and being that I was listening to Coast to Coast, my mind was open to all sorts of possibilities and I paid attention to every detail.  They didn’t seem to start from the sky nor from the ground, they were just there.  The light was not super bright, which is why I did not notice it at first.  There were nine of them, spaced equally apart, the same distance from me, and all the same brightness, surrounding me in a semi-circle.  There may have been some behind me, but I didn’t turn around to look because I was driving in dangerous weather.  Anyways, the columns of light were like perfect cylinders, the same width throughout. I couldn’t tell how far away or how wide they were. This is when it got even stranger.  Since it was still snowing, the sky was rather dark, although I could see a few stars through a couple breaks in the clouds.  I noticed a peculiar star and I realized that it wasn’t a star but a plane, because the light started blinking (as lights on planes do).  I watched it travel across the sky when all of a sudden it seemed to skip the whole horizon.  It started on my right (I saw it through the very right side of the windshield) and I watched it blink about five or six times and then stopped blinking for one or two seconds and all of a sudden was way to left (outside of the driver’s side window) and continued to blink. The whole time this was happening,  I could still see the beams of light.  I could see them for the whole drive home, about 35 minutes, until I turned off of the highway and started driving on back-roads through the country where the trees were blocking my view.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,42.23958516129032,-84.34975419354839

I was looking toward the west, hoping to glimpse the last bit of sunset sky, when all of a sudden an orange light gradually appeared (about ½ to ¾ the size of a dime if held out at arm’s length).  It was a faint light that became very bright and then faded out (lasted about 6-8 seconds).  To the left of that (facing west, southwest), the exact same light appeared, in the exact same manner, for the same length of time.  To the left of that (facing south, southwest), about double the distance of the second light to the first, the exact same light appeared, same manner, same length of time.  Immediately after the third orange light disappeared, “small, white, sparkler lights” appeared in the sky, above and within the entire span where the three orange lights had been.  I call these “sparkler lights” because the closest thing I can compare them to is a sparkler; the sparks are bright, yet fade quickly.  These “small, white, sparkler lights” were inconsistent or erratic (no pattern to them) and their density was higher when they initially appeared.  We ran into town to the gas station and drove the long way home to continue monitoring the sky.  As the density of these “small, white, sparkler lights” decreased, they moved greater distances between reappearing in their sparkle/twinkling fashion.  Once home my boyfriend worked in the garage until about 7:30pm, and these “small, white, sparkler lights” had continued even after he called it a night.  The duration of these lights was 1 ½ hours+. I agree that the orange lights we witnessed were a very similar color to that of street lights, however, they were much brighter and from a spatial stand point, well above the street and could not be mistaken as street lights.  I have no guess as to what the “small, white, sparkler lights” are, as this is our first encounter with lights of this fashion (in person or otherwise).  In my opinion (not speaking for my boyfriend), I think that the 3 separate orange lights were not separate ufo’s, but part of a larger craft, however, a formation was never presented.  This experience was exhilarating, but has left us feeling a little nervous since this all happened right outside our residence and we have only lived here about 5 months.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,43.85580000000001,-88.9875

I ran to the other side of my house and out the back door to watch it as it climbed some distance into the sky and hovered for about 30 seconds.  It suddenly shot up into the air and the light got dimmer and dimmer until it was a pin point into the sky.   There was no noise coming from the object so I defiantly know it could have not been a helicopter or airplane.   Freaked me out.  I live right by wright pat air force base here in Dayton.

The orb would dart down and shoot back up, what seemed like 200ft, in extremely fast and disoriented movements.   As it shifted positions it would change from a bright blue to an intense white.  I confused it at first to be a firework like a rocket/roman candle but it left no trail and did not look pyrotechnic in anyway.   My second guess was it was a drone like a quad-copter but it moved way too fast for a propeller driven drone.  It could have been military if it used tiny jets instead of propellers but it made no sound, so that rules out the possibility.  As it danced in the sky it would dip below the tree line, and would remain out of sight for up to 5 seconds, till it shot back up to at least 200-300ft.   Before I lost sight of it, I saw it shoot in and out of the tree line at least 3 times before it shot a beam towards the ground. It looked like a white spot light that pointed at the ground below it and then swung it towards my direction for a split second.  (I didn't like that lol)  Accelerated towards the tree line again and moved West towards the ocean on a horizontal flight path till it was out of sight.   I then walked into my apartment complex to find my neighbor running out of his house looking in the direction I had previously looking in.  I said, ""Hey I saw a UFO!

UFO SIGHTING TIME:  Approximately from 6:30  a.m. RMST to approximately 6:50 a.m.  Duration of sighting 20 minutes. LOCATION:  Fremont County, Colorado. OBJECT DESCRIPTION:  Large, round, reflective sphere.  No lights, no sound emitted, no exhaust trail. SIZE:  From Venus-size to slightly larger as it approached. COLOR:  Yellowish white. DATE:  1/10/2014  EVENT DESCRIPTION: While out walking, I looked around at the pre-dawn sky and notice 2 bright objects to the west at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  They were both equally bright in magnitude (the two brightest objects in the sky at the time) and almost parallel to each other in reference to the horizon line (Rocky Mountains, Wet Mountain Range).  I thought it peculiar that they were both so bright, thinking one to be Venus and one to be a planet.  I soon dismissed this notion as no other planet or star is comparable to Venus in magnitude. After about 5 minutes, I checked the sky again and found that the objet to the south had moved to the 10 o’clock position above the object to the north.  At this point, I stopped and watched the object move in an easterly direction and turn to a new heading of north by northeast at about 45 degrees above the horizon line near Pike’s Peak.  Wind was out of the north at 15 to 20 mph.  I watched until it was out of sight. The object’s speed is hard to calculate.  The best way to descibe it is that it moved at a “leisurely” pace with no apparent variation in speed. Elevation of object approximately 15 to 20,000 ft.  My position was about 6,500ft. The other object remained motionless during this time and visual contact of it was lost while looking at the moving object as the sky brightened. I am going to find out where Venus was in the pre-dawn sky in an attempt to account for the second “stationary” object. I will attest to this event by oath or affidavit. Thank you for this opportunity and I would like to let you know that your work is greatly appreciated.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,,

I remember my mom asking me about my twin brother and if I had seen him and I told her no.  It was the beginning of the summer vacation in June, the weather was warm and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.  All of a sudden my twin comes busting through the door with a look of terror on his face and screaming so loud and incoherently that we couldn't understand anything he was saying.  My mom grabbed ahold of him and held him close to try to calm him down and when he did he told her something that to this day, I will never forget. He told her that he was playing at the school.  Winterstein school in Sacramento, California. He said he was playing in the playground and had looked up to the sky because it got ""cloudy"" all of a sudden.  When he looked up he saw a large silver object that looked like a ""school bus"" with lights all around the middle part and could see ""people"" looking out the ""windows"" at him.  But when he looked closer at them, he said they weren't like any ""people"" but had very large black eyes and were all silver.  My mom got him calmed down and he went into his bedroom and slept for the rest of that day into the next day. My brother finished high school and went into the Air Force as a Radar spec./technician.  He served his tour of duty and I hadn't heard from him for nearly the whole 6 years he had served.  When he got out, he came home and got in contact with the family and I invited him over.  I had a chandelier that needed some work and asked if he would look at it for me.  He was happy to do it.  He got on the ladder and I started to ask him questions about when we were in kindergarten and when he saw the ""school bus"" in the sky.  He affirmed everything that he had told us at the time and said he didn't know what it was and that he had in fact seen the same exact thing four times.  Once again right after he had joined the Air Force while on a training ship, and another time while he was out at sea on his ship coming home from Okinawa and another time after he had bought some property in Bodega Bay, California. I had, at the time, been reading one of Bud Hopkins books that had drawings and depictions of the ""greys"".  I was being very careful about what I was saying as he was looking and sounding a little nervous about talking about it and I didn't want to make him too uncomfortable, yet my curiosity got the best of me and I picked up my book and showed him one of the drawings in the book of an alien with large black eyes and ""dressed"" in ""silver"".  When I showed this to him, he climbed down off the ladder and bluntly told me that he didn't want to talk about it anymore and he would never talk to me about it again.  He was very angry with me for bringing it up and to this day I regret showing it to him at that time.  We have had very little contact since then and I don't know how I can repair the rift that has come between us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

VA} friends were at our pond on our property in Southwest Virginia.  We had fished for a couple of hours, then built a fire, had some supper, and eventually gathered the lawn chairs around the fire and played music.  The other three were all picking various acoustic instruments, while I sat back listening, watching the sky occasionally, and enjoying the music for an hour or so. I stretched out, and just looked over my left shoulder while flexing my neck muscles. A bright yellow orange light caught my eye, coming from the north over Clinch Mt., and moving in an easterly direction.  I immediately sat up, turning toward it. It was stationary at first, then moved forward slowly, hovered, and then moved back again to its original position. I knew then it was not a plane.  I grabbed my husbands knee, as he was picking a banjo, and pointed to the object.  He looked and stopped playing immediat! ely after watching for just a couple of seconds. He then told our friends, who were sitting with their backs to the object, to ""stop now, and get a look at this"". It was that quickly apparent that this was out of the ordinary. The time was approximately 23:15, on a clear night, no clouds, and no background lights, as we live in the country. We watched this light go in a controlled yet occasionally erratic pattern for about three minutes. At one point, it went from a 1 or 2 o'clock position, to a 7 o'clock position, then back. It would hover, then go forward slowly, deliberately, and had occasional almost jerking movements back to its previous hovering point, then jumping ahead slightly, and moving smoothly. (It reminded me of a dragonfly in motion). I had a Nikon D50 with me, and a Hitachi digital dvd camera. Neither of them would work. They both had fully charged Li ion batteries. [I had both of these present, and fully charged, to record some of our annual get-t! ogether music]. I was very surprised about my digital SLR, as ! I quickl y changed settings, wondering why it would not work, as I had taken several shots previous to this sighting. I tried to just fire the flash of the camera, to see if there would be a reaction of some sort from the object. The flash would not fire. I was torn between trying to figure this out, knowing I'd be missing part of what this object was doing. I tried the the video cam...nothing. It would not record. I put them both down, deciding to just watch, while mentally cursing the manufacturers of what I thought was fairly good digital equipment. By this time, the object was halfway between Clinch Mt. and Pine Ridge. We continued watching its movement, fairly slow, deliberate, with occasional moments of hovering, until it could no longer be seen over Pine Ridge. No blinking lights were seen by three witnesses. The fourth thought he might have seen a blinking red light, but not at all times. There was absolutely no sound. The estimated time of sighting is three minutes. I knew s! omething extraordinary had been seen, and we were all fascinated, not really knowing what to think, except that it was definitely not a plane or helicopter. While the event occurred, it seemed to me personally that I was seeing it, yet at the same time not really believing that this was something I could not explain. Just remarkable; I really can not find the perfect word. Totally amazing falls a bit short.  For informational purposes, about 5 minutes later, I picked up the Nikon to see if I could take a shot; it worked perfectly, still showing a full battery charge. Didn't try the video-cam, though; we packed it up and came in.

I belive its the neighboorhood between ranchwood and mustang road we were in but it was traveling from the old mill towards the highway. not sure the first entrance to his neighboorhood but its by the old little ceasers. so I know we walked a block down as we were perplexed by the strange glow of the craft. now this I know for a fact we were standing on cambridge street under the street lamp as it flew DIRECtLy over our head o my god it was amazeing. it had three 3 rockets on the back of it and was dead silent. it was thick like a brick as we could see it didnt taper off like a planes wings. it looked like something straight out of star wars. it was HUGE I have tryed reporting this before. my gf at the time worked at mcdonalds on main street and she told me cops were there that night talking about something strange in the sky later that night when we talked. but what gets me is I immediatley called the pd with my friend and they called us back saying wiley post reported no aircraft in the area yet... right after we seen the craft after we got off the phone with the pd another fried a block or two away was drinking at a party and got a ride home and called me to tell me he seen a bunch of green orbs go flying in the sky from ground level like foreflies lighting fast all swarming and comeing from some bright oramge red light I assume its what WE saw. now he was with another kid that drowned in a lake and died last year in texas who seen it also and they GOT PULLED over and ASKED if they seen anything strange in the sky. based on this and the other report I see on here that year around that time im convinced ! that there is some sort of far more  complex superior futureis! tic tech nology via be it top secret or alien in origin I have seen it with my own two hands and god whatever he may be blessed me and my friend with it flying so close over our heads im positive as it was traveling over head I could have hit it with my .308 bolt action. it was so queit it sounded like a slow bunson burner or torch on low honestly the wind from the tress and the neighboorhood dogs were louder it defied physics something that big of a mass of triangle going as slow as it did should have stalled and crashed. yet as it flew over the streetlamp the lamp seemed to grow much brighter and the wind died down as it flew off into the distance towards lake overholser. I dont know if anything extreme happend as I dont know the origin but I belive we seen this thing much closer than anyone else did that night amd there 3 of us left to confirm this it was real and theres no denying that. I am just amazed to know that we are atleast not an iscolated group to have seen it that night! and also amazed that atleast 100 people didnt see it because although it was LATE at night and it WAS silent it was a VERY populated area and somethimg like that triangle would be VERY hard to ignore or miss.

Crossed Kingston/Rhineclif Bridge and turned south onto 32/Flatbush Rd.  Noticed two lights slightly to my left through front windshield but dismissed them as stars or possibly small planes.  Was listening to music and thinking. As I passed a the Rondout Services center on the left I glanced up and noticed the lights were still there but brighter.  They were also a reddish color.  I also noticed that they were below the cloud cover because it was thin and fuzzy stars could be seen through them.   These lights were very bright and not hazy in the same way. I still thought they were planes or helicopters, but noticed that they didn't seem to be moving.  But since I was in motion I couldn't tell.   I continued to watch them and it became very clear quickly that they were stationary in the sky because, as I continued they seemed to be getting closer and the angle between them and my view was changing.  I was approaching a perpendicular angle to them and I noticed they were quite a bit lower and closer than I originally had thought.  By the time I got to the stoplight at the waste management station they were right in the frame of the driver's side window.  It's a lengthy light, so I took the time to roll down the window and stick my head out to really get a good look.  At that point they were right in front of my line of view out the window.  One appeared to be about 40 degrees up from the horizon (there's a rise to the left, then the Hudson River, which is about a mile away from that point) and the other was higher, to the left, at ! about 60 degrees.  I glanced at the car next to me (I was in the left hand lane), and at least the driver of that vehicle had also noticed the lights and was clearly looking at them.  Our eyes met briefly in recognition of what we were seeing.  He was also speaking to someone, but whether it was to a passenger--couldn't see into his vehicle--or into a speaker phone I couldn't tell. When I stopped and actually really looked at the lights, they were clearly stationary, very bright, steady reddish lights, very shiny.  All of a sudden, on cue, as it were, and right before the stop light turned (it almost seemed timed), the two lights very rapidly and in perfect tandem and coordination, veered at right angles to the left.  They went from stationary to rapid motion literally at once. I remember thinking...""ok, this is just too weird, it's just how it's supposed to be, why couldn't it have been something else.""  I drove on through the light and a little ways down the road was able to look back briefly to see if I could tell where they were heading, and I couldn't see them again. I don't know if they speeded up and disappeared or what, but they were gone. When I got home my partner and I plotted the sighting on a topographical map of Ulster county that we have on the wall.  Based on that, and depending on their elevation, we figured out that the lights either had to be over the Hudson itself, or close to being over S. Rhinebeck.

I went outside to have a cigarette and look at the night sky. It was a clear night with the moon in the south east of the sky.  It was a big, bright moon. There were a few light wispy clouds, but almost completely clear, dark night.  I looked at the sky for while, then let my eyes adjust by staring at a blank area of the black sky.  That's when I saw a light, it had the intensity of a brighter starlight, moving from the south. In the first instance I saw the moving light I thought it was a satellite or other regular object. I am used to seeing a variety of things in the night sky.  That is when I noticed two more exact same lights behind the first.  The lights were in a dark part of the sky with no clouds at first. I could not figure out what was moving up there. Whatever is was, it was at altitude.  The 3 lights moved in unison.  Then the craft went under a wispy cloud, and with the moon that night, it was just like someone standing up in front of a movie theater screen.  I got a clear look at the shape of the craft.  As the craft went under the cloud I saw that it was a (what I thought) was a delta shaped craft.  And I thought ""wow a stealth bomber must be coming in"".  Then, as the craft continued under the cloud and more of it came into clear view, I noticed that it was a V shaped craft. Clearly a V, like a carpenters square.  It was not a B2 or a stealth fighter. It was big, my initial thought was that 2 747's could land on one wing of the V craft. The span from tip to tip of the rear tips had to be at least 6 or 7 747's apart. It was huge. It was not a UAV or remote controlled craft. It was at altitude and huge. It had no aviation lights, just the 3 lights that were like stars at each point of the V. When the craft went under the cloud, you could not see the 3 ""star lights"", only the outline of the craft. As the craft left the cloud, it was like the craft went invisible again. The cr! aft continued north. As it went away, all I could see 3 glowin! g red ha lf orbs, all side by side. They glowed red, not bright red, but like a low watt red light bulb. The craft made no sound, absolutely silent. I estimate the speed to be approximately 100 to 150 mph due to distance it traveled in that time. It went perfectly straight heading south to north. I know this sounds crazy but when I see some of the images that people drew of the ""Phoenix Lights"", I see the same thing I saw that night. It was real. It was not a plane, jet, remote UAV, or anything else I have ever seen. If I had not looked at the sky like I did that night, I would have never had known it was going over my head. I have hoped to hear of someone else in Saskatoon that saw the same thing that night but I have not. There is Sept 26/13 report on this site with a drawing by someone in Turlock, California of a V-shaped craft very similar to what I saw, but his drawing has too many lights, I saw only 3, but other that that, it was the same.",2013-12-12T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

I looked at the photos which I had taken earlier and realized something on the side where Mt. Suswa is situated; it is very visible from the road that is on top of the escarpment.  I zoomed the object which is black in color, looks like it’s in a rectangle blue light.  On the clip after playing it in a slow motion, I noticed there was another object, which was not that visible, following the other.. Things got more mysterious when I looked at the details of the clip and photos, the time on them did not match the time I was in Mahi Mahiu. •	First photo reads 12.45pm •	Second photo reads 12.52pm •	Third photo reads 12.53pm •	The clip reads 1.00pm  Am afraid on that time I had not even reached Mahi Mahiu. 1.	  Left Kisii to Nairobi at around 10.20am. 2.	  Around 2.30pm the bus I was traveling in stopped in Narok for people to have lunch. 3.	  Exactly at 3.10pm I sent a message to my boyfriend telling him I was 40km away from Mahi Mahiu. I still have the message on the phone and I knew the distance because I had seen a sign on the road reading, ‘MMU 40KM’ then sent the message. 4.  	I reached Mahiu Mahiu around 3.50pm and that’s when I started taking the photos. 5.	  Reached Nairobi at around 5.30pm. I have used my phone log to give the times.  I had been receiving calls during the journey. I have taken a few pictures to see if the time settings of my phone are correct or incorrect and up to now they are correct. I was traveling in public transport bus and maybe if the other passengers can be found they can give their side of the story.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,,

I thought maybe it was a blimp.  But I checked the news and the internet and I found nothing on a blimp being flown around evansville.

I couldn't see anything but could hear a disturbing loud noise that drowned out our T.V.. I then decided to look outside again and this time I saw a colored light in the middle of the squared white lights and looked kind of like a police light but with different colors spinning around.  There are 3 windows on each side of the colored police light and a total of 6.  The window on each side of this craft seems to wrap around.  So I really only see 2 1/2 windows on each side of the police light.

I told my husband I was going to take a drive down the street and I rolled my windows down and could here them really loud like something was bothering them.  Also, I saw that 3 neighbors had their backyard lights on that faced the pasture and farm.

They would appear and disappear about 1 to 2 minutes apart and within 5 degrees of each other.  They did not rise and fall like throwing a ball into the air.   They appeared 7 different times.  The orange objects appeared to be very far away (50+ miles).   During the middle of the appearances I heard and felt a sonic boom.  It shook our house.  That was the only noise I heard. The last time the bright orange light appeared it was much closer and 20 degrees above the horizon and moving slowly Southwest to Southeast.  It first appeared about 235 degrees in the southwest.  This time I could see behind the bright orange sphere a long tail of orange embers trailing behind.  The embers didn’t appear to be falling but they just trailed off directly behind the object sort of like a comet.  This time the light was pulsating for 10-12 seconds and then it went dark.  It was about the size of a basketball thus it appeared much closer and brighter than the first 6 sightings. I called the Iron County Sheriff’s office to report it and see if anyone else had seen it.   Apparently I’m the only one who observed it.

I've debated with myself for quite a while (as can be seen by the date of this report), as to whether or not to formally file a report.  On the evening of 12/13/2013, my girlfriend and I exited my house at roughly midnight; I got into my car, she got into her car (I needed to drive up to the local gas station to put air in my tire, which was extremely low). Before backing out of my driveway, I checked my rear-view and driver-side mirrors to make sure that no other vehicles were behind me. Upon looking in my driver-side mirror, I noticed two lights very close together at roughly 35 degrees and possibly 500-1000 feet in the air; this object appeared south of my home. I looked for a moment slightly confused as it was a mostly overcast evening. The longer I started, the longer my girlfriend started at me wondering what I was looking at. When I looked over at her, she kind of tossed her hands up wondering what I was doing, I pointed back and up.  After doing this, I got out of my car. She then exited her car and wondered what I was looking at. I pointed it out to her and she was also confused. She then pointed out another set of identical lights roughly 1000 feet to the right (towards the southwest). I then spotted a third set of lights roughly another 1000 feet further to the southwest. All of these lights appeared to be at the same altitude but was unable to make out anything that resembled a shape.  As we looked at these stationary lights, the first set of lights started tilting to the right as if if was going to start moving, it however stayed stationary. When we looked over at the other two sets of lights, they had done the same thing. I am not sure as to whether or not these were coordinated events, or circumstantial. At this point, we actually questioned what we were looking at. We kind of jokingly dismissed it as ufo's and got back into our cars and headed out to the gas station that is at the corner of state road 38 and 109 in Markleville, Indiana.  I continued looking to the south as I was driving to watch the lights that we had spotted. They were still there, and the further from my home that I drove, I spotted 2-3 more. When we got to the gas station, we watched for another few minutes. By this point, the objects had started moving slowly to the west.  When I got back home I looked again, and each set of lights was gone.  Having served in the Air Force and being familiar with several different types of aircraft, my initial thought was that we had seen a small fleet of helicopters preforming late night maneuvers. The more I thought about it though, the objects (after tilting to the right) did not appear to move. It is common for us to see commercial aircraft over our homes at night as we live in an area that is a commonly traveled flight path for airliners to land at the Indianapolis International Airport. It is also common, though less so, that we have military jets fly over our home. This however, generally only happens during air shows at the airfield located around McCordsville, Indiana and rarely outside of spring or late fall. Also, these objects were 100% silent. The only noises that we heard were from our running vehicles.  I captured no photographs of this event, and it wouldn't likely have been good photographs due to low light. I would however be more than willing to sketch what we witnessed.  Thank you for taking the time to read this rather lengthy report.",2013-12-12T00:00:00,39.97,-85.6175

We decided to do back country camping, and hiked down for at least a mile away from any major trails. The first night I didn’t notice anything unusual in the skies.  However on the second night, there was a strange occurrence. First, my boyfriend noticed some lights in the distance up near the main trail that seemed to bob up and down.  At first I thought they were flashlights from people walking around (it was past 9pm, probably close to 10pm, when we got back to our campsite).  The lights almost looked like they were coming toward us, so we put our shoes on just in case (there would be no reason for anyone come that way as we were a good distance from the main trail with no other campsites visible).  After studying the lights for a while (maybe 20 min, it is hard to say), we still could not tell what we were seeing.  The lights just kept dipping below the horizon line, which showed the outline of trees and other formations of the park, and weaving behind the trees or formations.  Like I said, it was hard to tell. We finally decided to just forget about it and have dinner. After, we looked at the sky. I saw several brilliant flashes of light out of the corner of my eye. My boyfriend said that he saw several as well.  However I was never able to pinpoint the source of light.  There were no clouds in the sky, but I’ve speculated that this could have been a type of heat lightning.  I don’t know if that is even possible, but that is the only explanation I could think of. Finally, and this is why I have decided to report this sighting, I saw something even more bizarre. We were going to bed, and I had just finished reading and was trying to fall asleep. I noticed an intense light from below my closed eyelids and opened my eyes.  There was a brilliant light, for some reason I have the word “spotlight” in my mind, that shined right on our tent.  It lit up the whole inside of the tent. Terrified, I tried to wake my boyfriend up. I remember saying “Oh my god, there’s a light, there’s a light, there’s a light outside”. I shook my boyfriend’s shoulders to try to rouse him. He just mumbled something, and continued sleeping.  At that point I knew we were basically sitting ducks and that there was nothing I could do, so I just forced myself to close my eyes and I shoved my head down between the blankets.  It felt like the “spotlight” just kind of moved on after a minute or two (even though my eyes were squeezed tight, I could still see light, so I knew! when it had left because the light was gone).  I don't remember anything after the feeling that the light had passed; I don't remember if I fell asleep, or stayed awake.  The next thing I remember is waking up some time later towards morning.  To note, I do not remember hearing any sound associated with the light. I have never had anything like this happen before, and it has taken a while, but I thought this might be worth reporting.",2013-12-12T00:00:00,,

Hello I stumbled across your website through google.  I wanted to report a strange “star” that for the past 2 months has been appearing in the night sky of Dallas. Its Coordinates is 215 DEGREES southwest of the southeast Dallas sky.  It is easily seen as it is commonly brighter than the North star. This strange light sometimes becomes dim like most stars, but for the most part it is unusually brighter than most of them.  It just recently appeared as I said above about 2 months ago. It is sometimes seen higher in the sky or lower by a few degrees even after the upward or downward shift it sits stationary, and certain nights its always near the same area of coordinates given above.  It is currently 11/29/2013 19:52 hrs and it disappeared but the times it does vanish varies, it normally appears everyday around 17:30-19:30hrs approximately. I don’t know what it could be, I assumed at first that it was one of our planets, as was reported that during this year we would see Venus, but later dismissed that assumption after finding out Venus would only be visible for a few nights. This “star” as I call it, sometimes glows an orange tint and when it does it is usually farther away, and every now and again can be spotted further to the southeastern part of the sky. It would look like Mars would when looking at it with the naked eye. When looking at this “star” with the naked eye in its brightest stage it begins to look as if it glows a little with a faint misty aura around it. I'm sure this might just be due to the human eye and how it works, but I have a feeling it is something else. I do believe it is a UFO as I cannot identify it, but I also do not have a telescope to see this marvelous site.

While vacationing with friends for the first time in Lincolnville, Maine on September 14, 2013, we arrived at our destination after dark to a house in the woods.  I had not been oriented to my surroundings since my arrival was after dark but was told that the house was on a pond in a wooded area.  I went to bed approximately 11:45 PM which was  in an attic bedroom with a skylight in front of the bed on the drop ceiling.  I was awakened after midnight to a blinding, focused, white light coming through the skylight about thirty yards away from the house, illuminating the bedroom and focused on the wall beside my head.   The light became brighter and slightly dimmer and then brighter again which stayed bright for at least 20 to 30 minutes or longer.  It was brighter than the lights on a football field at night.  I got up and looked out of the skylight and saw three large spotlights arranged two beside each other and the third under them in a triangular fashion.  The lights were attached to a triangular object suspended just below the tall tree line in the quiet black sky.  I did not know what to think so I remained calm and peaceful not even thinking about waking up anyone.  I eventually covered my eyes from the light and fell back to sleep.   When I woke up in the morning I became terrified because the condensation on the skylight took the form of a picture of an alien grey head.  The second morning the condensation looked like half of a huge cat head, and the third morning the condensation reminded me of a Peruvian Indian head. All three of the forms has personal meaning to me.  The first picture reminded me of an UFO encounter that I believed happened to me as a child and had suppressed for about 35 years, the second picture of a cat is my favorite animal and the third picture looked like one of the native indians I saw while visiting Peru in 2007.  It is NOT like me to be so calm in a situation like I experienced in the middle ! of the night in Maine.  All of this is so bizarre that I start! ed not t o report this but this is what I've experienced.",2013-12-12T00:00:00,44.3219,-69.0596

For a couple seconds we both didn't say anything, but there was something awfully parculiar that we both seemed to pick up on. First off, my friend lives near the Manchester airport, she's used to seeing airplanes all the time.  Airplanes have a blue & a red light on them, this craft did not have them.  Secondly, the lights of an airplanes aren't perfectly flourescent & white, but seem to have a yellow tint to them.  What we saws lights were whiter than any lights that we've ever seen before.  There was one bigger brighter one in front, and two smaller ones not far behind in the back. We also keep in mind that we are near the airport, which brings me to my next point.  This bright lighted craft was flying low heading East in the direction of Derry.  And then it just disappeared. We were baffled all the way until we got to our destination in Litchfield.  We had gotten out of our cars, and had asked our friend in the other car about it.

On the evening of November 22, 2013 at approximately 10:45pm I arrived home late from work.  I live in Rome Georgia (45 mins North of Atlanta).  My home is located on top of Mt. Alto. A small (3000ft approx) mountain.  Two lane road with houses on both sides of the road.  Very nice views north or south.  As I was getting out of my truck I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star - but it looked ""too close"" to truly be a star.  Plus it was blinking like planets blink.  Sort of changing colors white-red-yellow but only slightly.  The changes were not extremely noticeable.  It was just twinkling - but again it looked too close and too bright to be a star.  It was about approx 35 degrees or so up in the sky.  Orion was up as well as the north star. The object was below Orions foot and to the left of the North Star.  It was an extremely cold and clear night.  No clouds whatsoever.  I decided to go get a pair of my binoculars - but could only find a! pair of my kids - which are basically just toys.  It actually made my view worse.  I decided to see what my phone would do.  I put it on video (Droid Razr Maxx) - Immediately I saw a distinct shape and set of lights in a row.  Looked like the classic saucer shape lights in a line.  I videod it like this for about 20 seconds or so and then zoomed in.  Once I zoomed in - it was incredible.  The object is HUGE.  Dozens of lights blinking - some random and some in a definite pattern.  The object then appeared to be cigar shaped with what appears to be a tall tail or fin on the far right side.  Lights would appear all along the object in different colors - red,green,white,yellow and in many different places along the object (in a line in front - and randomly through the center and then again in a line on the tail/fin).  It appears to be just MASSIVE.  I can only slightly make out the shape - but the lights are very obvious.  It sat in the sky for at least 4 or 5 hours. The obje! ct never moved in a traditional sense.  Once while videoing it! with my camera it shifted up in the sky about an inch or more INSTANTLY.  Also it moved four or five inches to the right in the sky one time and then back left - both times the movement was so fast it was almost like it just ""appeared"" in the new spot. I did not catch the right left movement on camera as I was changing the batteries. I videoed it for about 20+ mins on my regular video camera as well as my phone.  My wife came outside and watched it with me.  But it was late - after 11pm by this time and extremely cold.  I also noticed an unusual amount of static electricity in my house later that evening - that I have never noticed before and have not experienced since.  I have looked each night since the sighting but have not seen it appear again.  The object would easily be confused as a star to the naked eye.  I have a large amount of video of this object and as of the typing of this report I have turned the video in to MUFON and this organization for further investiga! tion!",2013-12-12T00:00:00,34.28513526785714,-85.1916888392857

At first I thought it looked like Santa’s sleigh and reindeers light up.  As the lights curved and moved upwards  towards the south I noticed that they disappeared one by one as they were directly over our garage which is south of the house. 	I went inside and yelled for everyone to hurry up and get outside and look at the sky.  My husband, Sam Powell, and my neighbor who was over visiting, Zebbie Wassom, came outside.  I counted 10 lights in the sky.  We all watched for a few minutes.  There was no noise.  I saw new lights emerge from the distant southeast at about 30 degrees in the sky.  They appeared more of a flaming red color.  The lights followed an arcing pattern through the sky. (Appearing in the southeast, moving northwest, moving west, moving southwest, then moving south and disappearing.  All this activity occurred in the southern part of the sky.) Some lights were further apart from each other.  Some lights were higher than others but not by more than about 5 degrees.  Some lights appeared to change speed slightly.  Some lights appeared to change direction slightly.  As the lights got closer they all appeared more of an orange color. 	We all went back inside.  My husband got out the phone book.  Zebbie and I grabbed our cell phones and went back outside. It was 7:20 pm according to my cell phone as Zebbie called her husband who was at home across the street and told him to look out the window towards the south in the sky. 	Zebbie went back inside shortly thereafter.  I continued watching until the last light was gone at 7:24 pm. Overall, I counted about 15 lights in the sky at one time and about 24 lights total.   The lights were high up in the sky – not to be confused with airplanes coming in for approach to Spokane International Airport or Fairchild Air Force Base.  The lights appeared larger when they emerged from the distant southeast sky. When they were closer they were about the size of a regular star in the sky except they were bright and flickered.  The lights did not come down from the sky instead the moved across: in, around, and then out. The lights did not have a tail on them like a comet. I didn’t bother to try and record this event on my cell phone because I thought the clarity would be bad and besides it would be on the news with an explanation of what had happened. The rest of the evening and for a few days I watched  local TV news stations to see if anyone else saw it, but nothing was reported that day or since.

I say oval, but I could tell it was actually the shape of a frisbee, but from my angle, it appeared to be an oval.  We were about a half an hour north of O'Hare airport, but it was moving way to fast to be a plane.  And it was too big and had a solid white light that didn't blink or flare or leave a trail, so it couldn't have been a comet. It seemed to be about airplane height, I want to say 20,000 feet. But by the time it reached the horizon, it could have been anything higher than that.  If a plane travels 500-600 mph, I would say it was 4 to 6 times faster then that.  The best way to describe it was if I were laying on my back and a professional whipped a frisbee over my head.  Only difference is the object was clearly glowing and was very high in the air and huge. It was about the size of a skittle, maybe a little bigger from my perspective.  As I wrote, it happened very fast, but as soon as it happened, my passenger and I looked at each other and at the same time said, ""Did you just see that?"".

As we continued to drive we noticed the craft was no moving enough to make a noticeable difference and the light trail was much shorter than what is typically seen behind an airplane.  We soon cleared the tree cover and noticed 3 objects to the direct north all flying diagonally in different directions at different altitudes.  When we made a more southern turn we noticed 2 more streaks of orange light parallel to one another almost in a direct southwest direction.  As we neared Georgetown we noticed one more streak above the Toyota plant but it seemed to be noticeable farther away.

Then I could faintly see four distinct lights apear out of the trees and then the sound just stoped.  There was a loud boom, but the boom was recognizable but I couldn't remember what the noise was.  Then it got too silent then it flew overhead, with a low hum then it was just gone.   After it left I heard a dog bark a few times.

It had a white light on the side near the top – the size of it was one inch by five inches.  It pulsed every two seconds but did not go completely out during the low side of the light.  The object was about 80 -100 feet from my position.  The unusual thing about the object was there were no definitive edges.  The house, driveway, lawn and street looked as normal.  The black object looked as if it shimmered slightly.  It was black but not a dark solid black with lighter streaks going through it horizontally though they were faint.  The only other thing that was not normal was that my ne! ighbor had installed Christmas lights on the lawn next to the driveway.  The lights were not on at that time.

This was a Saturday night and we had stayed home -- I did not have an alcoholic drink that night nor have I ever in my life used any kind of recreational drugs.

I live in north Brevard County Florida, in the city of Titusville, approximately one mile to the north of a small regional airport, Titusville Executive Airport. Also, Orlando Interational Airport is approximately 40 miles to my west/southwest.  Patrick Airforce Base is approximately 30 miles to my east/southeast, and the Kennedy Space Center approximately 12 miles due east.  As a result, I frequently see, and am familiar with all manner of small, private, single/multi-engine propeller and jet aircraft, as well as commercial and military aircraft.  Furthermore, I am familiar with their lighting and flight characteristics. On the evening of December 2nd, 2013 at approximately 6:30 pm, I observed an unusual display of lights in the western sky as I was driving south on the street I live on, approaching my home.   My attention was initially drawn to the ""object"" due to its unusual brilliance, purity of color(s), and size.  The object was located west/southwest of my position, about 45° above the horizon and appeared to be moving slowly towards me.   My initial thought was that it was simply a commercial flight from O.I.A. and that its ""unusual features"" were caused by flairing due to viewing it through the window glass.  However, I quickly dismissed this notion once I had exited my car and seen it with the naked eye, unobstructed by any glass.   The object appeared to be circular, about the size of a large pea held at arm's length.  It was an absolutely pure white, diamond-like brilliance I have never seen and, projecting downward from each side, at about a 45° angle, there was an i! ntense ""lazer-like"" blue beam.  These ""beams"" appeared about the diameter of the shaft of a round wooden toothpick, and the length appeared approximatelty equal to the diameter of the light.  I watched it for several minutes as it maintained it's approach at a very low speed. I would have stood there all night watching it and tried to get a picture on my cell phone, but my father-in-law was seriously, in the hospital, and we were rushing to try to get to the hospital to see him.   I simply cannot get that image out of my mind, it was unlike anything I have ever seen. I hope this account helps in some small way the effort to finally get an answer as to what these things are that so many people around the world have been reporting for so many years.",2013-12-12T00:00:00,28.54022121212121,-80.85438636363637

Hi. I went into my back yard around 11:10 on 1/13/2014 to stargaze with my 10x50 binoculars.  I looked around the whole sky with the naked eye to see how clear it was out; there were almost no clouds out.  So I looked at the moon and the constellation Orion.   When I took the binoculars down and I looked up I noticed a very bright pulsing red/orange circular light on the upper horizon.  Automatically I knew that it wasn’t there before, my heart started beating like it was going to jump out of my chest.  I looked through my binoculars at it, the object was far away but I could tell it was circular.   As I kept staring at it, it looked as if it was bobbing up and down.  Then I thought I saw a white beam/light almost flickering under it and then out the side of the object I saw three white objects shoot out to the right and then directly up and then they were out of my vision.  The smaller objects were pea size in comparison to the main bright red/orange object.   Not too long after that the main object started moving away from its original position.  As it got farther away from me it got dimmer and dimmer, eventually in an instant it was gone and I stood there in awe of what I saw and then went inside very much scarred.   My dog was with me out there and she didn’t react in any way but the object could have been too far away.   I’ve always wanted to see something like this for myself and finally I have.  My family now thinks I’m crazy but I KNOW what I saw.   Tonight I will go outside and check again but I doubt I’ll see anything again.

The object was framed between tree branches.  There was a large cracking sound before I noticed the light.

I observed the light it was bright white with maybe an occasional flash of red, it appeared to be about the same size as Venus appears, larger than most stars, I observed the object for approximately 20 minutes in the frame of the tree branches, it did fade and did not disappear entirely from sight during the time I watched it.

I did see a few other lights in the general direction, one appear red, which where in the same general area but could have been low planes.

It then rapidly came towards our parked car, moving towards us and closer to the ground. At this point we drove away and it stayed hovering right above our car.

The underside was covered with panels of light, much like the light of a cool white LED.  The light panels were also gridded, like looking up at  fluorescent office lights.

At the time and date stated above, the sky was clear, stars were plentiful.   My girlfriend and I were leaving our parked car in front of our house when we noticed a bright reddish light in the northeastern quadrant of the night sky.  My girlfriend is training to become a pilot and remarked that having only the single colored light made it appear to not be a fixed wing aircraft of any sort since it did not have the white strobe light and constant green light that most aircraft possess.   The object appeared to be moving slowly in a north-south direction, though at times it appeared to slow to a stop and even slightly adjust course before moving forward once again.   At the same time this was happening, an emergency helicopter passed overhead (in the opposite direction the UFO was moving) traveling at its normal operating altitude.  This gave us some perspective as to the relative distance the unknown object was both above us and in a distance.  We would estimate the object was in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 feet in altitude, and perhaps some three to six miles away.   We continued watching the object as it continued its’ north-south vector for some minute and a half.  Then the object stopped moving forward and hesitated briefly.  I watched as the light appeared to slowly turn on its’ axis so as the bright light was no longer shining in our direction, but now facing due east.  I could still see the light enough to tell that it was now moving forward in an easterly direction.   Once it began traveling in that direction it disappeared within two to three seconds, fading from sight very quickly.

He called back soon afterwards to say that he had spoken to the men who operated the radar as well as flight screens, and neither had seen anything unusual.   However, a gentleman who works in the tower told the supervisor that he had been walking towards the tower at that time and had seen the same object in the night sky.

I stopped at a convenient store during my lunch hour today and looked up at the sky because I heard a helicopter.  While I was watching the helicopter, the sky was clear and blue but I noticed that there was a bright whitish light it looked like an orb with a beam of light or tail coming down from it and when it moved it had a silver metallic shine to it but it didn't seem to be moving like a normal object.   I looked at it for a moment and thought ""that is cool someone released a balloon maybe?""  But as I was thinking this a dozen or maybe more white orbs started to appear-they were dimmer than the first one I spotted but were just appearing like a light switch was turning them on one by one.    When I saw this all thoughts of balloons left my head.  I watched these things switch on for about 5-10 minutes.   I got scared and did not see anyone in the parking lot to talk to about what it was so I quickly went inside to make my purchase and clear my head.  I thought when I went back out I could decipher what I was seeing more clearly.   I spent about a minute inside and when I came back out they had all just disappeared.   My hands were shaking when I got into my car and I quickly tried to google any type of celebration or memorial where balloons were being released but I could not find anything significant happening in our area today.   The helicopter that was flying by at the time was white with either a black or dark blue bottom like a police helicopter.  I did not see any name on the side of it.  Could it have been dropping something.   I'm just curious if anyone else saw this and new what it was.   I am having a hard to determining whether I should submit this but.......I would like to know what it was or if anyone else seen it.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,30.47439334637965,-84.25529034572733

I just left work and was stopped at the intersection of 280 and Office Park Drive. I was perhaps 2 or 3 cars from the light, waiting on the light to change.  Across 280 I saw what I first assumed was an aircraft moving slowly through the sky…until it stopped moving.  At that point I assumed it was a helicopter, but it moved back in the opposite direction, stopped, then moved forward again.  It was hovering back and forth in a way that is strange, even for a helicopter.  It had a light that pulsed, changed from red to green, (did not blink in a familiar, aircraft pattern).  The pulsing was random.  There may have been a white light as well.  All lights were tightly clustered together. I could not discern a shape. Just the lights, but I was parked at the traffic light for a good 45 seconds to 1 minute watching it hover above the trees across the busy road (someone else had to have seen it - it was rush hour). When traffic began to move, I pulled off of the road and looked back  so I could continue to observe it, which I did for another minute or so.  It slowly began to descend below the tree line where I lost sight of it. Total time observing: approximately  1.5- 2 minutes. My theory is that it was some sort of robotic drone that an engineering student may have been testing from an empty parking lot in Mountain Brook Office Park.  That’s the only “rational” explanation that makes any sense to me at this point. I tend to have a critical eye and I do not jump to conclusions.

Three of us went inside to eat and the other stayed out to have a cigarette.  When she came inside she claims to have seen multiple airplanes fly towards the direction the lights were traveling. When we got out of the restaurant, a star filled sky seemed almost empty, like smoke or fog was covering it.  The stars and the line of lights seemed very faint.  It wasn't clouds covering the sky because we could see the very few clouds that were there in the horizon. When I got home I heard multiple airplanes and helicopters flying fairly close to the ground.  I went on Facebook and saw the status updates from multiple people saying things like ""does anybody else see what I'm seeing""  or ""what are those lights in the sky??""   I wanted to go back out and check it out, but I didn't.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,33.8639,-84.1243

For some reason I looked up to my left and I saw a HUGE formation of red lights in a long line.  There were at least 10-15 lights in a row dimly pulsating but sequentially.  When I spotted it I immediately said ""what the HELL is that"" and I never say hell in front of my kids. Immediately I thought...""wait, it has to be a string of lights over a  production plant or something"" because there were several in the area.  Or maybe part of a tower even though they were horizontal.  So I thought maybe they were on the top of a very tall fence or strung across something.  It looked pretty close and low like maybe a half mile away.   When I went down a hill, it went behind the trees and when I popped up it had moved.  This continued and I continued watching it move steadily across in front of me and eventually continue on to my right. I was travelling due West and it went from south to north so now I knew it was not stationary lights.  During this time, I could see it in relation to several planes flying overhead and could tell it was much further out then they were, therefore, further than I had thought in the first place.  It wasn't in outer space.  It as within the radar airspace, but higher than a fixed engine would fly. I was driving so I couldn't count the lights and study it for long periods of time.  I had to keep looking at the road so I wouldn't wreck and I didn't want to pull over on a narrow shoulder on this dark road.  I noticed that it looked like it was in fog because the lights were hazy and would look as if they would just dim out any minute as they were pulsating so I thought the sky must be hazy but after I got to where I could no longer see it,.  Looked up and noticed that all the planes and stars were very bright.  The sky was crystal clear with a very bright moon. This thing was either a formation of many crafts or it was one HUGE craft that had lights outlining it.  I got the impression that it was probably a massive craft with lights on it because there was also a light in front of it and also because the lights stayed in such a perfect straight line.  It moved very very slowly and if it was so far away that it looked hazy and slow, then that means it was far bigger than I thought.  Just one light was the size of the planes in the sky maybe little smaller so if you can imagine at least 10-15 red lights lined up in a row, that is one big UFO. Even if I had taken a picture, it wouldn’t have turned out because the lights were so dim, not at all bright like the planes. I am 46 and have never seen anything like this. It was totally unfamiliar and unusual.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,33.9785,-83.8811

I was in bed, not yet asleep, and turned over to face the bay window, which has an eastern exposure.  I became aware of what I believe was a white light flashing onto my body; since car headlights sometimes reflect into the house and there was a car on the road outside, I thought that's what the light was.  However, this light was flashing, and when the car had gone, the light remained, flashing.  The duration of this was just a few seconds. My memory of the transition from the white light to the colored lights isn't clear, but the white light seemed to be gone; I now noticed a red/blue flashing light.  My first thought was that a State trooper had stopped a driver at the bottom of the hill on which my house sits; however, when I sat up, I realized that the road was empty, and the lights were in the distance - above the ridgeline.  I watched for a few seconds, and the lights just appeared to go out. I must preface my description by stating that I am very nearsighted and, of course, was not wearing glasses or contacts in bed.  Anything I see without vision correction is blurred, appearing larger than it actually is.  That being said, the lights still appeared quite large.  They were in approximately the same position, for me, as the rising sun.  I've seen the sun rise without my contacts, and these lights appeared larger than the sun.  What I saw was a large, circular light display, apparently composed of many smaller lights.  The flashed in unison from red to blue and back; that is what made me think of flashing police lights.  I live on a hill with a fair view to the East, and it occurred to me that a police car stopped with flashing lights on the distant hill might be seen from my position. In the morning, with my contacts in, I lay in bed in the same position; it then seemed unlikely that I'd seen flashing police lights.  The lights I saw really appear to have been in the sky. About me: I am a 68-year-old woman, college educated.  I have never made a report such as this before.  I have tried to find another explanation for the lights I saw, but I cannot; they are a mystery to me.",2014-01-16T00:00:00,39.7724,-76.5845

We continued to watch for several seconds, after which an object began to fall to the ground (perpendicular to the earth) . It seemed to emit a dim spot of light.

Upon leaving the store, approximately 5 minutes later, I immediately noticed the brightest light I have ever seen in the night sky other than the moon in the same direction as I had just traveled not noticing anything.  I watched for a moment in the parking lot as it seems to pulse between orange and gold colors with very little motion. I decided since I lived near open water that I would drive to the water’s edge and get a better look. As I drove along the tree canopied roads it was hard to keep a good eye on but at one point it seemed that there was something that resembled a light beam from the bottom.  This made me think this was possibly a coast guard helicopter or something but continued to get the unobstructed view at the water’s edge. To my surprise the object was no helicopter, completely silent and so bright that the light from it reflected clearly off the calm water.  I snapped the best picture I could with my phone but it is obviously not made for detail at a distance.  Object was located WNW of Homosassa, FL, with a slight drift toward the south. Low elevation, 1000-1500 ft max would be my best guess.  If it was more then a few miles offshore it would have had to be of massive size based on the sheer amount of light being produced. Slight color changes between a golden yellow and orange happened periodically but not in a certain amount of time.

At approximately 9pm this evening, my fiancé and I were relaxing on the couch watching television.  The lights in the house were off.  When we watch television we are facing one small and one large picture window that looks out onto our wooded yard.  Our house is tucked into a forested lot so that even the headlights from the very occasional passing car going to and from a neighbors house is not seen from our living room.  There are very few houses on our road. As we watched our show at least 3 bright orange flashes of light flew from the right side of our house in the air the whole time and moved across to the left.  Even though it only lasted a few seconds it was clear that the light originated and continued in the air, though maybe not tree top height.  The trees around our property average about 20-30 feet high. From where the flashes originated there is nothing but wooded property and our garage.   The flashes seemed to be no more than 6-10 feet off the ground but grew in height.  My fiancée thought something in the garage had exploded.  However, there was never any sound at all. I thought the lights to the truck had flashed a few times.   My fiancé ran out onto our front deck to look and see what it was but there was nothing there.  Nothing was out of place. The lights were bright orange and clear quick flashes with 3-5 of them successively within the span of 3-5 seconds.  They moved from right to left completely silently and were so bright they lit up our front yard (which is about the size of the parking lot of a small business) and all the trees in our yard.  To give you an idea of how big our yard is, we could probably park 30-40 cars in our front yard alone. I don't know if it's at all related or not but last night (the night before this happened) around 3:30 in the morning, our dog who sleeps on her bed in the living room, came into our bedroom and alerted to something in the living room or at the front door.  This is out of character for her.  Just as she woke me, I heard a very slight sound but I could not pinpoint the sound.  It seemed to resonate throughout the house.  It was a very slight but deep sound.  You could liken it to a (Wah-Wah-Wah-wah) sound.  I could feel this sound just as much as I could hear it and I can't explain it better than that.  It lasted for just as long as it took me to walk the few feet from our bedroom to the living room.  Then it was just gone.  It just immediately stopped.   I have a really tough time falling asleep last night.  The dog acted as if there was someone at the door and I felt like there was too but our motion sensor lights weren't on and I saw no one.  I felt the weird need to sleep in my f! our year olds bed with him at that point.  At this point, my healthy ((xx-years)) old dog would not leave my side.   Suddenly, my dog collapsed onto the floor and laid there with her eyes open but not blinking.  She would not respond to my voice or my touch.  She would not even respond to my commands.  This scared me.  About two or three minutes later she came to again and acted totally normal again.  It seemed as if she had been drugged but of course she had not. I am a college educated ((deleted)). I also hold a degree in ((deleted)).  I do believe that we are not the only intelligent life out there.  However, like most people I have never encountered anything personally that would give me that absolute undeniable truth.  I'm not going to say that this experience is that undeniable truth.   To be quite honest, I don't and I can't know what this was that we saw but it is a very strange experience and it happened just as I have told you.

It was early in the morning (~9:15am) so the sun was not high up in the sky (just above Lake Ontario).  I then noticed that the sun was to my left and another bright light was to the right.  My first thought was it was a reflection of some sort from the sun bouncing off the clouds, but it was just very unusual how it only reflected off of one spot. I thought to myself this was beautiful and decided to take a photo with my cell phone camera (while driving).  As I started taking pictures and getting closer to the lights I realized this was some sort of phenomena.  I then had to turn right (westbound) onto Wentworth and decided to pull over and get a still shot.  I rolled down the window and took a clear shot of the lights then I zoomed in a little closer and took a couple more shots. Then within a matter of less than a minute the light started to fading or slowly disappearing. The light now turned into a small beautiful rainbow as the cloud disappeared and then eventually the rainbow also disappeared. I did not think anything of what I saw as a mystery, but just beauty. When I got to my office I downloaded the photos to do a review then to my surprise I now am noticing an orange dot in some of the photos.  I did not see this with my eyes while observing the bright light.  It seemed to have been moving and one shot shows the dot very near to the bright light.

The light was high in the air but lower than the outermost atmosphere.  It was not a star. It was moving, though too slowly to be a rocket or a plane.  As I was trying to figure out what it was, a jet coming from the south flew by the light so quickly that I thought for a split second that the light had fired a rocket.  It was a jet though, as I could tell from the condensation trail. It appeared to be some aircraft running reconnaissance on the unidentified light in the sky.  That means it was low enough for manned aircraft to pay attention to it.  I went back to my house after walking my dog as the night sky grew darker.  As I got closer to my front door, I realized the light was traveling in a northerly direction from the south.  It ended up in a position southwest of my house, and my neighbor drove up as he came home from work. I told him to look at the light in sky and tell me if I am seein! g things. He asked the same question I did, ""what is that?""  We both looked at it for several minutes then went indoors.  I texted my other neighbor and told him to look outside to see if he could tell me what he saw.  He and his wife both saw the light and remarked on how strange it was. It was there for an hour or more.  I left to go inside and was unable to track it any longer. When I had a free chance I went outside again to see if it was still there, but it was gone.

I was in the backyard where we have full view of high skies and much flight activity as close to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and Air Force Bases. I was standing and an enormous and brilliantly white in color light caught my eye as the it seemed to literally fall from the sky and quick over the house and neighborhood and then to the ground. It came from what appeared to be the North and East direction (saw as quick came over roof of home) and the immense and very intense bright white light dropped in the just near South and just East or possibly just Southerly direction.  The area where it flew over seemed to be almost right above the front of our home and heading rapidly towards the ground and South Mountain part.  The bright light was very intense and large and ""appeared"" too close to be real.  We did NOT hear any explosion or landing noise.  We did, for the very first time we've lived here, hear dogs HOWLING. It was so large that clearly others have seen and will report.  I had thought to call 911 but thought I could not really tell them what it was or where it landed. I have seen meteor shower and stars falling.  They burn out quickly and don't appear to ever be lower than the very busy aircraft that are constantly in the air.  The Airport closest is about 10 miles due East and we see departures and arriving flights around the clock, along with military craft performing maneuvers and plenty of high altitude large craft mostly coming from the West or likely California and passing far above the local traffic.  This was in a fairly spherical shape but the light was SO BRIGHT and SO WHITE that it seemed like it may have been very large-nothing I have ever seen in 40 years.  I've never reported anything like this, never have seen anything like this and hope that you and others can locate where this landed and hopefully it didn't land or crash in a populated area.  It's too early online to see comments from NEWS, etc.  But MANY private and commercial craft were in the air at this time.  This was far below even where helicopters fly.  Thanks for listening.

I noticed the extra bright spot that I see in the sky every single night, but tonight with the frigid, clear conditions, you could see a distinct diamond shape that was blinking green, yellow and blue. Around 3:00 am I went outside alone.  The object was on the other side of the sky, and when focusing on the object I noticed not only that it was blinking green, yellow and blue but that it seemed to be bobbing up and down.  While staring at this object, I noticed another, smaller and less distinct light that seemed to be traveling and closing the gap between itself and the large, bright object.  While I was watching, the larger object seemed to flash orange and both objects ceased all movement. I went back inside and returned about an hour later, knowing that the objects would be gone. The only apparent object in the sky was the one that I normally see in its usual spot, so the large and bright object was back where I normally see it, but much less brighter than in the previous hour. It was still brighter than any star near it, and it continued to bob, though not as much as before.The second, smaller object was no where to be seen.

Like it would have been on a curved object the sky around the lights was dark, I started to pull over but the traffic was coming up behind us and my husband said no, don't pull over.  We sat with the traffic behind us and stared.  The light on the far right went out and another appeared or came off of the one next to it a little closer and then another appeared where the one on the far right was.  Then the one that appeared closer to the second one on the right disappeared. It reminded me of the lights one goes off then the next one goes on etc.  We watched for at least 20-30 seconds while stopped, the lig! hts on the far left stayed lit.   Then all at once nothing.  Just like nothing was ever there all at the same time gone. Just blinked out.  These lights were not moving and they did appear to be in a formation very evenly spaced.  They were over a farm field not very high in the sky and very close.  I am no good at trying to determine distance. If these lights were on something it was big. 1/2 the size to the size of a football field big.  They were NOT high in the sky like you would see a star.  I am still trying to wrap my head around this.  I got a very severe headache during and after this.  When we got home we went to our windows to see if there was anything there that we could see.  We do not live far from where the lights were and would have been able to see them from our windows.  I got ill and had to go to bed.  Had a very uneasy sick feeling all night.

Can't rely on that though. I could go out there and show someone.  Sorry!  I also took pictures of something in Nov that I did not see when I took the pic.

These were now further out in the sky above the ocean and appeared smaller because the distance had increased. Last sighting was about 5 minutes later with just 2 red-orange orbs appearing horizontal again then disappearing. All four sightings were very linear in arrangement and precise in the lights.  There were no tails of light as comets or flares produce.  The lights were a definite red-orange that simply turned on and off in a very distinct fashion.

I was about two as I was potty trained but still wore a diaper at night.  I don’t know the exact month or time.   Every night my friend and neighbor, ""C,"" would scream bloody murder, as she was afraid of the dark.  Her mother was Asian so her parenting style was to let her cry it out.  Her screaming however scared me.  I could not sleep until she stopped screaming.    One night a thin man with black hair appeared at my crib.  ""C"" was still screaming.  He told me not to be afraid.  He asked me if I wanted to go for a walk.  He was talking to me but his mouth was not moving.  I pointed to my shoes.  I told him that I didn't know how to tie them.  His face was expressionless.  He said that it was okay and that he would carry me.   He held me and we were in a field.  But it wasn't the pineapple plantation across the road.  I don’t know how we left my room.  His black hair reminded me of my father, so I told him that I loved him.  He told me that I did not know him.  So, I asked him his name.   I can’t remember it, but I remember it was too long for me to say as a child.   From the field we went inside a room.  I don’t know how we got into it.  It seemed small and round shaped inside.  He put me down and said he had to work.  I told him I could clean as I liked to clean the tub.  He asked me not to touch anything.   He spoke to another who told him that he should bring me back.  I told him that my diaper was wet and asked him to change it.  He told me that he better bring me back.   When back in my room, he told me not to tell anyone or he couldn't come get me anymore when the girl screamed.  I was having trouble opening the door, so he opened it for me.   I wanted to be with my family.  My father, mother and sister were playing a game.  My father wanted to know how I got out of my room so I told him that a man let me out.  My father asked me if the man was black.  I thought that he meant, did he have black hair, as I had never seen an African American male before.  I said yes.  He searched my room including the closet.  He checked the window/s and it was locked.  I could tell my dad was upset because I remember he was sweating.  He told my mom that it must have been someone from the barracks but he didn't know how they got out with the window locked.   My father asked if he hurt me and I told him, “No.”  My father reminded me of the importance of telling the truth.  I told him again that the man was there.  The next night when ""C"" screamed, the man did not come for me.  I remember standing and waiting until ""C"" stopped screaming, but I saw no one.

I moved back into my parents house in SW Bakersfield because my boyfriend's (at the time) mother did not like me, and living in a tiny back house with them was horrible.   On a summer night in 2008, my boyfriend called me at around 2:30 am crying and asking me to please pick him up because his mother was kicking him out of the house, again.  I told him I would be right there.  I was not asleep, nor was I sleepy.  I am usually awake until 3-4 am any ways (I am a nocturnal person).   I parked my car in the next alley, ran to their alley, and crept to their window to spy.  I saw nothing, but could hear them loud and clear arguing, again.  I noticed my boyfriend's sister's car parked there, and I hated her, so I let the air out of her rear tires.  I got bored waiting for them to finish arguing, so I out of the alley, and around to the front house.  I stood on the very right side of the front chain link fence, and I could kind of see through to the back yard's back house's tiny kitchen window.  I got frustrated that I was not able to successfully spy.  So I got off the fence and, in boredom, looked up at the night sky.  And I saw a UFO floating perfectly in the sky!  It wasn't too close and not at all far away.  It was about the altitude that a police helicopter would be at if it were searching for a suspect, that should give you an idea.  The UFO was metallic silver, shaped like a disc but it had a flat bottom.  There were no windows, lines, bolts, it was clean. I saw it immediately, and I remember saying ""OOh myy GOD!""  And it turned on: two red lights appeared on the tail, and a giant flash appeared in front of it, and the UFO immediately went through the flash at the speed of light.  All that was left was two red lines of disappearing light left over from the speed.   They faded away, and I was in shock for maybe several seconds, and I started freaking out, in a good way, jumping and running around yelling ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!"" And I looked around to see if anyone else was around to see it.  No one was.  I looked at my cell phone and it was 3:15 am, and no one else saw it because everyone was asleep. I will never forget it. Later on, maybe a year later, two other people and I saw 4 UFOS.  I will submit another report for that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I dropped the truck tailgate down and sat on it looking westward enjoying the quiet clear night before heading inside for good. I was just basically staring straight ahead across the road over miles of vacant land and not up into the sky.  Not too long a time went by when I spotted an object moving toward me from a mile or so away.  It was traveling parallel to the ground and not more than a few hundred feet above the ground.  It got larger, naturally, as it came closer to me.  (It did not change size. It was just getting nearer and nearer.)  I hopped down off the tailgate and stood watching it get closer and closer.  I was definitely not expecting to see what I saw. This object was clear like crystal glass and spherical.  It looked like a crystalline golf ball in that its entire surface had concave circular “divets“all over it just like a golf ball.  I could see inside a black structure spanning about the center third of the sphere. The top of this black structure was probably a bit more than half the internal height of the sphere. Below the black structure was a brown structure that touched the black structure and was the same width.  It is hard to estimate the size of the sphere.  This was no star pinprick of a light in the sky.  This was probably a minimum of twenty feet in diameter and just a few hundred feet above me. I slowly raised my head up as it passed and turned my body around to follow it towards the city of Phoenix.  This sphere made not a bit of noise, and it did not cause any air turbulence.   There was no harsh or bright light emanating from it.  The inside was illuminated, (that is how I saw the black and brown structures) but no bright spot that would indicate the source of light was evident.  The outside had like a hazy light around the sphere. No separate exterior light(s), but light that must have passed from inside the crystal sphere to the outside.  It was like the haze you see around a street light at night. My eyes followed it until I could see it not more.  I ran inside and turned on the radio…no news flash, etc.  My husband was watching  tv, and there was nothing on the tv about the object. I never heard anything about it. I have looked on the internet concerning spherical ufos and have found nothing similar to what I saw.  I came across this site tonight, hesitated, but then thought maybe someone else did see it  or one like it and hadn’t responded either. It was real, and makes me wonder what our government really has knowledge/ability to do.  I know what I saw, and there will never be an denying it. I am 67 now and saw this when about 32 years old.  I was a school teacher at the time and just retired two years ago from 25 years of teaching mainly science at a Texas junior high/middle school.

They moved at the same rate of speed and in the same direction, while they disappeared at varying spots across the sky.   During this time I noted we could see the stars clearly in the sky, an airplane traveling from the South East to North West through and passed the red lights.  The interesting part was the red lights never blinked like the lights on the airplane and we noted that while the airplane was moving away from us we could still see it in the distance while the red lights completely disappeared at various points of the sky.  I did try to take a picture of the lights – un! successfully – the lights did not show up on my I-phone and subsequently did not show up on the pictures I took.  I suspect the lights were too small and too far away.  I am not sure if this is an actual UFO siting but thought it to be rather interesting and unusual experience for me and my friend.   There were two other people watching as the red lights cross the sky and multiple walkers in the park noticing the lights as we watched.

While following it down a long straight connecting road to the next town; now in Dracut MA, I noticed my radio went to static as I got close to it.  At this point I was close enough to see it looked like a very thin cross shape with an orange/amber colored light in the middle.  Once I got that close it would speed up andove to the other side of the street.  Always stayed at the tree line. The closest I got to it looked like the curved disk shape became more prominent and thought I could make out two faint smaller green lights on either side of the middle orange one.  It got faster and finally sped up so much I had to let it go, didn't want to speed.  Seems like it was heading back toward the direction of the next closes river.

The incident I’m reporting occured at approximately 11:28 pm, Westlake, Ohio, May 10, 2014. I noticed outside of my window an orange/red circular light approaching, traveling at 30 degrees NE (heading towards Lake Erie, which is about 3 miles from here) somewhat low on the horizon.  It caught my eye because this is not a typical path for planes or other aircraft, plus it was relatively bright. The light had flashing that was uncharacteristic of a plane (growing bright and brighter, then dimming) and at some moments the light would go dark. My husband and I went outside to get a better look, and suddenly the light (or craft) vanished for about 2 to 3 seconds.  The light reappeared, then we noticed what I can only describe as a small ball of light “falling” off the bigger one, for about one second.  This smaller light was also orange/red and left a slight trail.  After this, again, NO lights at all for about one second.  We lost sight of anything, then suddenly we saw what appeared to be an unlit craft.  It seemed as if, in order, the light was turned off, the craft went invisible, then appeared but was a translucent/opaque whitish colored oval.  It was almost directly overhead at this point, and lower than the altitude of what a plane would be, but definitely higher than the altitude at which a helicopter would travel.  The shape seemed to be an oblong, oval shape that sort of tapered at the front.  My husband describes it as an obscure oval.  It’s hard to estimate how large it was, but if we were able to determine ! a shape, then that alone should give an idea that it was fairly big.  There was absolutely NO noise associated with it, so I can say with certainty this was NOT an airplane or copter.  At the altitude it was traveling, we would have heard engine noise for sure.  I’m not a good judge of speed, but it seemed to be traveling somewhat faster than a commercial plane. At this point it went over my building and I attempted track it by running outside (I’m on the third floor so this took time) but by then, whatever we saw was gone.  Neither my husband nor myself have ever seen any unidentifiable aircraft before.   I am an occasional night skywatcher and I know space weather when I see it, and what we saw was not anything like meteorites or typical space weather at all.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,41.4553,-81.9179

As I approached the post, I noticed strange lights rising out of the southwestern sky climbing at a rapid rate and seemingly in trail of each other. At first glance, I thought I was seeing the Idaho Air National Guard A-10's getting a little night currency.  A few seconds later I realized that they were not A-10's, and thought perhaps they might be guard helicopters?  After studying the phenomenon for a few more seconds, I concluded that the lights were not consistent in appearance or in movement of any kind of aircraft that I was familiar with.  They seemed to rise out of the southwest sky in trail formation at 3 to 5 second intervals appearing as round, reddish orange, balls of light with tiny black rectangles in their centers. The first one that got my attention was soon followed by a 2nd ,3rd, and 4th.  Their movement progressed from my right to my left rising to about 4000 AGL and estimated to be about 4 to 5 miles south of me.  As I realized more were coming, I shouted to my wife to run and see what was going on.  She immediately confirmed what I was seeing and I dashed back into the house to collect my camera.  In my excitement, fumbling with the settings, I cranked off several seconds of video and a few still photos all of poor quality before they finally disappeared.  In all, I estimate  12 to 14 objects appeared over about an 8 minute period with irregular intervals of longer duration towards the end of the sighting. The lights reached their apex to the southeast of me and as the lights faded, the black objects in their centers appeared to tumble away in the diminishing light.  I asked my wife to go in and call the media but she was reluctant to do so.  We had been having rain showers prior to the incident and during the sightings I could hear sirens in the distance which were picked up on the video.  We decided to go back to our TV program and wait for the 10 o’clock news expecting that hundreds of people would be reporting the sightings.  Astonishingly, nothing appeared on the TV news or in the newspapers that evening or the days following. A few days later I sent an email to friends and family describing what I saw and attached a few photos captured out of my very shaky video.  All had opinioned explanations of what they might have been like .... flares, fireworks or the like,  none of which matched the criterion of the scenario I observed.  It is not likely that flares or fireworks would rise out of the horizon, travel over several miles across a populated city and not draw somebody's  attention .

As we got to the end of the building there to the South was ‘Mars’, and we looked at it and then at the ‘Bright Light’, that looked like a Star,,,, we all walked out to the clearing on the top of the mountain and was looking at this ‘Light’, and all of a sudden it went Vertically UP… not far from what one would estimate in ‘height’ but then I got the distinct feeling it was coming right at us…..”I yelled to my Son and his wife “get back to the apartment quick”, my son said as he was running he was going to get his camera and being 6’3” 195 of solid muscle ran quickly to his pick-up and grabbed his camera and ran to the apartment door where his wife and I were (there was a little cover built over the doorway),,,  My son looked up and tried to use his camera (which he used every day for work but it would not work) as we all looked up “There was this Beautiful Object just above the tree tops that had the most Amazing Lights I had ever seen in my life”, I kept saying…. “Wow,,,, look at those lights, they are beautiful”, and my daughter-in-law wanted to run out under the object and I held her back and told her “NO…. You can’t go out there, haven’t you seen the movie “Fire in the Sky”????  She said NO, and even though I didn’t know what we were looking at….

We ran to the other end of the building and could find no trace of where it had gone….. I told my daughter about it the next day and she told me she was listening to CNN that morning and a couple reported seeing a ‘bright object that looked like a star in the sky that same night we did and it came towards them as well’…. I tried to contact CNN to get information about the couple but never got a response. This really did happen and after we went inside, my son stated that “we just saw a UFO”, it was like we were mesmerized when it was above us, but we lost no ‘time’ in this encounter and none of us have had nightmares or dreams that have frightened us so I do not believe there was any encounter with whoever was in the object.

It was June of 1965, and I was just out of High School and on my way on a bus to Sonoma California Security Base for high (above top secret) Naval Security training.  It was a clear day as the bus rolled through the rolling hills of Central California.  I glanced through the right side window where I sat to admire the golden California countryside.  I saw hovering over the mountains in the distance a huge object.  I assumed it was a dirigible the Navy used to use during the Second World War to observe the ocean front property where they kept an eye open for enemy subs and such.  Then I realized it had been keeping up with the bus for over an hour.  The mountains in the distance were high, but this cigar shaped thing dwarfed the mountains it hovered over.  I knew then and there it was a different kind of craft than a dirigible because I had studied the history of dirigibles and knew they could not move that fast.  I also realized that dirigibles were not as big as this thing was.  Keeping in mind that I was in Central California where things look closer than they really are, it had to be longer than fourteen football fields, it was huge, far longer than any conventional dirigibles being used at the time, or at any other time in military history.   I was on my way to a secret Naval Security Base with a Top Secret Clearance, so there was no way I was going to report the incident or I would have been chipping paint on a submarine for the rest of my Naval career.  I was trained as a Communications Tech and knew how to spot unusual objects in the sky (because that was my job), and spent years on a ship (in plotting) during the Viet Nam era, where I used all available equipment to track and plot each aircraft over and off Viet Nam soil.  I had pics but we were never allowed to keep a private camera (because of what we saw daily).  The only pics I had were OKd by the training head of Naval Security in our sector, which I do not want to mention.   Wish I had hidden a few, they were something to see.   I attest to this fact, and to other sightings during various conflict actions during the years 1966 and 1968 in and around the Viet Nam conflict.  The cigar shaped one was only the first, many more followed.  I guess this happened because my job in the military always had to do with Top Secret Operations, and I’m sure they (whoever they are) kept an open eye on everything we did. One time I swear someone (or something) saved our guys on four River Gun Boats (three man crews) when they did their best to hold five North Vietnam Junks full of guns and explosives until the sun came up so they could check them for illegal weapons and such and to take prisoners.  I was on duty on the Bridge with my Flak Jacket and Helmet when suddenly all hell broke loose.  The Junks all began to fire at the River Boats (at me too).  The River Boat crews held their own as best they could, but I saw several of the crew hit badly during the fight.   All of the sudden four of the five Junks were blown out of the water by some unseen friend overhead. They just exploded into oblivion, no residual left.  I saw only one flash, what looked like a lightning strike, hit a Junk and it exploded.  I hit the deck when bullets started hitting all around my head.  The last Junk gave up quickly, and our ship took credit for the save.  I saw it, I know we did not do it, but since truth is stranger than fiction so I left it at that.   Thank you friends whoever you were.  You saved our guys. But all I have to offer is my word, no pics.  Please do not ever mention my name over the air because I am still bound by my Top Secret Clearance (for life) and could be in lots of do-do. We can just refer to me as Henry B.

UFO Combat Contact  Date: October 15th 2009 @ 0300 in the morning.  Location: Al-Iskandariyah, Iraq  Brief background of me at time of incident: I was a 11B (Infantry) RTO (Radio Transmitter Operator)  Description of event:  The night started out as a basic patrol from FOB (Forward Operating Base) Chosen. The base was located at the Al-Iskandariyah power station.  Everything went as normal when our convoy came under attack from insurgent forces.  As the RTO of the convoy, I was directing communication from the convoy to the base. The attack happened at the government housing that we called “The projects.”  The housing was setup as multi-level apartment complexes surrounded on all sides by farmland with the road going up the eastern side of the complex.  Power was scarce in the area so there was no electricity at night. 	The encounter happened about 15 minutes into the firefight.  I was standing by the driver door of the HMMWV (Military Vehicle, similar to a civilian Hummer H1) coordinating the attack and directing support with the Lieutenant. Facing west, the UFO just appeared out of nowhere.  I was looking directly at the craft when it appeared.  The craft was dead silent, had a dark hull, non-reflective, appeared cigar shaped from my angle, and had a series of blue lights on the bottom and top.  The craft was about 100 meters away from us and about 150 meters off the ground.  The craft was dead still and had no sway or movement at all. 	About 30 seconds after it appeared, the (Singars) Radio’s in the HMMWV immediately started to emit a steady tone.  Our vehicle was equipped with 3 radio’s (One for platoon, one for battalion, and one for aviation.)  Two of the radios where on VHF Frequencies and one was on a UHF Frequency.  All three radio’s started to emit a stead tone on all three radios at the same time.  Our handheld radios (MBTTR Radio) also emitted the same tone.  As I switched to the different channels, every single Freq was jammed with the same tone. 	The fire fight immediately stopped and a single shot was not fired by either us or the insurgents.  At the same time our communications were jammed, the electronics on the ITAS TOW Missile system went off line rendering the missile launcher and optics useless.  The craft stayed there motionless for about what I guess was 2 minutes when we heard 3 loud booms coming from our base.  After the booms, the craft immediately disappeared and all communications were restored. 	At FOB Chosen, the TOC (Tactical Operation Center) was monitoring our contact when they too witnessed the craft appear (as the base was only about 700 meters away from the craft).  Later when we returned to base, they told us to that they heard the same tone, not only from the VHF and UHF radio’, but also the tactical satellite radios.  At the same times, all the computers in the TOC went off line and became unresponsive. 	At the same time, our base had three 105mm howitzer artillery cannons loaded and on standby for our contact in case we needed them.  When the craft appeared, they lost all communications with everyone and their targeting computers went off-line.  The Staff sergeant in charge of the firing line, unable to get orders from the TOC, immediately identified the craft as the cause of the blackout and considered it hostile.  Without the targeting computers and no time to do calculation manually for the trajectory, he ordered the cannons to direct lay (Essentially pointing the cannons straight at the target, instead of lobbing the rounds) toward the craft and ordered a 3 round volley to be fired.  After the cannons fired, the craft disappeared. When we returned to base for the AAR (After Action Review), no one could explain what we all saw.  After the artillery fired and neither us in the field or the artillery line saw any explosions on the craft, we assumed that the rounds missed the target all together.  There was an immediate concern about the rounds because after figuring out the trajectory of the artillery rounds, we saw the point of impact was in the middle of the city of Al-Iskandariyah and the concern for civilian loss of life and collateral damage immediately became priority.  We had an AH-1 Cobra on station and gave the pilot the grid coordinates of where the rounds should have landed so he could identify the point of impact and give us an accurate grid and battle damage assessment.  The pilot flew in a straight line from the cannons in the direction that the rounds were fired.  The pilot came across the radio and reported that there were no impact craters within a 1000 meter radius of the calculated poi! nt of impact and no appearance of any disturbance. 	The next morning we were dispatched to the area we thought the rounds landed to ask around if anyone heard where the rounds landed and no one reported hearing anything at all and the local clinics reported no one being admitted with any shrapnel wounds or no new deaths.  We have no idea what that craft was and even more, we never figured out what happened to the 3 artillery rounds that were fired.  A direct lay shot to a static target 700 meters away should have been an easy direct hit, but there were no traces.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,,

Occurred:  6/30/1952     21:00.       I was living at XXXX SW 51st Court, Miami, Fl. I was going to sleep at night and I was 8 years old.  As I was saying my prayers with my eyes closed, lying in bed I felt like someone was watching me outside of my bedroom window.  I opened my eyes and saw a light staring down at me from up in the air like a helicopter about 300 feet away. I felt like my thoughts were being probed.  I think they could feel I was scared and they mirrored back my feelings.  I hid under the covers on my bed and then I became like I was frozen stiff and unable to move. They took me out of my bed holding my wrists, were leading me down the hallway.  I screamed for my dad. Telepathically they told me that he couldn't hear me.  I think everyone on my block was like under ether or something.  I don’t remember going up into the saucer. The saucer was round with a see through dome from the inside out, night or day. I could draw great pictures of UFO’s in school.  My parents blew off my story after I said , “I saw a saucer last night”.  My mom said on the way to the kitchen, “Gee I thought I locked the door last night”, it was open in the morning.  I can remember all conversation and think precisely when I get an adrenalin rush. As they flew me to the mother ship, I remember vividly sitting down in the middle of the ship with the dome window behind them and I was afraid to let them think that I could see them as they stared at me.  I pretended not being able to see them. There was one alien that wanted to Communicate, maybe the navigator, the other two were standing in back of him, and they just watched and never tried to communicate ever.  We went to a larger ship. I remembered the docking port.  How we docked and the dome part of the saucer had a bottom rim that fit into the docking port and became attached to the ship, and as I was going aboard getting on board I remember the mesh floor and a small box next to the bulkhead, and the round top of the saucer fitting into the hole under the mother ship had lifted up.  I remember how big the ship was inside because it appeared small and was large inside. He told me when the tests started and over and over telepathically that it all would be over soon so just wait a little bit longer. Most of the things that happened above I could not remember at first but was reminded by other things as I lived my rest of my life. I saw one recognizable abductee that was very familiar on TV years later and she was complaining about her experience of being used during the abduction. They let me see the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from New Orleans to Tampa.  I remember the color of light aboard the ship as the sun was coming up, They showed me a ray gun.  The end of it had a shape similar to a filament that hangs electric wires from telephone poles.  Because of their telepathy they can feel things that their body never feels through your experiences.  Maybe they try to get some of our features to benefit themselves. I was on their ship more than once, because of my scoop marks. I even saw a hooded figure that scarred me standing next to a cement slab.  They told me how many kids I would have. I saw a projection of my wife years before I got married. I believe aliens look a little oriental. They will step in to our world if they think we are going to destroy our world. It is like controlling the bad fish in a fish bowl from breaking the fish bowl. All that happened when I was 8 years old in the UFO flap of 1952.  The UFOs flew over President Truman’s White House and were as were seen flying up the east coast as reported by Eastern Airlines pilots, on route to the north from Florida. When my parents moved houses in Miami they moved in back of Norman Beans house, a MUFON original board member.  Coincidence or not, you be the judge. When I get reminded of more I will add more.

Sighting #1:  It was June of 1965 and I was just out of High School and on my way on a bus to Sonoma California Security Base for high (above top secret) Naval Security training (Skaggs Island Naval Security Base, Sonoma, CA). It was a clear day as the bus rolled through the rolling hills of Central California. I glanced through the right side window where I sat to admire the golden California countryside. I saw hovering over the mountains in the distance a huge object. I assumed it was a dirigible the Navy used to use during the Second World War to observe the ocean front property where they kept an eye open for enemy subs and such. Then I realized it had been keeping up with the bus for over an hour. The mountains in the distance were high, but this cigar shaped thing dwarfed the mountains it hovered over. I knew then and there it was a different kind of craft than a dirigible because I had studied the history of dirigibles because I was trying to design a rescue vehicle using that tech! nology. I knew dirigibles could not move that fast and also realized that dirigibles were not as big as this thing was. Keeping in mind that I was in Central California where things look closer than they really are, it had to be longer than fourteen football fields, it was huge, far longer than any conventional dirigibles being used at the time, or at any other time in military history. I was on my way to a secret Naval Security Base with a Top Secret Clearance, so there was no way I was going to report the incident or I would have been chipping paint on the outside of a submarine for the rest of my Naval career. I was trained as a Communications Tech and knew how to spot unusual objects in the sky (because that was my job). The cigar shaped one was only the first, many more followed. I guess this happened because my job in the military always had to do with Top Secret Operations, and I’m sure they (whoever they are) kept an open eye on everything we did.  I attest to this as fact and to other sightings during the years of my service in the Navy from 1965 to 1972.

Sighting #2:  I spent years on a ship (in plotting) during the Viet Nam era (1966 to 1968), where I used all available equipment to track and plot each aircraft over and off Viet Nam soil. This sighting was in 1966, not sure what month. One time I swear someone (or something) saved our guys on four River Gun Boats (three man crews) when around 0300 they did their best to hold five North Vietnam Junks full of guns and explosives until the sun came up so they could check them for weapons and such and to also take prisoners.  I was on duty on the Bridge with my Flak Jacket and Helmet when suddenly just before the sun came up all hell broke loose.  The Junks all began to fire at the River Boats (at me too).  The River Boat crews held their own as best they could, but I saw several of the crew hit badly during the fire fight.   All of the sudden four of the five Junks were blown out of the water by some unseen friend overhead.  They just exploded into oblivion, no residual left.  I saw only one flash, what looked like a lightning bolt, hit a Junk and it exploded.  I hit the deck when bullets from the junks started hitting all around my head.  The last Junk gave up quickly, and our ship took credit for the save.  I saw it!  I know we did not do it, but since truth is stranger than fiction I left it at that.  Thank you friends whoever you were.  You saved our guys. Unfortunately, all I have to offer is my word, no pics. I had pics, though not of the unseen craft that fired on the Junks.  I took pics because that was part of my job to document the firing activity of our ship, but we were never allowed to keep a private camera (because of what we saw daily with the Russians).  The only pics I had were OKd by the raining head of Naval Security Headquarters at ComSecGruAct West Pacific Station, Yokosuka, Japan.  Wish I had hidden a few rolls, they were something to see. I attest to this as fact, and to other sightings during various conflict actions during the years 1966 and 1968 in and around the Viet Nam conflict area when I served aboard a U.S. Naval vessel.  When on duty in Plotting I saw numerous blips on my screens that we all knew were not our aircraft and had no idea who’s they were.  I assume some of these blips were our unseen friends who saved our guys.  I know there are other military personnel who can also attest to such happenings during this same period because being Naval Security I heard the stories.  I hope they have the courage to come forward as I just have and risk being humiliation. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minede.

The color was like looking at a light shining through the skin between your fingers. It moved at a steady pace across the top of the trees.  The color did not change and there were no changes or movement, just a round ball moving across the sky.

But, I have not been able to locate this information.  I do know that I was around twelve or thirteen years old.  This would make it 1967 or 68. It was chilly but not cold.  So, it was probably either spring or fall.  The house was on Mt. Carmel Church Rd, about a fourth of a mile off Hwy 14 (now loop).  This is half way between Reidsville and Eden NC.

At the time, I was 22 years old and working three jobs; rec-room manager under a local restaurant, psychiatric assistant at the county in-patient facility, and deputy sheriff. All three jobs were in Lancaster, the county seat, but I lived about 18 miles southwest of there in Cassville.  Since I was a Grant County Deputy, I was able to do ride-along shifts with the Cassville Police officers.  Sometimes I rode in uniform and sometimes not, but I always carried my badge and revolver.  These officers worked alone and were glad of the company and, occasionally, were happy to have backup on calls. On this particular evening, I was rushed to get into the squad car by the officer yelling at me as I left the door of the house.  He said I should hurry to get a listen to what was happening on the police-band radio.  After we took off, he filled me in. It seems several sheriff deputies and local municipal police officers were at a farm about 15 miles due north of us, near Mount Hope.  They had been there since the afternoon. Word had gotten out on the county dispatch frequency that a UFO was hovering in the farmer's field, just a few feet off the ground.  The farmer thought maybe it was having some kind of problems and had been watching it for some time before he thought to call the Sheriff's Office.  He had not seen any crew members, just the craft hovering there.  The SO sent a road deputy to investigate and soon sent the county narcotics sergeant out there, too.  Not because there were any drugs involved, but because he had a lot of expensive, Federally funded, photographi! c equipment and knew how to use it. Later, officers from other communities in the surrounding area, Prairie du Chien, Bloomington, and Fennimore, went to the farm out of curiosity.  We radioed county dispatch and asked permission to go, too, but were told we were the only car in the west half of the county that wasn't there, so, we had better stay where we were. Around 22:00, when it was good and dark, the two of us were sitting on a road atop the river bluffs, so we could hear the radio calls from the repeater tower in the farm area. Radio traffic was light until one of the officers shouted into his mic, “Hey! Is it moving?! Hey! It is! It's going up!”  Other officers chimed in, affirming that the UFO was slowly rising from where it had been hovering. Then, another officer added, “There it goes!”  Still another officer wanted to know, “What direction is that?”  Someone answered him, “Straight south.”   There we were, sitting 'straight south' of that farm.  I was sitting in the front passenger seat and in the silence, turned away from the radio lights to look, absentmindedly, out my window.  I startled at what, at first, looked like bright, red eyes staring back at me.  Only to realize what I was looking at were the aircraft warning lights, halfway up the cable-TV tower about 300 yards away. I turned back, with a big smile on my face, and started to tell the other officer what a fool I had just been.  At that instant, the entire squad car was bathed in the brightest, white light I had ever seen.  It appeared to emanate from directly overhead. We both sat there, mouths hanging open, in disbelief.  After what seemed like 8-10 seconds, the light went out. We still sat there, wordless.  Then, I said, “Tell, me what you saw!”  He said, “The brightest light I ever saw!”  Neither of us heard anything outside the vehicle, either coming or going.  There was nothing in the sky that we could see.  I had the overwhelming feeling of a need to be back among people and he had no arguments.  We got down off the river bluff and back into town as quickly as possible. I'd estimate, from hearing “Straight south” to being bathed in light was only about seven or eight seconds.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,42.7379,-90.9354

I saw lights far away behind me which slowly gained on my while I traveled along at about 80 mph.   Over the next 20-25 min these lights slowly grew larger and more clear till they finally resolved into three seperate yellow lights of very high intensity.  I'd been driving for about 5 hours by this time so I pulled off onto the shoulder for a rest.  As I said, I'd been going about 80 mph and the lights had steadily gained on me but when I pulled over, they slowed down appreciably.  As I sat on the hood with a bottle of water, I was amazed to see the three lights separate into three triangular-shaped craft which cruised along in echelon at about 50' in height with about 10' of seperation both side-to-side and front-to-back.  At the nose, they were about 6' thick, top-to-bottom, and about 4' wide at the apex of the triangle.  Going back from the nose, they were flat on the bottom but angled up at about 15 degrees and along the sides, widened at about 25 degrees.  Overall they were about 40' long and at the rear, they were about 12' in eight and 15' to 18' wide.  They shone a yellow light at the nose with a red light at each rear corner.  I could seen no openings of any type though the nose did show the outline of something in the space where we'd place a windshield.  They were all an identical flat gray/black color without even much or any contrast except where a shadow might mask an area.  Unlike most of the reports I've read or heard, I could discern nothing in the way of sound, electrical effects, or anything else out of the ordinary.  After it became clear as to what they were, it took them about 15 or 18 minutes to pass fully by and pass from sight.

It was 1977, and my girlfriend and I were walking down the street in our neighborhood. I looked up while we were talking and I saw a small saucer hovering over the top of a small house.  I told her to "" Look at that"", I said ""no-one is ever going to believe us."" It couldn't have been more than 4-5 feet above the roof of the house.  These houses were very small three bedroom houses in comparison to the houses I see now.  It was pretty much exactly the same size as the roof of the house. I felt it knew I saw it and it took off towards the sky FAST up and off to the right, it made no sound at all and had two lights on the bottom, but I'm not positive what those colors were. In one blink of my eye it was so far up in the sky, in two blinks it was a dot and by the third blink it was gone.  I couldn't believe what we had seen. I wanted to go to that house and ask what had happened to them, but was too scared.  I was a teenager at the time and it was very strange that my friend and I only walked around the block to our friends and by the time we got there had forgotten it.  It took  thirty years to remember. I wonder if it could have done something to my memory.  I know without any doubt it knew when we fixed our eyes on it and took off. I have told many people in my lifetime and they all give me that ""look"" and I have to remember that just because they are my friends doesn't mean it's easy for a person to swallow.  Anyway, I feel at fifty that it would only! be fair for whatever it's worth to whoever may want to hear it and listen.  I don't know if it was from here or somewhere else, but they are there..most uncomfortable to see. I think now that I'm writing this I'm going to go back to that house and see if I'm lucky enough to find someone who lived there at that time and ask them if something happened to them that year.

They looked to be slightly bigger than the size of a star.  There was one light that moved in varying patterns in the sky.  It moved in a way that no other aircraft of ours has the capability to do.  I was mesmerized. I turned onto Interstate 89 and headed south about a mile or so.  I was watching behind me as I saw the light staying in the sky.  Then in a split second the light was right next to me in the northbound lane.  It did this two more times – staying behind a mile or two and then there it was, next to me. I turned off the interstate and turned left up a road and then into the family driveway.  When I got out of the car the triangle shape UFO was there.  It was totally silent moving slowly down toward the ground.  There was a red light in the center of the bottom of the ship that glowed outward.  My family came to the door and screamed to come in.  The ship went up and away without making any sound.  Three weeks later, the ship returned to the other side of our driveway and descended lower than the first time.  Because it was lower the triangle shape was clearer and it still had the red light in the center of the bottom of the triangle.  A relative was with me and pushed me toward the door of the house to get away from it.  The ship took off, again without a sound.  That was the last time I saw this type of ship.

As we made our way to my aunt's house my cousin and I stopped at the old railroad bridge that had LRS102 radio station's lights on it as it still does today but not working when my cousin said what's that?  I asked him what he was talking about and he pointed to an object that was directly over the Louisville, KY, skyline, he proclaimed its a UFO.  I laughed and said it's an airplane and we watched it as it approached our location on the Jeffersonville  river bank and it soon was clear that it was'nt an airplane at all. I became frightened and my cousin just yelled out beam me up scotty in which I replied to him to shut up. The object was oval shaped with multi colored lights making two rotaions two the left then two rotations to the right, it was completely silent and became more freightened then the craft came down and hovered about 20 ft above the bridge silently with no disturbance to the water below. We watched in awe and fear as it just hovered for maybe two or three minutes then it slowly acended and once it reached an altitude of about 3000ft it zoomed off into the nite sky and left us paniced and we went home excitedly telling my aunt the story who obviously didnt believe us at all. The next day I went home to louisville where I told my older  brother what happened of course he laughed at me and ridiculed me, well later that day we had been watching television when a commercial for the local news came on, the reported Jim Mitchell of WHAS 11 said tonite at 11 a Clarksville, IN man has video of a UFO, my brother looked at me with eyes and mouth agape and I proclaimed"" I told you so now do you believe me?  We asked my dad if we could please stay up to watch the news that it was important my dad thought it was odd that we would care about the news program but ok but your going to bed rite after, so my brother and I waited nervously all evening long until the news came on, we watched the whole program and it never mentioned it once. Two weeks later at around 830 pm, my dad said we need to go to Kmart to get your little brother some diapers before they close so it was my dad, step mom and two siblings in the front and I sat in the bed of the truck wearing shorts and flip flops and no shirt, my dad who was an alcoholic was drunk and drinking and driving along popular level road blasting three dog nite on the 8 track, about two blocks from the Kmart we stopped a redlight on popular level where I could see the Kmart sign all lit up. I noticed something strange, there was a warm breeze raining (down) on me and I looked at my arms and the hair was standing up on them and my neck so I looked up and there was a massive craft like the one i'd seen two weeks earlier but much larger like a mother ship and I could see intricate piping mostly squared in shape and I nearly broke my neck looking from one end to another it was as large as a football field and I began to feel sick to my stomach. I began beating on the sliding glass window of the pickup truck yelling: dad, dad but got no response he was to drunk and the horrible 70's music had drowned out my screams and I looked up again and it was gone, now surely there was multiple people that saw this thing I mean we were not alone at the stoplight and im sure someone saw me looking upwards",2014-06-04T00:00:00,38.32784732142857,-85.69607053571428

They were very high in the sky; if one horizon was three o'clock and the other horizon was nine o'clock, then these lights were now at about 11:30, nearly overhead. He said he'd been watching them for a long time and they hadn't changed formation.  They were arranged in a triangular formation, one light leading the other two, and they were just progressing across the sky.  It was hard to distinguish them from the stars on this clear night, they seemed to be just about that size and brightness.  We thought, at first, it was a plane; but then noted you could see the background stars between them as they went. The lights finally made it to directly overhead and they stopped.  They just sat in place for about half a minute.  Then, from a complete stop, they shot apart in three directions and out of sight in a brief second.  We had no idea what they were.

On or about 03:30 in the morning of Saturday, August 12, 1995, I was witness to what can only be described as a genuine UFO sighting on I-75 Noth bound, just south of Sarasota, Florida.  I say to have witnessed a UFO, not claiming it was extra terrestrial in nature, but, a flying craft that was unidentifiable.   I am former miilitary, and I will not describe the nature of my military experience other than to state that I am very familiar with most if not all known aircraft, whether civilian or military to make any identification of such vehicles with a certain degree of accuracy and confidence.   What I saw on this occasion, is entirely foreign to my experience and remains so nearly 20 years later.   On the afrementioned morning, I was driving a 1992 Ford Taurus, a vehicle kept in excellent mechanical condition, traveling on North bound I 75, on my way from Hollywood, FL, to Tampa, FL.  As I began to approach a very well lit section of the interstate, some 10-12 miles South of Sarasota, Florida, I caught sight of what I first took to be a rotary wing aircraft in distress.  At this point, the interstate is divided by only a 40 yard or less median, and the craft was above the emergency lane on the opposite side, or on the South bound side of I75.  The craft appeared as a helicopter experiencing tail rotor failure of some sort, as it was descending in a seemingly uncontrolled fashion, pitching side to side and coming down like a falling leaf.  It dropped from about 500 ft to about 150 to 100 ft above ground in this fashion when it suddenly stopped, right above a tall highway light, to shine a bright beam of yellowish white light onto an empty, older model sedan, that was parked on the southbound emergency lane of I 75.   This craft was approximately 30 to 35 ft. In length, an approx. 10 - 15 ft in height, and 10 ft + in breadth, it had no windows, no wings of any type known, and overall this craft seemed to change shape and color, with an almost fluid manner.  As I approached this scene with! my vehicle, I lowered my driver's side window to get a better look, as got immediately parallel to it, being less than 120 ft. distant from its location.  As I passed it, outside of the normal rush of air noise, the other vehicle made absolutely no sound, it was noiselessly hovering, frozen in place.  The surface if this craft seemed to have a multi faceted airframe, and was oblong shaped. The facets on the surface seemed to change planar configuration , as the edges converged with one another to constantly change its outer shape without changing its dimensions.  The craft emitted what  seemed to be intermittently dull and brighter levels of light intensity in colors that were in the off white, yellow, dull orange and almost beige range.   The craft did not appear to have any visible signs of doors, hatches, windows or ports of any sort.  As I was experiencing all this with my head half out the driver's window, I suddenly became aware that my car's engine had shut off, and I began ! to struggle against the loss of power steering.  The craft remained motionless, still shining a beam of light on the parked vehicle.  I immediately turned my attention to my car, shifted the transmission to neutral and turned the key on the ignition, my vehicle started up again instantly.   I turned to look at the craft again, it was still there, however, within a second or so, it turned off its beam of light , and began to slowly ascend in a perfectly linear and vertical attitude, some 50 - 70 ft, when it suddenly, just vanished.  I did not see it fly off in any direction, I just saw it disappear, there was no more light or movement, just empty air.    Weather conditions on this date was slight to medium,  low cloud cover with the expected high humidity for that time of year, approx. 72 F.  All this took place in a time span of less than 30 - 45 seconds, and although I did lower my speed to about 40 MPH +/-, the actual experience seemed to have taken more than a minute.  Once the craft disappeared, it did not reappear again, and I have not seen anything like it since.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,,
Triangular-shaped object witnessed by two people at close range.,Salem,MO,1991-11-10T22:15:00,triangle,3-5 minutes,"Occurred : 11/10/1991 22:15  (Entered as : 11/10/91 22:15) Reported: 5/14/2014 12:20:16 PM 12:20 Posted: 6/4/2014 Location: Salem, MO Shape: Triangle Duration:3-5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109585.html,"Triangular-shaped object witnessed by two people at close range. On November 10, 1991, my cousin and I were subject to an object that not only crossed our paths that night, but would affect both of our way of thinking for some years to come.  It was 10:15 P.M.  Central Standard Time as we were traveling east on highway H and was coming back into the town of Salem, Missouri.  We had just crossed the one- lane bridge that resides approximately 5 miles out of town on H highway, and made our way up and over the hill just ¼ of a mile past DD intersection.   Upon topping over the hill, my cousin notices what he believes is an airplane to our far left in the cattle ranchers’ field and this object is traveling south.  Upon further notice, we both realized that not only was this airplane descending, but it made absolutely NO SOUND as it made its way across the field and toward H highway in which we were traveling on.  Believing that it was an airplane, we accelerated to approximately 90 miles per hour so as to pass under the plane as it crossed the highway.  The object reached H highway before our car had the chance to pass under it or even get close to it, and much to our dismay the object came to a complete stop above H highway.  As our car came to a screeching halt, it slid up under the object and stalled out. Sitting in the middle of the highway, my cousin and I stared up at the object, still believing that it was some sort of a helicopter, when we both noticed that the object was making no sound, it was not moving, and the unknown object hovered silently not 30 to 40 feet above us.  In fear, my cousin rolled up his window and we sat silently staring up at the craft.  He turned to me and asked “what do you think it is?”  To which by this time I realized that neither of us knew the answer to his question.  The object had three circular lights on its underside that were extremely bright.  These lights formed a triangular shape and the light source did not waver in energy, in fact, the lights were so bright that the whole highway was illuminated as though it was daytime.   After sitting motionless above the highway for what I believe was approximately two or three minutes, the craft began to slowly move diagonal from its original route and hovered to a clearing in the open field that lay ! to the right of my car.  The object hovered just above the tree tops, almost brushing them as it passed over them, until it had reached an opening in the field. The object stops again and then, much to our dismay, starts to turn onto its side and then slowly lower itself to the ground.  So close to the ground in fact, that I could see the silhouette of the field grass as the light from the lower of the two back lights shined through them.  After sitting at ground level for no longer than one minute, the object slowly left our side and made its way down the forest that rested to its immediate right.  The object then leveled back out flat to the ground as it traveled and after flying about 300 yards, it ascended at a 30 degree angle.  It flew up into the night sky, never to be seen again by my cousin or myself.   After much deliberation, my cousin and I agreed that we had not experienced any lost time nor have we ever found any explanation for what we witnessed.  However, after attending a recent UFO conference an investigator told me that he has studied triangular-shaped UFOs for some time and with my experience, I had come closer to one th! an anyone that he had ever heard of.  During that same conference I spoke to a psychologist who has studied the phenomena, and he listened to my story and was surprised to find that I had not experienced any lost time.  He began to ask me a lot of questions concerning my childhood and after that evening I began to question many events in my childhood that have followed me even into my adult life.  I have had many strange events in my life, and my children seem to also be affected by some of these phenomena.   After many years of not speaking about the event, I contacted my cousin and asked him to tell me his version of the events, only to find that everything lined-up with my story except the ending where he told me that the object followed outside the car as we drove off.

Out of shock, I disregarded where I needed to go, and proceeded past Wilmington Ave to follow the object.   Out of fear as I neared Willowbrook Ave I discontinued following the object (ironically not one person was outside).  The object eventually fell out of site and appeared to land in an industrial part of Compton in a South-Easterly direction near what I would approximate to be east of Santa Fe & Alameda.

They appeared to somewhat chevron shaped, black, fixed wing aircraft about four feet wing tip to wing tip and about one to two hundred feet off the ground.  They were traveling horizontal to the ground in a north north easterly direction.  A few things were very extraordinary.  There was no sign of any propulsion system nor bulges in the thin depth of the vehicle to accommodate a propulsion system.  But, by far the most amazing thing was that two of the vehicles were unstable.  One was wobbling, but the other was tumbling completely head over heels yet neither was falling behind the other vehicles which were very stable flying straight as an arrow.  I estimate their speed at about 200 MPH.  They passed almost directly over my car so I lost s! ight of them, but a notable thing happened.

We had just sat down in the living room of my house to watch the Mike Tyson VS Lennox Lewis pay per view boxing match fight on HBO.  As we sat there talking, Mike Tyson, just put his leg over the ropes to enter the boxing match ring when an object with very bright lights facing downward. flew, glided over the top of my house at very slow speed illuminating the inside of my house through the 6, 9 foot tall 3 foot wide windows on the front of my house facing Eastward, on Bond Lake.   As I saw this bright thing through my windows moving Eastward. I jumped off of my couch slid the sliding glass doors of my house open and steeped onto my patio facing Bond Lake, as I looked up at a 45 degree angle I saw a triangular shaped object, about 10 foot above the tree tops in my yard moving East at about 2 miles per hour.  At this point this triangular object was about 65 feet from me, I could see the bottom and back of the object.  It had 3 bright lights, very, very bright pointing downward at each of the 3 points of the bottom of the triangle craft each of these 3 lights were about 4 foot in diameter and were projecting light downwards.  On the back of the craft was a very, very bright round light about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, but this light being well lit with bright light was not projecting light outward as the other 3 lights on the bottom of the craft were doing.   At this point this triangular craft was about 60 feet from my eyes moving East over my dock and boat.  My 2 friends were beside me all 3 of us staring at this triangular object, it continued to move across the lake at about 2-3 miles per hour, at about 40 feet above the water of the lake.  This vehicle came to a stop on the East side of Bond Lake, about 400 feet from my patio.  It looked as if it was sitting on the tree tops, on the East side of the lake shore the lights on the bottom of the craft were no longer visible, they went out. This craft was about ! 50 feet tall and about 80 feet wide.  At this point I ran inside my house to get a camera while my 2 friends continued to watch this craft from the patio of my house. When I came back with a camera the battery was dead and this craft was still sitting there hovering in the air making no sound at all. I ran into my house to get another battery for my handy cam camera when I returned to the balcony the craft was still there and the new battery was also dead.  I ran into my house again to get another battery for my camera, the new battery was also dead. I ran back to the patio the craft was gone, I asked my 2 friends where did it go?  They said it disappeared, I asked did it go right, left or straight up?  They said no, it just disappeared.  We watched this triangular shaped craft for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. The weather on this night was clear and warm.  I later learned that a triangular craft was seen by others on the East side of the state of Wisconsin, 1 hour after our sighting experience.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,,

It was around the age when I was about 15 years old I'm now 25.  Through the years I've found out strangely enough how common this type of craft is reported (black triangle) UFO.  Me and a friend were walking back to my house from another friend's house late at night somewhere around midnight (completely sober) and were walking through our old elementary school in Healdsburg, CA, walking thought the ""black top"" which is a large open space where we had break and lunch at the school when we were younger attending that school.  At the time of night and part of town the sounds of cars and other things are pretty much dead silent, as we were walking my friend tapped me on the shoulder, I looked at him and I saw the shock in his eyes as he pointed up to the sky.  I looked up directly above us maybe 500-1000 feet in elevation...! yes that low..was a triangle formation of red dim lights, non flashing.  One red light at each point of the triangle craft plus a couple in between each point.  Around 7-10 lights if my memory serves me right.  But we saw in between the lights pure darkness to confirm it was a solid craft to make up the triangle. It was HUGE.  We guessed at least a football field.  It was DEAD silent and flew at a speed most modern aircraft would ""stall""....now, at me and my friends age we were both big military buffs including on USAF aircraft, as I later became in my adult life and army infantryman and he a marine.  At the time we were familiar with B-2 bombers and F117s.  This thing was nothing even close to human capability. The very SECOND we seen it we didn't even question if it was human or not.  We just KNEW it was from out of this world.  But what was so strange was that it flew so low and slow over a populated area...like it was scanning or something, who knows.  Not even a experi! mental military craft would do that over such an area.  No question in our minds we saw something out of this world and none of our friends believed us after the fact.  It never bothered us but whenever me and that friend reunite time to time it's the hot topic between me and him haha.  Something we will never forget!!  I hope in my lifetime there will be a explanation for these things (alien life).... ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

To Whom it May Concern:  I am writing you to file a UFO sighting report that is long overdue. Ive always had a great interest in the UFO phenomenon but never actually had a sighting of my own.  Not one that I was 100% certain about anyway.  I really wasnt aware that MUFON had such a widespread network until recently, and I really hadnt considered how important it is for individuals to report such sightings so the data can be documented until now.   This occured sometime in the summer of 2006. Im estimating it was around August of that year.  I was at a friends house in Barnesville, Pa which is approximately an hours travel (by automobile) South of Scranton, Pa.  We actually had a small 3 piece band at the time and were practicing late at night in his home studio.  This location was ideal for late night rehersals due to the lack of any really close neighbors.  There arent any street lamps near the area, or at least at that time there werent.  So the night sky was awe inspiring.  I was always taken back when I was there at night because all the stars were so visible with no light pollution. Anyway, we decided to take a short break and I stepped outside the front door onto the porch area for a ciggarette.  I stepped out from under the roof a few steps and just as a began to look upwards I noticed a streak of light enter my perifreal vision from my left.  As I looked upward it stopped suddenly and abruptly, going from an extremely high rate of speed, to a dead stop in an instant.  It was directly overhead at an altitude I'd have to guess would be maybe 1500 -2000 feet.  At that altitude the object was slightly larger than my thumbnail held at arms length looking upward at the sky. I'd always expected, if I ever was to have a UFO sighting, to see a disc shaped craft.  Well, this was not disc shaped.  It looked more ""egg"" shaped.  Almost as if you were to take a Tylenol capsule and hold it in the air.  The division of its coloration was also the same.  The rear half was green and the front half was red.  Divided 50/50.  Both the front and rear of this object seemed to ""counter"" rotate. I got this impression because there was a dry ice like vapor lingering around the rear (greenish) part of the object as it hovered.  The entire length of time it hovered was about 3 seconds or less and seemed to ""bobble"" ever so slightly during this time.  I just had registered the thought of yelling for my other friend just inside when it zipped off over the horizon to my right.  I just began to get the first uttering of words from my mouth when this happened.  What I was trying to say was ""Man, you are not gunna believe this.""  But I never quite got it out.  By the time my friend got outside it was long gone. I know absolutely what I saw without any doubt. I've been an artist and a musician my entire life and pay great attention to subtle details commonly overlooked. I guess you can say a photographic memory to an extent. I hope this report and it's documentation helps you in some way. I've always been curious to know if there are other reports like mine, with the same type of description. I myself, haven't heard many. If you have any information you can forward me of similar sightings in the area I'd be excited to check it out. I appreciate your time in reading my report and greatly appreciate the work you and your collegues do on a day to day basis. If I can be of ANY assistance to you or your cause, please don't hesitate to contact me either by Email or phone.

I'm not sure if this was you would consider alien, it may have been a satellite for all I know, but I could never find anything about satellites being seen like this.  It happened a while back so the date isn't exact, but the year and time is. I was standing on my front porch in a very rural part of North Robertsdale.  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and noticed out of the southwest (My porch faced west) this spinning object moved across the sky due east.  At first it looked like one of the many satellites that can be seen moving across a clear sky at night, but I noticed it was rotating like a well thrown football does (Sorry, best way I could think to describe it).  As it moved closer I could see the light wasn't just on the object, but was beaming off of it, like a hugely powerful spotlight.  As the light rotated around the craft the beam was reaching out a great distance as it rotated around the object.  As it got closer the beam was brighter, until finally as it moved over head, the beam made a sweep across my yard, again directly over me, and continued across the field behind my home and presumably along the entire direct route that the object traveled until I couldn't see it anymore. This light was very bright, and swept rather quickly, but lit up everything it went across like it was daytime.  I was frozen in terror.  I had of course heard UFO stories and never really knew what to make of the subject.  But that thought in my mind that it might be a UFO scared me like few things have.   I immediately went inside and started searching the internet for satellite sightings and if there were any that rotated and would maybe reflect the sun off it's panels.  I never did find an answer to that question and I'm hoping maybe someone here can help me come to understand what I saw.   I've only told a couple friends about it and never reported it because I always thought it was probably a satellite.  But every year or so it pops back in my head and I search for a while to see if anyone could explain it for me. So please, if anyone can help me understand what I saw or reaffirm that it actually was just a satellite, please get back to me as soon as you can.  Thank you for your time.

It has taken me quite a while to be able to mention this to anyone.  I didn't want to believe it happened, but I have to get this out.  I'm not sure of the exact date although the moon was almost full. I work evenings and had been home a couple hours and had just finished watching tv in the living room.  My wife and 2 daughters were all in their beds asleep.  I am a creature of habit and, correct to schedule, I turned off my tv and turned around to grab my cat to take her to bed with us.  She always watches tv with me until about 5:00AM and then I scoop her up and take her to bed with my wife and I.  My cat hangs out with me like clockwork until I take her to bed with us. (she sleeps at the foot of our bed every night.)  The lights are now off in the house and there was plenty of light coming in the living room window from the bright moon.  I turned around as usual to scoop up our big Main Coon cat and she was nowhere to be found.  I thought that was a little strange because she had been there earlier but if you know cats then you know they have a mind of their own, so I didn't think much of it. As I turned to go down the hall to retire to bed with my wife, I noticed how clear and bright it was outside. Since it had been cloudy and raining earlier I decided to step outside for just a moment in my socks and boxers to take in the rain-refreshed air and look at the moon. The sidewalk had almost dried so I walked about 30 feet down the sidewalk to get to the driveway so I could have an unobstructed clear view of the night sky and nearly full moon.  I looked up and remember seeing the moon and how beautiful it looked and then something even brighter than the moon caught my left eye's per.  Vision. I turned an look up and at first I was amazed thinking to myself, ""what on earth is that?"". It was a bright white glowing orb but it had spikes coming out of it all over.  The spikes were the same bright glowing white but they were not all the same size and they were constantly expanding and contracting growing larger and then smaller again.  They were pulsing and changing sizes getting longer and shorter all the time.  It's hard to explain. At that point I felt frozen and terrified because it appeared very close to me - maybe only 30 or 40 feet up in the air. That's when things got really terrifying.  The reason this has stuck with me is because I was quite literally frozen in fear.  I was descending closer to me - maybe about 20 feet directly over my head now. I have only two words that can explain what happened next: Primal Fear. I had always heard people being paralyzed by fear but I've been in a lot of tense situations before and am known for staying calm and collected. if you asked me before this experience what I would have done I would have told you I would run inside. But I literally couldn't move. My front door was only 30 feet away but it might as well have been 30 miles away because there was no way I could get there. I remember I was standing slightly off the sidewalk into the wet grass at this point and I wanted to run for the door. But I could not. I fell to the ground in a fetal position completely terrorized and paralyzed in fear. I heard no sound from the object at all. It was completely silent as it kept descending toward me now about 15 feet or so in the air. It's spikes continued to expand and contract and I began trying to scream my wife's name, tears running down my eyes. But I couldn't make a sound. I tried screaming for help but not a word or sound came out of my mouth. I remember trying to scream for my wife and then just HELP hoping somebody -anybody would hear me but I could couldn't make a sound. What I can tell you for sure is that the fear was as deep, primal and disturbing. The fear was REAL. The next thing I knew, I woke up about 11AM in my own bed naked.  But that is not unusual for me.  Sorry maybe that is a little more information than you wanted.  But it is relevant because when I woke up everything appeared normal. I remember thinking, ""Oh God, it was just a dream... It was just a dream thank God!"" A hell of a lucid vivid dream but a dream non-the-less. So, wife and kids already gone for the day, I stumbled back down the hall toward the kitchen to make some coffee.  I was starting to relax and then decided to walk outside and get the paper.  What happened next I will never forget. There next to the sidewalk where I had been standing ""in my dream"" we're my two wet socks, my damp boxer shorts (it had previously rained before the incident the night before.  My socks and boxers (the only two things I had been wearing) at the time were outside.  At that point my heart sank. I threw the socks and boxers away and have never mentioned it to anyone until now. Not even my wife.  After almost two years I still have not mentioned it to my wife or anyone else. I'm afraid they would send me to a mental facility or that my wife would think I am nuts, which I am NOT.  I cannot afford to lose everything.  At best, I went sleep walking around my neighborhood naked (I am not a sleep walker). At worse, it wasn't a dream. I am very confused about it - that's all I remember. One final thought. At night when I close my eyes and start re-living the incident over in my head to try and figure out more - when I concentrate really hard on it my body jerks and I have this extremely unpleasant electrical feeling surge through me until I stop thinking about it.  Think about what restless legs feel like but over your entire body - just for trying to remember it.  It is like my brain has blocked off my access to that memory and has set up some kind of ""electrical"" force field around it in my brain that is so uncomfortable physically that I try never to think of it. So there it is. You may think I'm crazy but it feels good to finally get this off my chest. By the way I own a very successful business and have a degree in business management.  I tell you that just so you know I am of at least average intelligence.  I do not drink alcohol. And I am absolutely certain I was not seeing the moon.  They were in two different places. I have never heard of anything quite like this.  If you know of others similar, please let me know.  It would mean a lot to find out I am not the only one to have experienced this sort of thing.

I am of sound mind and testify in open court on a regular basis.  I have three college degrees: a BA in History, a BA in Philosophy and a Juris Doctor degree.  I do not drink, do not use drugs and honestly have withheld this information along with my three friends who were with me at the time.  None of us are on medications or have any history of psychosis or psychotic episodes.  We were all working on a construction project at the time of the sighting.  It occurred as follows:   On July 14th of 2012 we drove out to the Moore Cut Off road in order to construct a cattle abatement/antelope crossing fence.  I remember the date because I had lived in France in 2002-2003 and was explaining to my coworkers about Bastille Day.   We started stretching wire and tying it to the t-posts around 8:30 am.  We approached a hill which had very large rocks jutting out of the side.  We all grouped together and a friend asked what time it was,  I checked my phone and saw that it was 10:38.  I remember this because we always guessed what time it was before looking and the closest person to the correct time was paid a dollar by the other coworkers.   I then glanced up at the full moon which was declining in the western sky.  I am an avid amateur astronomer and was marveling at the moon's position so late in the morning.  I then saw a shiny metallic shape located under the moon.  I quickly drew attention to it and asked one of my coworkers (who was attending aviation school) what type of plane it was.  He stated ""that's no plane I've ever seen.""  Given our relative closeness to Area 51 (it's all desert from where we were to Area 51, hundreds of miles of nothing) we just chalked it up to some sort of new type of secret air craft that was classified.   So we sat down to watch it, but it was simply hovering in the same spot.   Then, in the blink of an eye, it darted across the sky.  I cannot begin to calculate the distance it covered, but my pilot friend said that there is no plane in existence that could travel that fast from a dead stop.   We then started to realize that this was no ordinary aircraft, not even a secret air craft.  As we looked around the sky, we saw other aircraft flying east and south.  Each craft was moving extremely slowly compared to the object and they all had a trail behind them. There was no trail behind the object. We watched the object as it hovered in the new location across the sky (to the north) of where the moon was positioned.  I told my friends to expect a sonic boom, but no sound came.  It then darted right back to the EXACT same position it had been under the moon.  This time it zig-zagged down going first to the right and then to the left, but it seemed to be moving downward away from the moon.  After 5 or 6 zig zags it stopped and then blasted straight up into the sky. It went in front of the moon and that's when I got the best glimpse of the object. It was gone.  I said to my friends ""please tell me you guys saw that...  That was the craziest thing I have ever seen.""  They all agreed that they had seen the exact same thing.  I looked down at my phone to call my father (who works for the government) but I didn't have cell service.  8 minutes had passed and we all sat there for a while, dumbfounded at what we had seen and experienced. I am not saying that this was an alien aircraft or extra terrestrial life.  I will not presume to make such an assumption.  However, I do know that this thing moved unlike any aircraft we publicly know about to this day.  The amount of g-forces that this type of maneuvering would create would literally kill those pilots without some sort of advanced technology to mitigate the pressure.   I know what I saw though and all 3 of the other witnesses saw the same exact thing.  We still discuss it to this day when we all get together.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,39.1031,-111.1674

On a brisk clear February evening a friend and I went for an evening walk on Leckhampton hill (900ft) in Cheltenham, England. It was a short time after about 5pm so was getting dark, but it was a cold clear dusk with hardly a cloud. From where we were stood you can look north to the Malvern hills (1,400 ft) in Worcestershire, which are around 30 miles away from where we were. The first thing I noticed as we were looking out towards the row of hills was a white spherical light appear in the sky, above and to the right of the hills. I watched it ""switch on"", or appear suddenly, and my first reaction was to think a plane has just switched it's lights on as it was getting dark. (I have since spoken to other people and for several reasons I don't think this makes sense with being a plane.)  At first, as I thought it was a plane, I didn't pay it much attention and continued talking to my friend for around 30 seconds until we both suddenly noticed it had moved up above the Malvern hills into the sky and started randomly looping and smoothly accelerating and decelerating in quite large circular patterns. After about 20 seconds of this it went up higher directly over the hills, and as it did so over about 5 seconds it faded from it's previous white light colour to a more gold colour and then into a definate orange, and was still making smooth looping patterns at various speeds above the hills. It then proceeded to travel down in front of the hills, and was a fierce orange colour, very close to that of the average British street lamp. Because of the time of day and the season, the hills and most of the land was black with darkness, with a pale blue/whiteish sky behind and the orange light traveled down in front of the hills then in a diagonal direction (south-east-east as we were looking north-west) and traveled in a relatively straight line at a moderate steady speed until it merged in with the lights of Gloucester city centre and we could no longer see it.  Gloucester is around 10 miles from where we were stood, and the Malvern hills where the light was sighted is 30 miles.  The whole sighting was probably around a minute and a half.  The first minute being the light above the range of hills and it then took about 30 seconds to travel from Great Malvern over to Gloucester meaning a speed of about a mile a second. My friend and I relayed back to one another the events several times and both agree on what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Due to the date in proximity of it's 1 yr. anniversary I have decided to tell my story. Last summer my girlfriend and I frequently visited Juno Beach in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.  On a few occasions we did witness ufo's in the sky at night. According to people in the area, apparently this beach is a hot spot for that type of activity. One night almost one year ago, my girlfriend and I fell asleep on our blanket and awoke at almost 4am in the morning.  We gathered our stuff and decided to leave when I noticed a shadow figure by the shoreline giving off a blue blinking light. 1-2 seconds then blink...then 1-2 second and then blink.  But the movement of the shadow was very weird.  It went up and down, to the left and to the right.  Next thing we knew the shadow darted across the shoreline about 50 feet to the left.  My girlfriend decided to find out what it was.  Just an fyi: we were not under the influence of any drugs/alchohol and there was no one at the beach at this time.  It was dark and empty at 4am!  Next thing we decide to go down to the shoreline.  When we were near the moving shadow figure I decided to shine my cell phone light over it.  It was then that we both witnessed the figure shift it's shape to form arms and legs.  Completely black, no face with a blue light that would not allow us to see a face if there was one.  The figure then puts one arm out near us and we immediately ran back up and went home.  Before we left the sand, we looked back and saw the figure had left.  We couldn't see the light anymore. We'd like to clarification if anyone within this organization knows what this thing might have been. Thanks!",2014-06-04T00:00:00,26.838909943181818,-80.16463636363636

I had contact with alien beings in my bedroom. I hope this is the proper place for such a report. It happened sometime in 2013.  I was in bed sleeping, when at approximately 3a.m.  I was woken up after feeling something touch my forehead. I opened my eyes, and I saw that my bedroom was flooded in a sort of red color. I was lying on my back and I looked up the wall above my headboard, and was shocked to see a doorway coming out of my wall.  There were two men side by side, and I could see a stairway going up into total darkness,  The men appeared to be wearing leather jackets!  They appeared to me men and both had thick wavy black hair. One of them pointed what I thought was a gun at my forehead, and for a second, I really though I was going to be shot in the head. I was partially paralyzed, but I was able to raise my right arm enough to actually get a hole of the man holding the ""guns wrist"" I then saw what looked like tiny blue lights where the open end of a gun's barrel would be. There was a dull white light slightly larger than the tiny blue lights which went around the tip of the ""gun"" in a circle. I saw that it was not a gun, but it was roughly the same shape as a hand gun, only a little thicker down the barrel and tapering off where the lights were. It appeared to be some kind of shiny plastic.  They put the tip of the gun like instrument against my forehead, and at that point, both men has a perplexed expression on their faces. It appeared that they were confused at whatever it was they may have been expecting to see. I managed to push the man's wrist up and away from my head, with what seemed to me to be very little effort. I had the feeling that they were not allowed to resist me if I attempted to push them away. That is why, I afterwards, reasoned that I managed to push his hand away so easily. Suddenly, they were just gone, and my wall was normal again. It took a while for me to be able to move normally, and I was able to see my wife had slept right through the entire episode. There was a dim red glow on my ceiling for about ten or so minutes after they had disappeared. I could see red catching the tiny lumps off my stuccoed ceiling for quite some time as it slowly dissipated. I didn't have any fear except for slightly, when I thought I was going to be shot, but even then, not as much fear as I would expect to have had my life actually been threatened like that. It seemed to me whoever they were, they were able tocontrol my emotions and my body. A few months after that experience, I was watching a television program, where investigators were attempting to make contact with ""ghosts"" Ghost Adventures, was the name of that show. I saw one of their cameras had the exact same color of blue, and the exact same size and configuration as the instrument which had been used on my forehead. The camera itself was much bigger, but the tiny blue lights were the same size. It turned out to be an infra red camera. I thought they all used red lights, however, this camera, used blue. My wife had no recollection of anything out of the ordinary, nor did our three adult sons. I have not had any further incidents. The experience was real, not a dream, of that I am certain. I am a bible believing Christian, and I honestly feel that kept them from doing whatever it was they had come to do. Thank you for your time. J.C.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,44.2501,-79.4663

Hello,  On the night of October 19th, 2013, at 10:30pm while driving west on Willow RD approaching the I-275 overpass bridge, I began noticing reddish-orange lights in the sky. These lights were moving towards me on the right side of the road in single file formation. They appeared to be following one another.  As I drove, I noticed there were approximately 3-5 lights and due to their color and direction of travel, I knew immediately I was seeing something extraordinary. There is an airport nearby, and I am used to seeing planes in the area, but in my area, the planes travel north to south and vice versa.  Plus, jet liners have those red, green, blue LED lights and huge white spotlights in the front. What I was seeing was nothing like that.  These lights appeared to be flying bon-fires.  I’ve not seen anything like it before or since in the sky. I stopped my car just before the overpass in an open area, got out, and attempted to take video of the objects with my Blackberry cell phone.  I could tell by looking at my cell phone it wasn’t picking up all that I was seeing, but it was all I had on me, so I continued videoing anyway.  I didn’t want to miss anything, so I was watching the objects as I videoed; consequently, the video is pretty shaky at times. Anyway, as I stood there, I noticed the objects, while traveling in a straight line, were actually traveling in a long slope upwards, higher and higher in the sky.  One by one, the lights would climb until it was no longer visible. I would then pan to the next one and video it until it disappeared too. As I said, they appeared to be reddish-orange, sort of like a bon-fire. Imagine not a raging bon-fire, but a smoldering fire that has nearly gone out with a flame more orange than red is what I can best describe it.  The object itself I could not see at all but rather the outline of the object due to the fire surrounding what I assumed to be the bottom of the craft/object. I am sure they were not sparklers, flares, or lanterns because of their speed and consistency of travel, which was in a perfect line, gradually upwards in what I would approximate as a 30 degree angle. These objects made no sound that I could hear.  It was a quiet night and not particulary windy. I felt no breeze. I could also see clouds in the sky because the moon was so bright. They were not disappearing into clouds.  I am sure of that.  They were moving so far upwards into the sky that they were no longer visible.  I am not sure how far that would be, but in a matter of minutes, they were approximately the height of where I would see jet liners approach for landing, and then 2-3 minutes later were out of the atmosphere where I could no longer see them. I have video a 1:50 video of the objects.  The video is 110mb but is a bit shaky.  Other than the lights themselves, not much else can be ascertained, but I can send it anyway if you like.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,42.126,-83.3913

The next day a strange phone call at 5:30 pm central time zone- lots of weird static on line.  We weren't there, but voices told us about that- they said they'd do that and it happened apparently. someone told us on the phone about that stuff.  They said it was an air lift due to car wreck, but the aliens would say that's what it'd be, too. ***(The aliens did say that- they said they'd land... air-lift something or other.  That it'd be an air lift due to car crash, but there probably wasn't a car crash.  If it was it would been on the main road there probably since it's a 1 road town.  There's such things as air-lifts, but it flew real low and there was a strange call the next day.  The call was aliens for sure and if a car crashed they knew about it and told us first or they did it.  But, first she didn't mention a car crash- just low flying helicopter and said that's what it was.  Just like we thought of it shortly before that happened a few days before- day or so before.  We thought aliens landing or something- someone flying low by- which the mafia has did that here- flying low by the window out there following us down the hall while someone came out the stairs and also followed us at the same time.  The voices said aliens in a helicopter land and then said - it's probably an air-lift from a car crash.  So you'd think it's that, but maybe it wasn't because why would a helicopter land down the street? They - the voices may have said -make the mafia fly low over the house there since they did that here once at least and we saw them out there. Hells Angels International mafia organization did that here. They talk to the mafia - they told us they were on the phone with the mafia day before or recently- the mafia woman calls daily she said there. She talks to the mafia out there on the phone and they moved in next door and into her house even- that area. So, we were par! anoid maybe and just thought of the helicopters something and ! then tha t happened- and the voices, but it may have been aliens in the helicopter. We'll have to ask what color it was. They were mystified about that at first and the car crash theory was probably not real and just somethign they made up to explain it. The call the next day was very strange with real weird static and it was about same time we got up day before which was when the mafia woman would call out there every day and lie on the phone. So we had tried to call and it was busy and it was just static and they said they hung the phone us. they said it sounded real real weird and that it hasn't happened before and it's not a normal regular type of prank call they get out there or anything.) You may think that coz why else would it land, but that was aliens in the helicopter realy and on the phone. The aliens seem to be reminding us a lot recently of things that we thought of and then forgot before we had a chance to calm down over it to make the voices go away. so they were just ! helping us to make the voices go away and spooking us by telling us they were going to do those things and then doing them. don't know if it was black helicopter or not. it landed also by a house that we thought of - probably there- that is down the street. they said it landed down the street. So, it was the house that someone used to tease us about when we were little kids saying the woman who lived there was a  witch. We recalled that other day and when we were little it scard us a lot and gave us nightmares. The voices reminding us that we were scared is what they did when we thought of that we freaked out and they landed to remind us of that apparently that it was scary. The woman was out in broad daylight if she was a witch she'd been hiding late at night- she wasn'ta  witch. The other woman just said that being weird - she said - see that old woman out there with them shakers banging on them trashcans- she's a witch. We'd run and get scared- we were real little babies! only then. She was just playing moracas and banging on the tr! ashcans because it sounded musical kinda. She was unable to haul off the trashcans- large metal tranh containers kinds with the lids on top in metal-metal barrels. The woman thought she was sexy smoking cigaretttes and they'd walk around the block and she'd tease us kids like that. She'd walk around the block smoking those and say that when we went by that house. A helicopter flew over the house real low and landed down the street. The next day a strange phone call at 5:30 pm central time zone- lots of weird static on line.

We were all in a mesh tent so we could see clearly through it. at about 12:45 in the morning everyone had fallen asleep I was still awake at the time because i kept hearing strange noises.  I finally decide to roll over and look up through the tent and I saw a large object directly above us It was emitting a slight shrieking sound and it had blue lights arranged to look like a X, it also had a blue haze around it.  At first i thought it was a meteor, but after watching it for about five minutes it had not moved, in fact it was rotating slowly. after about twenty more minutes some smaller objects appeared to have come out of the larger craft and joined into a delta formation there were about four objects on each side of the formation.  They wee circling the larger craft as if they were protecting or escorting it.I would have woken up the others but I was too shocked to move.  There were some dogs outsi! de with us, they were howling frequently, there was also a donkey in a nearby field giving out loud yelps.  The objects could not have been more than 1000 feet above me they sat there as if studying the landscape.

Probably right down the street at about the only location we realy know about there. someone used to spook us when we walked by that house as a kid.  The aliens seem to remind us recently of things that we had thought of and forgot.  They help you to remember the scary things so you can forget them because when we originally thought of them we forgot without thinking of it and becoming unscared of it.  It was something scary and they helped us remember it so we wouldn't be scared no more so we can put it out of our minds. So, the helicopter flew real real low by the house someone told us on the  phone day before yesterday.  It had happened the day before and they had just got a real real weird phone call about 15 minutes before we called.  It had real real weird static on the line they said and they hung up. It wasn't usual and hadn't happened ever before.  Don't know what color the helicopter was or much on how the call sounded.  They said the helicopter flew real real low and the call was real real weird though.  They said it was an airlift because of a car crash.  They said it landed down the street first - flew weird though.  The car crash idea was probably just something they thought of to make sense of it. It surely wasn't one and at first they just said that it was a real weird helicopter flying strange and landed.  They didn't mention a car crash.  Didn't mention the main road.  They mentioned a weird flying helicopter is what it was.  And nothing of any cars or anything like that- just that it ! had landed. So the other story of the car wreck and air-lift was not realy what it was. We thought of a helicopter that flew by here low recently and voices said they'd make one fly low there, too.  They said it'd be the Hells Angles outlaw motorcycle gang- just like flew by here many times very low outside our window.  That is how they do death threats- they are a mafia organization. So, then the voices said aliens fly by and land down street in helicopter and you just think of an air lift due to a car crash would be why they'd land like that. Helicopters landed down the street here before, too. But the voices said landing there and aliens or mafia and that they knew a car wreck would happen or they would cause it to happen. Realy, it may have been aliens or else the hell's angel's mafia organization maybe - perhaps possessed by aliens and landed there. Don't know what it looked like or what the occupant's looked like. It landed so that is unusual. The call was weird- at same time the mafia calls there daily which would be when we woke up the day before. They ca! ll and tell lies on the phone because that is mafia activity. They lie on the phone and tell them the same things we said the day before at the same time we said them the day before. It is meant to make them trust them- sound familiar to the person so they trust a stranger. The hell's angel's do lot's of murders for money and that is what that is. They work with other mafia organizations, too such as Georgia mafias which is what some of them are out there. So, the aliens called the next day, too and did weird noises on the phone. Static maybe copying that song by the band who did 'love shack' because we thought of that song other day, too. Maybe aliens put the song in our mind. B-52's is the band name. Channel Z song- maybe we used to think the song was ufo's or something related to it like ufo's contating you telepatically. The aliens may have reminded us of that idea that we'd never have remembered otherwise. don't know if we ever thought that realy. Or we used to think t! v's were weird or something- like the film Poltergeist. The vo! ices may be were helping us forget soemthign that scared us though by reminding us that we thought of it and forgot it before we calmed down over it. So we could remember it and forget it. So they landed and just basically also annoying us with voices and scaring us. It was a helicopter, but it maybe was aliens and it landed- don't know if it was black. Rape is associated with a ufo landing spot where an alien was sighted in the vicinity. It landed and one was sighted apparently at least. If it was the mafia or not we don't know, but that itself is ufo related because it's alien related because aliens have something to do with a gang that kills thousands of innocent people every year - mostly in the southern us. They work with other mafia organizations, too though a whole lot- we know because we have seen them. And they are international, too a-lot we know because we have seen that, too. We'll have to ask about the color of the helicopter and what the occupant/s looked like. They abdolutely did not at first say it was a car crash and air-lift via helicopter. They said it flew by real real low! It had landed down the street! And all you could figure out is why they'd do that would be an air-lift to the hospital from a car crash maybe on the main road. Why else would it be there? Is it legal to land personal helicopters wherever you want like that? In a residential neighborhood and flying that low- they said it was terribly low. We've seen low planes before because we have seen ufo's before and aliens flying low. This was even lower apparently. Real real weird static on the phone the next day and they hung up the phone they said. So it's not normal and it does not even sound like a prank call. I have got calls from ET's before and here we have stopped answering the phone. The alien/s called maybe just to freak us out seems like and they may have been ordered to phone us up from time to time like it's their job by a top alien. We heard a voice saying they'd be a weird call and there was- with static real weird on it- and it was. The day before we had tried to call out there and they were on the phone to the mafia. The mafia calls and lies and tells them things we said day before at the same time they call there the next day. It's to gain trust and they had called and were on the phone lieing to them out there to make them think they have something in common with them- to sound familiar so they will put their guard down and trust them when they shouldn't. So calling people like that would cause ET's to get there beca! use the mafia is doing very violent type of thing by doing that. ET's being evil have something to do with it. So there's the mafia and also we don't usually call out there and we recalled that. Aliens maybe wanted to remind us of that and how bad it was coz they hate us out there of course. We had to call though because there was important business needed done and you can't do it in 2 minutes once a week here in town realy. We had to do things about buying groceries, clothes and everything and we had to call. They maybe wanted to remind us - did we get mad and freak out and say we weren't calling and to remind us to calm down over whatever we maybe thought on that whole thing if we heard voices on it or whatever. I heard about it via the voices 1st, they saw it and surely many others saw it there in the town. Aliens could fly a helicopter and even abduct people or animals onto them and make people think it was an air-lift.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,35.3562,-95.2651

I am writing this since I noticed someone else in the same general area saw something similar, just on different days.  As for the exact date, I may be off by a day either direction but it was during a snow storm that hit this area dropping a foot of snow over a few days (first week of Feb 2014).   It was late in the night, my best guess would be 10:30-11:00pm.  The snow was coming down pretty good and the cloud cover was very low.  I was sitting in my house when I heard a loud but muffled boom coming from the direction of my neighbors house behind me.  Then about 10-15 seconds later, I heard the exact same sound once again.   At this point, I got up from what I was doing and decided to go take a look outside to see what this noise was coming from.  I went outside on my porch, took a look around but did not see anything out of the ordinary.   I then left the covered area of my porch and started walking outside and as soon as I got to the bottom step of my porch, I looked up into the sky and saw a bright red light hovering just below the cloud layer directly above me.   At first it almost appeared to be an emergency flare but it just stayed in one spot, had no direction of travel at all.  Being former military, I am pretty familiar with the different style and type flares used and I have never seen one do what I saw that night.   For about 10-15 seconds it stayed motionless just below the cloud layer, emitting a bright red glow from the objecs which was lighting up the bottom of the clouds.   What happened next is the reason why I know this wasn't an emergency flare:  the object then shot upwards through the clouds at a decent rate of speed.   That was the last visual contact I had with this object and haven't seen it or anything like it since that night.

I have set the ""event date"" as the approximate date of the last sighting, along with the corresponding approximate duration, time, and location. The first unusual thing I saw was a few days before Halloween. I'm not sure of the exact date. I was traveling Rt. 395 West at approximately 7PM in the Auburn area.  Off to the left about a mile or so away I would guess, a white streak came straight down, appearing close to the ground, and then disappeared.  I thought it could be a meteorite, but thought it unusual that the streak would appear so close to the ground and be perpendicular in relation to the ground.  The streak appeared for about a second or so before disappearing.  There was no flicker or debris trail that I could see, but appeared as a white ball of light with a solid white streak behind it. A few days after that, I was traveling Route 9 West in Westborough between 5:30 and 6:00PM. I noticed an unusually bright light traveling left to right across the sky. I lost sight of the object as it continued across the sky. I was traveling down Rt. 20 West in the Shrewsbury/Worcester area shortly after. I could see what may have been the same object from a good distance, probably a couple miles or so ahead. As I recall, it was two same-size solid white lights facing outward toward my direction, positioned horizontally to each other with smaller colored lights in the middle that were pulsing. The object remained stationary. The white lights were bright, but did not appear to project an outward beam like a searchlight or headlight. The lights were bright, but did not have a glistening brightness to them like a flashlight might. The brightness was closer to something like a traffic light. The white lights were circular and large. I can only guess at their diameter, but based! on how low it seemed to the ground, I would guess they were at least searchlight-size or larger. At first, I wasn't sure if it was the position and trajectory of the object in relation to my vehicle that made it seem as if the object wasn't moving, but as I got closer I could see that it was hovering, maintaining the same position directly above Route 20. I would estimate it to be 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground, but I couldn't see the shape of it. I ultimately passed directly under it's position, which was further confirmation that it was hovering in place. I was excited to find out what other people would report, if this would be on the news, etc., as this was during rush hour, and at a minimum, hundreds if not more people would have seen this same low-to-the-ground object. I was very disappointed to find absolutely nothing in the news or anywhere online about the incident. A few days after, on Route 20 West in the Shrewsbury area, also during rush hour, the same or s! imilar object was hovering just to the right of Route 20. This! time it appeared to be lower to the ground, and there were multiple lights both white and colored, but the lights were dimmed to such a degree that you might miss it if you weren't paying attention. They had a consistent low-light glow, no flickering or blinking that I recall. The object would have been noticeable to anyone traveling in that area, and may have been in a different configuration from the one I had seen days before. I have never seen anything with dimmed lights flying in the sky or hovering above the ground before this, so it was very unusual indeed. Again, I passed by it with it hovering above me off to my right. I can't speak as to whether the object made any noise either time, as there was moderate to heavy traffic all around, along with the noise produced by my own vehicle. I have seen strange lights in the Route 9 and Route 20 area before, but nothing as noticeable or that was recurring like this. There are planes and helicopters that commonly fly around this are! a, but I've never seen anything like or similar to this, and I have been traveling these same routes around the same time, Monday through Friday, for several years. Another few days after the last sighting, I was approaching the on ramp to Route 395 North near Exit 3 in Webster. On approach to the entrance I noticed multiple large white lights that were stationary part way above the tree line. I believe there were four of them. I don't remember specifically, but I believe two or more lights were pulsing. At the time I thought they may have been night time road work/construction lights or something similar, so I didn't pay much attention to them, and it didn't occur to me as unusual until after I turned onto the highway.  Although I had been this way many times, I am not familiar with all areas of the town.  I have since been down the road the trees are adjacent to, and there are no roads in the area or anywhere nearby that align with the top of the trees, and I saw no lights of this kind anywhere.  I have never seen those lights before or since in that area, and have traveled the same way many times since and during the same time of day.  If this were the same object I had seen before, I would guess it's length across to be 40 to 60 feet across. Over the next few months I would see this same or very similar configuration of white lights. The next time would be in late December on Route 395 South in the Auburn/Oxford area in the evening around 6:30. The object was to my right and was higher in the sky than I had seen it at other times, but again was relatively low to the ground. I could not see the shape of it, but the configuration of lights was the same, a row of four horizontal, outward facing white lights. I could clearly see the two lights in the middle that remained solid, and the lights on either side pulsed. All lights appeared to be the same size. There may have been a faint colored blinking light near the middle of the white lights. There was also a single pulsing white light that appeared to be close to the row of lights and approaching it from left to right in the sky. The single light was similar in intensity, but I can't say with any certainty how far it was from the row of lights. The next time I saw these lights was around 6:30PM on January 9th near and to the left of Route 20 approaching the entrance to Route 395 South in Auburn/Worcester area, but this time there were only two large solid white lights, same configuration, horizontal and outward facing, and again hovering relatively low to the ground. I would see the lights with my wife the next time in the Auburn area in the evening. I believe we were either on Route 20 or had just entered a side road intersecting with it. Same two white lights, same lowness to the ground, and again either motionless or moving very slowly. This is the first time my wife had seen the lights. In late January, early February, I saw the same lights again during my evening commute from the end of the on ramp going from Route 9 to Route 20 West. As I yielded to traffic at the end of the on ramp and looked to the left for traffic before entering, my eyes were drawn upward where I saw the same two white lights. I could onl! y pause for a couple seconds or so, but again the object appeared to be motionless or moving very slowly. I would guess it was about one-half to one mile away, and perhaps a couple thousand feet up. I have seen the moon, basically in the same position in the sky. This was not the moon. The next thing I saw was during my evening commute on February 11th. It was a brief red flash on Route 20 West. It appeared to be a few miles away, and lasted only a moment. It appeared, and then it was gone. From where I was the shape looked like an egg on its side with it going smaller to larger left to right. In the smaller area to the left there was a small white flash. I saw a bright white light in the vicinity of where I believe the flash occurred. It appeared unusually shaped, and I saw it at certain points in the sky for a few minutes as I was heading home. My wife saw the two white lights again while driving on Route 395 within a few days of my last sighting, this time hovering in the vicinity of exit 3. To this date, that is the last time either of us has seen the lights. We never saw the shape of the object. I am open to the possibility that these occurrences are all explainable as something ordinary, but I also have to consider how unusual and unlikely something like this is - the unusual and similar nature of the lights occurring multiple times in different areas, but within the same 30 mile radius. I was happy to find some similar, and some very similar sightings by others at NUFORC.org, MUFON.com, and YouTube.com. Whether ordinary or extraordinary, I look forward to seeing these lights again, and hope to come to know what they are.

There was one very bright solid orange light ""possibly"" oscillating a but it could have been various environmental factors and IMHO too far away to get any detail.  The first light was then followed by a 2nd which made me think I was looking at an aircraft route, but then there was a dance.  The front light shifted right and the the 2nd left.

The whole thing was very cool and I did take pic on my iPhone.  *granted I wasn't that close so its nothing highly credible but I think it's worth mentioning/showing.

My son began to tell me about flying objects that were either a triangle hovering around the home that made no sound since November while walking the dog.  I kept telling my son that he must it be confusing them for helicopters but he kept insisting they did not look like helicopters at all till April when I decided to walk the dog at night with my son that I discovered he was actually telling  the truth and these flying objects did not look like helicopters or air planes.   For one they make no sound, they are able to hover on top of the homes at a very very close range, they seemed to come out of a bigger a mean a much bigger space ships, the shapes of their lights change and they take off with such speed that it is almost impossible to see them take off till you go back and review the ! video and realized they took off so fast you were not able to see it.  I also will like to share an experience, I sort of put it together in a video that I am also attaching. I am able to see vortex, I am able to see the energy they generate, when they open up, the beings that come out of the vortex which then turn into these sort of rotating flowers. I can also see the interconnection in the sky, they are like big flowers that interconnect and sort of like watching people and/or helping healing or I just do not know why there is these interconnections.   I have several videos of how the vortex open up, then it is like these flying beings that then turn into rotating flowers and begin to assist people in healing, all while the person is feeling the pulling things out of their bodies, or their bodies begin to shake, feel hot rod entering their bodies all while I am able to see with my own eyes what is it that they are pulling. I see DNA and atoms around me and others, the DNA strands are usually at the end of the snakes that I see, they carry them at the end of their tail, some of the snakes are huge, I mean gigantic.  I can see the infinite space and the tunnels where these beings jump into sort of machines and enter the tunnels and then the tunnel closes.  I am able to see when someone is ill, when they have attachments, when they are full of light, I can see the energy field when emerges and the material no longer is solid as we know it.  I had a vision after one day experiencing so much pressure on my head that I was sore for about 2 weeks the first time I attempted to meditate, I was told “You are awaken” In the vision, I want to believe it was God as I am a Cristian believer, came down from a tunnel or vortex and handed me a white electric ball, the ball hanged on my hands, it retracted and expanded and stayed on my hands without me touching it.  I was told that I would be able to fight dark matter with it.  After that, I realized my hands contained such energy that I can invade other’s energy field and pull what is been affecting them, it could be illness, faces of beings attached to them.  At times the vortex opens up and the beings come out and begin to pull the things out of the person while I am watching everything they are doing, the person can not see it but they always feel it in their bodies for I would think it was all a part of an illusion on my part.  It is dark matter, when someone is ill, it is dark matter and the flying beings that turn into beautiful pink rotating flowers that surround the person begin to pull the matter.  I am able to also pull the dark matter with my own hands without ever touching the person or by just praying/meditating next to the person that is ill.  I am able to see attachments on people some of them have a silvery color, others are black with really ugly faces; However, I am also able to see people who are full of light and are surrounded by beautiful flowers, the colors are either pure white light, crystalline pink and sometimes light blue.  I am able to see the shape and faces of such attachments, the color of people auras and their flowers.  I am able to see when the vortex opens and the beings descend, then turn into these beautiful rotating flowers that then surround the person and begin to assist the person in pulling the dark matter.  I see sort of machines taking off and despairing into the abyss, while I have my eyes close, I can see everything that is happening, when these things are stubborn and refusing to leave and detach, which it is far more easy to bring them but really hard to get rid of them. I can direct the things that have infested the person to leave but is not that they are leaving this earth, I can see the infinite space full of stars, galaxies, then they enter these tunnels and the tunnel then closes. Sometimes these beings, as crazy as it might sound, I can see them jumping into these sort of things that look more like a machine space craft, or I am guessing they get tired and come and carry their stuff with them and take off.  The last experience I had was three weeks ago while I was taking a nap, I was woken up to hands on my back, I immediately felt I was sort of open on my back, then something from the middle was pull and as soon it was pull, it went into a tunnel.  Even thought I was sleeping on my stomach I was able to see the what they pull out of my body.  Then I felt hands pushing my back together, that is when I truly freaked out and jolted back.  There is an open vortex in my room, it is there all the time.  The beings come out specially if someone is in my room.  A friend visited me and began to read a bible passage and as soon as he began to read the scriptures, the beings came out, turned into these beautiful flowers and stood right next to him sort of hearing or seeing what he was doing.  I asked him if he could see them, he said no but he could sense them.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,36.688524576271185,-121.62845480225988

On May 1st, 2014, I was confronted with a threat by a unnamed individual on the internet.  I have always have had a interest in UFOs and Area 51 and other stuff.  Never thought anything serious of it until May 1st. 	I came home from a day at school and I thought I’d look at some sightings and go into chat rooms about UFOs like I usually would do on a normal day.  I looked at sightings for about an hour, got bored, and moved on to talk to others who are interested in UFOs.  Usually I get a lot of pranks and people who are just trying to joke, but every now and then I receive a legit person who shares info with me. 	On May 1st, I encountered a man who was very interested in UFOs and had a lot of information that most people never shared or even had opinions about. 	He said things like there are these “people” who try to quiet him and he refuses and is spreading the word that he has “come in contact with a UFO”, and never had a chance to grab his camera, but he could describe it like he was there. 	He started to explain the object to me, he said it had blinding, bright lights and moved in incredible different ways. Before he could go further, my computer glitched, but I was still in the chat, however, he had stopped typing. I thought it was just bad connection but then a stranger came in the room and these exact words appeared on my screen, “Do not speak of what this man said. This conversation didn’t happen.”   It seemed like a threat, I thought it was some dumb prank, but then, all my tabs and links I had pulled up were immediately shut down. 	I do not know what became of this man but ever since that day, I have no doubt in my mind someone or something didn't want me to know about the object this man had seen.  Since then, I've been looking for a place to share my story.  All I know is whatever he saw, it must of been something that we were not supposed to know about.

We were in bed watching TV when my wife asked me to check, looking out the window in a nw direction I noticed a series of lights which appeared to be in a straight line. At first I thought the first few lights might be part of a few planes following each other in formation.  But after seeing the 5 and 6 light I asked my wife to follow me she needed to see this.  I ran downstairs and went into the back yard (I couldn’t go out front I was in my underwear).  When I was out back I noticed the lights headed towards Lewisville.  It was several miles long and all of the lights were on when the lights began to turn on and off randomly.  There were about 60 perhaps 100 lights that seemed to be in a straight line in a tight formation.  I couldn’t make out a shape, depth or height as the lights were partly obscured by clouds. As the lights began to alternate off and on they suddenly turned off.  Then they appeared again to our left several miles away and in a straight line but in a vertical pattern instead of horizontal.  The lights moved down towards the horizon when it looked like it might touch down the lights began to flash white and red this time.  Then all of the lights turned off and about 5 seconds later we saw red lights in the form a triangle pattern just to the right of where the horizontal line had been.  The lights flashed off and on in red and possibly yellow for 1 or 2 minutes then stopped.  We waited about 10 – 15 minutes then went back inside.

I was walking to my truck after being stage manager for a music festival in Snow Camp, NC, on Saturday, February 3rd, around 10pm, or a few minutes after.   Being the stage manager, I was one of the last people to leave.  I am unsure if any of the other staff left on-site saw the object.  While walking to my truck, I noticed what appeared to be a large ""fire colored"" object coming over the hill next to me through the tree tops.  At first I was quite concerned that it was a large piece of burning paper floating up from a campfire from the nearby campground.   I soon realized that it was traveling too straight of a line, and too steady of a speed to be campfire debris.  As it cleared the tree tops and came into plain sight, I could see that it appeared to be oval or disc shaped, only turned on its side, with what would be the top of your ""typical flying saucer"" being the leading portion of the craft.  I could plainly see the back of the craft, as it! appeared to be only 800-900 ft in altitude.  With my arm fully extended outward in front of me, and my hand in the shape of an ""L"", the object easily took up 2/3 of the space between the end of my thumb and the curve up to my pointer finger. It was very large, very low and made no sound whatsoever.   The back fire orange glowing part of the craft looked similar to the bottom of a mushroom, with a round ball like center with lines going outward to the outer edge.  Similar to looking at a stopped turbine of a jet engine.  This feature was as large as the craft itself.  It was low enough and bright enough, that the refraction of the light behind it from the heat coming off of it could be seen, almost like it was emitting a very hot exhaust.  The craft continued to travel SSE at a very steady pace until it was out of view.  The craft passed directly overhead and was in plain, clear sight for well over 40 seconds.  Having turned my phone off due to no cell signal and not w! anting to waste battery life, I was unable to take any picture! s with m y phone.   By the time it powered back up, the craft was gone.  I am still very unsure about what I saw and after spending 2 weeks researching what it possibly could have been, I am unable come up with any reasonable explanation.

UFO sighting, chase and possible abduction.  Charlotte N.C., May 5th, 2014. I am submitting this report because I feel that people should know what my adult daughter (28 years old) and I went through.  After over three weeks later we are still upset and still not our usual selves.  I guess we are both still in shock and we are not sure what to do about it. It’s hard because we only really have each other to talk to about it and my daughter is still having stomach problems and just wants to forget what we saw.  I can’t get it out of my mind.  I am still scared. I still can’t believe that it happened at all.  But, I know it did! We know it did. On May 5th, 2014, around 8:30-8:45 PM, we were driving through Charlotte, NC, on the Southbound side of I- 77.  I noticed a really bright light off to the right of us up in the sky.  This huge thing was just floating there in the sky.  It was no plane.  It was silent.  My daughter was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  I just kept asking, “What is that?”  Her reply was that it was a plane because it had blinking lights.  It did have blinking lights but they were pretty insignificant compared to the huge bright white string of lights that seemed to be at the front of this thing.  The smaller lights looked like they were on top of it. One to each side of the center.  The white lights were very large.  I couldn’t see past the lights to see what shape the object was.  We were kind of arguing about what it could or could not be. I grabbed my cell and took some photos.  I actually caught two pictures of the lights and I also turned on my cell’s video to try and catch it that way.  I caught it on video too but it is very small and all you can see is a white light off in the distance.  It’s pretty shaky.  I’m not sure if I can pull it in to see it better or not. As we drove through Charlotte on 77 we came to an area where there are street lights right next to the highway.  Tall orange/yellow street lights.  I could no longer see the object because the street lights were so bright.  All of a sudden a huge round ball of solid bright white light came right at the windshield.  Out of nowhere! It took up most of the windshield and she drives a four door Toyota Corolla.  When it came for the windshield I braced myself for impact. But it didn’t hit the car.  It just kind of seemed as though it evaporated into it.   At that moment my daughter was driving over 70 mph.    As I sat there dazed, I was thinking that one of the street lights must’ve fallen on the car but there was no sound at all and I was having a hard time trying to grasp what had just happened.  I hadn’t said a word to my daughter about the light when she asked me, “What was that light?”  I was like, “You saw that too?”  Then I told her “I don’t know what that was!”   That scared us pretty badly.  Her stomach started to hurt really bad and she was nauseous and my stomach was hurting too.  It seemed to just take all of my daughter’s energy away. She started feeling really bad.  Not only did this light scare the crap out of us but it “STUNNED” us.  We were actually dazed by it.  We don’t know where the ball of light came from, but we didn’t see it again.  We both remember actually feeling it on the skin of our faces and upper arms. I remember that I looked in the side mirror a few moments later and nothing was there.   A little while later a huge helicopter flew right over and in front of our car. It was so close that we could see the two greenish/blue light domes stuck underneath it and a tiny little blue light on top of it, under the blades.  It was a huge helicopter and it was very loud. Because of the blue light I thought it must be police or military. All in all we saw the chopper three times or three different choppers. They were circling the area where we were. So, we couldn’t have been the only ones who witnessed the object. Not sure if anyone saw the round light that came after us. I did notice that the helicopters didn’t actually seem to approach the white lights that were still in the sky. They just circled around the interstate. The last time I saw one of these helicopters was when we were leaving the Charlotte area. Once we cleared the street lights we could still see the lights in the sky were still there. Then the road turned so that the object ended up behind us. I was determined to get some pictures of it so we took the next exit so that we could see it from on top of the over pass. Well, the next exit didn’t go up to an overpass. It angled down. We ended up surrounded by trees and buildings. So, we couldn’t see it anymore. We were going to go to the next exit to see if it had an actual overpass where we would be able to see it again and that’s when my husband called. It was 9:08 PM. I frantically told him all about the lights in the sky and the ball of light that came at us and about the helicopter. I wasn’t paying any attention to my daughter who was still driving until she said, “Mom, I don’t feel good!”  That’s when I noticed she was driving about 85 mph and she told me that she couldn’t stay awake. I told her to slow down. I got off of the phone.  She told me that she had been nodding off and that she couldn’t drive anymore.  We had eaten in Huntersville and we left at dusk.  I’d say a little after 8:00 PM, she was full of energy.  Our trip to where she lives was only 3 ½ hours away from Huntersville and she was fine.  She was fine until the white ball of light came at us. I told her to pull off of the interstate so that she could rest and that I would drive the rest of the way.  The exit we took had a Denny’s so we went in there. This Denny’s is located in Rock Hill, S.C.  As soon as we walked in, we realized it was freezing.  So, we reluctantly walked back outside to the car and opened the trunk to get our jackets.  Everything in the trunk was hot. Even the metal of my camera’s tripod was hot to the touch.  Our jackets were toasty as though we had just pulled them out of the drier.  That was when we started to worry about radiation.  Worried about where that ball of light might’ve come from. Everything being so hot really shook us up all over again. (We don’t know where to go to have something like that checked out. Who do you call to see if your car or you have been exposed to radiation? If anyone out there knows; please get the information to me.) When we went back inside we sat down and ordered coffee. We sat there trying to rationalize what had happened. She was still nauseous so she decided to get something to eat hoping she would feel better. I didn’t eat. My stomach felt bad and I had no appetite at all. Strange thing is that the clock on her cell and the register receipt didn’t match. The receipt said we left there at 10:05 and my daughter had gotten a call from her husband while we were at the table and the time read 10:46. That would mean that by her cell we left there after 11:00 PM. I know we weren’t sitting there for that long. I called the Denny’s last week and spoke to a manager to see of the register’s time was off. But, it was accurate. I can’t explain the difference. I wish I could say that our experience ended there. But, it didn’t. We got into the car and I drove back to I-77.  After I had been driving a little while, I spotted the lights again. We couldn’t believe it!  They were over to the right of the interstate, just like before.  (When we had left the restaurant I made sure that we got my video camera and Cannon camera out of the trunk.)  So, I told my daughter to grab it to film the object, so she did. I couldn’t help her with it because I was driving.  As she opened the view finder she tried to focus on the object when it seemed to come straight towards our car! She just said “ It can see us, it’s looking at us!” She said the white lights went out and now there was a line of red lights under it. Then it flew over the car. It went from the front passenger side to the rear driver side and then across the street. By this time it was moving very slowly and low. The whole thing turned slowly like it was facing our car while staying in the! same spot. She is so scared and at this time I can’t see it. She can, because she is looking over the seat through the window behind me. I pull the car off to the right side of the slow lane. Strangely there is no traffic except for us. Now, I can see it! As we watch this thing together; it started changing shape. I ask you, how does something just change shape? The fact that it was in the air is what scared me! We could see what looked like metal beams drop down from I guess inside of this thing and it looked like they were interlocking. The beams looked like 2 x4s but seemed to be made of metal. It was changing shape right in front of us. We could clearly see it because it was right there and the red lights illuminated it. It’s outer shape was starting to look like some sort of a triangle. That’s when I put the car back into drive, hit the gas and took off. I need to say this now; my daughter doesn’t own and has never used a video camera. (Except for one time when I was recording something and handed it over to her to use.)She thought that just because the view finder lights up and the screen is showing what you are pointing at that what you see is being recorded. She never hit the little red button. Later when we realized this we were crushed. I do not blame my daughter. Now, here is where I made the worst decision of my life. At this time we are in South Carolina and are between Rock Hills and Columbia. As before, I wanted to see more of the object so since it was behind us I started to look for an overpass again so that we could sit up high and maybe my daughter could get some more footage of this thing. When I took the overpass to the right, stopped at the stop sign then headed left onto the bridge/over pass as we looked at the trees in front of us there was a large glowing hovering bright creamy white object that was about 50 feet wide if not more. I don’t know if it was the same object we had just seen but if it was it had changed color and shape again and was chasing us and waiting for us. As soon as I saw it I slammed on the brakes. I remember hearing the sand and gravel crunch under the tires as I skidded to a stop. I had driven all the way across the bridge and was sitting in the middle of the road on painted lines that showed that ! the lanes were separate. We were in shock. It was at tree level and we could see the outline of the tops of the trees on both sides of the road. I could see that the road we were on went in between those trees and looked like it headed off to the right. There were no lights anywhere on or around this overpass. We were just sitting there, stunned.  Staring at that bright light. When my daughter said, “You aren’t going near that thing? Are you?” I told her no. But, as I realized later; I still wasn’t leaving either. I can’t explain that. I was terrified but I wasn’t leaving. I don’t know how long we sat there. I think it was just a few minutes. Then we were hit with headlights from the right side of us. Someone had taken the exit from North bound side and had pulled up to the stop sign facing right at our car. That snapped me out of it. I took my foot off of the brake and swerved to the right and around to the left to make a u turn in the street and headed for the ramp back to I-77 South. I am ashamed to say that we did nothing to alert the other car. We have no idea if these people saw it or not. All I know is that the object was still there when I took my u turn. I never looked back. Once back on the interstate I drove for quite some time when finally I just had to pull off. By this time it was after midnight. I took a well lit exit and saw a Wendy’s but it was only open for drive through. All of the gas stations were closed. All the while I’m checking the skies. So, I got back on I-77 and looked for another exit. That’s when I saw a Shell station sign and took that exit. It was on the left side so we had to go over the overpass. We could tell it was closed as soon as we came over the overpass. All of the parking lot lights were on but it was closed. I was in pain because my bladder was hurting now. I pulled partially into the entrance of the Shell station and then made a u turn. As I completed the u turn we saw a guard rail right in front of us. At the very end of the guard rail as we were swinging around we saw something  standing there. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it. It was right next to the road. Right next to the door of the car. It seemed to be! bristling. Like it was luminescent in some way, but it was really darkly colored like it was camouflaged. I actually thought it was someone dressed up in that camouflage netting stuff when it moved towards the glass right next to my daughter. She put her hands and arms up over her face and head and tucked her head downwards. That is how close that thing was to her door. I honestly thought it may have been a poacher until I could make out the shape of it. I could see a larger than normal rounded top of a head then it came down to a short little neck area then straight out to both sides to shoulders. (Human shoulders aren’t shaped that way.) Then it’s arms dropped straight down.  The thing that made me realize that it wasn’t human was mostly that it’s waist was only like 8 inches wide and that it was about maybe 4 feet tall.  I could see from the top of it’s head to its hip area through her window.  I remember thinking “It’s so skinny!” Next thing I know we are past it and my  daughter is asking me, “Was that a person?”  I remember looking  back over my right shoulder through the window behind her and still seeing the thing.  It was moving and I had never been so terrified in my entire life.  My daughter said that she didn’t look at it but then moments later she said that it was really thin.  I remember asking her how do you know that if you didn’t look at it?  She still can’t answer that question, but is adamant about not looking at it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and she assures us that the report is sincere.  She will have her daughter submit a supplementary report.  The mother has offered to send two photos she asserts she took of the object(s).  PD)) I somehow find the ramp back to the interstate and just drive. Finally, I spot what looks like a truck stop. I know they are open 24/7. As we take the exit there are semi’s parked to the right side of the exit. As I passed them I could see that it was open and now I had a place to use the rest room.  Even after seeing that thing I had to use the bathroom so I just had to stop.  Once I was finished inside I came back outside to the car.  We sat there for a couple of moments trying to absorb what we had just seen. I didn’t know what time it was then and just got back on the road.  My daughter had to get back home that night because there was no one home to take her three dogs outside to the bathroom.  That is the reason we hadn’t stopped and gotten a hotel. While driving I ran into construction three separate times where signs with arrows pointed us over to the slow lane and the speed limit was only 45.  After the third road maintenance/construction site I had had it.  I told my daughter that I just couldn’t take it anymore.  I had to pull off and get a hotel.  Two exits later we found hotels and stopped for the night.  It was 2:00 AM.  The hotel was in Orangeburg, SC.  We were so shook up that we didn’t get to sleep until 5:00 AM.  We turned all of the lights on in the room and bathroom. We jumped at every little sound.  Even sounds the little refrigerator made.  I woke up at 6:00 AM and realized that we had fallen asleep.  We were both sitting up leaning on pillows stacked up against the headboards.  I finally turned off the room lights when the sun came up enough to light the room. I just can’t get the image of the creepy little thing out of my mind.  Even right now, I can still clearly see it in my mind.  Every time I get the same feeling of outright fear.  We think we were still being followed.  Then again, maybe this creature was separate.  We don’t know. I do guess that the larger lights that we saw were not what we saw change shape.  That object was much, much smaller.  So was the glowing light we saw at that over pass. We are still afraid. Writing this down has taken me all day long.  It’s still very upsetting. We don’t understand why it chose us.  Was it that we were taking too much interest?  Again, that would be totally my fault.  At points during all of this she was begging me to get far away from what we were seeing. All in all it took us four hours to get 1 hour and 43 minutes away.  The time it usually takes to drive from Rock Hill to Orangeburg.  We got off of the road a couple of times but still feel that we are missing time somewhere. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Can you tell me where people who have witnessed a UFO go when they want to speak out loud to someone about what they saw? Do people ever get answers to what happened? It took me about 7 hours to physically write down all of what happened that night. It was very hard to have to keep reliving it so that I could write it down. My daughter and I went over it a hundred times while I was still at her house but now it's like pulling teeth to get her to talk about any of it. She feels that we never should have been there. Never should have seen what we saw and that we shouldn't tell anyone. She doesn't understand why I feel the need to let people know what happened to us. What we witnessed I think it's important! All of it!  I want to know what that ball of light was!  Did it leave radiation in/on her car? What happened to my left ear?  Why is there a ""New"" bump behind my right ear and why does my daughter have one in the same area? Why were my triglycerides through the roof when my blood was tested 7 days after May 5th? They were so high that my doctor called me at home to give me the results. I remember that I was asked by the tech' when my blood was drawn if I was on any blood thinners when he drew my blood. I am not!  I am still very scared at night.  If I have to go outside for something alone at night now, It takes everything I have not to fly into a panic and run when I see any lights moving in the sky.  What if it knows where I am or worse, where my daughter is?  Please, accept my apology for being so rude in my reply to your email before.  I have not been myself lately.

With nowhere really else to report what I experienced, I thought at least I could submit it to you. The morning of May 7th, around 5:45am atlantic time, I am slowly awaking from sleep for no apparent reason.  I am laying in bed listening to this overwhelming sound coming from outside, it's a steady low rumbling hum sound that does not change in tonality it remains constant.  This part is a bit ridiculous, but before I was fully awake and had all of my senses, I remember feeling this great sense of comfort and peace and warmth for no reason but I was attributing it to the sound, like the sound was making me feel relaxed and loved...becoming more awake, and noticing the sound didn't disappear or fade out, a thought popped into my head ""that's a spaceship""....now fully awake, with the sound still as constant and loud, my boyfriend rises up from bed and says ""thats a spaceship!""....at this point, I lost the feeling of love and warmth and actually started to become scared, this whole topic of ufos and aliens is frightening to me and I don't take it lightly....my boyfriend's acknowledgement of the sound brought the whole experience more into reality and I guess it made me feel scared.  I would not let my boyfriend go outside to investigate I was that scared....though he did look out the windows to the skies and saw nothing. No plane, no jet, no helicopter, no street sweepers or garbage trucks, though the sound was nothing like any of those.  The closest to it I guess would be a rocket or a jet but it would mean it would have to be hovering over our apartment building for 10 mins and not passing over.  The sound was very present, like it was right above us, and very constant.   After about ten minutes of pacing and peeping out windows it went away slowly....then came back three minutes later and stayed another three minutes then passed. I reported the incident to my municipality's Facebook page, and then another local news Facebook page. Surprisingly, my post received 80 comments before the admins deleted it (without explanation), and at least a dozen other people had replied that they heard it too, some were outside looking for its source and saw nothing in the skies.  One was as far away from me as Quebec, but she heard it and described it the same as me.  Others were within the tri-city area and another about 60 km away. For what its worth, I grew up 15 mins drive from loring airforce base in Maine, and I am well aware of normal sounds of jet engines flying low over or engines revving up or idling.  I have had people suggest to me maybe it was a street sweeper and in desperation for an answer I checked the block around me that morning and nothing had been swept.  And that still wouldn't explain the woman in Quebec. In case this matters, I have studied UFOs and aliens a bit, the topic has always interested me and I have in the past seen things I can't explain.  I'm also aware that UFOs are almost always silent and rarely reported to have a noise.  This could have been military somehow, I don't doubt thats possible, but my initial intuition and feeling was it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft hovering over my apartment building.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,46.10951755319149,-64.79290186170212

They were blinking, flashing and started to go off and on.  Then all lights came back on and stayed on until craft left area.  It was hovering over Mesa, AZ, for about 30 minutes, then the ufo looked to be out of control, in trouble because it went from hovering to vibrating, bouncing, shaking and spinning wildly, it would go up and then down slightly, and then it turned 180 degrees on its side and and started spinning wildly.  It would alternate between being top up and on its side, but always appeared to be out of control, it was at about 40K ft in the sky, and was about 20 miles west of Apache Junction.  It stayed in that area of the sky and w/in a range of about 5 degrees for over an hour.   After it was in the erratic stage for about 20 minutes, 3 more ufo's arrived on the scene, 2 were the same size as the one in trouble and the other one was a smaller one, the smaller craft flew up under the troubled ufo and then disappeared inside of it, the smaller ufo remained inside the troubled ufo for about 10 minutes, and never exited the craft.  Then all four ufo's left the visible sky.  Just disappeared.

I live on the south side of South Mountain in a condo complex the area had lots of hiking trails and mountain berms.  I hike the trails several times a week mostly in the evening around sunset.  This evening I saw what I classify as a blue orb of some kind.  It turned a little red but mostly blue.  What was amazing it was broad daylight not even close to darkness the sun had set in the western sky behind the mountains, so I call it twilight before darkness.  I hike to a small mountain berm directly behind my complex maybe 200 feet at the top of the berm.  The trail starts out east and I reach a ridge line at around 500 feet, then goes north as a switchback to the north east to the back side of the berm.  After reaching the ridge line I have line of site view to the North and east.  I can see distinctive parts of Tempe, Chandler and Mesa in the distance.  I can also see 4 Peaks and Superstition Mountain in the distance 50 miles from those view points.  I have live in the valley since 1980 and the area very well and have flown in and out of Sky Harbor many times.  This blue orb was at least I estimate to be 5-8 miles off in the distance.  I first noticed in my hike when I reached the first ridge line. As I hiked higher I was able re verify visually where exactly it appeared to be.  It was not is some remote part of the valley but right over very residential part of cities.  The orb would shoot as high and several hundred feet..with no pattern ..like taking a flash light and just shining on a wall and rolling my wrist as if play with a cat chasing the light on the wall.  The orb could shoot strait up and zoom directly back down to the ground as it was playing with the buildings on the ground.  It turn red sometimes but mostly stay blue.  It would disappear completely for several minutes and re-appear.  My hike from the ridge line to next ridge line was to the North and North easterly direction to the next ridge line.   The total time it was viewable was maybe 15 minutes.  I witnessed this from approx. 7:20pm to around 7:36pm.   I went on up to the top of the berm and the lighting condition with the sun had changed..darker..the orb was no longer visible at the top.  I am curios to know it other people sited this event also.   I listen to George Noory Coast to Coast I have heard other reports to the east toward San Tan Valley recently.

I am use to lots of air traffic around here so didn't think to much at first.  Then the orange lights got me and they were not flying in any of the normal flight patterns.  So I went out on my porch to get a better look.  Not an airplane, not a helicopter.  They both were up pretty high but close enough that I could see very clearly that I did not recognize the shape.  I was mostly focused on the orange lights and trying to rack my brain of what aircraft might have those kinds of lights.  There was absolutely no noise.  The craft was silent.  Seemed to be moving along side by side one a tiny bit further back from the other.  I went to get my camera to take a picture, but they were gone when I went back out.  Never seen anything like that before.  Not with orange lights like that.  It was only one bright orange light or a cluster not co! mpletely sure about that.  Just wanted to report what I saw.  No one I know could explain what it might have been.   Because I am a teacher and like my privacy I prefer not to give my name at this time.

The Tempe Arizona sky was clear with many stars and planets visible and moon at 74% illumination. Suddenly at very low level (just above tree tops) a flight was observed moving from southwest to northeast, proceeding in a ""rounded"" zig-zag pattern with quick turns and slight variations in altitude. Initially it looked like a blurry/hazy white ""W"" and I wondered if it were an owl initially.  As it quickly came closer it clearly was not a flight of birds or bats not an identifiable bird; and the ""W"" resemblance was assured, moving with the ""W"" parallel to the ground and moving toward the two points at the bottom of the W.  No typical banking maneuvers were noticed, meaning the object did bank and/or pitch up, just not with the co-ordination nor symmetry associated with fixed-wing aircraft nor fowl. As it neared, still flying erratically, the object looked a muted white even translucent.  The ""W"" was not with sharp lines/edges, rather more rounded and muted/hazy with visible striations fore to aft along its entirety every 5% or so.  The flying ""W"" appeared as one unit, no flapping, no noticeable moving parts, no exhaust or trail of any sort, no lights nor glowing and no noise. The object proceeded to nearly overhead the open patio and as I stood up it quickly altered course and went over/behind a 30' tree (which provided perspective & parallax, so I report it at low level). I walked over under the tree and observed the object completing a turn back toward the tree. As I walked toward it, it turned away and proceeded back on a zig-zagging northeasterly track.  Observer has seen some very large white owls in Arizona, and this was not that.  If it was organic, nothing distinguished it as such.  Observer had previously observed what were deemed ""The Phoenix Lights"" on more than one occasion, including during daylight hours.  This ""W"" is quite unlike those phenomena.

The weather conditions was sunny with no overcast in the sky.   At this time I was driving around a bend when I came to a clearing which revealed the sky, an unknown object and the horizon.  The first thing I noticed was this bright, silver and extremely shiny, metallic and circular object located mid-horizon straight ahead of myself.   This object could not have been missed even if you lacked all attention.  This object seemed to have been hovering probably in the vicinity of 15,000 feet from the ground and was the size of roughly 3-4 times the circumference of a mid-sized commercial jet.  I would of liked to observe this object longer than I had but unfortunately had to drive out of the objects view and then I noticed as my attention came to, a Massachusetts State Trooper at my rear bumper.  I did observe this unknown bright object enough to know that it was completely immobile.  I stared at this object waiting for it to turn to see its profile view in search for wings and or exhaust smoke which failed to show.  I was in awe as I viewed this object and I'm sure the other cars on the highway was too as the traffic was low but yet present.  This object cannot be described as anything but unidentified and as it was airborne/flying I have no issue labeling this anomaly as an Unidentified Flying Object.  I am grateful to have viewed this UFO and would like to see if there are others who have shared this same experienced and will report this.  Anyways, keep your heads up and your eyes wide open.

Then, I saw the object heading East and knew right away it was moving too fast to be a satellite.  After about 3 seconds, the object shot 90 degrees and suddenly stopped.  I thought to myself, ""way too fast to be anything man made yet too slow to be a shooting star or other space garbage.""  Not to mention, it didn't 'burn out'. At that moment, I knew it was not of this world.  The object moved up and down and then headed to a bright star.  I later learned from my phone app, Google Sky Map, the star was Vega located in the constellation Lyra.  I could barely see the object as it seemed to closely orbit Vega.  About three minutes later, the object headed North and I lost sight of it. The whole sighting was as if I was looking at a dim star/satellite that was moving at different speeds.  All I can think of is how fast that object must have been going to travel the distance it did in such a short period of time.   Also, if it was a craft of some kind, how could I see it with the naked eye?  My only conclusion is it travelled through some worm hole?  Maybe it wasn't a craft but a form of energy?

I have heard this sound on many winter nights during intense storms, multiple times at night (when we usually have no aircraft flight patterns.)  It is intensely loud, like thunder, and very slow (the sound can last maybe seven minutes!) I have always assumed it was jets avoiding storm damage by flying at lower altitudes, combined with some effect of the clouds that increases the sound vibration, length and level of jet propulsion noise.  When I realized this was the same sound, I was very excited to finally see what was causing it! It was a beautiful starry night,cloudless, even warm for our area at 65!  I couldn't spot anything off the back deck (southfacing), so I headed for the front porch. Headed almost perfectly north was ""the jet"".  Only, this jet was made up of four white points o! f light at each of its four corners! Yes, four corners!  These light were steady (not blinking). I have never seen a square 737 before! It was traveling ""slowly"", ahh, slower than a commercial plane, at about the cruising height of Cal-star. In it's center was a pulsating red light that looked perfectly ""airplane"" like and rhythmic, except of course, that it was pulsing from in the middle of a very large, very slow-moving square.  It was, as I have already mentioned, very, very loud, but in no way similar to the sound of a helicopter which has a ""choppy"" thunking quality to it. It was not silent, like a drone.  It was deep in tone, steady, and gigantic sounding. It brought to mind aircraft carriers at sea, only flying overhead! It dissappeared at our nearby tree-line, though its sound lingered after I could no longer see it. We live in the rural pacific north-west, sixteen miles inland from the coast.

The object appeared no bigger than a soccer ball.  The shape was very clean, not distorted, a perfect orb or spherical shape. I first assumed the object to be a plastic bag or seagull but the object stopped in midair in what appeared to be 15 – 25 mph winds heading South by South East.  The object was at an altitude higher than a six story building but lower than the aircraft taking off at the nearby San Jose Airport.  Several commercial aircraft, 2 or 3 mostly 737s were visible during this time. The object moved in an erratic behavior dropping 50 – 60 ft and then climbing vertical another 50 – 60 ft.  The object moved right to left in a 50 yard area and then suddenly headed south and vertical in an upward motion at a speed much faster than the surrounding aircraft, birds, or insects that I observed.  Another way to characterize the speed, I have worked closely with F-18 Hornets and have never seen them capable of travelling at this speed. I doubted my observation several times thinking it could be a plastic bag, a bird, a drone, an insect, or even a piece of flying pollen.  None of the above items match the flight characteristics that this odd craft showed as it seemed intelligently controlled, capable of stopping and moving about in any direction, at any speed despite the winds. There were no visible clouds, no light shining on the windows of the building that I observed the object through.  I have never seen anything like it. There was no visible propulsion system, jet intake, propellers, or anything that would indicate the power source this craft used to move about.

My encounter with an alien occurred in the fall of 1983, late October or early November. I was 16 at the time. It was a clear night, chilly, mid 50s, no clouds or wind, with ample moonlight overhead, but not a full moon, about ¾ full. My friend, who lived across the street from me came to my bedroom a little past 1 AM. He wanted me to walk to his girlfriend’s house a couple of miles away.  I wasn’t sleeping, so I agreed.  We spent some time at her house, less than an hour and begin walking back home. We were 4 blocks from our road walking up a road that comes to a T at the end, turning either left or right at the top.  We were about 50 or so feet from the T, walking on the left side of the road.  I had been walking looking mostly at the ground, my friend was maybe 6 feet in front of me.  As we approached the corner I looked up to the street sign the sits 3 or 4 feet on the corner property.  It was there I saw someone or something standing, not 2 feet from the street sign.   I began to slow my walk, not taking my eyes off of it.  My friends head, as best I could tell, didn’t raise up, I assume he hadn't seen it yet.  By the time we were 20 or so feet from it, its head turned right, from facing forward to facing us. My friend still gave no indication he saw it.  My friend was now about 10 feet ahead of me.  I noticed as my friend went around the corner, the head of whatever it was, was slowly turning to follow his motion around the corner, I was maybe 12 feet behind him watching this.  As my friend had finished the corner and began to straighten out, the aliens head was now completely facing left, towards my friend.   At that point it rotated back 180 degrees and was now looking at me.  I continued walking and as I was no more than 5 or 6 feet from it I looked at its face. It was maybe 5 feet tall, it looked a little bit taller do to the fact that the curb was maybe 4 inches tall and he was a couple of feet back from the curb and another couple of inches higher than the curb.  It was gray all over and lean, there was no discernible muscle tone, but very smooth.  Looking at its face, I saw there were indentations where the mouth, eyes and ears would be and a protuberance where the nose area would be.  The scary part was, those features were not there, only the spaces where they should be.  It didn’t look like a mask.  Its head rotated as I went around the corner following me, my head rotated to keep my eyes on it.  We were close enough so either of us could have lunged and grabbed the other.  It didn’t appear to have on a suit of any kind.  There were no visible buttons, zippers or anything that looked like it could get into a suit and fasten it, just smooth all over.  I did notice 2 arms but didn’t look at the hands, couldn’t say if they were human looking or not. After I rounded the corner and my head was turned as far as it could go left, still watching it watching me, I turned forward and jumped and grabbed my friend arm, spinning him around and whisper yelling his name. I didn’t scream since it was nearly 3 AM. in a quiet neighborhood.  As I spun him around to face me I turned back to where it was standing, it was now gone.  He pulled away from me, agitated, and asked me what my problem was, but not that nicely.  I looked around the street sign looking for it, but it was gone.  Between that street sign at the end of the persons property and their house was nearly 100 feet.  I didn’t take more than 2-3 seconds after I looked away from it until I had grabbed my friend, spun and looked back to the spot.  There was nowhere closer than the house to hide. It would have had to move from facing the street to turning and running or moving close to 100 feet in less than 3 seconds.  And even then, there were only small shrubs by the house, nothing ! big enough to hide something that size.  Also, that night was very quiet, no wind, no cars, only the sound of our footsteps in the street. I would have hears something moving that fast, that far. There were no sounds aside from ours. My friend again asked what my problem was. I said nothing, thought I saw something. He apparently didn't see it or it was not visible to him. I never said anything about that night to him. Neither it nor I made physical contact with the other, and no time was lost during the encounter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2014-07-11T00:00:00,,

Myself and 3 friends were in what was called the pit back then, right next to the town dump in Branford Ct.. A The approximate date, 1984, spring time.  We were all in our mid teens 15-16 just driving ages.  One of us had a bit of pot that was very fresh leaves from his plant he grew and couldn't wait for the plant to mature or for the stuff to dry, but we tried lighting it to no avail.  I remember because the subject of drugs came up when I reported this to police.  So we were not high on drugs, but trying!  We were parked facing the dump in the Pit right in the middle of probably 20 acres of dug out land used for fill around town.  So to get in this private property the entrance is a gravel 30 degree shear drop on both sides about 12 feet down into the pit. Not bad enough to kill us but damage or flip if over we went.  Sitting parked trying to light wet weed Frank in the passenger seat yells ""look at that!"" WTF are those things zigzagging over the dump!?  These objects  were shooting lasers at each other and moving around just missing each other by what looked like inches.  Then in a second one was over the car on the passenger side more so I could see it as plain as day it was only 30 ft. up.  It was Egg shaped with sections of colors that were pulsating dim to bright and changing colors from one section to the next.  It was so beautiful I still get a tear in my eyes thinking about how unearthly it was.  I knew it wasn't from this planet.  But the other 3 guys weren't going to stick around to watch what could happen next.  So we started driving out of there.  As we were peeling out Gary in the back said they're all coming together in a ball.  So the other Gary driving the car turned the car around and shot it off, at the gravel entrance facing the bottom of the pit on the 30 degree, as the 4 ufos came together as one incredibly bright light a beam hit the car, the car was going crazy with noise and the lights were flickering on off then the car started moving without it running up the gravel in reverse grinding gears and lights on off radio stations changing all at once crazy!  It was terrifying and then it was over. It was gone that fast.   We were on the road driving is my next memory.  I recall the entire event. I went to the Branford PD the next morning and reported it.  I don't blame the officer for not taking me serious.  Can't say I would have.  Anyway he did say that calls came in about bright lights over the dump.  So that's my story and I'm sticking to it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Somewhat startled I stopped and looked up.  About 300 yards in front of me and a short distance above the trees was a giant white triangle shaped aircraft surrounded by 3 ""balls of light"".  Best way I can describe them. As I first looked up, I had the strangest sensation I've ever had. I didn't think they were UFO's, I just had no idea what I was looking at.  I could almost feel my brain trying to figure it all out. Then I finally realized what it was I was looking at.  The Triangle aircraft was about 3 passenger airplanes in length and maybe 5 stories high. The Triangle aircraft had 2 large red lights in the back and one white light in the front. The 3 lights took up almost the entire bottom of the aircraft.  The red light was blinding bright and gradually dimmed out.  As it dimmed out the 2nd red light came on and again got to be blinding before dimming out.  The white light then proceeded to follow the same pattern and just repeated this sequence the entire 12 mins.  The lights also were not coming from light bulbs. It was much brighter than anything like that. To the rear of the Triangle were 2 balls of light and 1 to the front.  Oddly they  were in a triangle pattern.  I could tell they were made of metal but much too bright to make out a shape.  The Triangle itself had some sort of distortion around the top or it wasn't made of metal if that makes any sense.  I can only compare it to a cloud that appeared to be bubbling.  All the aircraft were silent.  I heard absolutely no sound and that includes the sound around me. Now for the strange part. I was on a jogging trail and I remember a man on a bicycle ride past me.  I looked over at him to ask him to stop and look at this.  I at this time looked over and it appeared as if I was about 3 or 4 feet in the air even though I wasn't.  The bicyclist also appeared to be moving very slow.  I wanted to say something to him and it seemed like he was a million miles away.  The whole thing still creeps me out. At this time I'm standing there and a second Triangle aircraft literally appears out of the thin air and flashed all 3 of its lights and then vanished.  It didn't fly away it seriously just was gone.  It too had the same lights, it was an identical aircraft.  It then again appeared and then vanished and that was the last I saw of that one. After it vanished, I looked back and the 3 balls of light that were there were now gone too. At this time the first Triangle aircraft started to rise very slowly and just kept going and going and going.  I could still see its lights rotating in sequence when it was VERY high in the atmosphere.  It was the first time I realized how high the sky actually is.  I've seen some airplanes real high in the air and this thing was twice as far.  I eventually lost sight of it. I then looked down finally and there about 100 yards in front of me were to Police Officers staring right at me.  I do not know how long they were there or if they saw what I did.  For all I know someone called the Police on the guy standing in the middle of a running trail looking up.  I decided to just quickly leave the area and jogged away.  I have went back to that spot every year since at the same time and have never saw them again. For the record I have no clue if it was Alien or Military.  I'm not far from a very famous Military Base.  What I do know is there are aircraft capable of either turning invisible or vanishing to some other place.  Out of the 5 total UFO's I saw, only 1 flew away.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,27.962023177842564,-82.7516170553936

The time was about 12 minutes after 9 o’clock. We were sitting in the hot tub.  The sky was very clear and cold with lots of stars in the night sky. Three dim red lights passed over us in an almost due north direction.  They did NOT flash like an aircraft’s lights do.  At first we thought we were seeing a shooting star, but there were three lights. There was absolutely NO sound associated with these lights.  They were much dimmer than civil aviation lights. The three lights stayed in the same “formation” the entire time we saw them. The lights moved very fast; much quicker than an airplane; unless said plane was very close to the ground.  If it had been a commercial jet sized plane, it must have been much closer to the ground than the normal flights that pass over this area because the lights were at least twice as wide as a commercial jetliner’s lights appear.  Perhaps it might have been a military aircraft that we were not supposed to see. But it made NO sound. One of the other things that struck me as odd was that the lights, while in a triangular formation, did not look right for a plane to me.  Normally a plane has lights at the end of its wingtips, and another at the tail, and maybe one under its belly or nose.  Such lights clearly delineate the outer edges of the plane. These lights passed over in a skewed triangle.  They did not appear to line up with the direction of travel.  If it was a plane, it appeared to be flying sort of sideways. I listened for a sonic boom, because they appeared to be going very fast, even for a low level plane; but they made no sound. I’ve seen a lot of things in the skies before, but nothing ever looked like this. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report is well known to our Center, and we consider him to be highly reliable.

As I was driving home from a friend’s house just after 4:00 am during the month of March in 2013, I observed an event traveling extremely low (just above the trees) and silently above my car. I proceeded to stop my car to watch the event. The location was Huntsville, Alabama on Whitesburg Drive between Byrd Spring and Four Mile Post Road. I clearly observed three yellow-white lights in a triangular formation around a central red light. They were on an object (presumably triangular, though I did not have time to discern a clear outline) that I could observe because there were no stars visible between the lights. There was absolutely no sound associated with the event, and I presume it could not have been any sort of conventional aircraft due to this fact and the altitude of flight (again, just above the trees on the corner at which I stopped). The event passed slowly overhead until it passed out of view. I exited my car to look, but I could no longer see the event or any evidence of its passing. Although I cannot estimate the size of the event too accurately, it was well over twenty feet across by my best guess. As a note, I do not tend to acknowledge the existence of extraterrestrials here on Earth, and I know of no sort of powered flight that could run so low and silently. This is why I refer to this phenomenon as an “event” rather than a “craft” or “object.” I can provide no explanation as to the cause of this event, however. I am currently a student studying fields of natural sciences, so I tend to favor no explanation rather than one that is fantastical in my opinion. I am somewhat familiar with what I would categorize as “U.F.O. lore,” but I do not treat it as fact. I have never used illegal drugs, and I was neither on prescription medication nor was I intoxicated at the time of this event. This was my first and only encounter with an event of this type.

We were on the deck looking south when we both noticed a red orb in the sky, stationary, just above the tree line towards the southeast.  It had a presence that seemed unusual. My g/f said at the time ""it must be a NYE blimp"".  We did not get a picture.   I thought it might just be a blimp too, but it wasn't moving. It was stationary, but kind of hovering like a blimp would, and gently pulsing.  It was much bigger than any star in the sky. We would estimate the size to be about 3x that of Jupiter- easily.   We went back in after a couple minutes because it was cold.  Two weeks later when I read an article saying that multiple other witnesses had seen the same red/orange orb(s), I knew that what we'd seen was not a blimp, because throughout the southeast part of the stat! e (it was southeast in the sky) people had seen what I'd seen.

It flew a straight line and could even possibly be the International Space Station, although it really didn’t look like the ISS.

This was told to two of us by the person who witnessed the event.  He was a mechanical engineering major, an honor student, and quite sober minded.  He never drank or used drugs.  He passed away two years ago.   He had returned after the Thanksgiving holidays.  He spent the holidays hunting on a large lease located between San Antonio & Laredo.  Deer hunting stops in Texas 30 minutes after dusk (I believe).   He left his blind and walked to the gravel road to wait for his dad to pick him up.  He saw a single light quite a distance down the road and figured his dad had broken a headlight driving through the brush.  (This was a huge ranch covered with brush and prickly pear & numerous inside cross fences.)  As it neared, he realized it was too high to be a pick-up light.   As it kept coming up the long hill, following the road, he realized it was too orange, and too large.  He steps behind a clump of brush and watches.  The light gets to a cross fence and cattle guard, stops a few seconds and makes a 90 degree turn and follows the fence line.  It is about a foot above the fence or 6 feet above the ground.  The size is about 3 or 4 inches larger, in diameter, than a basketball.  There is no wind.  The object makes no sound.  He said it was moving about the speed of a man jogging.  He was quite baffled by what he saw.  The orange was from an inner glow that stayed the same intensity. In 2000, a co-worker and I were driving from Ft.  Worth to Houston.  The news station we were listening to reported a UFO sighting.  After a few questions, he told me of an experience he and his cousin had while deer hunting in the lower Rio Grande Valley.  The year was in the early seventies.  His cousin flew helicopters in Viet Mam, My co worker worked on B-52s in SE Asia,  a rancher had allowed these two returning veterans to hunt on his property.  He suggested a huge misquote tree on a pipeline easement.  One hunter looked one direction, the other watched the other.  Near dusk, my friend noticed a light coming toward them.  He called it to the attention of his cousin. ""Here comes a chopper checking the pipeline.""  They usually fly the lines every week.  His cousin waited a minute or so and said, ""That's not a chopper."".  Eventually the sphere got to the tree they were in and stopped for a minute or two.  Then it heads on down the pipe line easement. The description was exactly the same as what my college roommate saw 7-9 years earlier and about 200 miles to the northwest.  I said, ""I've heard this story before."" He said, ""No way! I've never told anyone, including my wife.""  Then I told him of my roommate.  I myself am 71 years old and have never seen anything.  I have majors in chemistry, biology, biochemistry & marketing.  I have minors in math and physics.  I know these guys saw something they cannot explain.",,,

Now, however, there was a street light and new asphalt.  Still, the road was quiet, deserted, the few homes set back in the trees of their large lots.  The ((name deleted--the neighbors')) yard looked like a park, like a glen in a small wood, a sylvan stand, idyllically bathed in the pale golden glow of the single street-light, high as the moon on its pitchy pole. But what to my amazed eyes then happened.  Something so strange and unexpected, so bizarre.  For years, I was unable to speak words to give my listeners an understanding of what I saw.  Now, thanks to 30 years of ""special effects"" and Sci-Fi technology, I can come closer.  Have you ever seen a film where travelers in future civilizations ""wink"" in and out of locations?  There seems to be a slit in the air and they step through?  Well, this is something akin to what I witnessed.  What I saw was the scene that I had been watching, the still, pastoral night-woods, ""freeze"" momentarily and become like a painting of itself.  From behind this ""set"", this ""prop"" false-front stepped a dozen or more people. They were intently walking, fast and purposefully, toward our yard.  They streamed out from ""nowhere"" like they were getting off a bus back there.  Crossing our yard, they went to the edge of our grove.  I sprang up and went out the porch door and toward their destination in our yard.  They were going up.  Whatever they were climbing, I couldn't see it.  But I got in there, in behind them, and went up, too. Now, none of these folks were talking to one another.  It didn't seem like they were social or maybe they were just tired and everyone seemed to be giving each other some ""private"" space.  I was then in a small, round-shaped room; the light was pale gray.  I left that room through a large opening into a curving hallway.  On the outside of the hallway, that is, the larger side of the curve, were doorways.  The walls, the ceiling, were pale gray, very clean, very empty, very evenly-lighted.  The doorways to the apartments were set up about 8 inches off the hallway floor.  You had to step up to enter them.  The doors sealed tightly.  Everything seemed fitted, metal, cool. One such doorway was open.  I looked in.  The room was surrounded in floor-to-ceiling bookcases, filled with books.  A wooden room-divider, a set of shelves with no backing back then known as an “étagère”, extended from the wall beside the door for about three feet, straight into the room.  I stepped up into this ""apartment"", and saw, in a glass dish on one of these shelves, a painted rock.  The rock was a smooth one on which was painted in yellow an area like the shape of the state of Virginia, and in black the words ""Souvenir of Virginia"".  Just then, a woman stepped through the doorway at the far side of the room from me. She was  no one I knew.  I still can see her face, and I don't believe I've ever met her before or since.  She had medium-length hair, straight, auburn, cut in a ""page-boy"" style.  Her clothes were classic business attire.  She would have fit in at any American office, from 1950 to today.  She seemed surprised to see me there, but she did not speak.  Rather, I seemed to hear her thoughts.  They went: ""Oh!  You shouldn't be here.  My husband is coming up soon, and he'll take you back.""  After this, I have no memory except of finding myself in my bed at home. But, I do not think this was a dream.  I am writing this in 2002, over thirty years have passed, since it occurred in 1968.  It was not dream-like.  I was not asleep when it started.  I have never seen reality ""shift"" to a cartoon of itself and people come out from ""behind"" the scene before or after.  Only on recent Sci-Fi shows is there anything similar to this.  This woman was no one to me.  I cannot place any of these images as relating to my life then; I get no meaning from souvenir rocks and no association with ""Virginia"".  These images were from outside of me, not from my mind and concerns.  It was not a dream.  I clearly remember getting up from bed and running out the door to the grove. I want to comment on her attitude toward me.  It was the way we who are compassionate, treat wildlife.  Not like we treat a pet, but like we treat an intruder who is probably harmless if handled properly, something we don't want invading our ""home"" and we wouldn't kill it... unless that became necessary.  But certainly NOT like one of ""us"", and certainly like a ""problem"" to be dealt with, an inconvenience and an impropriety. The communication was there, but it was all one way.  There was no ""who are you? what are you doing here?""  I was TOLD I was not supposed to be here and that I would be ""taken care of"" and soon.  Maybe I'm being a bit precipitous.  Maybe her attitude was like the way civilians are treated when they innocently enter off-limit areas controlled by the military. Above written 3-31-2002  Since this was written, I have re-thought how the vehicle which the commuters took may have been hidden.  Perhaps it was capable of mimicking its background the way some fish take on the color and pattern of the sea floor to escape detection by predators?  I happened to witness the craft ""gelling"" into its new, fixed location and when its ""door"" opened and let the passengers debark, they appeared to step from behind the scenery which had been placed in front of the nearly-identical scene. How did it arrive at this spot without my seeing it in contrast to the background?  Could it have been invisible, immaterial prior to my seeing it ""gel""?  Could it have come up from below?  If so, how did it do so without disturbing the ground?  Perhaps it arrived so quickly that it seemed to appear instantaneously?

In the Fall of 1973, I was taking a doctoral course two nights a week at Baylor Univrsity in Waco.  The class was from 7 to 8:30PM.   Coming home in the first part of the week in late September or early October, I saw a low, bright light over Lake Waco.  I concluded it was either a helicopter or the planet Venus.  However, two nights later, I saw the same thing; so I decided to investigate. As I approached the bridge going over Lake Waco, I could the craft hovering over Lake Waco just near what is known as Speegleville Park.  After going west over the bridge, I took the next exit which brought me down into the Park; but as I approached where the craft appeared to be stationary, it turned off its bright lght and began to move to the southwest.  It crossed in front of me and went over the highway; so I decided to follow it. I could see it settle down in a clump of woods just on the other side of the highway.  I crossed over the highway and slowly drove by the wooded area.  The road curved to the southeast; and I went up about seventy yards passed the spot, pulled over and stopped.  I turned off my lights but left my engine running. I watched in my reawview mirror for a few moments when I could see the craft rising slowng and coming in my direction.  It pulled up to my right just on the other side of the fence not far from a telephone pole.  I figured it was no more than 50 feet off the ground at most.  It was black in color, trangular in shape, about 30 feet in lenght and 20-25 feet in width.  I could see the cockpit with a green hue inside and three small heads peering down at me. I hadn't been there more than 5 minutes when the craft shown a green light down that engulfed my little VW Fastback.  My engine died and all electrical devices would not work.  I tried restarting the engine and tried turning on my lights and radio to no avail.  It was then I became alarmed and locked my doors. I kept trying to restart my engine every few minutes.  Finally, after about 15 minutes, it turned over.  I went down the road for about another 75 yards before turning on my lights and doing a U-turn. As I past where the craft was stationed, it made no attempt to follow me; and I could still see it when I got back on the highway.  At no time could I hear any sound nor see any moving parts.  During that week, the weather was clear and there was enough light to be able make out tree shapes and anything in the sky. About 3 years later, I saw the same lihgt hovering just about the lights in the south end of a LaVega high school football game.  I wanted to go closer to craft to show my wife and children who were with me; but my wife didn't want me to go chasing UFO's.  Having spent two years in the AFROTC and two years in the U.S.Army and flew a couple of times in a helicopter, I knew the craft that I saw in 1973 was not anything that the U.S. or any country had the time.  I even held a Top Secret Clearance while in the military; therefore, I wasn't one to be the subject of delusions. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in 1973 is approximate.

Just before 10pm, I was driving my friend back to Galesburg from Kalamazoo, MI.  As I usually do, I turned South onto Fullerton Ave from West Michigan St. to drop him off.  He opened the door to get out, but then we both noticed a glowing red orb in the sky ahead of us, just over the trees, on the left side of the road.  The object looked to be at least a few blocks away. I said, ""What is that?""  My friend replied, ""Maybe it's just a plane?""  We both got a peculiar feeling.  He closed the door and we drove South down Fullerton Ave toward the object.    Luckily, there's an empty field a block away on the South side of Blake Blvd, adjacent to where we parked the car on Fullerton.  We turned East at the intersection of Fullerton Ave and Blake Blvd and parked the car on the South side of Blake Blvd, next to the field.  When we pulled up we realized the object was closer than we thought and was more or less hovering over the field. We then began observing  a decent sized object that looked like a ball of fire in the sky. My friend and I agree that we observed the following: It flickered somewhat like a candle and was bright orange.  The object was very low to the ground and looked to be well below the cloud ceiling at 1k-3k.  The sky was completely overcast at the time.   The object we observed did not have wings, a tail, any visible means of propulsion, any cylindrical shapes, right of way lights, strobe lights, a propellor, jet engines, etc.  The object was not an airplane, helicopter, ultra-light aircraft, etc.  It didn't resemble any known aircraft.  The only light coming from the object was an overwhelming red/orange/amber glow that flickered and didn't appear to be attached to anything, but was the object itself.   The object wasn't blowing around in the wind, like a chinese lantern, but seemed to be hovering around very slowly, under it's own control.  The wind speed at the time was 7 mph from East to West.  The object didn't make a sound; it was completely silent the entire time we observed it.  As we started walking toward the object, it appeared ! to be hovering Northeast, in a straight line.  However, my friend says the object was flying Southesat in a straight line.  We demonstrated to each other that we both knew which direction North was from where we were.   We don't know how to reconcile the difference in direction, but agree the object was hovering in straight lines.  I estimated its angle of elevation to be 40-45 degrees at the time.  It remained at a near constant angle of elevation.  Twice or three times during the time we observed it, it appeared to stop and remain stationary for short periods of time. I turned on my cell phone camera and began running toward the object to take pictures.  My friend stayed closer to the car and continued observing.  We watched the object flicker for a short time, getting brighter and dimmer while hovering around.   I snapped two pictures.  They're both time-stamped at 9:57 pm.  The object appears in both the shots, though the lighting is poor.   After I took the pictures, the object appeard to move in a short straight line and got dimmer.  When it did, my friend and I simultaneously got a distinct feeling the object was going to disappear, though he and I hadn't said anything.  The object then remained stationary, got incrementally dimmer and faded out. Later on, at 11:30pm, I had driven back to Kalamazoo and to work for the night.  We hadn't had a chance to talk about what we'd seen, as I didn't want to be late for work at 11:00pm.  My friend and I got online and started taking about it.  In discussing what we'd seen, my friend said, ""It was weird when I knew it was going to disappear.""  I agreed with him.  I felt the same thing.  Then we realized we'd had that feeling at the same time, as if we'd had the same thought or feeling ""together"" somehow.  We agree that whatever happened to us was very strange and very difficult to describe.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,42.2888,-85.385

It was what some might call a fire ball or orb of light, but there was something else going on as well. Before I continue let me say that I live near a military air station, as well as a smaller but busy local airport. I am accustomed to seeing all manner of aircraft, both at night and during the day, such as; Osprey (with the rotors up like a helicopter), giant military transport planes, light/personal aircraft, small personal jets, fighter planes, and helicopters of all kinds.  I know very little about aviation but this was nothing I had ever seen before. This event happened in the eastern sky, and appeared to be fairly close.  It lasted about 10-12 seconds total, but was already happening when I looked up.  At first I thought what I was seeing was a meteor falling and burning up very close to the ground.  There seemed to be debris falling and burning up in the sky like something breaking up. However, after maybe half a second or so, I noticed two things.  1) It was not falling but stationary.  2) The brightest point of light was at the top.  At that point I thought maybe a firework. The debris, for lack of a better word, was almost “dripping” from the ball/orb of light.  It seemed to have a liquid quality to it.  Not at all like what you would associate with a firework.  It almost looked like burning/melting plastic being poured or dripping/falling into the night sky. I then thought maybe it was a lantern burning up and the dripping was just thin paper on fire and swirling around, and the ball/orb of light was the heat source for the lantern.  But the ball of light remained stationary and the “liquid fire” kept falling; so much that it would be hard to believe this was all paper from a lantern or that the lantern would even be able to maintain its elevation while loosing that much of its structure.  The same would go for any aircraft. It was just so much fire.  It also did not seem to be consistent with what I have witnessed as a flare. At this point it has been maybe 3-3.5 seconds.  The origin of the “liquid fire” began to glow very bright and appeared to grow larger.  It also, at this point, started to pulse alternating between a dimmer light red-orange color and a full, bright true-orange color.  The “liquid fire” increased in volume and also seemed to pulse along with the ball/orb of light. It stayed this way, very bright, for a couple of 2-3 seconds and then the dripping “liquid fire” stopped.  The ball/orb grew even brighter and more well defined. It pulsed a couple more times; finally sticking with the red-orange color, and shot off heading east at a very high rate of speed.  I could see it for 3-4 seconds before it was too small to be visible anymore. There was no sound that I would say could be attributed to this event.  This is in a suburban area and near a highway so there is ambient noise.  However, it is also in a valley and air traffic is usually amplified not muffled or masked.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

He and I are both 34 year old college educated males.  We both work nights (I've been a full time firefighter EMT-B  for 7 years), so it's not unusual for us to go out in the CT river or on the Mattabasset all night and stay out sometimes into the next day until almost lunchtime.   I am (or was) a UFO skeptic.  Always have been.  He is a believer.  I usually roll my eyes and laugh at some of the things he's said he's seen in the past.  But this came out of nowhere.  We weren't looking for it.  We were trying to catch some bass.  No drinking or substances involved.  Just glad to be not at work with no obligations and fishing finally. We started the trip from the Portland Fairgrounds...  May or may not be entirely right to launch from where we did, but it was getting late and we wanted to get in.  Both of us have bright LED's that illuminate the surrounding water and trees.  We put the fishing off to head way down river (south).  I kept asking when we were going to be at this ""spot"" my friend had fished in the past.  Was a long trip down river.  Probably a few miles.  So when we saw what we both saw, we may have been near Portland, Cromwell, Rocky hill, Wethersfield, Glastonbury...  I'm not 100% sure.  But local fisherman have nicknamed the spot ""the peninsula"".  It's an island in the middle of the river near ""Perzold's Marine/Marina"".  We were heading to the back side the peninsula (downstream). Still in the middle of the CT river, We both saw something in the sky to the East.  It was bright white, big, crescent shaped, appeared suddenly and went down diagonally and to our left, moving very fast, until it disappeared behind the tree line.  We both said ""Whoa!""  At the same time. We talked about it afterwards and I kept thinking of things it could've been but they all turned out to be impossible.  Closest I could think of would've been a comet or shooting star... But this was too big, too white, no tail, & too fast.  It happened very quickly and was gone. So we kept moving.  Our moment of wonder was soon replaced by the fact that we were at the peninsula and it was time to fish now.  My friend went to shore and started a fire on the beach area.  I kept paddling and casting near the shore for a bit before heading over.  I got out and we got a small fire going.  (Fire ordinances don't apply if you're in the middle of the river just before sunrise and don't know exactly what town you're technically in... right? Lol)...  Then it got wierd enough to remember for a long time and even report on here (I can't believe I'm doing this btw.)... I was standing by the fire.  For some reason I got the urge to look back over my right shoulder and up at the sky...  Why?  Because something was there.  That's the only reason I can think of why I'd look. I had already forgotten about the other event.  I looked up and saw a strange light moving a great distance at a medium pace, steadily in a straight line towards us across the sky (was heading west toward the Wethersfield side of the river.)  Things then escalated to wierd level 2: the thing had one bright light.  And as it got closer to being over head the light got dimmer and dimmer until it vanished completely. No clouds. Perfectly clear, still dark, just before dawn. It was gone. I turned my head back to my friend who was over on the left casting his line into the water. I quickly told him what I just saw and how wierd it was. He turned to look at me as I was talking. I looked up at the sky again and what we saw next made us both yell out profanities at exactly the ! same time. Diagonally In front of us, slightly northwest but just overhead, something shot across the sky faster than anything man made can move and in a way that stars, comets, or anything like that can move. This display, to me had ""technologically advanced machine"" written all over it. It made a line in the sky visible for less than a second. It was bright white and shaped like an archer's bow. Fast as hell and bright white. But this time, it didn't disappear afterwards. It looked as if it went hundreds of miles in a second to the north, and then stopped and hovered just above the tree line. And as it hovered it turned towrard us. And then it was possible to see more of its shape. It wobbled like a saucer as it turned toward us and then sat in a fixed position ""watching us"" as we fished. The front view it allowed us showed a multicolored string of lights around its cylindrical, saucer shaped perimeter. It say there for a while in the sky just before s! unrise, almost as if it was waiting for us to come to terms wi! th what we both saw, talk about it, and get comfortable with it to the point that we could just fish, know it's there, talk about it, and move on... Which is what we did basically. I've texted and talked about it with him in person since it happened just to verify the reality of it. I was completely blown away. There was no way I could dispute this or write it off as something else. He's happy because he ""won"", in that sense. But all I can think about now is wanting to see more. And I feel like a gift of knowing there's some other beings up there has been given to me. Pretty awesome. Next trip, I'll have my iPhone ready to take pics instead of tucked away in the watertight box I keep it in. Have even thought about getting a telescope. I'm amazed. That's all I can say.

I then saw an orb pass the plane & followed it until it was gone.  I thought since I saw this one, maybe there's a decent chance I'll see another if I hike up the hill near where I live & bring the video recorder.   I was up there for a few hours & saw one other orb that was larger, slower & I believe closer for a short time.  I took some videos of planes passing & there really wasn't anything very exciting.  Then again, I could hardly see the screen in daylight, even with something I brought to cover my head with the screen.  I wrapped it up & went home.   Then dropped the footage in a video editor.  I viewed a short clip of a plane in the distance that was a bit shaky & short, I was about to hit the delete button, then thought first I'd zoom in on the plane first.  I'm glad I did wow.  I saw an object facing the pilots in flight, but then thought it might be a speck on the lens or screen.   So I continued looking frame by frame & the object was still there.  When I toggled through the frames, the object appeared to be blinking.   I was still not convinced because it was faint.  But then, on ONE particular frame, the object got very bright & much larger with some detail.  My jaw literally dropped, I gasped & covered my mouth.    I submitted it on a popular video site.  I show it in the editor including placing some textures to show it & some frame by frames.  It's quite amazing.   I thought this could be quite a big deal since the Malaysia flight 370 disappearance.   Also, while I was editing the video, I was listening to KFI radio & they announced that there was an ""accidental chute deployment"" which was causing the plane to have to be diverted from going to John Wayne Airport, which is where this plane & UFO were headed.   When you view the footage, clearly there is no way the pilots didn't see what was right in f! ront of them.  So maybe we got this on radar?   At least at the ! very minimum, the pilots MUST have told the control tower what they were seeing.   Maybe that flight diversion was on purpose to avoid a danger like what happened to the Malaysia plane?",2014-07-11T00:00:00,33.534344000000004,-117.705338

I noticed a bright white ""star"" that was moving from southwest to the south east.  At first I thought it was the I.S.S. as it was a at least as bright if not brighter than that object,but it was moving notably faster in my estimation. Then I remembered according to NASA ""Spot the Station "" the station was not visible from my location on July the 3rd. I went back inside to get my Binoculars (less than half a minute), but it was gone by the time I returned. NOTE:  The I.S.S. will not be visible till about the middle of this month. If this was not the I.S.S., I have no idea.  Satellites do not move that fast, and meteors look different and move faster.

It had a greenish glow to it and was very very still, like a picture.   At the end of the road there was some gas stations and pharmacies, and I'm sure there were cars next to ours.

I reached my home and had planned to sit outside on my dock to watch the meteor showers the sky was clear and I was anticipating the event. I was outside sitting on my bench texting a friend about the upcoming event when from my left hand side I caught site of the red object approaching my dock at roof level crossing  the adjoining neighbors docks coming straight towards me. I became frightened and immediately phoned my son and spoke to him about what was occurring. the object was still coming closer and I told my son I was going to film it with my cell phone which I did.   It stopped at roof top level at my next door neighbors dock and stood still.( I captured this on video) I then decided to go inside because I became afraid of the unknown object.  I called my son  as I came in the house and he suggest I call the police I did not and looked outside through the window facing my neighbors dock and the object was gone. I had a snack and settled down for about 20 mins and decided to go back outside to observe the meteor showers. Within 15 minutes, the object appeared in front of me in the middle of the lake and rapidly move forward till it reach the end of my 55 ft dock.  It hovered about 10 ft off the water surface I could now clearly see it had changed shape and became a triangle aprox 6x6x6 ft with rotating glowing orbs in each corner.  I was very scared and did not have my phone to take a picture I then heard voices from a few houses down saying something to the effect do you see that I heard them running down their dock and they proceeded to  their boat to where the object was as they got closer the object backed up to the middle of the lake quickly and then went up and over a house across the lake.  They did not notice me sitting there and the next day they stated that they had seen the same thing near my dock. I did go inside and called my friend and informed him of what I had seen I did not get a picture of the object as my phone was in the house .after talking with him for approx. 30 minutes, I forget that I had left my coffee cup outside on the dock and went to retrieve it.  As I glanced up in the sky, an object appeared about 13 stories in the air and moved quickly North across the sky and dropped behind a house at the end of the lake. this object was red in color and about 6 feet long cigar shaped.

Here's my report to MUFON:  I am a Sergeant with a state police agency; while on patrol on a side street near the 8700 block of north Milwaukee Avenue in Niles, Illinois, on the evening of Thursday, 07/03/2014, at approximately 2315 hours, my eye was caught by two (2) pulsing round red lights in the SW sky, one on top of the other, which appeared to be a cell or water tower in the vicinity of Maryhill Cemetery.  This caused me to do a complete double-take, because I know there are no such structures in that area.  When one of the objects began moving slowly from west to east, and the other followed in a ""wing-man""-type formation (slightly behind and further south than the object to the forefront), I thought, because of their basketball-like appearance and large size, that they were helicopters of the ""bubble-cockpit"" variety, flying low on the southern horizon.  I parked my squad car and shut off my engine and all lights, and exited my squad car to observe the aircraft.  As soon as I got out of my car, I realized that these were not helicopters, and were much farther away and larger than I originally thought.  There was no helicopter sound whatsoever in the relatively quiet night air, and the presence of many airplanes in the sky (Niles and Park Ridge are under major flight paths in and out of O'Hare) provided me with an excellent contrasting point of reference to what the UFOs at least ""were not.""   The objects glided eastbound, slowly and deliberately.  They were basketball-sized spheres, approximately 5-times the size of the strobe lights on an airplane, with a shimmery white halo completely circling the sphere.  The red light was unlike anything I have ever seen, having a pulsating, almost ""liquid"" or ""living"" appearance, and glowing, rather than piercing the night sky.  The white light appeared like an aura (similar to the heat you see emanating from a rocket or jet engine).  I was awestruck! When the first craft was almost directly in front of my line of sight, the spheres both suddenly ""receded"" quickly up and into the western sky (back where I first saw them, but much higher).  The UFO that was offset to the rear disappeared so quickly that I barely had time to register that it was gone.  The craft that was more ""in the lead"" receded up and back to the point that it looked like a red star, and then blinked out of sight.   I saw that there were two adult male citizens, one African-American and one Caucasian, looking up at the sky from a residential driveway across the street and south of my location.  I approached them and we all verbally confirmed that what we had seen had not been fireworks or flares of any kind, but were definitely very large, unidentifiable aircraft.    We were all very excited.  I remember that my emotions were in a ""condition red"" or ""high alert"" status - I remained in this psychological state for many hours after the sighting.  The African-American citizen kept repeating ""warp speed! they took off into space at warp speed!""   Two things I would like to point out are that, 1)  for the 20 minutes or so prior to this sighting, I was unable to connect to the internet on both my Blackberry cell phone or my in-car Panasonic Tough Book Laptop with Verizon air card.   Five minutes after the spheres ascended out of sight, both my telephone and in-car computer came back online. 2.  I did not think to take photos of the craft because the camera on my Blackberry produces very poor quality photos.

Illustrationally speaking for a mental image, a flight path from Dallas, Texas, to New York City. As the jet neared closer, I noticed an odd object behind it.  I didn't think much of it until it got closer.  The jet didn't pass directly over me, it probably was (roughly) an eighth of a mile South. As it got closer to passing over, I noticed the object trailing about (roughly) a half mile behind it, on the exact same path, flying at about the same speed.  I was in T- Total shock!

I could hear fireworks going off so I was standing in my driveway looking at the sky to see if I could spot any fireworks before we embarked on our ride.   The sky was overcast with cloud cover so I couldn't make out any stars yet and I couldn't really see anything BUT cloud cover.   If there was a plane in the sky, I guarantee I would not have been able to see it.  It was that overcast.   Right when I got out into the driveway, I looked towards the east (the direction of where I take my dog on her nightly run) and immediately saw a bright red sphere in the sky, slowly moving/hovering.   I thought it was strange because it was SO overcast- it stood out because it was the only thing visible in the eastern sky besides cloud cover that I could see.   It was NOT a firecracker or firework.  I saw fireworks later in the evening and they were nothing! like this.   The red sphere was large- about the same size as the sphere I'd seen on New Years Day of this year at 12:05am.  About the size of Jupiter x 3.   The sighting only lasted about 30 seconds.  It stood out as a bright red orb, it hovered, and pulsed, about 25 degrees from the horizon (low).  Then it began to slowly descend, and then it began to flicker out like a candle would.  The red color started to get dimmer and dimmer before it disappeared completely- exactly like a candle would when it burns out.  Or when a light bulb is at it's end.  It ""flickered out"" is the best description I can give.  I immediately knew that this was unusual because of how overcast the sky was.   It was completely silent- no noise at all.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,38.34323901098901,-122.70405054945056

We are sky watchers and enjoy looking for anything in the night sky, i.e. satellites, airplanes, stars, and the moon phases, so we recognized immediately that we were observing something very different.   As we watched it slowing, silently come towards us, my husband said, “What could that be?”  We speculated this and that but really was at a loss as to what it could be.  I mentioned maybe it was a drone but there were no navigational lights as required by the FAA at night, just a soft orange glow traveling in a deliberate path obviously not just something drifting in the wind.   It was low, about the height of the fireworks that were going off, lower than a small airplane but higher than the treetops.   As it came adjacent to where we were watching, it made a 45 degree right turn toward the south.  A couple of minutes later another one came from the east and also made a left turn to the south as it came adjacent to our position.   A few minutes later, one came back from the south, either one of the first two returning or a different one and it continued to the left over our house and to the north out of sight.

""Presence"" in daughter's doorway. 		MY EXPERIENCE: 	In the early morning hours of May 12, 2014 (after 1:30 AM when I went to bed but before 2:00), I awoke to an intense sound of extremely low frequency throbbing that seemed to fill my bedroom.  In fact the low frequency throbbing--repeating approximately every one second--seemed to vibrate my entire body.  It was as if I was immersed in a vibrational field that permeated me, as opposed to the sound propagating through the room from one direction or another.  Yet nothing else in the room was apparently vibrating, not even the windows. 	This sound was unlike anything I'd ever heard or felt before. 	I found the low-frequency throbbing to be extremely agitating to the point of being intolerable. So I was compelled to get out of bed to locate the source. I'm on the 2nd floor of a 3-story condo unit so I initially thought the sound might be caused by someone in a unit above, below or beside mine -- from WHAT I had no idea. The sound was totally unlike anything I could identify. 	As usual, my bedroom door was closed, having to open it to check things out. But as I walked around the dark condo I could not locate the direction of the source of the sound, which appeared to be uniform in intensity throughout the 2-bedroom, 2-bath condo. The sound did not appear to be coming from any perceivable location -- either outside the condo or inside from adjacent units. 	My daughter slept in the middle bedroom with her little dog and, glancing in, I did not see any movement. 	While I'm usually of a rather calm, deliberative nature (being a scientist), this low frequency throbbing nevertheless agitated me in a way that is difficult to describe -- more so than, say, from someone using a subwoofer above or below me which can cause the floor or ceiling to resonate. The emotion I felt was not so much from being incensed that someone would make such noise in the middle of the night. Instead it was from the sensation of my body being violated in a bizarre manner. I was having a reaction like I would if I suddenly discovered that I was covered in leaches but wasn't able to remove any of them. 	Unable to locate any likely source of the sound -- which was of constant pitch, intensity and periodicity -- or conjure up a hypothesis as to its bizarre nature -- I reluctantly went back to bed. 	I must add that when I initially awoke to the sound it was as if I had only slept for a moment -- awaking from a blank, dreamless state. Likewise, I have no idea how long I lingered awake after returning to bed. It was as if someone flipped a switch and suddenly it was morning. This is quite unusual for me when I usually remember multiple dreams every night. 	Subsequently, I was amazed to discover, upon listening to ""Coast-to-Coast"" radio at 1:20 AM on May 30th, that another person (in Pryor, Oklahoma) had experienced this same low-frequency throbbing that he said ""vibrated through me!""   	--MY DAUGHTER'S EXPERIENCE --  	I didn't mention anything about this bizarre phenomenon to my daughter that morning, other than asking her why her dog was sleeping in the hallway. That was when she asked me: ""Were you standing in my doorway last night?"" Puzzled, I replied: ""No, why would I do that???"" Looking disturbed, she said: ""SOMEONE was standing in my doorway last night and it creeped me out!"" 	 	Asking her to explain, she said she woke up a few minutes after 2 AM to go to the bathroom, using her cellphone light to navigate. Curiously, her dog was not in bed with her but was instead standing at the end of the hallway, next to my closed bedroom door. She picked him up and carried him back to bed with her, only to have him immediately jump down and nervously pace the room before running out. This highly unusual behavior spooked her, as the dog is a creature of habit, sleeping with her all night, EVERY night during the 2 years we've had him. 	At that point she perceived a dark presence standing in her doorway -- apparently on the threshold of her perception -- and in a panic she shined her cellphone light at it but it was gone. But when she turned the cellphone light off, she could sense the dark presence lurking there again. 	Frightened, she turned on her nightstand lamp and again the figure was gone. Eventually she got up to see if maybe I was up and about (and maybe playing a trick on her). She saw that my bedroom door was closed (as usual), but that her dog was now curled up on the hallway floor in front of my door. This is something he only does when my daughter is having a sleep-over with a girlfriend, or when her boyfriend is in watching TV with her and I don't want the dog in my bedroom. Otherwise, at bedtime, the dog dashes into her bedroom to sleep with her on her bed -- all night long. 	So that particular night, the dog was acting like there was someone in my daughter's bedroom! But because the terrier wasn't barking or hiding under the kitchen table, he was reacting as if the presence were benign -- as he does with my daughter's friends. At such times he comes into my bedroom to be with me. I must emphasize, the dog will NOT stay in my daughter's bedroom when ANYONE else is in there (except for me). 	My daughter went back to bed, leaving her night-stand light on and barely sleeping all night. But her dog stayed in the hallway, sleeping on the floor, which is where I found him later that morning when I opened my bedroom door to come out. 	At some point I asked her if she had heard any sound that night, like a deep throbbing, and she said she didn't hear anything. 	My daughter was deeply disturbed by what happened that night, and kept asking me if I had played a spooky trick on her or something, hoping I'd say ""yes"" and admit it. Of course I hadn't. I had only walked by twice and glanced in once when investigating that horrible pulsating sound, which she would have heard if she were awake. At that time the dog was still in bed with my daughter. 	The behavior of our dog leads me to believe that my daughter's experience with the ""presence"" came AFTER mine (with the throbbing sound). At the time of my experience, the dog was still in bed with my daughter, but during her experience the dog ran out of her room to the end of the hallway, sleeping there until I opened my bedroom door to come out for breakfast. If her experience had come first, when I went to investigate the throbbing sound, I would have found the dog sleeping in the hallway outside my door, which he wasn't. 	Now my daughter doesn't want to talk about the incident. The story she told is greatly out of character for her because she has no interest if not an outright aversion to such ""creepy"" things. Recently, in fact, she got quite angry at her boyfriend for taking her to see a horror movie. My daughter's second experience:  	Unfortunately, the story is not over.  The following morning (May 13th) I asked her if she slept well (code for: "" Anything unusual happen???"") and she reluctantly admitted she had another ""weird"" experience.  She said she woke up at almost exactly the same time as the night before (2 AM) and looking through her doorway saw a kaleidoscope of ""strobe lights"" as if flashing behind a fractured, stained-glass window.  She made a drawing of what she saw (she's quite a good artist, her room is full of her paintings). This startling phenomenon lasted for only a few brief moments but left a profound impression on her. 	Again, her dog had inexplicably left her room to sleep on the hallway floor in front of my closed bedroom door. 	The following and subsequent nights (without exception), the dog was back sleeping in bed with my daughter -- all night long. 	No, my daughter does not do drugs or drink alcohol or smoke -- it's contrary to her very reserved, shy, conservative nature. 		As a scientist I can only say the phenomena my daughter and I experienced are a great ""unknown,"" and quite possibly ""unworldly"" or ""other dimensional.""",2014-07-20T00:00:00,,

I was a warehouse worker, on the job, at 620 pm, at one of the factories on the Southside of Fort Worth, Texas, during the evening--shortly before sunset. 		I was moving stock up a ramp, in back of the main 2 story office/factory building, when I noticed a sun glint, in the sky, over a neighborhood across the street from the plant. 		The gilt was around 20-30 stories high as I measure the downtown towers, I use to work around high-rise buildings for a number of years. 		Because of their size, I at first mistook them for a C-130 cargo plane, climbing, as UPS and other carriers often fly over from the airport, so I was just about to look away, when I noticed an odd pale glow. I took out my pocket binoculars to look closer and saw two metallic spheres. They had deep groves along the equator, with plated skin like an air craft. They were close together as if they were magnetized – with a white vertical beam of light or gas jet that seemed to balance them – as they made see-saw and wobbling motion from the high wind gust—they seemed weightless. They reminded me of a bubble head doll as they moved north by south wobbling, and this odd white beam remained fixed between them like a balancing rod. They seemed in a hurry and one seemed disabled, with the other, facing south as the tolling craft. I could tell that they were flying directly over the houses across the way on Mcart Street. I soon got concerned about that white beam pointed toward the ground, as I watched the objects move through a cloud, I lost sight of them, and became fearful they might turn my direction. That beam was at least 200 feet downward with 5 feet width or more, as far as I could guess, but I couldn’t tell what kind of energy it was made of – gas or light. I quickly went inside the building. When I got the nerve to come back out, on the street side, I noticed a man walking on that sidewalk unharmed. So I quickly moved to the sidewalk on Mcart – but when I got out where I could see the sky better, the objects were gone. An airbus came from the south direction at the same altitude – so I got to compare its size, using my finger and I determined the two spheres were half as long as the airbus. That meant each had enough room for at least 50 human size passengers. The fact, I didn’t see the spheres anymore – didn’t surprise me, as that wasn’t the first sighting of such objects, in that area and elsewhere about the city. Here’s a spot for more of my background. My interest in UFO has been a on and off affair –since my mother recounted a close encounter at a very young age. She the youngest girl and a uncle the youngest boy of 13, on a farm around 1934 or 5, where they came within ten feet of a glowing sphere. “It was a huge white ball with black lines running from pole to pole and it hummed like a high voltage transformer.”  I asked her how close it was.   She pointed to a wall about ten feet away.   She said, “We had snuck out that night and was about to cross an open field, when this huge ball suddenly lit up in front of us!  We just watched it for a few minutes, then, the older ones grabbed {her & my uncle} and took off down the road…we never saw it again.” That story was verified by her siblings as much as 40 years apart – each time they initiated it. It wasn’t until July 1973 when I had my first sighting. I had just arrived in Texas and was living in Dallas at that time.  I was outside reading a book, on the back lawn, when I notice a squadron of F-16 fly over.  They were moving rapidly west to east -- in formation with 5 or 6 glowing spheres that phased in and out of sight. That incident made me more aware of my surrounding, but it wasn’t until a night in July 1997 that I saw a test flight of a craft that was man made; it took off along I-35w near an air strip I know of in Keller, TX. It was long and big about the size of a 727 and that was about 9 pm as I was moving north on I-35.  I saw it lift off from below the trees – it had a faint pale greenish blue glow.	 	It was invisible to anyone beneath a street light or anyone in downtown area. 	I just happen to be in the right spot at the right time, when it climbed to a height directly over the Bass tower in Fort Worth, and it stopped on a dime.  It remained at station keeping for several seconds; it began moving in wide circular patterns, so fast, it seemed to be two places at once. 	That went on for almost 30 minutes, then, it returned to its landing strip.  Being a member of a large family, I had relatives in various fields – like the corps of engineers. Sometimes they went to work at the D.U.M.B. where CIA security have to supervise their handling of blueprints stored in a metal scroll like device, so only their area of work is visible. We figured down there is where the craft proto-types are stored and developed. 	Since I worked at this factory location, I’ve been able to spot a number of alien objects and observed the government’s reaction. It was a clear night, on a Friday, in Feb. 2008; I had just arrived for work at 11pm, when I saw a bright object drop in the southeast. I thought it was a meteorite and looked away, I continued walking north along the loading rim of the loading dock. I went up a short flight of stairs, got my clipboard and continued north, passing 3 overhead docks door. I was about to cross the space of 45ft, between buildings, when I glanced to my left, towards a long 1 story building that ran north by south and next to it was the 2 story front office building. I looked and saw that same bright yellow object still in the sky. “That’s no meteorite!”  I said out loud, as I watched the object make a controlled landing not more then a few blocks away from where I stood.   It looked that close.  And it was at least 30ft wide shaped like an egg – but extremely bright like the sun,  I use to work at an airport and seen hundreds of chopper landings in all weather conditions and that thing made a perfect soft vertical landing. I just took off for the front as fast as I could navigate the complex and when I got to Mcart Street – I saw no trace of it. That object was as bright as the sun.  I expected to see a fire on somebody’s roof – it came down right below the roof level of our complex – and it appeared very close. I was expecting a chopper to arrive, one did, a gray one, but it was circling the wrong area.  It did so all night, leaving once to refuel and came back. Days later, I saw one odd looking black chopper fly about the area, in a search pattern, but it didn’t stay long. About 2 week after that, the chemtrails started and so did larger objects appear. I’ve lived and worked in this area 10 years and never seen a chemtrail.   But now, it sprayed as thick as a blanket, until the sky has an eerie look and smell. 	One weekend I noticed a small blimp with an Insurance company logo, fly over this cluster of houses located in an isolated spot where gravel is dump and hauled. 		I was driving stock toward the warehouse headed west as I saw it, the blimp turned toward me.  It came directly overhead, I suddenly got sick.  My pulse started racing and I felt flushed and it lasted until the blimp moved away from me. 		I moved clear of the area and watched with my binoculars as the blimp just kept circling this one cluster of houses for several hours until just before sundown and then it went away headed north. 	I saw it return weeks later, from the north and circle this same group of houses, seemly all afternoon, then, it would leave the way it came.  Inside the blimp I saw one, or two people in the cabin at the flight controls – but no passengers. Shortly after that, maybe a week or more, I saw an airbus moving eastward with a huge thick trail of dark smoke behind it.  I almost thought it was in trouble, because I saw what I took for smoke move away from the cabin, but it wasn’t smoke. 		I was wearing a pair of very dark sun glasses that enabled me to see the object clearly, as it was almost invisible to the naked eye. This object that cut across the path of this airbus was huge – it dwarfed the plane by thousands of feet. It moved toward the ground in a U shape – when it reached the ground it dissipated. 	I looked toward the south of the plane where the sky hadn’t been spray-- and saw this mass of objects move from the upper atmosphere and cross paths with the plane, once again moving toward the ground. I thought they were meteorites. I could see grainy chunks moving in mass toward the ground, with a faint pale yellow green color and dissipate as they reached about 100 feet. After a moment of trying to figure out what I was seeing, I then thought it was a sun flare that had punched through the atmosphere.  But it wasn’t that. I saw another object come down and cross paths with the airbus, and as I advanced closer, I could see chunks of inner mass move in long stringy formations, like a jellyfish tentacles.  	At that point I began to wonder, if I wasn’t seeing something that was alive. Then I realized, all during this incident, the plane hadn’t moved much since I first saw it.  It was still in the same place in the sky. 	That plane was spraying a huge mass of chemicals and I was ready to stay clear of it, so I fled indoors.  	The black opts projects in Texas are in full gear! Since May, 30, 2008.  I’ve stood below test shots of energy beams, 20  to 30 feet wide, shot from a University rooftop at clouds 60 ft above my neighborhood,  I seen metal framed jet powered drones fly overhead. 	I’ve even seen our folk, or them, make a huge Jacob’s ladder or escalator in the clouds for about 55 minutes. 	You could see the moment they turned the switch off, the wind and clouds settled down, as if nothing had happened.",2014-08-29T00:00:00,32.757366003227546,-97.34710441097364

It was roughly between August 2012 – November 2012. Time: Approximately between 12noon-3pm   Duration of Sighting (Before my departure): 4-6 minutes  Shape: Metallic Oval-disc  	 My location started at the east end of downtown Ojai.  There were no visual obstructions in my view. I am a person with 20/20 vision.  Approximate location of UFO was above and possibly slightly behind a mountain ridge of North-east Ojai valley.  The distance between the object and myself, judging east downtown Ojai to the mountain ridge it hovered above, is approximately 2 to 2.5 miles.   The objects size from my perspective could have been from 100 ft long and 20 ft tall to 300 ft long and 60ft tall.  It appeared to hover above, either directly above or back and above, the mountain ridge.  There was a very slight distance between the object and the mountain ridge at about a 16th of an inch, if I were to hold my forefinger and thumb to measure from my location. It was a clear sunny day without a cloud in the sky. I was walking down the sidewalk looking at the scenery along the Ojai valley mountain range.  My first observance was spotting something metallic, noticing sun reflection on its surface.  My first impression was that is was either an airplane or a satellite dish.  There are airplanes in flight traffic pattern in the east end sky of Ojai valley.   However, as I noticed it was not moving along the mountain ridge or diminishing or growing in size, I knew it could not be an airplane.  I then, thought maybe it’s a Blimp, but again, it was not moving in any direction, just fixed.  Also, the shape was very much more oval or disc shaped to be a blimp.  So, then I presumed it to be a Satellite Dish I hadn’t noticed before.  I did think it seemed much too large to be a satellite dish atop a mountain ridge at that distance.  I simply came to the conclusion that that is what it must be, a Satellite dish.  So, then I got to my car, proceeding to drive in the opposite direction, still observing it and wondering about it, since it had such a mysterious and odd looking presence. The next day I was in the same area, I remembered where I had seen the supposed Satellite Dish.  I kept looking and looking along the mountain ridges.  It wasn’t there anymore. I thought “No way, it couldn’t be what I think it is.”  I have been going over and over in my mind about this sighting.  I tend to take a scientific approach to things.  I thought, there can’t be any denying it, it has to have been a UFO.  I have heard from others in the Ojai Valley that they had had some experiences of the UFO or extraterrestrial kind, though not sounding as clear and present as my sighting.   I had never had an encounter of this sort before.  Even though I knew it was possible, I thought it had to be impossible to happen to me.  I do believe there are other technologically advanced life forms in our universe.  The age of the Universe and the time it has taken for us, alone, to develop to what we are today and know what we can be capable of, is a good enough ratio of time for others to have developed far and beyond what we have accomplished or can imagine.   This is a chance for me to add to the plethora of genuine and growing evidence out there.  I wanted to finally share this to help to bring awareness that there are other beings and forces out there and around us.  I believe that there are those that would harm us, but also those that wish to aid us.   Hopefully someday we will all be able to witness and know the Truth that has been so well kept through deception and secrecy.  As for my account you can take it or leave it.  I simply would like to add my observance to the collective.  I hope that this will help for further investigation or for confirmation of other eyewitness accounts in this area and beyond. Peace be with you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2014-08-29T00:00:00,34.511540000000004,-119.28705272727271

I whistled and the creature tan away I heard five bipedal footsteps before it ran through the treeline two yards down that is like 50 feet in five steps.   I felt sick to my stomach afterwards for five days and when I went over to where I saw the creatures head silhouetted in the light from the neighbors window the creature had to be at least seven feet tall.

UFO Sighting Place: Flatwoods, KY Date and time: July 4, 2014 between 20:30 and approximately 22:30,  July 5 apprx. 21:00 – 22:00   	In Flatwoods, Kentucky I usually take an hour long walk in the evening for fitness reasons. I decided I would take a slightly shorter walk this night because I was getting started so late and didn't want to walk in the dark too much. After making my preparations, I began my walk at about 20:40. The sun was setting very low in the west. 	I was standing on the corner of Argillite Road and Bellefonte Road when I saw the first anomalous objects. The time was approximately 21:00 and the sky was still light, but darkening.  	The objects were in the sky in the distance in the direction of the Flatwoods City Building beyond Super Quick. There were two objects moving slowly towards the direction of Russell, to the east. They appeared spherical in the distance and I thought they were odd because their appearance and behavior didn't match to a plane or a helicopter. They were not shaped like a plane, appearing vaguely spherical in the distance and were moving far too slowly to be planes but faster than a balloon would normally travel. Both objects appeared to be dark gray or black in the distance. The lead object had a light on it of an amber/red color that appeared to come from the bottom of the object. The object following behind it was unlit.  	Many in the neighborhood were setting off fireworks due to the 4th of July. Many were large type exploding in the air with very loud booms and sparklers and wizzers coming out at 200 to 400 feet up.  	On arriving home, my father remarked to me that he saw two objects to the east over the Armco Steel Plant (located in Russell, KY, to the east on the Ohio River) moving east to west. 	A few minutes later as I was standing in the driveway watching fireworks, an anomalous red light flew over the house at a high speed from the north horizon towards the south. After passing directly over the area it dimmed slightly, then lit up fully again, then dimmed once more until it could no longer be seen. I called to my father who was watching fireworks on the back porch and he come out with binoculars. About five minutes later, an object of similar configuration did the same, and a few minutes after that another one came. This happened numerous times.  	This time, I was able to get a better look at the object through the set of binoculars and could see that there was a dark solid mass of some kind attached to the light. The light appeared to be moving under this dark object which appeared vaguely round or spherical from my point of view. It was at this point that I made the mental connection back to the anomalous objects I saw during my walk. I realized that I had had a daylight sighting of two of these strange spheroid objects, one of which was shining an orange/red light from its lower part and the other of which was not. When I moved the binoculars down, I could still see the dark outline of this object as it flew quickly over the house, so it must have been very close. I would estimate it to have been 30-40 ft. across if it were at an elevation of 1500 – 2000 ft. If it were at this size and elevation it must have been moving completely silently at a speed of about 200-300 kts. All of the objects in this series moved in! a straight line at this speed from horizon to horizon. They made no heading changes but they appeared to dip in altitude as they approached the area and then climb and fade as they came over or passed it.  	 	After this first series of objects had flown directly over the area, another object came in a similar direction from the north, but was flying over an area slightly to the east  us rather than directly over us as the previous objects had done. This object exhibited the most atypical and dramatic behavior of all the objects sighted. It appeared to descend and dim its orange/red light, appearing to fade as the others had, but I could still discern the fuzzy outline of a dark spheroid object in the darkness. Instead of totally fading and climbing back up, it slowed down and suddenly lit up in a brilliant fluorescent blue-green green color before descending rapidly and going out of view to the southeast within what seemed to be only a mile or so. We did not see this object again after it did this.  	After this happened, a few more of these strange objects appeared over the house in the same course as the previous series, but eventually the activity tapered off after about 22:30 and the objects were not seen again that night. My father and I remained watching for them for a period of about an hour and a half more but saw no more of these anomalous objects.  No sound or noise of any kind could be heard from any of the unidentified objects.   	During the course of this UFO encounter, we observed three brightly lit objects which appeared to be satellites. Their direction of travel was approximately, one east to west, one north to south, and  one south to north. Planes were observed flying overhead during this incident with red, green, white and strobe lights.  	In the course of the incident we managed to capture photographic evidence of the objects, but they are low quality due to the fact that we were taking pictures of distant objects at night with cameras that were not meant for nighttime use.  	The next night, July 5th, my father, mother, and grandmother were all out watching fireworks from neighborhood again (the same type as the night of the 4th).  In about a similar time frame as the incident of the previous night, more objects of the same kind seen on the night of the 4th were sighted by me, my father, and mother. I also managed to capture a photograph of one of the objects that appeared this night.  	The direction or travel was from the northeast horizon towards southwest 	I kept watch outside the house the next night, the 6th, in case more objects would show themselves, but aside from a dim red light in the distance to the west which faded rapidly, I had no sighting comparable to the previous night's.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,38.5041,-82.7344

As we returned home after watching fireworks near Sidney Fisher Park, I pulled into the ((deleted)) condominium complex and noticed an orange light hovering above the beach just east of the condo complex.  As I exited the car, I walked around the condo complex to try and get a better view, but by the time I got there, the orange light had disappeared.

While that light hovered in place without a sound, I called to the rest of my family including my wife and my father-in-law, an ex-rocket engineer with Lockheed Martin space systems.   As they joined me on the balcony, we witnessed another orange glow travel from the north down the beach, pause for a moment near the condo at about 1,500 feet above sea level, and then proceed to travel east out over open water.   All of us were left speechless, trying to explain the sighting and the fact that there wasn’t a single sound.  During this time, the original orange glow that was hovering, literally just disappeared in place.  It wasn’t like it was hidden behind a cloud; it was literally like the light turned off and the object was just gone. My mother-in-law ran back into the condo to retrieve binoculars as I started to try and take pictures with my iPhone.  The pictures are added here. Over the next 5 minutes, we witness two orange glows side-by-side almost in formation follow the same path down the beach from the north as if they launched near the Kennedy Space Center and paused at about the same altitude as the prior aircraft, roughly 1,500 feet above sea level.   One of the two proceeded to rise vertically in place to about 2,500 feet, close to the same altitude the first aircraft was at, but slightly more north in the sky.   As I tried to find it in the binoculars, the second of the two aircraft had again just disappeared in place, like the light was just turned out.  Returning to the original aircraft, it too had disappeared. As the prior aircraft were hovering in place and rising to the roughly 2,500 feet above sea level; a final aircraft followed the same flight path as the prior three.  As that aircraft neared the same area of the prior two, it paused, rotated and turned out towards sea.  This one, I could find in the binoculars what appeared to be two circular exhaust engines side by side.   The aircraft proceeded slowly out east for what seemed like 3-5 miles before it too disappeared out of site. Stunned, we all turned to each other in amazement at what we saw.  Were they test helicopters?  Where they drones – never heard a completely silent drone?  Given the clear distinct side-by-side orientation of the engines for the final aircraft, it was confirmation that it was a powered aircraft vehicle.  But even at that, we couldn’t explain the orange glow as it approached us.  Why would we see the glow of engines?  How did they hover with no underneath engines for flight stabilization?  A thousand questions; all leaving us with the conclusion that we just witnessed a unique UFO sighting.

"Looked like a ship coming out of warp, lasted 1.5 seconds.",Las Vegas,NV,2014-07-03T21:15:00,circle,1 second,"Occurred : 7/3/2014 21:15  (Entered as : 07/03/14 21:15) Reported: 7/13/2014 3:50:50 PM 15:50 Posted: 7/20/2014 Location: Las Vegas, NV Shape: Circle Duration:1 second",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111516.html,"Looked like a ship coming out of warp, lasted 1.5 seconds. Wasn't sure if I should report this due to the shortness of the event but the more I think about it the more I am sure it was a strange event. For geographic location, I am in the far north west of town in Las Vegas, Nv. We are far enough north of Vegas that we don't really get the light pollution like down in town so we have a very nice night sky. We had just gone through a week of clouds and overcast and this was our first clear sky in days and the 4rth of July we had clouds and rain all day/night. On Thursday July 3rd I was sitting out in my pool around 9:15ish pm. The sun had set but the sky was still in twilight and not dark yet. I was laying back looking up at the stars and checking out the constellations. When in the north sky I saw what I can only describe as a ship coming out of warp going from north to south.  It left a streak in the sky about a half inch long at arms length but it was a wide light like a highlighter rather than thin like a pencil. Now here is why I think this was weird. I spend a lot of time at night looking up at the sky, I know how falling stars look, I watch satellites go by  on a regular basis and I have seen the ISS over dozens of times and know its speed and brightness. In fact at 8:15ish pm I saw the ISS fly over (south to north) and fade out just like I had seen many times. Most every satellites I see here are usually going from south to north. Most falling stars I see are much faster and the streak is much longer and thinner. I am under the flight path for most military jets from Nellis AFB but they fly from the base to the training range (east to west) over my house then back a little north of me from West to East. Generally with a lot of noise and very identifiable by their lights and speed. In fact I was thinking earlier in the night that they were not out doing their regular night time training and the sky's were quiet that night. I never see flights from the north to the south due to two reasons.  The mountain range is very high to my north (Gass and Sheeps peek) and due north of me is actually area 51 and the groom lake complex. It is a No Fly zone for the normal training flights from Nellis.  Even the famed Janet airline flights don't do North to south, they do NW to SE to get to McCarran.  And don't fly evenings. So here is how this went down. I am in the pool laying back looking up at the stars and due to the way my yard and pool is I usually look north to it being the darker part of the sky. I heard what I thought was a plane, which drew my attention to an area I wasn't focusing on, when all of a sudden, I see this streak and at the leading edge of it is a bright shiny object. The streak was only half an inch long and appeared like the old star trek shows where they come out of warp and leave a short light trail. My first thought was a plane with landing lights but when the trail and light went away as fast as it appeared I looked to the area to the south thinking I would see the plane continue through the stars due to the sky still being in twilight but could not find it. This is seemed strange to me for the fact that nothing ever comes from our north to the south and the way the light looked. And I have never seen a falling anything from the North to the South.",2014-07-20T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

The lift operators were spacing passengers out so my wife and daughter were several chairs in front and there wasn’t anyone behind me.  I yelled to attract attention but no one was close enough to hear. Coming down from the top I saw a white ball or perfect circle moving on a straight line from left to right.  It was difficult to tell the object’s height or size based on my perspective, but it appeared to about 6-feet across, perfectly round, and white and perhaps 50 to 100 feet above the trees on top of 5,236-foot mountain.  This would be only a few hundred feet above the ground. It was a windy day and at first I thought it was some weather balloon broken loose but the wind was in my face and the object was moving left to right on a perfectly straight line at a constant speed---too fast for a bird, too slow for an airplane.  It took about 30 seconds for the object to cross my limited field of vision as I descended to the base of the ski run.

It was moving from southeast to northwest and stayed visible until it was gone beyond a treeline on the horizon.  It never changed course.  I've seen planes fly that high before, and they always look like they are in slow motion being so far away, but this was moving much faster.  It had only the one star sized white light and no other lights that might indicate a plane or helicopter.  There was no sound either.   Our friend from the couple we were with is a veteran of the Navy, and he even stated that it wasn't possible to be any known aircraft, and also confirmed that at the elevation it appeared at, it should look as if it were moving much much slower than the object we saw.   He said it was a ""UFO"" but added that that didn't mean ""aliens"" (which I acknowledge as well).   There is an airport nearby, but from the southeast of us, not from the direction the object came, or was heading.

There were planes flying in the area and were obviouis that they were planes with proper lighting. I heard them mention the lights but paid no attention as I was watching the firework display. My wife said is that an airplane what is it.  So about 22:30 we left the gathering and headed home.  When we got to the intersection of HWY 30 and Summit Rd in Fenton, my wife said there it is again.  She was driving and I rolled down the window and hung out looking directly up in the sky.  There were light high clouds and this object was above those clouds I would say 10,000 feet maybe a maximum of 15,000 feet.  It was huge according to the light patterns.  There were 7 lights in a long row, with 2 lights centered just opposite the long row of lights.  I would guess this craft was at least 6 or 7 football fields long maybe more.   At first I thought why would there be 9 helicopters grouped like that flying in constant formation.  Shortly after that I realized it was one large object moving slowing above the clouds.  I told my wife Holy Crap that is a giant UFO!  It is moving in sync.    My wife tried to take a picture of it but the street lights were blinding out the camera when she held it up.  Just about that time all 7 lights switched off and then there was only two lights and then one of those switched off.  At this time traffic lights had changed and we had to go because of traffic.   The more I thought about it the more I suspected we had just seen a huge craft of some sort.  The craft made no noise all I heard was the car engine running.   Now fast forward to July 10th.  On the news channel here in St. Louis they ran a piece showing the lights in the sky and a guy talking about them.  He had gotten them on a video loop and sure enough it was the same configuration of lights stretched out on the horizon.  This craft is huge and it has been seen several times over the St. Louis Metropolitan area.   If you look into reports filed at local TV stations you may be able to get the video.

Sometime after midnight we pulled off the highway and drove south into the town of Maidstone to get some rest.  We were facing south at the corner of Railway Ave. and Third St. W, when we saw the object above a field southwest of the intersection, not that far from us.  I saw what looked like a shooting star, a white streak across the sky.  It suddenly stopped and just hung in the air.  It was a long oval that seamed to divide into two parts, rainbow coloured with an Ammolite type shimmer and a bright white light at one end.  The object hung in the air for some time, long enough for my husband and I to ask each other if we saw what we were seeing.  It suddenly divided and disappeared.  There was no sound from this object at any time it was silent. I have no idea what it was at all. My Husbands account of the same sighting. I was at the intersection facing south when the object came into view.  It was about 300 meters away and it filled up half the windshield.  The object looked like it was made of a cluster of tubes, green with 2 or 3 red lights at the end.  At one end there was a bright white and yellow glow almost like a mist.  The colours on it we the brightest and most vivid I have ever seen.  I don't know how long it stayed still, 30 or 40 seconds.  It was silent the whole time, I had my window down and there was no noise.  In a split second it shot away from us and was gone.  It looked like it was operated by and intelligent presence. It was not a helicopter or plane nor was it fireworks or a para flair.  Both of us spent more than 10 years in the Canadian military and we are familiar with these things.

Not planes or fireworks. Flying objects that were silent As I went out in to my driveway, I looked up to see some fireworks going off when I saw an Orange light just hanging there. I thought at first it was a firework, due to its firey orange color, that had reached its peak height and was ready to explode. Instead of explode though I noticed it was moving south, towards me, at a slow pace maybe 30-40mph.    After I realized it was flying I watched it for a minute then ran in and grabbed my video camera and got the wife.  As we watched it fly overhead and right past us the orange glow just faded out.   At that time we both looked back north and noticed another one coming.  This one did the exact same thing.  It flew south then slowly faded out.  This happened two more times.   These objects seemed to be following each other at a distance.  One every 2-3 mins apart.  The great thing about the night of the 4th was that it was a clear night and even after the lights faded we should have still been able to see the shape of the objects due to the fact the sky was so clear and we could see the stars.   I'm not sure what they were but as I said the were a bright firey orange color and were roughly 2000 feet high and completely silent.  They didn't make a sound! I see and hear planes go over all the time since I live about 5 miles S.E. from DTW.  These were NOT planes and were not on the flight route of the planes that land or take off.   These objects looked as if they were following Inkster rd due south and veered east over Lake Erie.  I found these same objects on youtube when I typed in UFO's of July 4th.  As far as my video went.  The video quality was terrible.  Trying to record and object like that at night is harder then I thought it would be. I'm not a UFO nut I and my wife work for GM and have no history of seeing things and can explain almost all of what I see in the skys.  This night however I saw 4 Bright Orange Lights flying overhead at a somewhat low altitude and did not see any type of body to these crafts against the backround of a Very Clear Sky.  These lights simply faded out as they flew over and were gone!   I cannot explain this or tell anyone what it was I saw other then orange lights.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,42.1125,-83.3017

My wife and I were staying at our mountain retreat.  At approximately 1 a.m., I went out on our back porch, which faces north and overlooks the valley.  Our place is located on the very top of Sloan Mountain, which is very rural.  The only ambient light was from a few lights in the valley, one cell phone tower to my left and a distant glow from Harrison, Arkansas, located about 25 miles away.  Even though the sighting took place during the Fourth of July week, there were absolutely NO fireworks were being used at this time. I was on the porch, facing northward when I noticed a roundish red/orange light, distance is difficult to estimate, but I had the impression it was about 5 miles away.  The light was just smaller than dime size.  It looked unusual in this environment, so I did a mental assessment of the other lights I was used to seeing.  This light I was seeing was above the horizon, noticeably higher than the distant mountains top. The initial light was at my eleven o’clock position and had some slight movement, both vertically and horizontally.  Two smaller objects came out of the original light; they expanded to the same relative size of the original one. I noticed other similar lights appear randomly.  In total, there were nine of them.  They were not in a precise formation, but were generally aligned, but were on different planes.  There was some movement, but like the original, no drastic movements.  They randomly blinked on and off, sometimes disappearing for two or three minutes, reappearing in slightly different positions.  The only constant light was the original.

I kept looking up at it as I was driving, wishing I had a camera to photograph it - I enjoy amateur astronomy and I enjoy photographing the moon.  Anyway, while I was stopped at a light on Spring St, I looked up again, and I thought I saw a fast moving commercial aircraft gliding between my view of the moon - I was just thinking about what a great shot that would make, when I realized that the plane had no wings - nor any discernible tail.  It was a very long, cylindrical object, round at both ends, and it was moving VERY quickly.  I've lived in this area my whole life, I KNOW what aircraft moving in and out of Avoca International Airport look like.  Avoca would've been north of my position at the time - this object was moving due east - maybe east/south east.  It glimmered and reflected light from the sun.

When I began ascending the hill to get to where my wife works, it went out of my view behind the building.  I had a good idea of its trajectory, so after I got my wife into the car, I drove to the other side of the parking lot to get a better view of the sky, and it was gone.  NO aircraft moves THAT quickly.  There was plenty of distance to the horizon versus the point in the sky where I'd seen it last. It was NOWHERE to be found.

At that moment, I realized that the objects, though they were rising in the sky, didn't seem to be getting any closer.

The two objects were lit like fire, and flying in formation directly up.  At one point the first object turned off its light, and I thought it had disappeared.

The craft was about three fingers wide at an arm's length and the length of the craft was half as long as wide.

I noticed a plane going by and listening to the roar of its engine. I also noticed a very slow moving object that had to be 100 above treetop level.  I had a very good look at this object which appeared to be oval shaped, white on the bottom and mid-tone to dark gray on the top.  The object also appeared to ""tilt"" like a plane would as it turns but then the object tilted back to its original position. I immediately got my camera out which I always carry with me and took 2 pictures of this thing.  I then switched over to video and took 1:10 video of it.  At the end I tried zooming in and also tried getting on the other side of the tree to recapture the object but I was not fast enough.  I reviewed the video later and found out it is out of focus after zooming in.  The pictures I took are crisp and clear. In the video and pictures you can clearly see airplanes near the object but also not aware of it being near them.",2014-08-29T00:00:00,41.62047596153847,-86.73390576923076

I was facing north, standing to the west side of the Museum of History and Industry at the South end of Lake Union.

The light moved slowly south and did not change size, color or brightness.   The first light was then followed by a second and a third at equal spacing, single file moving south.   When the lights were directly due west from me (over Queen Anne Hill) the lead light turned west and then disappeared but not behind the high cloud cover.  The second and third light followed the same route. Once the three lights were gone, a single orange none blinking light appeared at the same point of origin as the first three.  This single light stayed stationary.  At about the same time this single light appeared, 3 or 4 Helicopters moved to the West and could have been below the light. The sky was full of multiple aircraft and helicopters that night.  The marker and anti-collision lights are VERY obvious.  The lights I saw did not look or flash like aircraft lights. About 10 minutes later an orange light appeared as before, to the North of my location.  This time the second and third light appeared quicker and the three lights moved into a triangle position.  Again they moved South at the same speed and route as before.  The “lower” appearing light moved in and out, changing the shape of the triangle.

I could also see that it was hovering.  I zoomed in with my binoculars and I could see three lights - red, yellow and orange.  The lights were flashing from right to left.  They also had a luminescence not typical for the usual aircraft I might see in the sky.  I had seen several helicopters overhead so I suspected I could be mistaking this hovering craft.  Once zoomed in through my binoculars it did not look like a helicopter.  I could see the outline of the helicopters when zoomed in on them.  I was not able to see any detail aside from the lights on this craft.  I ran to grab my camera and zoomed in to capture it as the light turned southward and vanished instantly. The following morning my thirteen year old son returned home from spending the night with friends and wanted to show me some unusual photos he had taken while situated to watch the fireworks.  He had been on the west side of the city, on top of a hillside looking down toward the lake, and had a straight on view of these strange lights in the sky.  From his vantage point there were three of these bright lights forming a triangle shape, without any lines or visible material in between these lights.  He snapped two very clear photographs of the lights.  He noticed they moved formation, not remaining in this triangle shape before they all disappeared. I posted these photos to my Facebook page on July 5th.  The only comment made in response was from his Aunt who was at yet another part of the city, closer down toward the lake from where he and I both were during this time.  She had also seen these lights and suspected they were of UFO nature.

This object was flying at an altitude that appeared to be just above the mountaintops when I first spotted it.  I ran inside an had my wife come out into the backyard to witness this event.  The object seemed very rapidly ascend into the sky with the glow dissipating as it ascended.  I was able to capture this event by recording it on my cellphone.  When it reached a certain altitude, the object started to dim and appeared to flicker on and off twice, then it appeared to be a black craft triangular in shape very high in the sky.  This craft then disappeared from sight.  As I turned to go back into the house, my wife had called to me in a loud excited voice and exclaimed that another redish/g! lowing object was flying the same pattern and route as the first.  We were able to also video tape this object as well.  I had instructed my wife to retrieve our son's telescope but was unable to bring the object into focus with the telescope.  We videotaped this object as it rapidly ascended and suddenly disappeared out of sight.  During the videotaping, I was able to video an aircraft flying high above our house roof with its blinking lights to clearly show the contrast between the aircraft and these two objects that we saw and filmed.  The very interesting but disturbing thing about this encounter is, that we had seen the same phenomenon approx. 3 miles East of where I live the later part of last summer while riding our motorcycle.  We pulled off the road with 4 other vehicles and we all watched in amazement as 5 of these objects did aerobatics unlike anything we had ever seen.  They like the two comparable objects we had seen tonight ascended rapidly and seemed to vanis! h into the atmosphere.  I had made a report of last summer's sightings on the MUFON site.  I had since been trying to make sense of this.  I had first heard of this site from the Coast to Coast A.M. radio program.  I started listening to Coast to Coast after the first encounter.  I would very much like to have a follow up concerning these sightings and I will say that it sort of unnerves my wife and I, especially being that we have witnessed this phenomenon twice.  Also of note, on both occasions, these objects did not make any discernible noise whatsoever the whole time they were visible.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,41.0642,-77.5978

Formation of 4 round/oval craft over Los Angeles at night (no strobe lights).  ((NUFORC Note:  Pilot report.

I parked the airplane and was waiting for my guests to arrive when I noticed what appeared to be 4 aircraft approaching from the west.  They caught my attention as they were dimly lit with steady lights (i.e. did not have any flashing lights) which is not typical of aircraft (airplanes/helicopters typically have flashing lights).  It was somewhat hard to determine what the craft were as they were coming towards my location so at times it appeared as though they were craft coming towards me, and because of this viewing angle, it also appeared as thought someone may have simply let go of some circular balloons that were floating ""up"" and may just be reflecting city lights from below (as objects at a constant altitude that are approaching you in the sky also appear to be moving ""up"").   Once the objects moved much closer I was able to determine that the! y were not balloons floating up but were indeed a formation of 4 separate objects flying from west to east directly overhead.  The craft flew directly overhead at what appeared to be considerable altitude (it's extremely difficult to judge, but I would estimate anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 feet in altitude.  It was very difficult to determine the shape of the craft, as it was night time, but the craft appeared to have lights on the bottom that either outlined a somewhat circular shape or would ""move"" in such a way as to be consistent with a circular TV screen with various pixels turning on and off.  They were clearly all separate craft as they flew in loose formation and changed position in relation to one another, but generally maintained a somewhat traditional formation consistent with a group of aircraft (i.e. all moving in the same directly with somewhat equal spacing, with the space between the craft roughly 5-10 times the length of each craft).   They appeared to move generally in a straight line at a speed consistent with a highe r flying jet or a lower flying helicopter, yet the shape of the objects was neither of these things, and the light patterns of each were slightly different.  The light patterns almost appeared reminiscent of the large TV type display contained on the side of the Goodyear blimp, yet much more dimly lit.  One craft appear to be completely constantly lit in a circular shape.  The center was dark with increasing light towards the edges and slight color variation moving form center to edge.   The other craft shared this same general characteristic and color pattern, but the ""lights"" themselves were not steady state (i.e. the entire circle was not always ""lit up"" at one time).  One craft was lit in such a way as it looked light a two bladed helicopter rotor slowly spinning and fading a trail of fading light behind it (i.e. one line drawn across a circle that rotated and cast a fading trail behind).  This appeared to rotate at a speed of roughly once every 3-5 seconds ! (i.e. MUCH slower than a helicopter rotor system).  This object was the third in line.   The 4th object had a light patter which appeared to be a somewhat loosely drawn triangle which seemed to constantly ""morph"" and change position and shape within the context of the larger circle (like a screen saver on a computer screen).  The objects did not appear to make any noise, however this is not unusual of aircraft in the area as the wind, distance, and city noise can easily drown out aircraft noise. I am a helicopter and jet pilot with 14+ years of flying experience and do not believe these craft to be civilian helicopters or airplanes. I had a substantial amount of time to observe these craft (several minutes?) and attempted to take photo with my iPhone, however given the distance and the night time, I was not able to get a quality photo (again, to be expected given the conditions and equipment used). After the craft had passed overhead, and while they were still in plain view towards the east of my location, I called the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), 858-537-5900, and asked if they were tracking any formation of aircraft in the area.  The controller initially said they often routed ""downwind"" traffic for LAX over my location.   I indicated that the objects I was referring to were not downwind airliners headed to LAX, but rather were a group of 4 strange objects which now appeared to be well east (perhaps over fullerton airport) and were continuing to travel east bound.   TRACON employees indicated that they were not tracking any objects in that area, and said they were ""Looking at the radar right now,"" and did not see anything that fit this description or any other unusual traffic or radar targets. The objects continued to move east and eventually faded from view (as any aircraft would).",2014-06-04T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

There is a large tree to the right of my backyard (southwest).  From behind the tree about 1 1/2 km away, about 1 km above the ground the object first came into my line of vision.  It moved at the speed of a slow moving plane, or helicopter going from south west to south east.  This was no plane or helicopter though. It was disc shaped and its color was orange/red.  It was difficult to make out its exact shape because there was some kind of vapour effect that surrounded it.  Kind of looked like it was on fire.  But no flames were visible.  It just had this bright orangy red glow with a fiery mist that trailed behind it and surrounded it. At first I thought it must have been a meteor.  But meteors don’t move that slow. The object continued at the same speed and headed southwest.  But as it was getting further and more of its back was facing me, its appearance changed.  The orange red colour seemed to fade off and there appeared to be this umbrella-like white-ish swirling vortex that seemed to be coming from the front of the object.  Perhaps this vortex was creating its orange red appearance?  It continued on its way until I could no longer see it. The whole event lasted only a few minutes.  I do not know what it was I saw.

Airport, which is about 3 miles up ahead.  Realize it is a large plane coming towards me, straight down the center of Rt. 100 Medium size plane much bigger than Piper cub , figured it was a Cargo plane.  Flying much lower than any plane I have ever seen that wasn’t coming in for a landing.  Since its flying directly at me, I figured I would get a good look to see what kinda plane this is.  It's very dark with thick cloud cover, no stars or moonlight. As it approached rather quickly, what I saw was a huge Rectangle with Qty :  4 large red and green lights.  Much bigger than traffic lights, I assume as big or bigger than sewer caps. Vividly clear green on front right and back left, and red on front left and back right. I was simply Marveling at this technology as these lights had lumins/intensity of traffic signals but emitted no glare, aura, did not radiate downward or illuminate the craft at all. Were not convex or concave but completely flat..  diffused light that had no bright spots, light was evenly emitted so as just one perfectly round flat,  I thought landing lights. Strange that the road as far as I could see in front and behind me was completely empty with the exception of one car behind me about 2 car lengths.  As it got close I was leaning forward on the steering wheel looking almost straight up at the underneath of the vehicle.  Could only see a giant rectangle.  Could see no outline of an object, plane, helicopter. Seemed to be only couple hundred feet above me.  The one thought I was having is that this couldn’t be a plane, the rectangle way too wide for a fuselage of a plane.  At that point it turned clockwise 280 degrees and made a right turn as I am looking at it in 0.5 seconds.  If one was to count out loud “one thousand one”, being one second.  The object spun on an axis completely around by the time you get; one thous out of your mouth.  “And one” the second half of the word, the object had moved right turn 90 degrees and never changed or altered acceleration. 92 degrees actually.   By this time the object would be passing over top of my truck and I had to look thru the moon roof.  Where I could see it was actually traveling at a slight different angle now that I had a 3rd reference point, my truck roof.  Making a maneuver of 270 degrees plus, there was forward momentum to take into account.  When looking skyward seeing only dark and a rectangle I saw a perfect right turn , but looking thru the moonroof it had turned right but was still sliding a bit forward at the same time, thus explaining the slightly more than a 90 degree turn it made would compensate for the forward momentum after a few seconds, and put it exactly on course. What was the rear of the vehicle, is now the front of the vehicle headed to my! right at 90 degrees.  So it's like polarity in the propulsion system had been switched simultaneously. Of course at this point my mind going into Shock was thinking only one thing. What did I just see?  This is certainly not possible,, could this have been a helicopter.  A helicopter could have easily fit inside this rectangle and couldn’t do a maneuver that quick that precise even if it were hovering. It made no sound at all, seemed to be about 300 ft high and must have been cloaked to imitate the sky color as I never was able to make out any object or shape other than a crystal clear rectangle of spectacular lights.  Always dreamed of being lucky enough to see a flying saucer or something.  Never in my wildest dreams thought I would see something like this practically in my face.  The figure was exact shape of a football field. I could fit my house and garage inside its length.  I figure the object was 80 to 150 ft long and 40 or 60 ft wide. This is a shortened version of what I saw and the calculations.  Would love to talk to someone futher about this incident.

Back of home faces due Northeast towards a tall tree forested area.  Western side of Green Lane Reservoir lies on the other side (north) of this tall tree forested area.    Site map layout can be e-mailed. Event began around 10:05 PM EDT.  Skies were dark and clear, highly transparent - many stars visible.  All local area fireworks shows had concluded about 20 minutes prior.  No activity at all.   We were all cleaning and packing up from family holiday get together. I am a college graduate and IT Professional and have been an amateur astronomer for over 50 years.  Very familiar with night sky, celestial objects, stars, planets, constellations, cardinal directions, etc.  Never saw anything like this phenomenon before.  The others, with various educated backgrounds in nursing, health care, accounting and plumbing concurred. I was admiring the stars and the clear dark skies to the North, when I caught a glimpse of a brightly lit orange colored orb like object rising up through the tall trees in the sky but from behind the tall tree line to the far rear of the property.  I pointed it out to everyone else present at the time.  This orange colored orb like object then rose up to about 10 degrees above this rear tall tree line and then followed it straight like an arrow due East. I would estimate the apparent visual magnitude of this object to be -3 to -5. Similar in range to the planet Jupiter or Venus at maximum brightness.  But, clearly orange and orb like not like a white or blue white pin point star or planet I am familiar with.  Some minor light pulsations were noted as it traversed along its path.  Absolutely no sounds were heard. No red or green aircraft marker lights or aircraft landing lights on the object.  No other discernable features. No smoke or contrails either.  Traversed its path North to East covering about 90 degrees of sky in about 20-30 seconds. Hard to tell in darkness, but estimated the altitude of the object to be less than 10,000 feet, somewhere in range of between 1000 and 5000 feet. We were all very puzzled and awestruck by this object. Then, shockingly, 3 (three) more identical objects rose up and followed in succession along the exact same flight path North to East.  Exact same characteristics.  Color, brightness, some pulsation, no sounds, no marker lights, no smoke or contrails etc.  These subsequent trailing orange colored orb objects appeared to follow each other along same path in about 20 second intervals from the first one across the northeast sky like a string of bright orange beads.  The new ones would appear and follow while the previous ones were disappearing into the eastern horizon. All 7 witnesses experienced this spectacle. We managed to get a snapshot through one of our smart phones of the last of the objects. Different resolutions could be provided via e-mail. Other points of note. 1.	  Definitely not meteors – seen them, know them, no arcing, trails or contrails evident.  And, much too large and orb like given proximity. 2.	  The Planets Mars & Saturn were clearly identifiable and visible on the opposite side of the sky along the ecliptic (South-Southwest) from this event.  Mars in Virgo near Spica and Saturn near center of Libra.  Half moon also in Leo. 3.  	Two separate commercial aircraft with flashing marker lights were observed traveling East to West much higher in the sky (30,000+ feet) near the zenith during the course of the event as it was unfolding.  Presumably these were aircraft out of the New York Area going cross country. 4.	  Can probably rule out prankster candle balloons or gas lit bags because the objects did not deviate at all along the flight path – there was no undulating or sine wave motions.  And, much too bright for just a meager internal light source. 5.	  The fight path of the objects took them right near the star Deneb in the rising constellation of Cygnus in the Northeast sky.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,40.39,-75.4814

My wife, who is far more observant than me, was also watching behind us and pointed out the object to me, and asked me what it was.  Initially, I thought it was an aircraft in distress as it appeared to be on fire.  However, after watching it for a time, I dismissed that notion, for several reasons:  1) it maintained its’ altitude;  2) it had no aircraft lighting;  3) it made no sound.   The object was flying roughly northeast to southwest.  It was, at its nearest position, apx. ½ away and had only 1000-2000 ft. of altitude.  It was orange-red with roughly a circular to elliptical shape.   The flames gave it almost a teardrop, or hershey’s kiss, shape at times, as they rose above and mostly centered about the object.  The underside of the object appeared to be flatter and only glowing, while the flame appearance was around and about the sides or! middle of the object.   Even though the object was moving at a constant speed the flames did not trail the object.

We were seated on the grassy area outside Dublin Coffman High School stadium.  The fireworks began about 10PM.  I was in a lawn chair beside a mother and her adult daughter who was sitting on a blanket in front of us.  The night was cool, clear, with just enough breeze to move the smoke from the fireworks away.  The moon was out and between 1/4 to 1/2 full. Midway through the fireworks, I heard the mother beside me saying ""What IS that?""  She directed my attention behind me.  I had to turn around in my seat, so the object was almost due West, beneath the moon but well above roof and treetop level.  The dimension from our vantage point would be roughly in the aspirin-size range, maybe a little larger.  It was a length-wise oval (wider than it was high), apparently solid object.  It was absolutely stationary--no perceptible movement at all.  There were no blinking lights or color changing occurring.  The entire object was glowing an orange shade that to me, was pumpkin-colored.  There was, however, smoke residue of the fireworks in the air, so that may have affected correct perception of the exact shade.  There may have been a slight haze around the object, but again that is questionable because it could have been smoke.  The level of the object, however, was high enough above most smoke that it was not substantially ob! scured--we could see it distinctly.  It was not a fireball, as there were solid edges to it.  Also, I have seen one fireball--they move.  Fast. Of the group there, I only definitely know the mother and her daughter and myself saw the object.  Others were preoccupied with the fireworks.  And somehow, I was remarkably nonchalant about seeing it, and did not process it as a big event.  The object remained there over a period of a couple minutes, at least, while we calmly dissected what it could and could not be, and how it had no characteristics in common with planes or helicopters in flight, etc.  We were alternately looking at it and turning away to speak to each other (and, on my part, to even glance at the fireworks I was ""missing"").  During one of these times when we were turned away, it vanished.  We looked back and there was no sign of it. Of the possible explanations, it was absolutely not a plane or helicopter.  I KNOW what they look like in various orientations and stages of flight (have lived near airports and heliports and seen countless numbers).  We occasionally have blimps (Goodyear, whoever) and hot air balloons in town.  This did not look like any I've seen.  Further, if one has ever watched a blimp or hot air balloon fly away:  paint dries faster.  They do not disappear in a matter of moments.  Mylar balloons are metallic-looking and reflective--this object glowed, seemingly from within, more like a light bulb.  Also, any balloon or Chinese lantern--which I've seen suggested on someone's video of a similar object--would surely have been buffeted about by the breeze and unable to remain absolutely motionless for minutes. The observers were a 31-year-old mother who works in child care, her mother who works with children and adults in performance arts, and myself, 68, retired with background as a medical and legal secretary, and work in graphic design.  I will add that I have also had a lifelong passion for photography, had my camera in a tote at my feet, and am dumbfounded in seeking to explain why it never entered my mind to take a picture or video.  I didn't even process the object as what it was, until it was gone and the mother said ""We've seen a UFO!""  I think it was just a little too real, and too curiously out-of-place in such a mundane setting, for me to process its significance.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,40.108822448979595,-83.14292857142857

The light was so bright that it surrounded the entire craft.  I was not able to see any shape of the craft because the light was so bright so I am going to say it was a sphere.  It did not flash, it was a static light.   The craft was relatively high up in the sky, but still below the cloud line.  It flew straight across from the right all the way past our front yard and off to the left.  Because of the height I did not hear any sound, but I still found that a bit odd because other craft around that altitude usually make some sort of noise.   The craft would pivot slightly to the left and right.  Sort of like a boat in rough seas.  Do not mistake this for the normal ""zipping across the sky""  this looked more like wind was effecting it because it was moving at a relatively slow speed. There were no other lights other than the red.  No white lights, no strobes, etc... Having said that, I have to take an educated approach to this sighting.  Even though I might belive in something like this, there is always a possibility that there is a simple explination to this.   I thought to myself, well the slow speed and subtle pivoting, and bright red light... it could have been a helicopter.  But not a commercial one because of the bright red light, so then maybe a military helicopter.  But the fact that the light was so bright and no other strobing lights were on it, and there was no sound I am having a hard time accepting my own answer to this.  I have seen other military helicopters in the area and they are extremely loud.  And just to rule it out, it was moving way too fast to be a hot air balloon. We live near a small airfield (Bowman Field) and I see aircraft all the time, and am quite familiar with the lights on crafts.  I look in the sky several times a day waiting to find something, and sure enough I did!   This is honestly the first time I have been unable to explain this sighting and it is all I have been able to think about for days now.  I have seen everything from military helicopters, small planes, news helicopters, drones (about once a month) and now this. I have a very short video that I took of it, though my phone was low battery and shut off shortly after i started to record so I was unable to take any still images.

On July 4th, 2014, at approximately 9:30 to 10:00 p.m., my husband and I walked the dog down the driveway to the street in front of our house to show her some fireworks which the neighbors all around us were setting off.   We did this in order to ease her panic about the noise.   We suddenly looked up in the eastern sky and saw two crafts emerge from behind a tall tree which appeared to us like small airplanes with several red/orange lights in a parallel formation to the ground on each craft.  We did not hear any aircraft noise, as we were familiar with small aircraft noise due to my neighbor building and flying his own planes – sometimes coming over our houses in the neighborhood.   After these two emerged, they traveled southwest and went behind another tree.  They appeared to be flying fairly low, at about the same height and speed of a small aircraft.  Then two more emerged, flying in the same direction.   I would say that at least 8 appeared (in pairs) coming from behind the trees and flew in the same direction as the others, but as they flew on, they appeared to rise some and disappeared before our eyes.   At that time, we looked back at the first tree, and they were still coming, sometimes alone and sometimes in twos.  When they flew in twos, one flew directly over the other craft.  We watched as they all flew to the southwest and disappeared before our eyes.    A friend on facebook said they saw the red lights as well while they were outside with their family in another part of town.  However, only two miles away, a couple with which we are close, said they saw three of them heading directly west.   The husband of this couple was a Vietnam vet and an Iraq vet and was familiar with aircraft.  He alerted his wife to come see the strange lights before they disappeared.  Some family members thought they were “lanterns” due to the popularity of same.  However, I ""googled"" all types of lanterns and balloons, and none of them had any similarities to what we saw.  These things were not floating, but traveling with precision and each of them–nearly 15 to 20 in all–had approx. 3 red/orange lights on the crafts, and we never saw any blinking like air crafts (or noise as I stated above).   They were very unusual.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,37.98475253093363,-87.51397041619798

The object appeared to be 2-3 times larger than a star or planet, with no discernable shape, and stayed stationary during the 25-30 seconds that I observed it.   As I focused on the red object, I noticed a smaller, white object positioned at three o’clock to the red, presumably a star.  The white object appeared constant and did not flicker as a star would.   The white object than moved to a twelve o’clock position to the red, as if the red object was the pivot point.   Once the white object stopped at twelve o’clock, it stayed visible for about 2-3 seconds and then abruptly vanished.   The red star stayed visible for five seconds and then appeared to fade in a way that I would describe as waves rippling on water.  I stood for 2-3 minutes hoping it would reappear but no luck.  Due to the number of large, ma! ture trees in my neighborhood I couldn’t tell if there were more objects or if the object(s) reappeared in a different part of the sky. My location is in northwest Livonia near Seven Mile Road & Newburg.  There were quite a few local fireworks and maybe the objects I saw were somehow related to the Fourth of July festivities.

The objects did not have any lighting on them, the sky was mostly clear with visible stars in the sky and some light clouds to the west and further south.  The objects appeared to shimmer in their medium grey colour against the night sky but not vividly, more fuzzy or hazy. I could not hear any obvious sounds, which might indicate a regular type of aircraft; it was very quiet outside and no wind. I observed the objects moving slowly on a north northwesterly direction from my location.  I watched the objects for about 7 (seven) seconds when they became obstructed from my view by the tall building I was standing by. I ran to the furthest edge of the parking lot to visually engage them again but there was nothing there. I estimate their elevation to be somewhere between 1000 (one thousand) to 1500 (fifteen hundred) feet high. I estimate the size of the objects to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 (sixty) to 100 (one hundred) feet down the longest side of the triangular shape and the back or tail end of somewhere near 125 (one hundred and twenty five) to 150 (one hundred fifty) feet from tip to tip at the tail. They were a stout looking shape with an estimated height of about 50 (fifty) feet tall. The objects were flying in an orderly formation one ahead of the other but not trailing each others slip stream. Each object flew behind and to the right of the forward object. The objects moved in the direction of the pointed front with the (V) trailing behind or to the back of the objects. There were no other aircraft heard or seen in the area.

UFO Report from May 18, 2014  I am reporting this event witnessed by myself alone outside.  It was so unusual, I thought it would be reportable.  I have never made a report like this before.  I am skeptical of UFO’s in general, but believe that people like myself report unusual occurrences in order to find out the truth regarding such occurrences.  There may be a plausible explanation for certain occurrences. I am a retired firefighter, living in the suburbs of Chicago.  I am a U. S. Army veteran.  I have a college degree.  I have always had a keen interest in military aviation and space travel.  I have been to many of the annual Chicago Air and Water Shows at the Lake front.  I watch the skies for jet travel, local and transcontinental, and recognize the “circle route” when I see it.  I also have friends who are airline pilots. Yesterday, May 18th, in the evening, I witnessed what I would call an unusual occurrence.  I was at a local dog park with my Golden Retriever.  It is located at 185 Spring Ave., 60137 (41.865944, -88.044325).  This park has a large open sky area.  At approximately 20:32 hours, right at twilight, I witnessed what looked like a single jet contrail moving across the sky at a very high altitude.  I could not visualize the aircraft, but it seemed very small.  The surprising fact was that the front of the contrail, was moving faster than anything I have ever seen before. The contrail itself was smaller than a commercial aircraft contrail that I have witnessed, single, hazy, and white.  The background of the sighting was blue sky and I was facing north.  It also was evaporating at a fast rate as it crossed the sky.  It was moving from the north to the east, at a heading of approximately 100 degrees.  It disappeared in a very few seconds.  The altitude appeared to be as high as I have ever seen a commercial aircraft.  The aircraft appeared to be moving three times faster than a commercial flight.  The aircraft may have been in a circle route, because it appeared to be gaining altitude in a straight line.  The contrail stopped, and disappeared without any further sighting. So my first thought is maybe a military fighter jet.  I have seen them before at this approximate altitude.  What was missing was the roar of the jet engine.  No sound came from this fast moving aircraft.  That is all I remember at this time. Respectfully submitted",2014-06-04T00:00:00,41.8661,-88.05829999999999

I went in to get a camera and while inside my son saw a second one pass by, slightly farther away.   As it passed by it dropped off a smaller version of itself, that slowly descended to the ground.

Three small red lights were in a triangle formation were cruising along the beach line, fairly high in the sky, but not as high as a commercial airliner would be. they made no sound and as they were approaching, they then disappeared all the the same point in the sky. 30 seconds later a single red light followed the same pattern as the other three and disappeared at the same pint.   2 more followed that one about 15 seconds behind each other and disappeared at the same point in the sky.  Then three more in triangle formation and they also disappeared at same point in sky.   They were all the same shape, color, size and all disappeared at same point in sky and they made no noise.   No way they were aircraft, helicopters or anything else I have ever seen.  VERY VERY strange -- and the three other people with me are all UFO non-believers, but could NOT explain what it could have logically been as there was no clouds and they made no noise.  Only comment made was that someone mentioned there was a military base near Elizabeth City, but we still did not know what that would lend to the solution of what they were.",2014-08-29T00:00:00,,

The sky was clear, dark, and surprisingly, for a Friday night.  I could see an unusual amount of stars.   But one light, which appeared to be a star was moving across the sky slowly, but fast enough to recognize it was indeed moving.  I stared at it, looked around, walked onto the street to get a better view, and looked up again.  It was still hovering, at a fairly consistent speed headed southeast from my vantage point.   I pulled out my phone to take a video, but I could not get enough exposure so i put it up.  Then all of the sudden, like the flick of a light switch, it was gone.  I looked all over the sky for another sign, but failed to.   So i called my friend who I was texting to tell him about what I believed was a ufo, and as I was talking to him, another light, with the s! ame brightness and size sped across the sky, almost as fast as a meteor that reaches the atmosphere.

I kept watching to see if I would notice additional blinking lights like on a plane and there were none. the shape seemed to be diamond like and bright like a star.   I ran to grab 2 friends and showed them the very bright flying object which made no noises at all.  We all 3 of us stood there going what the hell is this??  Trying to make sense of it.   Then it just dimmed to orange then disappeared.  It did not get obstructed by anything.  Totally clear night and gone just like that.  It actually dimmed out slowly to orange and then was gone.   I noticed on the news this morning about recent sightings in other states and Nashville too recently.  This was real.

It had no blinking strobes that would have identified it as an aircraft. We forgot about it and around 11:00 p.m.   I went outside to watch and listen to fireworks, and a live rock concert taking place across a neighboring field when I noticed a semi-bright white light low in the southern sky over the Bellingham Bay - Lummi Island area.  I was thinking that it looked like the moon behind clouds... the sky was about 95% overcast with small open holes where I could see some stars.   The light slowly turned in a westerly direction changing from white to the bright orangish-red color.  I got my binoculars and my sister and when we looked for it again it was behind a clump of trees but we could still see it intermittently.   When it completely re-emerged there were two of them! moving slowly and appearing to be connected in some way.  One appeared to be following and catching up to the other light -- or they were two lights connected to a moving craft, that appeared to get closer together as the object rotated and moved away from us.   I felt that there was no way that two aircraft would be flying that close together at night.  They did what the earlier light did, slowly moving away from us in an upward trajectory in the SW sky and then blinked out or disappeared into the cloudcover.

While watching stars on my deck, I noticed a bright orange/red star at low altitude move slowly from the Pacific Ocean towards the east near my house.  The body was orange/red (with spikes of light, like a star) with a faint light (cone) shape in front of the aircraft. It was moving slowly in a straight line.  Then seconds later, 3 more objects moved in the same direction as the first one.  They looked the same as the first one, and but they had a faint cone of light surrounding them.  I could hear a subtle engine noise.  They were all about 1,000 feet in the air.   Then a fifth one was seen, moving in the same direction as the other 4. At first I thought they were balloons, but they moved faster than balloons, and I don't think balloons will come from the ocean onto land, nor travel at night.  There was really no wind to speak of.  They all disappeared from sight when traveling eastward from my direction. The lights didn't blink, nor were any normal colors seen (white, blue).  What struck me the most was the bright orange/red color, and the cone of light surrounding the main body of light.  My best guess is that they were drones, but if so, why fly 5 of them in the same flight path?  I was able to take photos, and also recorded some of the objects with my digital camera.
