I believe it was in the summer of ’94, during the night, I was awakened by a sound outside my open bedroom window.  My wife slept through it. I may have been sleeping lightly because my two daughters were in sleeping bags on the deck next to our bedroom. The sound was early in the morning, maybe three thirty or so. I didn’t get up, but rather fell back to sleep. If I was to describe the sound I would have to say it was like that of a sound effect from a sci-fi movie. It was a combination of humming low with whooshing and whirring . It was close to the house in the back yard just beyond the deck. The oscillation  accelerated as it rose and faded out of earshot at an angular direction. It’s funny how much information can be gleamed from just a sound. 	As I began to wake up at my more normal time, fivethirty to six, I was absently distracted by a steady irregular tinging sound in my lower back yard. I was getting my lunch ready for work, shower and the usual routine with this sense of this background noise just not being part of it, not being part of the usual. I always run late to work but I had to walk down to the lower yard on my way out to see what was making the noise. My lower yard consisted of a stand of older growth fir trees and I had the habit of collecting junk and storing it down below. One such item was the drum off of a cement mixer truck. Anyway the ground was covered with pine cones from the trees; they had been falling off by the hundreds out of the tree stand apparently for several hours. The ting sound was the ones hitting the cement drum. I first considered squirrels but there were so many cones. 	I was called out to by my neighbor from across a fence from which she had no view wanting to know what I was doing. She was obviously hearing the cones as well. It wasn’t until later that day I connected the early morning sound with the strange de-coning of my trees. I believe this was a close encounter. 	For reference my house is on the west side of Vashon Island in the Puget Sound  in Washington State.

This sighting happened with a good friend of mine which I will not name.  He took me to Bassett to introduce me to a cousin of his for a possible date with her.   After some chatting with her and her father we decided to drive back to Ainsworth which is about 17 miles.   By the time we left her house it was dark with no moon visible. It was also a very clear, crisp December night with no wind, ( unusual for NE!!). On the way home I noticed an unusually bright star in the North West, more West than North.  The closer we came to town, the closer this light seemed to be.  It did not appear to move, and the closer to town we came, the higher up it appeared.  As if it were stationary and we were approaching it.   At the time we were about ¾’s of the way home I pointed this out to my friend and it sparked his curiosity.  We continued to watch it until we were 1 mile outside of Ainsworth.  At that time I asked him if he would turn off onto a country road leading north.  He did, and we drove 1 mile north, turned back West and drove about ¼ mile then stopped. We sat with the pickup running and observed this bright light in the sky for about 30 seconds.  We were the only vehicle on the road since this is a very rural area.  At our vantage point, the only other lights in our immediate area were distant yard lights and the other stars in the sky, not to mention the soft glow from town.  He mentioned that it looked like a light from a helicopter searchlight and I agreed, it looked like it was about 500 feet up and about ½ mile to the Northwest of us.  It was at this moment that he shut off the pickup and the lights.   About 1 second after he killed the lights, the light in the sky literally turned off!  We sat there stunned for about 1 minute looking at where it had been, we started to see a light again, but it was faint.  It grew brighter and brighter until it was as bright as it was before.  I rolled down my window to see if I could hear an engine or something, but it was dead silent. My friend got very nervous and said, ""We’re gettin’ the hell out of here!""  He started up the pickup turned on the lights and high-tailed it to town.  We both lived in town at the time, so he dropped me off, didn’t say a word about it and he went home.  He still lives here and hasn’t said anything about that night since then.  I was honestly still a little freaked out about it so I called the sheriff’s office to see if there were any reports about strange lights.  The dispatcher said there had been no reports.  I managed to lie down and get a little sleep that night, but when I woke at 6:30 the next morning the light was still in the sky, except it was more in the West.  It remained in the Westerly sky until I went to bed the next night and I have not seen it since then.   Some days, months, and years after I have asked certain close friends of mine if they saw anything unusual around that time, but none have admitted to seeing anything.  I don’t claim that this was an alien spacecraft, but it was the strangest thing I’ve ever seen, and I think I speak for my friend too.

We were facing the back yard, seated in lawn chairs, talking, and all of a sudden the entire back yard (about an acre of ground) lit up in blue light.  We looked over our left shoulders (both of us, there was no sound and yet oddly we both looked over our left shoulders at the same exact time) and there was a bright blue light hovering there.  It was just that... a light and it stayed there pulsating for about 5 seconds I'd say... then it started to move and just disappeared.  My mom and I don't tell anyone about this because we know people will think we are nuts.  This is the first time I've ever put something like this out there.  We have no reason to try to make people believe that we saw what we saw.  I just thought I'd post this so that others out there that also have witnessed something as strange as this don't feel like they are alone.  I'm sure that some day what we all saw will come to ""light"" - pardon the pun.  By the way, from California to the east coast people saw this blue light at precisely the same exact time of day.  It was noted in the papers and news but was dismissed by scientists as possible meteors... though my mom and I, and everyone else who witnessed it, knows it could not have been - for it never hit the earth and it was hovering.  A meteor would not stop in the air.   I was not scared of this light... though looking back on it I'm surprised that I wasn't ... because it was so incredibly ""odd"" (that's the best word I can use right now to describe it)...nothing I'd every seen before and I don't necessarily believe in aliens or things of the like.  I did feel afterward that night that we had been ""observed"". It's a strange thing to say...and it was a strange thing to feel at the time.  My mom and I joked that it was taking our picture...then over a year later we were talking about it again and discussed the possibility of it being some government testing type o! f object...but that too sounds too strange to believe.  Anyway, don't feel like you are alone...all of you who have seen something like this...but then again don't try to convince anyone who didn't see it for themselves because they will only think you are nuts.  My own dad and sister don't believe my mom and me....we just don't talk about it to them because we too would likely not believe someone had we not seen it for ourselves.

I was driving south on 270 to a friend’s house and was passing by Port Columbus Airport, when I saw on my right what at first I thought was a helicopter (being so near the airport it seemed logical). It was around the size of a helicopter but had no tail or rotors, etc. I kept looking at it because it didn’t move and was a shadowy disk shape with white lights around the edge. I then thought it was only a plane coming in to land, but it just sat in the sky. I kept driving.  Then I noticed an identical UFO about 50 feet directly above a box car of a train on the Columbus & Ohio River Railroad bridge that goes right past the airport. The UFO was shining a large white light down from the center of the underside of the disk onto one of the box cars, as though it were inspecting it. The light was very wide, taking up the middle part of the underside of the UFO—maybe it was at least a 7-10ft. wide searchlight. It was illuminating an entire box car and part of another.  I then noticed a third identical-looking UFO to my left in a grassy area right before the bridge. It was almost touching the ground, and it shown a bright white searchlight on the ground, too. (My truck was noisy, but I could not hear any noise from the UFOs). I passed under the railroad bridge, directly under the one UFO above it. I became excited and exited at Broad St. instead of Main St., which is where I was originally headed. As I was about to make a U-turn to get back onto 270, I saw yet a fourth identical UFO directly in front of me, but higher in the sky and further away, possibly 500 feet away.  I made the U-turn and got back onto 270 and continued to Main St. I didn't try and go back the other way on 270 to take another look, because I would be late to an appointment. There were many cars on the freeway, so there had to be others who saw the UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I immediately had a feeling he suspected a ufo for some weird reason, but had no idea what we were about to witness. As I came to the bottom of the ramp, I stopped for a moment and just watched as this flying craft came towards us. It seemed to have no steady path. It had incredibly bright white lights and immediately, in mid-air turned those lights off seconds after I stopped at the bottom of the ramp. As we watched, the craft, which was Absolutely Not an airplane, and didn’t appear to be a helicopter either, it dropped straight down about 250 feet in the air, hovered, and then started to rise again. 	I turned right at the stopligh t(at the bottom of the ramp) and then proceded to my restaurant.  My boyfriend told me within 20 seconds from leaving the bottom of the ramp that it was directly above my car.  It stayed above my car as I drove to the restaurant.  My boyfriend told me he looked straight up at it and it was just spinning fast.  It was only about 4-600 feet in the air above us. It looked in the beginning like it was going to land right before our eyes.  It appeared to have 3 little lights on it, one was red and the other two were yellow or white.  This was too low to be a helicopter or plane.  After placing my order I remarked to my boyfriend that I was going to ask someone if they had or could see this thing too!

When we were approaching the Tobaggan Rd./Towerline Rd. intersection, we both seen a light in the sky that must have been quite a few miles away, it resembled a star because of the distance, but something tells me it was an airplane or some type of object. We seen this object fall very quickly, it didn’t fall in the blink of an eye, however; it fell gradually but quick.  This object was south east of Towerline Rd. The strangest part of this is that after we seen the object falling all of sudden it disappeared without any big light (sign of explosion) or trace- it didn’t fade away whatsoever, it just completely disappeared. The object looked as if it was crashing to the Earth, it was falling at around a 45 degree angle, and must have been traveling 200 mph or faster- from the speed I seen it falling as far away as we were. My girlfriend witnessed this first, then I seen it as soon as I looked in the sky ahead of us while we were driving.

Of course, it could have been as far as 100 miles however for some reason I had the idea that it was closer- it just didn’t appear to be a star even though all we seen was one white light.

It was an exceptionally clear night sky and I was impressed by the clarity of most of the brightest stars in the Eastern sky, including Regulus, which is the first star I was able to identify.   I was about to come inside after a couple of minutes of stargazing, when I noticed a very subdued and somewhat translucent object appear in the Southern Sky above the angle of my garage roof that caught my attention for just a second or two, due to its very fast South to North motion in the sky.  It appeared as a single object and then rapidly dispersed into several, 9 to 12 egg-shaped, very uniform objects that scattered in shotgun like pattern and then completely disappeared.  I would estimate the angle above the horizon and my garage roof to be about 30-35 degrees; was unusually horizontal and low to the horizon for a meteoric atmospheric contact.  I have witnessed hundreds of meteor showers over the years and have seen countless satellites in the night sky.  Most of these types of observations have had a distinctive brilliance or very noticeable luminosity to them.  In this particular case, which only lasted a couple of seconds, had a relativity low luminosity and certain amount of translucent quality to it. I suppose this event could most likely be classified as a low angle, low mass, meteoric atmospheric contact, which didn’t have a lot of rarefaction to it and thus very low luminosity or brilliance as most of the meteoric displays that I have witnessed in the past, however, this even I would consider to be of importance due to the uniformity of the object and dispersion pattern and its low level luminosity and translucence that I have never before seen in the sky.  After this occurred, I came inside to note the time on the clock on the stove, which was 10:47pm.  I went outside again, to see if there were any more meteoric activity, when I noticed a cloud formation in the Eastern sky , above the city, which wasn’t there previously.  This cloud formation was very small and somewhat rectangular and eventually disappeared in a matter of minutes.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,51.04237871352785,-114.05744246242263

I looked up to the sky in the direction he was pointing.  What I saw were three triangle shaped black objects moving very slowly across the sky in a easterly direction.  I called out to my wife, who had taken a few dishes into the house, to hurry outside and take a look at these things.  My wife came outside, looked up to where my son and I were looking and also observed the three flying objects.  My son ran into the house and brought out our digital camera but said that he could not find the objects in the view-finder of the camera.  I then ran into the house to get our binoculars but could not find them so I returned outside, and together we observed the black triangles drift across the the sky untill they entered the clouds.  Facts:   We observed the objects for about ten minutes from 13:55 to 14:05 local time (PDT).  The objects were triangle in shape, and black in color with no lights observed.  They were moving in a kind of formation (two close together and the other one by itself).  We did not hear any sound coming from the at all.  Sky cover was completly overcast with a cumulo-stratus cloud layer at about 3000 to 3500 feet above ground level.  The objects were clearly visible against the clouded background.  I am 100% sure that these objects were not airplanes (unless top secret), they were not helicopters, ballons, kites, birds, or blimps.

My husband was teasing me, saying ""Hey, remember that time you thought you saw aliens?"" and as I was defending what I had seen months earlier, and  he said ""Holy shit, look at that!"" I looked up and there was a disk, that was illuminated very slightly green, though there were no lights visible. It took about 15 seconds to pass over us and disappear out of our sight. A few minutes later, there was a second disk, exactly like the first. About half an hour later, another formation flew over head. It looked almost like a small grouping, flying in a formation. There were maybe 6 or so, flying closely together in a wavy line. Less than a minute later, there was another small grouping, this time flying in the shape of a triangle. These last two were dark in color, not illuminated at all. We could only see them because they were darker than the sky. The last one came at about 11:15pm, it was another disk like the first two. All 5 of the UFOs that we saw came from the same direction (S, SW), and headed the exact same direction (N, NE). It was a clear night, and it seems like just before or just after they flew overhead, the sky flashed with lightening, though there were no lightening bolts. All of the 'lightening' was coming from about the same direction as the UFOs were heading. This experience is one of the most incredible. Even my husband, who is a skeptic of all things supernatural couldn't believe it. This is the first experience of its kind for both of us.

I was driving my car and coming into Downtown Portland from the 405 Freeway. I was heading to take the Couch St./Burnside St. Exit. Just before I approached the exit, I noticed to my left in the sky at about a forty five degree angle two very bright, orange in color objects. One was at a complete standstill. There was another object, closely approaching very slowly as if to meet up with the object standing still. It came from the south. When it reached the first object it then was at a standstill with the first object. Then coming from the North, a little farther left from the two objects that were at a stand still, was another object which looked exactly the same as the first two. As it neared the first two objects, the first two objects started to move away very, very slowly to the south as the third object was heading closer to them from the north. I noticed an airplane, which came from the north and heading south near the now, three objects. I couldn't tell if the airplane was going to fly under the objects or just near them.  I also wasn't sure if the airplane was flying towards them to check them out or if it was just there coincidentally at the time.  The airplane was smaller than a passenger airplane and looked to be flying considerably low. I could see the lights and the shape of this craft and it definitely was an airplane. The other objects were not like this airplane at all. The objects looked like they were a little higher than the airplane. I really can't say how high the plane or objects were. The plane flew past the objects that were heading south.  Then I noticed a fourth object coming from the north just behind the third object as I took the Couch St Exit and turned left onto Couch St. heading east. I followed the four objects as they were heading in a S/SE direction. I was still heading east on Couch St. The four objects were flying very, very slowly now to my right at about a forty five degree angle.  I came to a stop sign on Couch and I looked directly up from my front windshield at about a 90 degree angle and noticed two more objects directly above my car. They were bright, orange in color objects that appeared to be fiery, or on fire. I really tried to get a focus on them, but could only notice the glow and haze which seemed to be in motion, almost like a candle’s flickering. The two objects were at a stand still. I know this because I was at a complete stop, too.  About one minute later the two objects proceeded very, very slowly to the S/SE. They also started to change in size of glow. They got smaller and then bigger again as they headed S/SE.   When they got smaller they looked more like stars.  The other four objects had  just left my view as I noticed the two objects that were directly above me.   A few blocks down I came to another stop.  I kept waving to cars on my right to continue after their stop as I was at a four way stop.  Me and my two friends were watching the four earlier objects as they moved slowly, S/SE above a  white building that had  some  radar like items and other things on top of the building.  The objects looked like they were much higher than the building as their glow got smaller as they moved S/SE.  We were at this stop sign watching for about three minutes or so.  Then we proceeded down Couch street to NW Broadway and along the way would still notice the objects as they headed S/SE.  I turned right at NW Broadway and headed into a parking lot that used to be a Burger King and my friend called 911.  They gave her the phone number to the UFO Center.  I called the UFO Center in Washington State and gave my report.  As I gave my report I was watching the last two objects  that at one point was right above my car, fly off in the distance heading S/SE.  They looked like two stars flying away in the distance with one on top of the other.  They looked to be about an inch apart as they drifted still very, very slowly and then eventually fading away.

It traveled very slowly, gliding almost, east past the USBancorp tower (between 5th and 6th avenue and Burnside) just passing it (but higher than the building, which is 470 feet approximately).  About three blocks after the tower it slowly turned south.  It continued for I would say a mile to a mile and a half.  The lights were still very clear, just a little faded.    2)  The angle of the lights was about 60 degrees.  These lights lasted about ten minutes or so in duration, without breaking or flashing.  These lights were amber in hue, but as I really studied them, I noticed that one of the lights might have been more red (I believe that there were three lights in a very small cluster).   My husband was with me at the time, and he will be filing an individual report this week.  We both stood there and watched these and discussed what it might be.  I guess we were trying to rationalize what we were seeing above a major metropolitan area.  Nothing made sense, nor does now.  They could have very easily been attached in some way though, for moving that slow, with absolutely no sound.  It is very quiet where I live, so we can hear anything flying in the sky.  There is a helipad five blocks away and we can hear them for a good ten to twelve blocks.  Especially that night, it was late in the evening and our building was silent.  There was hardly any traffic going by. I have already given my consent to an interview with the Oregonian.  You might also think about calling the Portland Tribune, it is an independent local newspaper.    Let me know if you want that picture, I'll take it tonight and then one in the morning for a daylight shot. I have enclosed a map of where I live and other points of reference.

I could not see any military jets, commercial planes, or helicopters (they would have the flashing or strobe lights in the night sky). Conditions were light hazy skies to the horizons with views of constellations above. I saw four red lights moving north to south at a slow speed. The lights traveled in pairs of two. In each pair, one red light angled higher than the other spaced by a degree or two, followed by a larger space (up to 5 degrees), and then followed by the other pair of two. These two pairs of lights did not break their formation and continued south until they vanished from sight. They were as bright as Venus and seem to be around 10 thousand feet. As I was viewing these four objects come and go another pair of two red lights were slowing moving north to south above in or around downtown Portland. These two did seem to slow down couple times or at least move to the west. I viewed this pair for a couple minutes before vanishing in the southern horizon.

I thought it was a plane but it had no blinking red or green lights.  By this time my friend was looking on.  We both notice how fast it was moving though it was not streaking. My freind said it looked like it had a bar of lights on the underneath side of the craft.  I would resemble it to a flying wing that was completely illuminated on the underside with its lights having partioning lines between them. It appeared so large at first that I thought it could have been an owl perhaps 50 yards away illuminated by street lights.  This thing just kept on going and was out of site much more quickly than a plane that stared out looking that big. The direction it was flying in was southwest.  It disappeared within a span of 15 seconds. Again, it appeared to have the shape of a flying wing or just a bank of lights like a somewhat rectangular thing flying with the wide side forward.

First spotted what appeared to me to be a large aircraft with I’m guessing 2 to 3 lights, very bright white, almost directly inline in the direction I was traveling.  This was just a little south of Folsom Damn Road. My initial impression was of a  commercial aircraft with landing lights on heading toward me.  Based on this assumption,  my estimate was that it was over the Roseville-Rocklin vicinity, maybe 10-15 miles distant.  This was a winding, slightly hilly road and I was driving between 45-50 mph.  Initially it was within my view for a few minutes consistently.  I did not focus on it all the time but was interested in figuring out maybe what it was since it seemed unusual in it’s flight path for the area.  Most commercial lights run E/W  and having landing lights at that position seemed premature, especially for any southbound flight path  toward the old Mather AFB where I know there is corporate commercial traffic.  As I proceeded north, the road became more winding, with many tall trees bordering it.  My view of the craft became more intermittent.  My focus was on driving safely, since I still assumed it was nothing  more than an aircraft.  But I still tried to keep a general eye on it.   Not knowing whether the winding road was affecting by judgment, my distinct impression was maybe it was gradually swerving in a gentle turn slightly west.  The trees along the west side of the road were interrupting any continuous view to just a few seconds.  As I approached at some point seemed to be stationary in it’s position.  Without being positive one way or another, it is possible it was stationary more or less from the point I first saw it.  At this point I assumed it was a helicopter, with not the ordinary display of lights.   This still seemed off since this is not an area I would ordinary think of helicopters.  These lights were not searchlight, as the they were not scanning and there was not light stream through the sky.  At approximately 2 - 1 ½ miles of Douglas road it was evident the object was hovering within a mile ahead maybe ½ - ¾  west of  Folsom Auburn Rd.  Not knowing it’s size but based on my speed an approaching it I  would guess it was between 500 - 1000 feet in altitude.  At this point I was pretty sure it was not a helicopter.  There was no noise associated with it.  The lights were more blurry at  this point,  not knowing whether it was due to cloud overcast or moisture in the air.  My observation was still limited to quick glances of it when it came into view.  My distinct  impression of it at this point was of something poivnting E/W, large hovering with some type of frame of lights on its south facing side.  At this point I felt it had to be a blimp, or some very large balloon like object.  I felt I needed to pull of to get a better & consistent view of it.  There was a single vehicle behind me, following closely but no shoulder to safely pull over.  I knew there was a place to turn off right within a couple hundred yards so I kept proceeding.  At this point I was approaching being perpendicular with the object to the East.   At this point I was able to see some of its outline.  The sky was fairly dark and I could see slight difference in the shade of darkness between the object and the background sky.  I saw it twice for just a split second each time.  It seemed I was mostly seen maybe the top right quarter of the object, and the closest I can say was it appeared do be blimp-like.  The top portion ran E/W slight curving downward East with it changing to something indistinguishable at its end.  The light were still on but much less visible and bright,  seemed to be slight away from the body of the object.  My impression of the lights were very indistinct, blurry, maybe shadowy, if that makes sense.  There was awareness of a bulk behind them but at the same time I saw nothing distinct that you would think you would see based on the lights even if they were pointing away from the object.   I lived in Southern California for thirty years until the early 1980’s, and seeing blimps were a very common occurrence living in northern Torrance near the Goodyear blimp airfield in Carson.  This just seemed different.  Too low to the ground where there was no imminent landing.  The lights were different.  Not like the normal running lights of an airship and definitely not like the commercial lights for ad display.  There was no familiar hum of the engines.  There was absolutely no sound at all.  As pulled past it slightly the lights were less easily seen, my assumption because I was now behind it , more toward it’s north side.  I pulled over on the next intersection at Fuller St. and made a quick U-turn and pulled over to the curb, expecting to see the objection facing west at maybe 10-11 o’clock.  But to my surprise, it was already moving south,  much quicker than I anticipated, especially since I assumed it was a balloon like object.  I could still  see lights but much dimmer and it was moving south still.  I’m guessing maybe at this point it was 1-2 miles away already.  This shocked me.  Blimps do not move that fast.  But at the same time, it did not seem to pulling away at a fantastic speed.  I decided that if it was a blimp like object I should be at least able to keep in view for awhile if I headed back south in direction I came and the direction it was proceeding so I turned left back on Auburn Folsom Rd.  I had to wait from 5-10 seconds for the light to change.  Already the object was I’m guessing was at least 5 mi, so I was anxious but still I followed.  I only caught a glimpse of the light a couple time over thles away next 5 minutes.  Losing sight due to the winding road and the trees.  I knew after I got closer to Folsom Damn Road my view would open up and then I might be able to reacquire my observation.  My impression was that since I was no longer able to see the lights that it had moved back east across the road and that I had missed this flight path.  When I got to the clear area it definitely not south or southwest.  It was not in the air east either but I concluded the only possible conclusion for the disappearance of the craft was it went east over Lake Folsom or landed in that direction.  I thought all of the assumptions were very slim.  I was just trying to think of a rational logical explanation for what I observed.  If I heard this story from someone I would be skeptical.  I would assume there were flaw in persons observations, logistically in the least.  I am not one to make any fantastical assumptions about anything in life.  I ALWAYS assume a logical explanation for everything that seems less than logical.  I am very observant and analytical.  Its what I do and who I am.  Most people would consider me very intelligent and very informed.  If someone could explain to me possible scenarios to what I observed I would welcome them.  Based on my experience I can think of absolutely nothing that would conform to my observations.  Thought I will admit my view of the object were fleeting and less than very distinct,  they were such that they were very analytical.  I would definitely refute anybody’s allegation of anything that would explain it that did not fall in line with what I observed.  But at the same time I would accept that would explain it that made sense.  But my sense of the timing and logistics were very accurate.   I would say my guestimates of distance and height are  subject to some question based on the size of the object and never getting more the a second or two glimpse of it, my ability to gauge these things has always been way above average.  I am a very observant fellow.  I do not base my observations on whims like most people.  If I say something, it is.  If I’m not sure, I will say so without problem.  If I don’t know, I will say so.  As far as my thoughts whether this was observed by anyone else, until I figured out it was hovering, I doubt if most people in the cars would have assumed anything abnormal.  If I lived in the vicinity of where it was hovering and was outside,  I’m guessing if I saw it I would had observed it.  I’m guessing within a mile of the object, anyone walking or outside would have definitely after seeing it, would have continued to observe it.  It was a cool night and maybe two hours after sundown.  The air was generally still and the sky seemed mostly overcast but I could distinguish of couple of stars.  This a suburban, semi-rural area.   There seemed to be slight reflection of city lights off the overcast clouds but getting darker definitely as you move East, with it getting much darker just about at the juncture of Auburn-Folsom road, with the definite effect of the large Lake Folsom to the immediate east.  When I saw the silhouette, this difference in shade of darkness of the object and sky was very slight but enough to distinguish the shape that I saw.  If needed I could make a cursory drawing of what I saw.  It was not a whole image.  I do not have scanner available at this moment but could do so if it would help.  The drawing would be rudimentary.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,38.7625,-121.1649

The object was bright and appeared to be streaming material behind (my son thought it might have been on fire).  We drive this freeway often and see planes crossing overhead the freeway (east-west) all the time on final approach to Bush Intl airport.  What primarily caught our attention was the speed, direction and altitude of the object.  We watched it continue in a northeast direction, until it either got too low to see or disappeared over the horizon.

As dusk started to settle in, I noticed a polar-orbit satellite going over and pointed it out to my son. We chatted for a while after that, then started scanning for more sats as the evening got a little darker (I had just mentioned the Sputnik anniversary, so we were inspired).  Before long, we saw another sat... I think that it was about this time (maybe 8pm) that we came in and looked up visible sat passes tonight on heavens-above.com.  Went back outside, both looking up - and we both notice, at the same time, a fairly tight group of objects nearly straight above us, somewhat to the north. There are five small lighted ""somethings"" moving quickly across the sky toward the south...  They were in a line, not perfectly straight across, but close... Moving much faster than a sat, not pinpoints like stars but *very* small, distinct circles. Not very bright - from comparing to the sats that we saw tonight (mostly Cosmos rocket bodies), I would say magnitude 3 or so each. The whole group was maybe 2-3 moon widths across. My first thought was a large meteor breaking up, but it was too slow for that.  If the speed wasn't enough to dismiss the meteor theory, the behaviour of the objects was - they changed their orientation, one to another, almost as if jockeying for position as they crossed the sky, eventually forming a shallow arc! I started saying ""holy $#&^!"" out loud by this time, and my son and I had time to look at each other and look back up and watch these things fly off to the south, probably 15-20 seconds after we spotted them.  They disappeared into the light pollution on the horizon at maybe 20-30 degrees up and off to the SSE.  I must have looked totally freaked out, because my son said to me several times, ""I saw them, too, Dad, I saw them too!"". I flipped open my cell phone for the time - 8:23pm.  There was no sound, absolutely nothing. Too fast for high altitude aircraft. No lights like aircraft. No way they were sats or breaking up debris - they swapped position with each other, very quickly, and flew in formation.  I even checked the upper air data when it came in later this evening to see if maybe, just maybe, we were looking at balloons (I know my high altitude balloons are sometimes reported as UFOs - things can look strange way up in the sky). Upper air sounding from 0z tonight showed winds in the right direction at around 9k-12k feet (I think - not near the ground, anyway, so they weren't party balloons and we mistook the apparent altitude) but only at 20 knots or so (which looks really darn slow from 10k feet away). And there's no way that I could make balloons - even purposely-designed as a hoax - do what these things did.  This is the third time in 20 years that I've seen something downright unexplainable in the sky. First time was 20 years or so ago - six or so lights in a ""T"" arrangement, apparent triangular outline, moving silently across the night sky (dimmer yet than these tonight). Second, about seven years ago, *exactly* the same as the first time, but moving in the opposite direction (first time the ""T"" arrangement went base-first, second time went top-first). Silent both times, hard to even see. Now this…  Honestly, I wish I hadn't seen this. I'm still rather freaked - and I'm rational, teach computers and science, design and fly high-altitude scientific balloons, do a reasonable amount of sky-watching, take no medications, rarely drink... I *wasn't* seeing things and I can find NOTHING that matches what we saw.  The two triangle things in the past I have written off to the much-rumoured secret mil airship - fits the descriptions in Aviation Week from a long time ago). But this?? My son was thrilled, wanted to see it again, seemed to be totally in awe. I can't sleep right now but wish I could….",2007-10-08T00:00:00,42.494305741626796,-83.02442081339713

It seems to me that the G-forces would not be too forgiving on the occupants inside of the craft.

NUFORC  Today, November 16, 2007, at approximately 6:40pm c.s.t, while relaxing in my hottub on the back deck,  I noticed two lights, one very bright to the naked eye and another one of less intensity. The brighter one was crossing the sky from south to slightly northeast, while the lesser light moved on a  southeast to northwest heading on what appeared to be an intercept course.  I watched them move until they were both obscured by the lattice barrier on my deck.  This is only part of the events that followed. Since I have a quality IR monocular for night vision, I decided to obtained it from within my house and quickly reentered my hottub.  The events that follow occurred between 6:45 and 7:15. pm, c.s.t.  While scanning the visible night sky, I having previously observed two lights moving across the night sky from south to north with the naked eye, observed not two [2], but  eight [8] moving lights in the night sky, but not all at once.   About 6:45, I observed my first light using the night vision scope.  It was headed from north to southeast.  I can observe the sky from about 35 degrees above the northern horizon to about 90 degrees overhead. The lighted object was moving at a good pace to the southeast observable for about 15 to 20 seconds with my scope.   Once out of my viewable area, I continued to scan the area of the sky I could observe for any additional moving lights. Again I was surprised to see two [2] medium intensity lights like a flashlight beam from several blocks away, moving to the north northeast in a right echelon formation at a pace much slower the that of the single light I had observed some minutes prior.  I was able to track them for a much longer period possible 2 minutes duration.  Their physical separation remained constant during my observance of their track across the sky.  Losing sight of them due to obstructions, I continued to scan the night sky for additional objects.   Over the next 15 to 20 minutes, I observed  four [4] additional lighted objects one [1] moving from the north to south in my viewable area and the other three [3] were observed moving from southwest to north northeast. All of the moving lights observed during this time had light intensities as noted above. The altitudes of all these observed lights were estimated to be out of our atmosphere, but well below the stationary star formations observed as they passed by.  I’ve never seen so many observable moving lights in all my years of star gazing in just one segment of time today, Friday the 16th of November.  If I have a dependable star chart, I could approximate their track across the night sky due to my very definable and observable viewing parameters. These lighted objects, don’t appear to be any military craft and possibly could be various satellites in orbit, but that scenario is highly unlikely, too many in such a short period of time.   Has anyone else observed these moving lights during this time period?  Time will tell I guess.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,39.01482293577982,-94.28685825688073

Was seen first as a bright white light as big around as an ink pen app. 300 yds away in the eastern sky at 20:15. Elevation was at a 40 to 45 degree angle. Height was about what one would expect of a low fling small aircraft. The skys were clear until 22:15. We observed the light not moving for app. 5 minutes. My fellow security guard and I were on patrol and lost sight of the light behind a large two story house before going on with our patrol. After doing an outer perimter check, which took about 5 to 7 minutes, we reached a place we should have been able to see the light again and it was gone. At app. 21:20 I dropped my partner off at the security office and drove the same route to see if I could see the light again. The white light was not to be seen, but I seen three red lights perfectly diagonal and spaced in the same general location. I observed the lights for a minute or two trying to think if there was any towers or  buildings in that direction tall enough for these unblinking red lights. The answer is No. I started my patrol of the south part of the proprty and returned to security office at 21:30. Upon returning to security office I spotted 2 red lights directly in front of security and pointed them out to my partner. When asked if he had ever seen them there before he said no. These lights seemed to be about a mile or mile and a half futher east, hard to tell. They too were unblinking and unmoving. The red lights I saw before and these were smaller than the white light we had seen earlier. They were also slightly lower in the sky than the white light we had seen ealier. Also the spaceing was like the middle red light, when I saw three red lights, was missing. A third security gaurd came in at 21:45 and we pointed the lihgts out to him. At 21:50 I crossed the road in front of security station to get the lights from security and cars going down the road behind me to get a clearer look. I wanted to see if these lights were connected, because if they were this thing would have had to have been a hundred yards wide, very big. From security one can see radio towers blinking red but there was a different look about hese lights and they never blinked on and off. While trying to get a closer a look a friend of mine called me on my cell phone. I told him to go outside and see if he could see what I was seeing. He could not and before he might see anything the 2 lights went out as if someone had turned the switch off. Just a metion here that when my partner came in that night he had a 12 sec. phone video of a simlar white light seen from his house in Springdale Ar at 4:30am the night before that he showed me when he first came to work that night. I also saw the white light the night before when I was leaveing work at 22:00 but did not take time to see. if it was a helocopter or plane. He still has it. There were planes in the area, very close, and they should have seen what ever this was plainly. I will try to get more info from local airports and radio stations to see if anyone else saw this and exactly where and how big this might have been. I called one local police station, newspaper,tv station that night to se if anyone else had seen this. Never heard back from tv or newspaper. Police said they had not reieved any reports of strange lights.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,36.29465033112582,-94.03436622516556

As he was explaining the basis of the next hole and I couldn’t pay attention to his words; all I could do was look at the sky.  Normally in the city you’re lucky to see a handful of stars and the only constellation you can ever count on is Orion’s belt.  Tonight though, outside of my brother’s apartment, I couldn’t help but stare at the sky in amazement. I don’t know if it was the clear sky or my brother’s neighborhood but the sheer magnitude and number of stars was breathtaking.  As I was scanning the sky I noticed the odd triangular shaped light forms.  They were moving quickly, faster than the planes.  They were so low and clear and as I tried to keep my eyes on them they jetted through the sky and disappeared. The whole time I kept shouting at my brother to look at them but they were moving so fast that he was never able to fix his eyes on them.  The three lights just totally disappeared.  I ran down the block looking for them, but they were gone.  I stayed outside scanning the sky for ten minutes after, looking for the lights or anything that I might have mistaken this spectacle to be.  I can’t think of any other explanation for it. It was three triangular light forms, flying in formation.  They hovered for a tiny bit, which is when I spotted them.  Intrigued and confused by what I saw, my eyes followed the shaped as they sped through the sky.  I tried to absorb as much as I could about them before they disappeared.  Each triangular formation was actually composed of smaller lights creating the triangular form.  They moved together perfectly and quickly and I know they weren't planes because I could see planes moving in the vicinity.

Then I explored the NUFORC site further and read an account regarding a possibly similar “translucent” craft close by over Pittsburgh reported to have happened during Oct of 2006.  Besides that the whole incident is just bugging me.  My daughter, a friend of hers, and I were traveling Pike Street towards the intersection of Rt. 980.  This affords us a view of the sky to the north of town and we can see part of Rt. 79N towards Pittsburgh.  The sky was overcast and a bit monotone with no visible stars.  It wasn’t dark yet.  As I slowed to stop for the intersection, a large white light appeared over the traffic light at a fair amount of distance and it just looked like an airplane that was headed straight towards us.  I noticed that there were no smaller lights to either side though and pointed it out to the teens.  They continued to watch it as we made our right turn and came to another stop a short distance away.  I was able to look out the driver side window and saw that the object was getting very close and was about to fly directly overhead.  After it passed over, my daughter pointed out a man and an adolescent girl close in a nearby parking lot pointing at the sky in the direction that the object had been headed.  I cannot begin to estimate the height accurately.  The object was under the clouds, not over them.  It was at an altitude that I would associate more with a small aircraft rather than a commercial passenger plane.  I heard no sound but the car windows were closed.  The traffic light changed and while I made the turn, my daughter continued to look for the object out of the passenger side window but did not locate it again.  When the object got closer before I had to react to the traffic light, I could see it more clearly and could eventually see the bottom of it.   I saw a large white center light surrounded by three smaller red lights within a silvery whitish outline of a triangle.  The outline gave the object an appearance of being “see-through.”  The lights were all rather muted and not exceptionally bright or glaring.  But I am the only one of us three that saw more than one light as it passed overhead.  When we discussed what we saw, the kids said that just a big white light flew over.  But I clearly saw more than that and I know I didn’t hallucinate.  Even a big white alone is rather unusual though.  There were no additional lights normally associated with an airplane and the teens are adamant about that aspect in their descriptions.   My daughter also remarked that it was odd that there were no other lights in the sky anywhere at the time of the sighting.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,40.2713,-80.1702

I was taking in my line and getting my fly rod ready to put it into its case when, out of the corner of my eye, something caught my attention. There was an odd movement in the sky. I redirected my gaze up to my left (Southwest) to see what appeared to be a star of medium brightness making erratic movements in the sky. The spot of light was moving at quite remarkable speeds in an 'S' pattern and then shot off across the night sky at a perfectly straight trajectory from southwest to north at about 11 inches (from my perspective) a second. It then faded into obscurity slowly as it sped into the distance of space above the earth. Then more of these spots began speeding across the sky at breakneck speeds, one after another, back and forth. We must have seem at least a dozen of them. At the height of the activity there were three together in a small portion of the horizon. Two of them almost collided as they crossed paths. One of the spots made an instantaneous 30 degree turn as if it were a billiard ball being banked off of a rail. It was quite curious to be sure. Neither of us could decide what we were actually seeing.

Read it and believe it. I was getting into our hot tub out off of our deck. As always I look up and enjoy the stars. I've been a star gazer my whole life.  I have NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE!  The thing was flying across the sky heading due south and off to the east a bit, not directly overhead.  One red light very dim with two sets of two directly behind. the whole thing was very small which I believe to be actually very high in the sky. -Unbelievably- fast and the real thriller is the ((deleted)) thing slowed to almost a stop and took off in another direction. I couldn't believe my eyes.  I tried to write it off as a helicopter but I heard NO SOUND.  My wife and friend came out shortly after and we hung out for a while. I told them what I saw and I don't think they believe me.   Anyway we soaked in the tub for a while and my wife went in the house. Our friend and I sat for a bit longer and intrigued  I kept watching the sky.  A few meteors throughout about an hour and one thing blew my mind.  It started out like a meteor but in the direct opposite path of the first unexplainable object.  It was a light that appeared and faded out like a meteor but it reappeared and faded and appeared again across the entire sky due north.  I of course yelled for our friend to look but she didn't see it. This too was going incredibly fast.  O.k. Now I'm starting to freak out a bit.  I've always believed in Carl Sagan about being alone. The real clincher is and this just happened one hour ago is that goddamn red thing went back south again in the exact same path. one red light very dim with two sets of two.  if you weren't looking you wouldn't see it at the same speed and damn near the same path.  It wasn't an aircraft of anything conventional. No disc shapes either. it was too high and way too fast for anything I have ever seen.  I have always thought there has to be life out there but now i have NO DOUBT. I would appreciate and explanation of what it was I saw tonight.  Duluth has a state of the art airguard base and I bet they know what !  it was or if they don't they BETTER because if what I saw is hostile we are doomed.

I had, in fact, last year reported something very similar on your network, however the size of this was remarkable today.

Monday, Memorial Day - May 28, 2007, Portland, OR, USA At about/between 18:30 to 19:00 PST, I looked up into the bright clear sunny sky, above the waxing daylit moon (full on 5/31/07) and saw what appeared to be stars or planets in the S/SE, but I knew they couldn't be stars or planets - invisible in daylit sky.  The sun was still at least an hour or so from setting.  I thought they might be satellites, but they were not moving in the fast, straight orbit pattern of satellites.  They were fairly bright (white light, like metal reflecting sun), and I realized they must be craft of some sort in the high earth atmosphere realm, either going out to space or returning.  Definitely not airplanes, they appeared to be flying above aircraft altitude and were not blinking or moving in the straight pattern as airplanes.  They were circular in shape and exactly the size of stars/planets to my relative view.  They were about 20 degrees up from the horizon in the S/SE section of sky over SE Portland.  There were six to seven of them covering about a 10 - 15 degree area across the sky in roughly the same plane/area across the sky just above and to the right of the moon, but they were not moving in formation nor were they evenly spaced.  The three on the left side were in a triangular/Cassiopeia-like space and formation, and the others to the right were in more horizontal formation, but not exactly a straight line.  They all moved as if they were flying, but slow, not like a plane.  It was regular/straight-ish movement, as human/craft (plane, car, ship, people) would move.  It didn't in any way seem alien or weird.  They simply looked like six human craft.  They remained in roughly the same area in the sky, although they were moving a little bit in relation to each other, like if you're watching 7 people or animals in a group walking or hanging out.  When I first had looked up, I saw three bright ones and then the few fainter ones to the right became brighter.  A seventh moved in from faint to bright into the same realm and then back faint again.  They were visible in the sky for about 10 or 20 or more minutes, and then gradually they all became fainter and fainter and disappeared into the sky as they came, like craft flying out to space from the earth atmosphere.

This object did not display ANY sort of a tell-tale sign of any know aircraft to our American skies (i.e. no blinking lights, no red or green lights, nothing). The object was not moving very quickly, but at a steady pace across the night sky  I quickly ran inside to get my wife to witness this event. She in turn came out to the yard and also observed the light as I have described. The object took about a minute to cross the sky above us, so it was not even moving as fast as the planes that do cross our skies daily. As we both watched, hoping that this object would display SOMETHING to let us know that it was man made, we observed the object become a bit brighter in the sky, and then with the blink of an eye, it was gone.  We both turned and looked at each other in disbelief, and both of us said almost simultaneously, “It made no sound.” As we were watching the object go across the sky, I even made a small comment out loud: “I don’t hear any engines. If it’s a plane, we should be able to hear the sound of the engines.” There was NO SOUND.  My wife was a bit shocked and perplexed, as she has not had any “encounters” that she has ever told me of. For me, this was one of many “sightings” that I have witnessed above the Houston skies. Nothing that truly warranted a report…until now.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

As I looked, it seemed to have different colors as it blinked. I also noticed that it didn't look hazy as if it were blinking from clouds passing by. My brother and my girlfriend came out, saw the same thing, but we all thought it could possibly be an airplane. After about 5 min or so, the light was still in the same place in the sky, not seeming to get closer or further away. It looked extremely far away (remember, I compared it to a star at first, so I'd say it was some miles away). We got some very cheap binoculars and looked at it again. At that point, all 4 of us that were there all saw the same thing. The light was moving around very fast, not seeming to be traveling anywhere, but just dancing around all different patterns in the same vicinity. The light was also not just red and green, but all different colors, constantly changing. I noticed that while I was watching, 2 planes flew by, about 3 min apart from each other, but they didn't go anywhere near the object or even in its direction.

I am a construction worker, and I was working in Tacoma Washington at the Simpson Pulp Mill at the mouth of the Puyallup River on the edge of Commencement Bay. I was working what is called a shutdown on the mill, this is when the Boiler is taken off line and is repaired, my boss was setting me up on a job to replace the hanger rods on the primary exhaust which feeds directly into the smokestack which is at a height of fifty to sixty feet. Scaffolding had been erected around the duct as to give us access to work. The sky at that time was partially cloudy with a 30% to 40% cloud cover. My lead man and I were climbing one of the ladders on the scaffolding when I noticed a round brilliant white object at a high altitude moving across the sky it looked somewhat like a weather balloon and I pointed it out to my lead when he reached the top of the ladder. My lead man asked me what I though it was, and I told him I wasn’t sure but it looked similar to a weather balloon, and it was moving slowly from west to the east, and we watched it for thirty seconds or so, my lead man then said common I want to show you something else which pertained to the job. We stepped out of direct sight, but I kept looking back into the sky at the object. The object continued to slowly move to the east at almost a 12 o’clock position in the sky. I then noticed a second object which looked identical to the other it was positioned directly in the path of the first at the same high altitude, but it was stationary both objects appeared to be about a quarter the diameter of the sun or slightly less. The first object then stopped and held position close to the second both not moving, I then summoned my lead man and said check this out, there are two of them now. My lead man then asked what do you think they are, and said “I am not sure what they are! but they are UFO’s.” My lead man then stated that I must be smoking something if I think they’re UFO’s, to which I replied “it must be the same thing your smoking because you’re seeing them too,” but neither one of was smoking anything, and they were real. The boss said common I’ve got to show you something else and we moved out of visual contact and when I came back they were gone. The whole encounter didn’t last five minutes, but I remember looking at my watch several times to confirm the time, it read 12:35 pm. One other thing that was kind of strange is that I kept thinking, to myself that they must be surveying our industrial progress, and I am not sure why I was thinking that, but they were directly over the heavy industrialized area of Commencement Bay.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

My brother, who was a passenger in the car, was telling me a story as we turned off into my housing development. I reached a smooth bend in the road and happened to look up and saw lights behind the trees. Knowing that there is an airport nearby, I thought to myself ‘that plane is flying really low’. Continuing through the turn I kept my eyes on the lights slightly hidden behind the trees for about 6 seconds. Reaching the end of the turn I could see the lights a little bit clearer as there were fewer trees and noticed that the object appeared to be hovering but was clearly some kind of organized pattern of lights. I focused on them for about another 4-6 seconds trying to determine what it was because sometimes planes appear to be still even thought they are moving. I thought this was strange because it was really low and somewhat resembled a large TV antenna with lights on it. However, I take this route every day and have never noticed this before. We finally reached the point where there are no trees and the object was in clear sight. Knowing that I have never seen anything like this before I abruptly shouted to my brother, ‘what the heck is that’? He looked up and was apparently as confused as I was. I got about 4-5 seconds of clear visual while my brother states he only got a glimpse but he too got a clear enough sight to confirm what I was seeing. We were both intrigued by how low and stagnant the object appeared to be. About 20 yards down the road was a side street with a cul-de-sac where I quickly went to get a better view. This only took 10 seconds or so to get turned around to get a better a look. However, by the time we pulled down the street the object was completely gone. We could not believe this. Judging by where the object was there is no way it could have completely disappeared. Even if it was a plane we should have had clear visual of it at the cul-de-sac. The object itself was clearly a cross shape. I saw a long series of lights, maybe 5-6, down the middle with two at the tips of the cross ends. They looked to be blue and white with a clearly larger blue light at the intersection. My brother only stated how strange it was that there were so many lights. As for me, the entire sighting was only for about 15 seconds with an unfortunate 4-5 seconds of clear visual. I am still trying to think of what it could be like a toy plane, an antenna, a plane, fireworks.  None of these seem to make sense.  I did have my window down and did not hear any noises like a gas powered engine or boom. Anyhow, it is really exciting because I have no clue what we saw. I myself am an architect. I have two professional degrees, a master’s degree and work at an architecture firm. I have always had a fascination with the paranormal and U.F.O.s and, honestly, have always wanted to see one. Much of my education focused around forensic architecture and engineering so I find the whole debunking side of paranormal investigations interesting. My brother is a teacher at a Catholic school.  He has three degrees and master’s in philosophy.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,41.0232,-81.628

We tried to follow it and get closer but it kept moving. It was covering a lot of ground in a short time. We last saw it heading towards Great Lakes Naval Base and it looked like it had gained altitude to avoid planes in the area.

I was driving from Clitheroe to Altham to return a van i borrowed from work. I looked South towards Blackburn and noticed a low flying aircraft flying directly towards me, it looked quite bit (737 size) and had flashing lights quite similar to a standard passenger plane. As i planes quite often i just ignored it and assumed it was making a landing approach, it was only when it turned that i noticed the light pattern underneath, again it was similar to an plane but there were subtle differences, the rear 4 lights made up a large diamond shape and there was another light at the front but the gap between these was very large, again this does not sound that much different to a plane until you compared it to other planes in the sky, as they make a diamond shape of lights, one at the front, one at the rear on and one on each wing tip, but this did not explain the extra light at the front and the distance between the lights. So now i decided to keep a close eye on this mysterious plane. It circled the entire ribble valley about 5 time between 1000 and 2000 feet, far too low to be a commercial plane and why would it keep circling over populated area in an area that is not on route to any local airports. I tried as hard as i could to get into a position where i could see the actual body of the aircraft not just the lights, but this proved to be quite difficult. My suspicions were however confirmed when the strange aircraft was intercepted by a Royal air force Tornado jet. The jet assumed a position above and behind the craft and continued to follow it were ever it went, this carried on for about 3 minutes then they both went out of view.  I kept looking for about 10 minutes but so no sign of either of them.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

These white lights really caught my attention, the weather clear with and with good visibility. They appeared to be very close, maybe at about an altitude of 10,000 feet. They did not move for about 2 or 3 minutes then one of the white lights started moving, breaking the formation and making a straight line formation. Then suddenly I saw several other smaller lights (star-like) appearing in the sky and moving towards these 3 big white bright lights, some were steady and others were traveling at fast speed. I was able to count at least 25 of them, but I saw more appearing from the north east, it looked like it was an invasion. I’m a private pilot and I’m 100% sure that it was not an plane nor an air show. I have never seen anything like that before because of the way they were moving,  and clearly it couldn’t have been a plane because there were no red or green blinking lights. Whatever it was it seemed as if they were observing us. After a while about 10 to 15 minutes later they all starting moving and dispersing from the sky; my friend was trying to take pictures with her camera phone but the resolution was very poor. I later went back to our office and I tried to contact the FAA to report it, but I was not able to get in touch with them, I called the 24 Hour Safety Hotline at 800-255-1111 and all I got was a recording but I never left a message about this incident.

The trees block your view of the bridge and water every now and then, but when the tree line opened up I took full advantage of my chance to get a nice view of the bridge and the bay while still riding.   At that moment I looked to my left to view the bridge and the surrounding hills across the bay, I then saw an object that is hard to explain.

It was a blimp shape with a slight edge on each side forming kind of a saucer, but it was more blimp like in shape, definitely shiny metal.

Overview:  This sighting took place on the evening of Thursday, February 1st, 2007, at approximately 6:45pm.  I was driving in the northbound lane of I95 between Brunswick and Bodoinham Maine.  It was the late part of dusk, about 75% dark.  The object that I saw was on the opposite side of the highway, hovering perfectly still about 10-20ft above the tree line, which would make it about 50-60 feet in the air. The object itself was an equilateral triangle approximately 15-20ft on the side.  At each point, on the underside, was an almost painfully bright bluewhite light.  The sky was in the period of late dusk, but not entirely dark.  Thus, it was possible to see the edges of the craft more or less clearly in contrast to the sky.  The object was perfectly still, and made no sounds that I could hear, even after rolling down the window.  Timeline: The part of the highway in which the sighting took place consists of a long gentle curve to the right, with the southbound side of the highway on slightly higher ground than the north.  As I began the curve, the object came into view.  It was very bright in the near-dark lighting conditions, and my first thought was that I was looking at some strangely lit new radio or cell phone tower, and even remember thinking, ""Gee, that’s awful bright to put right over the highway like that at night, its as bright as a car’s headlights on high beams."" As I got closer to the object, I realized swiftly that as far as I could see, there was no tower supporting it.  It was at that time that I realized I wasn’t looking at a normal object, so I slowed down considerably, and really did my best to take in as many details as I could before I drove out of sight. The object was triangular, and black as far as I could tell.  The corners and edges were very sharp and distinct.  I did my best to take in as many details as possible.  I rolled down the window to try to hear anything, did some mental evaluations of the height above the trees, which wasn’t very great, and I tried to look at the underside, which I got a great view of from my angle as I drove by/under it. Something about what I was seeing made me uneasy.  I felt like I was missing a crucial detail, even as I did my best to get all that I could.  It wasn’t until I sat down to start composing this account that I realized what it may have been, and it is simply this:  The bright, highbeam intensity lights on the bottom of the object did not light up the trees, the highway, or the underside of the object, which they clearly should have.  Looking back, something I felt that was odd was how completely black the underside of the object was.  When I say black, I mean black like it was almost absorbing light.  It is an eerie realization to make after the fact, because at the time, all I thought was how weirdly perfectly black it was.   It’s the thing that now, in retrospect, makes me even more convinced that what I saw was out of the realm of the ususal. Something else that I thought was odd was that, despite the fact that there must have been 6-10 cars on the highway going in either direction, no one even slowed down or seemed to take notice of the object.  Admittedly, as interested as I was, I didn’t stop either.  But it was something interesting to note. The final piece of possibly related information is that less than 5 minutes later, I saw a helicopter moving very slowly over the highway perpendicularly to road.  It moved from my side, over to the southbound side.  In more urban areas, the sight of helicopters is fairly common, but up in rural Maine it certainly is not, especially moving slow and low over the highway.  Now, there is a small airforce base in the Brunswick area, which might explain why it was there, but in the many years of traveling this route at least once a week if not much more frequently, never have I ever seen one. After traveling out of sight, I tried going over every reasonable explanation of what I saw in my head.  In the end, there were only two mundane explanations that are at all possible for what I saw.  The first is that it was a helicopter, since helicopters are the only conventional aircraft that can hover at that height.  However, the was no wind-displaced debris, as there would have been, and as close as I got with my window down, I would have heard it as well, which I didn’t.  These details aside, the fact that I clearly saw a helicopter 5 minutes later at a very low altitude and a very slow speed means that it wasn’t a helicopter.  The second possible mundane explanation was that it was in fact a new radio/cell phone tower.  Keeping this in mind, I specifically drove slowly along that stretch of road on my return trip looking for a tower, or for anything for that matter, that could possibly have given off that light.  Needless to say, had I found something, I wouldn’t be filing this report with good people. Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and please feel free to contact me for any clarification or further questions you may have.",2007-02-24T00:00:00,44.0387,-69.8684

I was walking due east under a slightly overcast sky and I could only see only the brightest stars through the very thin layer of clouds.

Small commercial airliners sometimes make a landing approach depending upon the strength and direction of the wind and can be seen overhead. However, as I looked up I realized I wasn't looking at the bottom of an airliner.

It moved quickly in a perfectly straight line without any wobble or side-side movement at about 100-200 mph (this was also hard to estimate).

Between the shapes was a light that flashed every fifteen seconds.  What intrigued me most was the fact that the shapes did not change in distance between each other as they moved.  I was too far away to view any details, if there were any.  My initial thought was that they were cloud formations, but after seeing them move for twenty minutes I did not see any change to them, and they remained equidistant from each other.  Then I thought that they could have been a pair of airplanes pulling advertisement banners. I have seen these planes over the last few months, but they stayed fairly close to the Schaumburg region. These shapes were quite a distance away from Schaumburg.  They were not jets, blimps or other aircraft that I’ve seen before.  Anybody else see these things?

Going generally from east to west they moved in bursts of high speed. There were erratic directional changes in their path. While covering this path the two objects also moved in relation to eachother. They repeated a path of semi circles. The lights started out larger  and brighter at the start of their path, by the end they were too far in the distance to see. It was still high above the horizon as it faded away. By the end of it's path it was not covering as much area, pretty much still as it dissapeared. It's flight was similar to that of an airplane covering the whole sky. But it flew in bursts of much higher speeds and erratic angles. What my girlfriend saw was more vivid. I had her explain in detail to me what she saw but she would not be interested in admitting  her account to anyone else. Over my shoulder she saw a sillouhette directly above her.

Less than a minute later, three jets which looked to me like military fighter jets, came up from about where the light had been and branched in three directions. One went straight, one went to the right and the other to left. I never saw the planes again. 4 other players along with myself witnessed all of the above. I'm not sure if any spectators noticed what was going on. I'm not sure if it was a UFO or just an honest trick of the eye. None the less, it was strange.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,31.7923281835206,-106.3748488764045

Conditions – very clear cool night.  Moonrise had not occurred yet.  Upon leaving our house (facing east towards Highway 176) to get in the car, I noticed red lights of fast moving aircraft moving roughly north.  Living within a few miles of airport – this was not unusual, but they were moving very fast and were fairly low (I would say 500-1000 ft.) above a residential area.  They made a fairly tight arcing turn left and back around over Crowfield Lake/swamp to a SSE trajectory and happened to come right over our street.  The fighters made a distinctive sound and I would guess they were F-16’s from Shaw AFB in Sumter.  Charleston AFB does not have fighters as permanent party residents.  The 4 fighters were all less than 2 plane widths apart – definitely not a typical formation over a densely populated area at night.  Now really interesting part.  Thinking that that was an unusual flight pattern for a Saturday night my wife and I got in the car and started driving to North Charleston.  Just as we were leaving our neighborhood we saw 3 unusual white lights about the height of a cell tower (200 ft or so) over the Goose Creek Reservoir Swamp (between Wannamaker Park and Goose Creek).  We saw the lights for about ten seconds, and then they were gone.  We drove back around the same way later, and were not able to see the same thing again, so it was not some errant streetlight.  So either it was a plane that crashed into the swamp or something else.  There were no blinking white or red lights, no anti-collision lights, just three very bright white lights (almost life bright streetlights) 200 feet over a place where there are no streets.  It is now 2152 as of this writing and a family member also claims to have seen a strangely flying white light from the Isle of Palms connector looking toward the big dipper.  Apparently this light was moving erratically (fast then slow then fast then slow again) for about 45 seconds.  Apparently then they disappeared - I will try to pick more details out later.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,32.9878,-80.0057

I pointed it out to my wife and made a joking comment about it being a UFO as she is a serious skeptic on the subject. My brother and I started discussing how the object was at a high altitude for it being a plastic bag and discussed the physics behind the strength of the wind needed for it to stay aloft. As we  we discussing this, the object made a lazy L-shaped U-turn toward the house behind us. It was at this point that both my brother and my wife noticed that the object had a ""guitar-pick"" shape and was not a plastic bag. I also noticed that the object was rocking back and forth on its axis in a slow wobble. We stood motionless watching the object as it continued toward the street in front of the house behind ours. I would approximate its altitude at being between 50-100 feet from the ground. Its length was 3-5 feet and had almost no width that I could see, making it extremely flat. The objects color was very white with no lights or moving parts seen. It made no sound that we could hear. When it reached the next street behind our house it started to gain altitude steadily. We could not begin to guess the speed at which it rose but it must have been extremely fast because it reached a very high altitude in around 30 seconds. At some point before we lost sight of it in the sky, I noticed that there was a tiny white round object that had seemingly materialized from the sky and flew very close to the ""guitar-pick"". I mentioned this to my brother who then stated that I must have been staring too long at the sky and was seeing a reflection of the light. I stood close to him and pointed the object out. He grew excited as he saw another white orb streak by the ""guitar-pick"". My wife suddenly pointed out yet another one moving in the opposite direction the other 2 had taken. These white orbs were moving at speeds that were impossibly fast and seemed to orbit the ""guitar-pick"" in motion. The ""guitar-pick"" at this time was almost out of visual range but looked as if it was still gaining in altitude. There were no other aircraft in the sky that day. There are sometimes military aircraft in the vicinity but as it was a Sunday very few if any were flying. I served in a ADA (Air Defense Artillery)Army unit for 3 years and can readily identify many types of aircraft by sight and sound.

I have very good depth perception and can judge altitudes pretty accurately.  This particular incident is the second unexplained sighting I have had in 40 plus years.  My 2 children, 12 and 8 years old, and I were sitting on a grassy knoll in a local park watching radio controlled gliders.  I heard an approaching airplane and layed on my back to looked up at the sky to watch the plane begin its' landing approach to the local airport.   As it passed overhead I noticed a small round, very bright, solid white object at a very high altitude, directly above me.  It was slowly moving westward when it stopped.  When this happened, I asked my 12 year old if she could see the object.  She said she did and asked what it was.   I then asked my 8 year old if he could see it.  After 5 seconds or so, he also saw it.  Just as my 8 year old spotted the object, it slowly started to move in a north direction for maybe 10 seconds, then stopped.  Within a few more seconds, it changed direction and moved south east to a spot directly over us again.  The white round object had completed a triangle pattern.  After about 3 or 4 minutes, we saw the object seem to tilt down towards the east and it now appeared to have a faint outline of chrome or silver to it.  It stayed like this for only 3 or 4 seconds, then appeared to rotate back up to its' original horizontal (?) position.  This day was fairly windy - 10-15 mph surface winds with a much faster high altitude wind due to a cold front system moving in.  The white object never gained altitude or drifted in any direction other than the original 3 directions mentioned. My estimate was that it was at or above 40k feet as there were 2 high altitude jets passing through the area that created vapor trails and the white object appeared at this altitude or higher.  My children and I watched this object for over five minutes - I had checked my watch.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

They sometimes seem above the noticeable water level, at least approximately several hundred feet, In Lake Ontario due North from approximately Hamlin State Park, NY. They appear through 2 sets of different binoculars to be of a spinning and glowing-pulsating nature. I am not a hoaxer and never would be considered abnormal or bizarre. I feel it is my/ our duty to report these now being at least the 7th time since last fall at odd times of night, they also have darted upward out of sight and 1 time seemingly into the water downward. We did witness 1 other time 1 then 2 and 3 all appear and form a triangle all the same kind of amber objects for only about 3-5 minutes and then all of a sudden they were interrupted by a bright very fast blue orb that shot down from the high stratosphere from dues S. West--like a shooting star at the 3 objects and then they all took off very fast in 3 opposite directions. Something is going on that is NOT of the ordinary and if it is something from the military –AKA – US AIR force based out of Niagara Falls, NY they surely would not admit to that.  But at the speeds and they way they seem fixed for minutes is not that likely.

On March 24th or 25th My wife and I were out for a walk about 8:45 PM in Las Cruces, NM.  It was a clear night with bright stars and no clouds.  I saw two lights moving from the west towards the east in the sky moving at what appeared to be a constant speed and in a straight line, about as fast as a small airplane would be going.  The two lights had just flown almost directly over the Las Cruces Airport.  The two lights were bright white color and were not flashing or blinking.  One was in front and was a little larger and brighter than the one following it.  Their alignment was straight with the path and the distance between the lights remained constant.  They remained the same brightness until right before they disappeared which I will describe later. I could not hear anything but I didn't think that was unusual.  I pointed the lights out to my wife and remarked how it might be an airplane except the lights weren't blinking and there were no red lights.  I said it seemed strange for a plane to not have flashing or blinking lights.  It crossed my mind that it could be a UFO but I still thought it was probably a plane.  She said it was a plane. We watched it and within a few seconds noticed an airplane flying west by northwest.  The second plane had flashing red lights and non flashing white lights and didn't seem unusual in any way.  The plane and the lights we saw first were heading in a way that they looked like their paths would intersect.  They looked as if they were on a collision course.  So we watched, not really excpecting them to collide, but just watching. When the plane and the lights intersected, it was hard to tell if the lights passed under or over the plane.  Their intersection appeared to happen almost directly overhead.  So far there was nothing really strange except for there being no flashing lights accompanying the two white lights.  The strange thing that happened was: immediately after the plane and lights intersected, the two white lights faded away to nothing.  the fading away was fairly fast but not instantaneous.  It seemed to take about a second for the fading to be complete.  Then the two white lights never reappeared.  There were no clouds and the airplane had just passed through the same part of the sky immedialty before yet it did not fade out of sight or even get dimmer momentarily.  The airplane was still visible and continued on it’s way. We both thought what we had just seen was very strange.  I suggested it might have been an alien spaceship but my wife dismissed that idea.  I really can’t think of a good explanation for the lights fading away like that and a few people who I described it to also thought it was weird. Neither my wife or I had been drinking or smoking anything.  I have not drank ( or smoked anything ) in over 23 years.  I am a computer scientist working for the Army at White Sands Missile Range and my wife is a Chinese immigrant.  It might be possible to check with the Las Cruces airport to see if  1 plane or 2 planes where flying over the area just to the east of the airport at around 8:45 PM on those nights.  I will try to remember exactly which night it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2008-03-31T00:00:00,32.32767214076246,-106.75489560117302

I was staying in a house in Rincon,PR along Rt. 115. At about 5:10am I unlocked the gate and crossed the road for a 2 block walk to the bakery only to find it closed till 6:00am. I then returned to the front gate. I happened to look up at this moment and noticed two bright objects  about the size of an aspirin held at arms length moving very fast following one another. The time was 5:20am, I know this because I tried to photograph it with my cell phone. I was facing west looking toward the ocean which was 4 blocks away. They were traveling in an SE direction toward the areas known as Lajas and Cabo Rojo P.R. I watched as they disappeared into some clouds.There was no sound and the sighting lasted about 30-40 seconds. They were flying over water as I viewed them at a 60 degree angle from where I was standing. I was exited because I knew exactly what they were. I live in an area of NY surrounded by  2 airports so I’m very familiar with aircraft lights. Later that morning after 7am as I was getting ready to leave for the airport I was telling my cousin about the sighting. The TV was tuned to a local station (WAPA), someone had managed to videotape the  objects and it was being shown 2 hours later on TV. The interesting part it was filmed on the east coast at 5:22am, that’s over 100 miles away.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,,

The object was headed southward and contained no directional lights such as port or starboard signals. The object eventually fell away from eyesight. It appeared to be lower in the sky than usual aircraft. I saw another conventional commercial airliner off in the distance to use as a gauge for speed and elevation. After the disappearance of the bright orange-yellow light, we spotted a very bright “star” eastward of the night’s almost full moon. This bright star brought our attention to a pair of very twinkling lights that at first seemed to be very excited stars. We were able to spot these through a scope to see that these objects were flashing three bright colors; Red, yellow, and blue flashed in what seemed random order. To get a closer look, we headed up a nearby butte. When arriving at the top of the butte, we quickly noticed there were at least five of these combination lights. They appeared to be situated at all different heights in the sky and at different ranges. Focusing on the largest/closest object, we could see indeed that these lights had three main colors that revolved very brightly. The position of the lights did not appear to create a definitive form, but a V-like shape could almost be made out by tracing the lights together. We watched the lights for approximately 90 minutes, from 11:30pm to 1:00am.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,44.073170796460175,-122.93638849557522

I was in my back garden and noticed something unusual traveling form the NNE direction.  It was a dull red glow at first, the type of glow that iron at about 400/450 centigrade gives off when heated.  As it came more overhead I could make its shape to be like a cylinder tapered at both ends, or a stretched ellipse. The glow was amorphous: it did not have sharply delineated edges, neither was it one uniform solid red colour, but it was obviously an object and not just a shapeless glow. It was traveling in a dead straight line almost directly overhead and was silent.  I watched it pass over. I expected to see navigation lights and headlights like on a plane or cabin lights along the side like a passenger plane but there were none at all; just a dull red glow all over, slightly fainter at each end.  I could not make out any shape or shadow where wings were expected to be either.  As it traveled away from me I looked for engine glow but there was none and still completely silent. It seemed to be traveling at about the same speed as a passenger plane pretty soon after take off when it is no more that a five thousand feet up.  Size is even more difficult to estimate. It was shorter and wider than a passenger plane fuselage, but not knowing how high up this thing was make it impossible to know its real size or speed. I have seen countless passenger planes lots of helicopters any many military type planes too but nothing like this.  I used to be into astronomy too and know what a satellite, meteor, meteorite, or fireball look like.  It was a completely cloudless night and the full moon was up but obscured from view on the other side of my house.

I was on Parker Rd. on my way to Hwy 75 North from the direction of Custer Rd.  The bright light looked like it was hovering in mid air and not moving.  At first I thought it was a light on top of a building, but I had never seen it before, so I kept looking while I was driving.  Finally I pulled over into a bank parking lot on Parker Rd. near the street that leads to Hwy 75 North, to get a better look.  Very soon after I parked, the light went out and what looked like a low flying airplane flew over me in the sky.  I could hear the aircraft pass as it passed over me.  So, I thought nothing of it, because I was then pretty sure it was just an airplane, but after I got on 75 North heading towards Allen, TX, I saw the light again, now in a different place. Again, the light was stationary, not moving even a little bit from what I could see.  I called my fiance to see if he could see what I was seeing, but he was at work and could not see anything from his perspective.  He was in Richardson, about 20 minutes away from where I was when I called him. As I was speaking with my fiance on the phone, the light seemed to go out in a small sweeping motion from left to right, and then I could see flashing lights moving slowly.  By this time I had reached my exit, Exchange Pkwy, and I was only able to see the lights for a short while longer before I had to make the turn onto Exchange Pkwy heading west.  Once I started heading west, my back was to the lights and I couldn't track them anymore. While I was able to observe the lights, they looked closer together than a normal aircraft's lights would be, and the lights appeared to move in the same sweeping motion from left to right.  The motion of the lights made the flying object seem to be a circular shape rather than the shape of an airplane like I had seen when I parked in the bank parking lot on Parker Rd. Also, the lights, which I assume were attached to some sort of aircraft, were moving slowly across the sky and looked as thought they were making oddly angled turns, speeding up, although not very much, and slowing down as they went along.  There were three lights, all different colors.  I believe the colors were blue, red, and green, but they were hard to distinguish, because I was trying to watch the road and the thing in the sky at the same time.  I am not sure how long the event lasted, as I do not know when the light first appeared, nor was not able to stop my car to observe the whole thing. I do not drink, so consequently, I have not consumed any alcoholic beverages tonight, nor do I use/abuse drugs of any kind, legal or prescription.  The only medication I take daily is Wellbutrin XL for depression.  I do not have a history of any other psychiatric disorders, nor do I have a history of seeing odd things in the sky or anywhere else for that matter.  This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

He quickly told me it was probably just a plane. It started rising higher and higher but not coming any closer so we started walking down our couldesac to go check it out. We walked closer and it seemed as if two human objects were glowing in the sky. The objects weren't lights, as they were just a very bright glow. As I am a christian and never believed in U.F.O.'s I thought the second coming of christ was happening and told my brother.  We were drawn to the glowing objectst by curiousity. It hovered high for about ten minutes and the two glowing balls seemed to turn back into one glowing ball. It almost is as if it knew we were there. We ran back home scared and it's almost as if it followed us. We looked over head and it's almost as if it slowed down, not like any plane can do but rather fast. Then we both saw it overhead and it looked like some type of plane but with a triangular shaped ""torso"". It took off very fast and had basically no noise whatsoever. I heard what sounded like little girls singing, but I'm not sure if this was the sound of the plane or not.  I did some research and found out about the Aurora project and looked at videos on Youtube and Google articles, it looks similiar to those projects but still not entirely sure, it seemed to all happen so fast. I now am a firm believer that I U.F.O.'s exist, regardless if it was exrtra terrestials or a government project. My brother called the non emergency policy number and told the lady he was a college student that wasn't prank calling or doing drugs. They said they would have somebody check it out.

Before collapse, one stopped, the other made a half circle around. Around midnight, while vacationing at the farm in Kurilovo, Vladimirsky Region of Russia, I went for a night walk.  Once I stopped and looked at the black sky, full of stars.  I looked for a minute, admiring the myriads of stars from horizon to horizon. One light, the size of the average star, appeared to be moving fast enough to catch my attention. I starred at it, thinking first that this is some airplane or a comet. But very soon I noticed, not far from it, the light from another object, which was moving with the same constant speed, straight forward to the first object. They both moved toward each other, being on the same parallel line. I figured out, that very soon they might hit each other! So I prepared to watch what will happen when they meet front to front, certainly understanding, that the distance between them might be thousands of miles at that moment. But in two seconds before the possible collapse, or simply crossing each other’s path, the first object, which was moving from East to West, suddenly stopped completely. But the second object, without making any stops or slowing down, completely changed it course to the South, and made a perfect half circle around the first object. As soon as the second object returned to the same parallel, but now being behind the first object, this first one immediately moved forward as fast, as it was moving before it, and they both continued to move in the same directions, as they have moved in the beginning. In a half minute or so, they both moved away from each other and I lost them. After what I have seen, I decided that UFOs are existed. The flying machines made by us, humans, as I know, can not make a sudden stop in the space, or change direction of flying almost at 90 degrees. Those guys were showing us what they can do, so we should believe in their existence. I made a graphic design of what I have seen, and published it on internet, to show their movements exactly.

I first thought was it was a firework, because of the bright red color, and the way it was decending. But after it had dimmed, it stopped it's decent, and headed north looking like a red star. I really do not know if the government has flyable flares, and if they are red, but that seems to be the logical answer. It did light up the sky, and there was no smoke trails like you see with flares. Also I could not see a parachute, like you can with flares if you are close enough. This thing did not seem close, and appeared to be at least 10 miles away, although I really can not judge do to being at night. It was bright, and it did fly away north, and I have never seen anything like it... Except Sunday or Monday night at about the same time but over El Mirage dry lake bed area. That night I was taking out the trash and noticed what appeared to be a red firework going up stopping at the top of the apex and then slowly decending and fading as it decended to a red star and continuing on east.

She was with two of her daughters on a long stretch of road off a main highway in a wooded area near forest trees.  I believe she said it was in the Molalla, Oregon area.  While driving, a UFO/Disk chased their car down and literally skidded on top of the roof of the car.  My Aunt told me she was driving erratic as she was scared at that point just to stay on the road as it was so bright and her daughters went hysterical and began screaming and yelling.  The object then disappeared.   She continued on till she saw a House with a light on.  She pulled off and got out of the vehicle.  There was some type of powder or substance on the vehicle all over the top.  I think she said it was Whitish/Yellow.   They rang the doorbell and the man came out of the house.  She explained that she got ran off a road by a UFO/Disk and that the car had evidence of the stuff it put on the roof of the car.  The man then said he BELIEVED HER because the samething on the same road had happened to him in the same area.  She also told me that when my Uncle and her owned their Boysenberry Farm not too long ago in Bandon-By-The-Sea Oregon some odd things happened at their home.  Uncle Lonnie died of heart failure.  She would be in the Living Room watching TV and they had a Solar Window over the Roof of the house.  Each night the Helicopters would fly over her house and she would look up and could see them.  It got to the point that she would wave to them as the lights were so bright that they would then Rev up the the motor to let her know they were leaving.  I don't know if they were just guys out watching the ships, boats out in bandon.  Who knows.   All I know is shortly after that she started to hear something out in her yard and the dog refused to go outside.  She use to keep the bedroom window open and fall asleep as it was hot sometimes in summer.  She said as she slept she could feel something around her ears and it was like a RADIO and broken up Language.  She could feel something touch her ears.  This happened several times and then she would see the helicopters again out there at night and sometimes strange BRIGHT LIGHTS like UFOS out there.  She decided she better keep the windows closed as she noticed several strange marks on her body that she never had before she could not account for.  She got so scared she told her sons and they went up the road one night as there was strange lights in the sky near her neighbors across the road at his Berry Farm.  The kids were worried at that point that maybe a burgular was scaring the local farmers homes at night.  The older man across the road said he had been seeing strange lights off and on as well.  She decided shortly after my Uncle died to sell the farm and move to another part of Oregon.  There was talk in the town that there was a school teacher one day found on the local beach with perfect incision marks on a cut off hand and to this day no body really knew how someone could have a PERFECT cut off incision like her hands looked when they found her.  Some local kid got blamed for it.  But to this day locals said something did not make sence the way she was found out there. ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

My mother-in-law, a very successful and down to earth woman was on vacation with her mother in New York in early 2006, and as part of their trip they were taking the tour to the Statue of Liberty. Before boarding the boat to cross the harbor, they were standing on the shoreline, taking in the sights. My mother-in-law is an amateur photographer with a very nice camera (I’m not sure what kind off-hand unfortunately, only that it is a very expensive camera, and has been used many times for family functions and such, so I know that the quality of photos it takes is extremely high, and the camera is in perfect working order). While she was taking photos of the harbor and the island across the way, she captured a metallic object hovering just above the water. Her goal was to take a photo of the statue from the shoreline and then take another photo of where they stood on the shore from the island once they crossed (she was playing with the idea of mirroring her position for fun). Once on the island, she took another set of photos, facing the spot they had stood before. In both photos the object can be seen clearly. It was a bright, almost entirely clear day, sometime in the early afternoon and the object was in nearly the same position as before. It appears to have hovered in place for at least the length of the crossing, and if you examine the photos you can tell that it is the same object. Oddly enough, this appears to be a chance UFO because she states that neither she nor anyone else saw anything the entire time (I don’t know exactly how long the ferry ride is, but I’m sure it’s at least twenty minutes or so including the time between photos) In fact, as she was showing us pictures, she started to skip past these as “silly” because she was having fun with the camera, and never noticed anything unusual about them until I bolted upright in my chair and asked her to let me have them. Once I pointed out the object, she said that she thought they were buoys (which she still thinks) My mother-in-law is not very receptive to things outside the norm (like I said, she’s very grounded), so I think she is dismissing these photos for that reason. However, I have enlarged these photos many times, as far as I could without pixelating them all-together, and the object is not in any way connected to the water, much less floating in it. It is clearly metallic, and vaguely oval in shape, and as I said, it either stayed in place unnoticed for the length of the ferry ride, or reappeared, which seems less likely to me (but that is speculative). There seems to be an off-yellow/reddish ""aura"" or sheen around the object as well when the photo is enlarged. There doesn’t appear to be a large disturbance in the water around it, and there are definitely not any disturbances or ripples like those that would show up if it were floating in the water, with the water splashing against it; further indicating that it is just above the surface. Also, if you look at the photos, you can get a sense of scale against the images in the background. I’m not an expert, so I don’t want to hazard a guess, but if you look at the object as one point in a vector, or triangulate, it seems to be fairly small, but certainly not as small as a balloon or anything like that, and again, it remained in place far too long to be debris. As I mentioned the camera is in perfect order, and by the photos you can tell that this is not an imperfection in the lens or anything. Anyhow, those are some of my own observations using limited resources.  I am sending scans of the original photos along for your inspection. The first photo is much clearer, and easier to distinguish details in, but the second provides an interesting view of the object against the city in the background, and if you look you can see the dock where they took the first picture off-center to the right for perspective. These are completely untouched, and uncropped. I would be very interested in knowing your opinion of these pictures. Speaking for myself, as someone who has studied the UFO question for over twenty years, I am convinced that this is some sort of UFO, but I’m curious about it because it is very small, and it’s odd for it to be there for so long in the first place, much less without being noticed on such a clear day. It does look somewhat like other objects I’ve seen captured on film, but those have usually seemed larger. Anyhow, if you have another explanation, please let me know.

Since the Goodyear blimp operates in the South Bay area of Southern California I started looking for it between the sparse cloud layer and the sun that was visible above and to the left of the clouds from my position. To my surprise, nothing was there.  Since the sun was fully visible and the clouds were thin I couldn't understand how the blimp was casting a shadow if it itself wasn't visible where it should be located.   As I watched the shadow, it headed slowly to the North changing shape as it moved over the edges of the scattered clouds as one would expect to see from a large moving object above them creating the shadow. The cloud layer wasn't too large so the shadow finally disappeared as it left the layer on the right after about 30 seconds.  I continued to watch for anything that could have created the shadow thinking it would appear out of the sun maybe or was obscured by the clouds.  Nothing was ever seen in the sky for the 15 or so minutes I continued to watch and no other clouds were in the sky that afternoon at any level that could have caused the shadow. No sound was ever heard and considering the size of the shadow and the estimated four to five thousand foot cloud layer, from past experiences if it had been the blimp I'm sure I would have heard it as it would have been upwind of my location and not all that far away. This ""sighting"" has haunted me for months now without an explanation and I am submitting it in the hopes that someone else around this time period may have witnessed it as well. I consider myself to be a credible witness being a private pilot with a passion towards anything that flies.  I've seen lots of ""strange"" things in the sky but can usually figure out what they are with some time and logic.  This one has me totally baffled however.

First, I would like to mention that I have seen multiple craft throughout the summer of 2007, from the end of May to this 9th of August.  Until my most recent sighting all were alone, all were yellow orbs, all made no sound and did not speed up or accelerate, but stayed on fixed paths at a steady pace. The only exceptions to this rule was a sighting in late June (date unknown) where a singular yellow circle/orb veered in an abrupt 90 degree turn and disappeared into a cloud bank. It never appeared on the other side.  I hadn't planned to report any of them because I thought they were possibly some strange form of aircraft or satellites. However, the circle that made the 90 degree turn was in the sky with an airplane, and the two could not have been more different. The airplane was much slower, had blinking lights (none of the other crafts had blinking lights), and had multiple light colors (all other crafts have been yellow).  Then my mother, my sister, and myself were on a walk July 25 between the hours of 9:30 PM (USA Central time) and 11:30 PM. We saw another orb in the sky, making no noise and moving at a fixed pace. However, the light was pulsing and yellow, and the craft itself was moving as though the air was thick, like a jellyfish through water. It was a triangular shape, though I thought it looked equilateral and my mother thought isosceles (we fought about it later).  This craft made its rather slow way across the sky, heading West, making no noise whatsoever. Then it changed shape and became circular and fuzzy-quite hard to see. It appeared to have moved higher in the sky and farther away in a span of time that almost impossible to understand. The tempo of its blinking light also quickened-it seemed to double.  The craft then began a lazy zigzag in the sky.  It did this for a short while and then vanished into the distance, still heading west. I should also mention that before it changed shape there was a flash in the sky, though my sister and my mother both thought that could have been a shooting star. (There were many in the sky that night, but I do know the difference between whatever that thing was and a star.)  These occurrences are made all the more unusual because I have never seen UFOs in the sky anywhere near my town, except for a childhood incident that remains fuzzy and was most likely a meteor (I do not remember that even well enough to report it).  Make of this what you will. Godspeed and good luck!",2007-08-14T00:00:00,43.267999999999994,-91.4777

There must have been 8 or 9 lights - bright white and some red - creating the oval formation.  I was in disbelief of what I saw and called my friends over to look.  Two of my friends came to my side and they too saw the formation of lights. Just after my friends arrived, the object changed its position and we could now only see three lights – still moving in coordination--until the object flew out of our sight.  A third friend had joined our side and saw the object with only the three light formation.  We were all astonished by what we had just seen, and we kept staring upward to see if the object would reappear.  The object did not pop back out; however, we do believe we saw the object hovering behind some trees that were on the right of the horizon, as we would sometimes catch a glimpse of the bright lights moving up and down. I had a camera in my hands at the time of our sighting; however, I only got a picture of the object when the three lights were visible.  When zooming in on the object, the picture reveals 3 half-moon shaped lights in very close proximity to one another, appearing the color orange (burnt orange). The next day when I was thinking about the sighing, I remembered one piece of information that I found to be relevant or interesting.  From where I was standing and looking, I could see airplanes in the distance (further back from where the object was flying) taking off or coming into my sight path from the bottom of the horizon.  (These airplanes may have taken off from the nearby Schaumburg Airport.)  As it was dusk, I could see the actual airplanes and not just their lights, however when I saw the flying object, at or around the same time, I could only see lights, and not any solid object.  My observation makes me wonder if this plays any role as to why local radars would not pick up these flying objects.",2007-08-14T00:00:00,42.0209,-88.1782

I then saw what appeared to be a small dimer star come out of the big bright star. I then figured this was an aircraft and checked for movement by standing so it appeared right next to a telephone pole a stationary object, to check for movement.  There was non.  The dimmer light took off to the north and went out of sight by this time. The very bright one just stayed there.  I then went in and got my night vision goggels what i believe to be russion helecopter pilot goggels no brand name if its important only markings are a c inside a triangle inside a circle and the letters OH 1x 20 if that information is needed. Looking at the starlight object was way too bright but could clearly see total cloud cover above it as the could cover was reflecting light very well. I then decided this was no aircraft or star and did what i always thought was a bad idea.  I took my dive light and pointed it at the object and began to flash it, seven flashes twice. The object which had been very bright and totaly still up till that time then shut off the light. An orange afterglow still was visable and it went skyward very fast through the cloud layer. this whole even took about 10 min. I waited and went in and out for about 15 min, and started looking over my house by the way to make sure it wasnt over me. After about 15 min the object again came back to the origanal location.  Wanting to get a better view i got my binoculars a pair of stiner comanders, they are old but work well.  what i saw was an object inside the light that appeared to look like the capital letter D. I watched it for about 15 more min as it changed color from bright orange to white.  It looked very much like a star but with the binoculars you could see an object insid! e the light quite well. I viewed the object till about 10:15pm and attempted to call my wife at her grandmothers house at the time, the phone didnt work at this time but gave me the option of leaving her a message. I since talked to her this morning and that message never made it to her.  I dont know if that is related or not.  I do know the object did take notice of me flashing it with my divelight and turned its lights down and took off. I also belive the object was small as it didnt seem very far away less than a mile, but cant be sure.  I do know it was much closer than an average helecoptor flying over the area and belive it was over the houseing track behind mine. As for the size and this is only a guess I would say the size of maybe a city trash can.  I will be looking at the sky much more now and if i see anything i will let you know.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,35.34399793103448,-119.04089261083743

By the time i jumped out of the hot tub and ran to the front of the house they were gone and i couldnt find them in the sky again.

On this evening the sky was very cloudy and the cloud cover was low. I was somewhat windy as well. I noticed in the eastern sky three lights that look as though they were in a triangular pattern. The colors of the lights were, red, green and yellow. What caught my eye was that as this shape moved through the cloud you could see the cloud being displaced and the cloud sort of shimmering over the haul of the object. The angle from my position to the objects was approximately 60 degree's. The object looked to approximately 250 to 300"" feet above the surface. I observed that the object was moving slow and banked up and right. There was no sound. It seemed to me that as this object entered the cloud it became somehow visible, I must say that I know this all sounds fantastic, but this is how it seemed. The object was very large for any air craft I have seen. I would say possibly 100 yards across and 45"" thick. That is a guess. It moved very gracefully, almost like a fish would move in the water. After it passed through the cloud it was no longer visible. My girlfriend unfortunately did not see it, but supports my sighting. When it was visible in the cloud you could see the cloud shimmering over the haul. I know this sounds crazy, but I swear I seen this. I would like to discuss this with someone who might know what this object was. I am not after publicity or notoriety. I have always been skeptical of these sort of sightings until now. I will say now this was the most awesome sight I have ever seen in my life. I hope to hear from you on this. Thank-you Sincerely,  ((name deleted))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,39.8373,-87.47110000000002

It hung there, those two rectangular lights just flashing. I said hi, so to speak. It began to move, fairly slow -- I think from the sky that was blocked and the way the lights were positioned, it was a curved triangular shape.

Around 2200 hours, about 3 hours after the begining of our shift; I stepped out on the steps of the back door (Which faces West.) to smoke a cigarette.  I saw what at 1st glance seemed to be the star that's discribed on this sight as a usual false sighting, but I realized that the star discribed was in a different part of the sky (I realized this because I like to watch it flash different colors sometimes when I'm looking at the sky.). I belive the star I sometimes watch is more to the Southwest, so it caught my attention.  Immediatly after thinking this, I observed the object to move extreamly rapid for the distance it appeared to be from our position (I am an air traffic controller, so I am aware of ""normal"", or fighter jet aircraft movment.).  I closed my eyes, and shook my head a little to focus on the object to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me, and it continued to move rapidly, change directions instantly, and stop in place.  I called my soldier over to confirm if it was acually moving, and he confirmed. As we watched;  another couple of minutes past, and over the tower radio frequency (Our facility monitors the control towers radios.)  I heard a broken transmission from what sounded like a pilot that said ""...yea, it's a triangle..."".  Tower came over the frequency, and told the transmitter to ""check freq."", which means your transmitting over our frequency, and your not supposed to.  If anyone who's reading this knows anything about aviation radio language, there is nothing anywhere about any triangle that would need to be transmitted to anyone.  I continued to watch the object, using a fixed object placed in my line of sight just below it to ensure myself my eyes weren't tricking me after starring at this thing for a while. It contiued moving irratically, and moving in the same area in the sky for about 30 minutes, and then seemingly dissapeared. It was to far away to make out a shape, but it appeared that depending on the direction of movement, it was emitting different colors (Perhaps different colors on different sides of the object, and depending on what side was facing me; it would show the other colors?)

My girlfriend and I were watching TV in our room at around 11:00 PM when we heard a very loud roaring that sounded much like a large rocket booster and seemed to be right above the house. We live very near the San Jose International Airport, so hearing roaring noises in the sky is not unusual. What WAS unusual, however, was the volume, behavior, and the proximity of the sound to our home. 	The normal flight path of aircraft into San Jose international airport puts them a few miles east of our home. However, whatever was causing the sound seemed to be directly above our house. Furthermore, it didn’t get louder (approaching our home) and then quieter (passing over and leaving our home). Rather, it was a very loud, very steady roaring noise that sounded as if it was directly over our home. 	We were lying in bed, and we both heard this roaring in the background as we were watching TV. The longer it went on without changing in pitch or volume (which would be an indication of movement towards or away from our home), the more that sort of “there’s something wrong here” alarm was going off in my head. Finally, after about three minutes of this steady roaring, we both looked at each other at the same time and vocalized our mutual curiosity as to the nature of that sound. She said, “what is that noise?”. I jokingly replied that it was probably a UFO, and she should pack her nice clothes because we might be about to take a ride. As soon as I had finished saying that, the sound stopped instantly. There was no winding down, there was no lowing of decibels, it was as if someone had just flicked a switch and turned it off. As if that wasn’t enough, it started up again after a few seconds in what seemed to be a different part of the sky, but still very close. The start of the sound was as instantaneous as the ending. It was just suddenly “on” again. Again, there was an extremely loud, very steady roaring for about a minute, and then it stopped suddenly. 	At this point my girlfriend was actually getting scared. She had lived in this area all her life and had NEVER heard anything like this before. When the roaring started a third time, I jumped through our window into the back yard (there was no screen) so I could get a better look at the night sky to try and get a visual on whatever was causing this noise. I was able to determine that the roaring seemed to be coming from the South, but was unable to see the source. I ran over to the patio door and knocked on it to get the attention of my roommate who was playing video games at the time, and told him to come out and listen. He did, and said to me, “it’s probably just an airplane.” Then it stopped suddenly, as it had done twice before and his attitude changed. Again, it had lasted about a minute and stopped for a few seconds only to start up again this time on the NORTH side of my home. Now he was clearly as curios as I was about the origin of this sound. The rumbling/roaring sound went on for about thirty seconds or so this time before it again stopped suddenly. It did not start up again.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

While we were stopped at the red light at the end of the off-ramp, we also noticed it was moving slowly to the left. Since planets do not move that quickly from a point of view on Earth, we also knew it wasn't a planet. When viewed with the naked eye, we even noticed wing-shaped protrusions. I though it looked like a phoenix.  When we finally arrived home, we could no longer see the object through the tall trees, so we had to walk down the road to view the craft with a pair of binoculars. We stood there for 20-30 minutes watching the craft. We noticed that it had a flashing red light on its underside, and had a faintly visible flashing red dot moving around it. We are not sure whether or not this was another craft, but if it is, we believe the larger craft is a mother ship. The large craft also had a starburst light pattern around it, which did not twinkle, indicating that this was definitely not a star. While we watched it, it stayed still for the majority of the time, but every now and then, it would noticeably move to the left, to the right, up a little, and further away...and at one point, closer to us. It also occasionally changed shape.  We walked back to the house at about 4:30, and noted that it was much higher up in the sky now; we could see it over the treetops while standing next to the house. It was also moving much more frequently, and slightly more quickly. At approximately 4:56, I ran into the house to wake my mother up to show her the craft.

A bright spot the same size, shape, and apparent magnitude of Mars moved through Perseus at around 0:32 EST, Bethesda, MD. I was looking at comet 17P Holmes, and checking out the planets, when my friend asked to borrow my binoculars to 'look at the ISS.' This object was moving at a  slower speed than most satellites (I estimate it would have taken 20 minutes to cross the sky, instead of 4-6); but it was not on the correct orbital track for timing or part of the sky, etc. according to Heavens-above.com which has orbital data for most objects. Several thorough searches have yielded nil. The light moved in a straight path from my field of view, and did not change in brightness, which may have indicated a change in altitude. The object appeared to be at an incredibly high altitude, which is why we thought that it must be a satellite, since even aircraft that are visible in binoculars would be in restricted airspace for this part of the sky. The flight path for National Airport is the SSW, along the Potomac River, and does not cross this field of view. After moving to within 2° of Capella in Auriga, it ceased movement. Just. Like. That.  We had watched it move for about 6 minutes from the NNE to the center of my FOV.  The light remained motionless for another ~3 minutes.  Its appearance in the binoculars was similar to Mars, in that it was a bright pink light that did not twinkle. The light then moved slowly in a southerly direction for about 3° and disappeared.  The 'real' Mars was visible in the next constellation over, so the light  definitely was NOT the planet.  No change in rate of speed or brightness occurred, no cracking or popping noises accompanied it--and it stopped moving for several minutes, so I'm fairly sure that it was not a meteor.

That was until today. At exactly 12:05 noon time I was standing outside in the garden, looking roughly eastwards, when I observed a loose formation of 5 or 6 shining identical spheres heading from the South East towards the North West (I was so fixed on the phenomenon that I simply forgot to count the number of spheres, but I am sure there were at least five of them). The sky was perfectly clear, blue with no clouds, and with an almost unlimited visibility, with the sun shining in the South (noontime) and a light surface wind coming from the North East. Some contrails of aircraft, as well as the aircraft themselves were clearly visible at high cruising altitude. The spheres were reflecting the sunlight at their backsides (sun side) as if they were from polished aluminium. The formation was visible during approximately 25 seconds. During that time of observation they travelled trough an arc of view of approximately 110 degrees (because of their relatively high speed, I did not have the opportunity to pick up my camera inside the house). The formation itself stayed together within a field of view of approximately 25 degrees, but their movements were very erratic, overtaking each other with brisk accelerations, and then slowing down again, and with brisk changing of directions over about 10 to 15 degrees deviation from the groups heading, before regaining the general track. During the observation the group travelled at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees above the horizon. They left no contrails behind them.  There was no audible sound until the silence was disturbed by an airliner that had just departed from Brussels International Airport (about 8 km away), departing from runway 25R, turning to the North West as a standard instrument departure towards the Nikki, Costa or Koksy VOR. At that moment the group of spheres was about to disappear behind the roofs of the houses North of my location. The airliner turned towards the general direction of the spheres but never passed in front of them from my point of view, so it was impossible to have any form of reference towards their distance and dimensions. In my opinion the spheres must have been visible from the cockpit of that airliner (especially from the co-pilot&#8217;s position) although they seemed a lot higher and faster.  As I said, I had no reference, no cloud base, and they didn't pass under or over any contrail present, but if you allow me a rough estimate, I would say that if the diameter of the spheres were around 20 feet, I would estimate their altitude at around 15000 feet, but that is only a guess.  These objects were certainly no balloons (too fast and against the wind direction), no birds at altitude (light reflection, far too fast, and not the same flight behaviour) and seemed clearly under intelligent control. What I found the most stunning was the brisk acceleration and deceleration when they were changing their relative positions. As they flew over a densely populated area it seems almost impossible that no other person should have made the same observation. By the way, just after the spheres disappeared behind the roofs of the neighbouring houses, I phoned my wife who was at work at that time, a couple of km North of my location (at that moment they should also still have been visible from there) but I could not make immediate contact, so I have nobody to confirm my observation. As these spheres were crossing straight trough the Brussels TMA and Control Area, I wonder if the air traffic controllers would have given a departure clearance to any airliner if they should have been visible on their radar screens!",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

I was coming home—pulling in the driveway-- (I live on a 40-acre farm) and immediately noticed a very bright orange-haze glow in the eastern sky—when I first noticed the object it was hovering (barely moving) and it was glowing. I noticed it immediately because of the size of the fireball/light and because it was much lower in the sky than any other celestial objects. I watched closely because it APPEARED to be moving, and sure enough, it was moving. The sky was very clear and the stars were very bright and beautiful on this morning. I am a college professor, and I was 100 percent sober. I was so taken back by the object that I woke my sleeping mother out of bed so she could also witness the object with me. I’m 37 years old and am always very cognizant of my surroundings, and I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this. I watched the object for approximately 1.5 hours (until about 5:00 a.m.). The object would hover for about 5 minutes at a time (sometimes more) and then it would disappear by ascending at a tremendous amount of speed. It would then reappear in a few minutes and repeat the same pattern. You could witness a zigzag hovering pattern—it changed directions very abruptly and almost zigzagged while hovering but we also witnessed (what appeared to be) either rotation of the air craft OR lights that were spinning (like a giant search light)—we could see the light going back and forth. The object we watched was orange in color and very bright—like a ball of light. Towards the very end of the sighting, we saw another object that was very different in shape with multi-colored lights (including red). The object was completely different in shape---not round but more like the shape and light configuration of a traffic light looks like. It did not look like an airplane because the rate of speed at which this 2nd object was traveling was incredible. It almost appeared as if the 2nd object ! was look ing for—or chasing the 1st object. Eventually, the orange glow ball object disappeared (as if it was being chased away). I was facing east toward Rochester and the 1st object disappeared into the south-eastern sky. The multi-colored object moved in from the north-eastern sky and disappeared in the north-eastern sky. When I first got home, I observed the object from outdoors. I did not hear any noises associated with this object. It was not a helicopter and it was DEFINITELY NOT an airplane. As the object appeared to be getting closer, I ran indoors because I was scared!

Marie, MI On June 28, 2006 I was measuring my backyard and preparing it for concrete when a big object caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. It was right over the neighbors house about 600-900ft. off the ground. I estimated that distance by using a radio tower which was right under the object as my way of figuring out how far off the ground it was. I believe that the radio tower is approximately 300ft. tall. It looked to be approximately two maybe two and a half of those towers from the ground. there was no noise at all. I grabbed my 12x50 binoculars and viewed the object for approximately 35 minutes without any movement at all. During those 35 minutes I made a drawing on my clipboard of the object as I viewed it through my binoculars. I wasn't going to call or tell anyone due to the fact of what other people might think. I figured I would just watch the thing until it took off. This thing was unbelieveable! It was tall and slender with a long shaft coming out from the bottom. On the top at an angle from the top and side was a chrome mirrored dome and there was a chrome gold reflection coming from around that same area. As I was watching the object through my binocs the dome turned towards me then stopped and a small object came out from the bottom of the long shaft and floated towards the top. It stopped beside the top of the craft and orbitted around the it twice before connecting itself to the top. Then the dome turned back towards the direction it was first facing which was NE and it never left that position the whole time. Right then I called my father-in-law, who is a sargent at the city police department, to come over and view this thing as a witness but he was sleeping because he just got off from his night shift. I told my mother-in-law that this was no joke and that they should get over here as soon as possible because there is a UFO over the house and that it was coming apart and reatatching itself. She told me to call the police, which I immediately did. I told the dispatcher who I was, that I was Mel's son-in-law and that this was no joke, and to send someone over right away because I believe there is a UFO over the house. The dispatcher laughed and said ""sure, I'll send someone right over"". My mother-in-law arrived by herself which was about five minutes after I called. (police never came). By the time she arrived it moved a little higher and to the south and stopped. She viewed it through the binocs as well and couldn't believe it herself. We both watched it for about 20 minutes before the neighbor pulled in next door. She viewed it for about 10 to 15 minutes before it disappeard into the sky. The dome never left its position facing the NE. It would move a little bit and stop. It did that about three or four times heading south and then it just moved slowly at an angle towards the atmosphere and disappeared behind a cloud. My mother-in-law went home and called the city police department and talked to one of the officers at the desk and asked why they didn't go out on the call and they said they were never dispatched. So the officers came over themselves after talking to my mother-in-law but by this time we never saw it again. They questioned me and waited a while to see if it would show again but it never did. I know the officers personally and they know I would have never called on something like this unless it was true. My father-in-law talked to the captain and they suggested that I go to your web site and log what I saw. I strongly believe that if the officer or anyone else with a video cam video taped this thing at that close of a distance for that long a period of time, that there wouldn't have been any other civilian evidence on earth with that much visual detail! Especially when it came apart and reattatched itself.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,46.4091,-84.3537

This object was really high in the sky, above the approach that airliners take to DFW or Love field. At first I thought it must be the blimp ready for the Dallas game that day. Upon further inspection while we sat at a red light in my truck it defiantly was a big Black Box shaped thing? I couldn’t make out much detail but it seemed to have what I would call notches like a cube on it. At this time the light turned green and we drove due north, at this time my daughter saw a jetliner on approach to DFW and it was way below the alt of this thing. When we stopped again at the intersection of Robison rd and Westchester it was still there and the plane had traveled quite away and was disappearing from sight.

But, I still go with the story, because coming up with a lie is not my thing. Well, this is how it happened, I went to the back of the house because I wanted to play with my little puppies, when I just looked in the sky and started wondering about that day when I saw the UFO. Well, I don’t know how I knew they were there because I saw what looked like a dot!! At first I was like it’s got to be a plane but it stayed still, then it stared moving south, very slow, it seemed very high up! And the acqward thing was that airplanes were passing right at the bottom of it! That’s when I started thinking that it’s got to be a balloon or a bag! And at that moment I called my sisters and my brother because this time I wanted witnesses! They came out side and asked me what’s wrong I said you wont believe it remember what I saw on April Fools it there again! They started searching for it and I told them were it is! Then my sister Virginia saw it and she said, “What is that” I told her you see it? She said yes. Well a couple of minutes later my other sister saw it and my little brother! I was so happy that I had witnesses but that’s when another one appeared. I told them oh my god there’s another one!!! When I saw the other one I got so scared! Because I started thinking maybe we see them. Well the strangest thing was that the were moving at a very slow speed, at first one would be ahead then the other. But then they’d go back and it was just so strange. A couple of minutes past when one of them just took off and headed south and disappeared, but the other on were still there! Just moving slowly.Oh yes and another thing that really creped me out was that one of the object was showing a red light at times and the other one flickered a blue light! That was the weirdest part, it actually creped out my little brother, because how could! it show the light in the middle of the day!!! Well, the saddest part is I didn’t have binoculars to get a better look, especially a camera! But the next time I will be ready, because I really want to know exactly what they look like because it was so high up that I couldn’t take a good look at it! It just looked like a dot, but you could still see it so it means it was probably large. I just hope I can see them again because they leave me with so much amazement and wonders!

As soon as the words came out of his mouth, a faint white light started appearing between the two contrails, looking like it was flickering on kind of like the flicker of a fluorescent bulb.   I thought it was the first star of the evening, but was proved wrong when the light grew steadily brighter.  It grew into a bigger, intensely bright white light and shone like that for about 3 seconds.   Then, the light flickered again and it was gone.  No trace of it.   There were no contrails coming off of it, it was too far away to tell if there was any sound, and there were no blinking lights like on an airplane or helicopter.  It just disappeared.

Approximately 8:50 pm as I stepped out onto our second floor deck a bright white star like flash of light high in the night sky caught my eye, it originated from a point about 80 degrees up and directly in the SSW.  I continued to watch the area thinking it was just a plane or possibly the final glint from an Iridium flare, after four or five seconds another flash occurred in exactly the same spot. No other lights were visible near that point of light. After another four to five seconds another flash appeared in exactly the same place, it was clear now that this was coming from a stationary source. I observed three more flashes approximately the same time apart as the previous ones; the last two however were about half the intensity as the first four. After several minutes and no activity I decided that it was over and I went inside to get the phone. I went back out with the phone and called my father to tell him about what I had just seen all the while keeping my eye on that area of the sky. Five minutes into the conversation I observed a commercial jet heading from South to North, nothing unusual. At about the same time as I noticed the jet coming from the South a fuzzy, red pulsating light appeared in the SSW slightly lower in the sky than the first event I described above. After a few seconds it was apparent that this red light was moving in my general direction and that it would pass directly overhead and that it would also intersect the path of the northbound jet, although at a much higher altitude. Careful scrutiny of the silent, rapidly approaching red light revealed absolutely no other lights on this craft. The light itself appeared somewhat fuzzy, with the apparent size of a pea held at arms length, it had a central hotspot that seemed very slightly less red than the overall area of red light. It appeared to pulsate between bright and dim about once a second, never actually going black between pulses. The night was practically silent, no traffic no, ambient noise. The only sounds were the barely discernable engine noise from the faraway jet and the occasional rustling of leaves. As I said the red light was headed in my general direction, moving from the SSW to the NNE and from my perspective it appeared that it was going to pass through the very same spot in the sky as the light flashes noted above. At the point when it did reach that spot, and coincidently high above the northbound jet this red light suddenly changed direction. It’s hard to describe, but essentially, one second it’s on a path that will bring it directly overhead and the next it’s moving parallel to the northbound jet, although higher and to the right of the plane. I was able to observe the jet and this object for the next 10 or 15 seconds as they headed North and eventually out of my view.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,35.05513711442786,-85.27057024875621

At any rate, what struck me was two things - the height and the pattern of flight.  The height struck me because they definitely were above the cloud level.   I'm still trying to figure out what the could level was at that time, but it gave me the impression that if they were as high as they seemed, then they were pretty large.  I first saw them going in a straight line, then the first one curved around the left and came back just a bit, then continued left, then forward, then right back to the original path.

Just as I came to the red light, I saw what I initially thought was a large plastic garbage bag about 100 feet from my location blowing in the wind about 30 feet over a field west of the intersection.  The reason I took it to be some kind of bag was that it was changing shape as if it were blowing in the wind.  However, it moved in a perfectly straight line, heading north.  It struck me as strange that this object could simultaneously change shape as if being buffeted by wind and yet not change direction at all.  When the light became green, I turned south, but found my eyes still riveted to the object.  On an impulse I decided to pull over to the side of the road and get out to have a better look at the object.  However, when I stepped out of the car, there was no object to be seen.  I looked at the field (recently harvested, and so bare) to see if a plastic bag had fallen, but I saw none.

Looked like the object was traveling about the speed of an aircraft but I didn't see any flashing lights on it other than the sparks.  Really looked like a plane on fire but there was no sound.  Other planes were in the air but farther way.  I live near a small airport, its probably a faulty engine but very few jet engine craft fly from the airport and not many at all at this time of night.

I live on the very western edge of the city and further off to the west is where I observed the object(s).  If I had to give a point of reference, I’d say it/they were over the Rio Puerco (so 7-10 miles west of my location?) area and heading west, but very slowly. About 9:45 I was in my side yard which faces west.  I looked up to see an object with several flashing colors of light (red, blue, yellow, green).  It wasn’t moving.  I ran into the house to get a pair of binoculaurs.  Through them I could see the colors better and a faint outline of the object (disk/circular).  It wasn’t a helicopter, no noise, either.  The sunlight was very very faint on the western horizon, and the full moon light on the opposite side of the sky almost ‘helped’ it stay undetected, if it were not for the flashing colors.  I stayed there watching it for about twenty minutes as it just stayed in place.   Then my partnere came home and I walked inside to tell him what I had seen.  He came outside with me and looked into the sky.  Now there were two of those objects, a bit farther away now, but in close proximity to each other.  It looked like one was going towards the other.  Now, I looked NW and close to the horizon and saw a white light in the sky, not moving.  It could have been a weather balloon, but they usually are seen because the sunlight is reflected off them.  About 5 minutes later, there appeared another of these multi-colored lights N/NW of the white light (the other two are due S of these, still hovering, though they appeared to have moved further west).  This was looked like it was farther/smaller but moving towards the white light.  At one point it looked like it was going to meet up with the white light, but then we saw what could have been an aircraft with identifiable red blinking light trying to 'catch up' to it (jet fighter?) but then this multi-colored object began to retrace it’s path (no wide turning as would an airplan! e), stra ight line towards the white light object, straight line back. The (jet?) aircraft moved away from both. By this time I realized that there were no commercial airplanes coming in from the west, like we usually see.  The white light object went over the horizon and disappeared.  The 3rd multi colored object kept going N/NE until we couldn't see it anymore.  The original two objects moved slowly west, but I couldn’t determine if they were moving up in altitude or just further away.  After about 40 minutes, we saw several planes begin to emerge from the north (not their usual flight path, especially, not directly over our part of the city).  Through the binoculaurs we could see that they were commercial aircraft.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

The sighting happened today during traffic hours in a very busy avenue.  I first saw a small flying saucer that looked very much like a toy.  The center circle moved rapidly, but the outer disk did not move.  It had a blue blinking light bulb on each side of the outer disk and I noticed that the direction of the object was well centered to the lights.  That is, that the lights were always on the side of this flying object as if they were the wings of a plane.  I immediately thought it was a remote control toy but what really caught my attention is that this one flying saucer was followed by another one, and another one after that, etc.  There were about 5 or 6 of them flying together one after the other.  They were going slow, at about 25 miles per hour and bordering the backyards of the houses that were parallel to this avenue.  They were flying parallel to the avenue.  At this point, I still thought they were kids playing from the backyards, but when I noticed these disks were not turning around, I realized it had to be something else.  They kept on going along the avenue. Two of them went up and moved slightly to the right and I was able to keep them in sight until they were two microscopic dots in the sky. I know that someone else must have seen it because this happened in the middle of Miami during traffic hours.  The objects were small, about the size of a large round pizza which led me to believe immediately that it had to be a toy.  I can’t imagine that it could be used for traveling.  I have never heard of such small size aliens.  I imagine that they could be used to scan an area, etc.  All I know is that they were small; they traveled at a steady pace and about 25 miles per hour and very close to the trees.   They were gray in the center section which spinned and black on the outer disk with blue blinking lights. I still find it difficult to imagine they were space crafts because they really looked like a toy.   However, I can’t explain how they were able to travel for such a long distance, especially the two crafts that went up in the sky until they became unnoticeable.   I am still shocked and would love to understand what happened.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

I could only see three silver dots, in the shape of the sky as they moved at the speed of normal aircraft across the sky...maybe we make triangle shaped ships.

I thought maybe the wind, which was kicking-up, had carried something skyward, so I watched until it went out of vision's range, but it wasn't an object kicked about by the wind...too regular...watched about a minute until it went out of view.   No solid object could I see, though upclose it might be solid, but just three dots.   Can't say it glowed...may have reflected...maybe holographic...maybe we have something new up in the sky these days.    Maybe it was how the sun hit, but it seems like the sun would have changed as it glistened across a metallic cover...not a light, but more of a reflection.  Whitish-silver.  Or, maybe, it was three very distant normal craft moving in perfect formation.

Then I realized it was moving slowly in a straight horizontal line, and so I assumed it was a private aircraft. After I watched it for maybe 10 seconds, it suddenly dropped straight down in a vertical line about a thousand feet or so in just a few seconds, so I knew immediately it was not a conventional aircraft.  I called my friend to join me outside and take a look, because I didn't know if I could trust my own eyes with what I was seeing.  He witnessed the same thing I did.   Next, the light began to shine brilliantly, pulsing between red, blue, green, purple and white while flying again in a perfect horizontal line - only now it had dropped below the tree line.  But because it was winter and many of the trees had lost their leaves, it was still fairly easy to track.  The light would extinguish sometimes and then reappear in seconds a mile or so away - and at different heights.  And after watching it for about 7 minutes, it finally disappeared.  It was a perfectly clear night sky, so I know it could not have been a spotlight reflecting off of a cloud.  Additionally the craft generated no sound, and no other aircraft were observed during the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

This object was to my left in the eastern sky, and looked to be a few miles away from me--(after some researching today I found out that this object was most probably 2-3 miles away from my location when I first spotted it.) This object was VERY bright, and a light orange color. Even thought I thought it looked awful large for a planet, I still assumed it must be since it was not twinkling like stars do. I pointed the light out to my son, and proceeded to bore him with trivia like how to tell if a star is a star or if its a planet. The object was in my view the entire time I was driving-(except short periods when trees obscured it.) A little over 2 miles up the road I had to make a left turn to head due east. I had started thinking there was something weird looking about the light so once I turned, and saw no other cars were coming, I stopped in the road to have a safer look. This was when I noticed the light was not a single light, but THREE lights. I thought to myself that it was weird for an airplane to have three large lights underneath it like that because for it to have been an airplane the two front lights would have had to have been on the end of each wing, and the third rear one on the tail, but all would have had to have been UNDERNEATH the object. These lights all looked to be the same distance apart and were very big looking lights, all large, all the same light orange color, no pulsing, or color changing, and they were set in a triangle pattern--(note I stated the shape of the craft was triangular, but I am unsure of the actual shape of the craft itself--only what formation the three lights were in.)  They didn't appear to be landing lights, especially since the plane was not coming from, or going towards the direction of the closest airport, so I'm sure it wasn't landing or taking off. The object was closer to me by the time I stopped to look and was heading towards me in a diagonal path. I made no unusual note of speed, or movement--(it appeared to move slowly, but I wouldn't say notably slow, nor did I see any unusual movements that defy conventional aircraft performance.) I heard no sounds as if an airplane was passing overhead, but I never actually cut my van off, so I suppose it's possible there were some sounds. This object appeared to be flying pretty low, yet was too high for me to make out any of the aircraft itself--I could only see the three lights.  It's possible this may have been a normal, everyday aircraft, but I have to say that I've been driving for many years, and have been out lots of times at night, and I have seen many, MANY, airplanes, helicopters, and such in the night sky at varying distances. I've seen all kinds of colored lights on planes at night time,at different altitudes, sometimes steady, sometimes blinking and blipping around. More than a few of them have given me pause, but I always realize very quickly that it is in fact just an airplane, or some other form of 'normal' aircraft. You just--KNOW when what you are seeing is normal, and when it is not, and this didn't look normal to me. I can't say as I've ever seen three big orange colored lights in that formation on the very bottom of an airplane like that before. Ever. Thought I should mention that I submitted a report to the NUFORC a while back....I think it was a year or two ago and it concerned a possible UFO sighting I had when I was younger back in the early 80's in nearby Suffolk, Va. (I believe that was the last time I have seen anything 'unidentified' in the skies until last night, btw...lol)  The one I saw in the 80's was a single big, bright light, but was orange like the lights I saw last night. Might be nothing, but thought worth bringing up. I made and am sending you two drawings I made via a computer paint program. The first drawing represents pretty much the exact way I saw the object in the sky--the direction it was heading, as well as the size in relation to how it looked to me up in the sky from my van. The second represents how large the 'orange planet' appeared to me when I first spotted it by comparing it to the 'north star'.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,36.67379999999999,-76.857

She was driving from Philadelphia to the Delaware beaches on southbound Route 1 and passed the Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware.  Having commuted at night for nearly two decades, she is familiar with the air base's lit-up landing strip of lights (which flash during inclement weather) off the left side of the roadway.  She noticed that the lights were off that night. When she was about a mile south of the air base, she noticed a large, triangular craft over a field off the right side of the highway.  (There are several miles of fields and marshes just past the air base off both sides of the highway.)  There were white lights on both sides of the object, yet no airplane beacon below it.  (She has worked with airplanes.)  It was silent.  She couldn't tell what altitude it was at, thus making it impossible to judge the size, whether it was 200 feet, 500 feet or 1,000 feet in length. She kept watching it for several miles as she continued driving and wondered why it was making such a slow decent and why it wasn't landing faster.  She eventually came to the perplexing conclusion that it was hovering, despite the fact that it obviously wasn't a helicopter. She has never seen a UFO and believes it was possibly an experimental military aircraft.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,39.16652996389892,-75.52987906137184

Probably just balloons, but since this picture was taken at 4:53 pm, and it would be dark in one hour, why is the, ""balloon,"" dark in the center?  I played with the gamma correction, and noticed these, ""balloons,"" were dark in the center and had a (white) structure at the top and bottom roughly in the form of a cylinder.  So if I am looking east, and the sun is setting behind me in the west, why are the balloons dark in the center?  It was an overcast day, so maybe this explains it, but I don’t see how.

On the morning of April 10, 2008 at about 4 am I was awoken by a phone call from my daughter telling me that there was a possible tornado heading straight for my house. I turned on the news to find out this line of rotation expanded over several cities and was coming towards me from the east. At about the time the storm was to hit my house , my satellite went out. I went out the back door to watch and see if I could hear or see anything. It was quiet except for the thunder. As I was watching I saw a flash of light out of the corner of my eye coming from the west. I thought that it was stupid for a plane to be flying directly into a storm of such great magnitude. Then I saw the flash again only closer. I still could not believe this plane was still heading directly into a possible tornado. I turned to look at the plane and realized immediately there was something not right. When I turned to look at the plane... there was not only one light but a whole line of lights aligned perfectly in a row. I could see them over my tree line.  The lights were very bright and all of them were flashing. I tried to rationalize of what it could be. The lights were too close together to be planes or helicopters flying next to each other. I tried to hear an engine or a propeller and I could not hear anything. I was terrified because I realized it was not several objects ... but one big one and it was getting closer and closer. I started screaming and was trying to reach my husband by cell phone ...but he would not answer. I started to think he would think I was crazy, so I tried to take a picture with my cell phone. I was shaking too much to time it right. Every time I would take the picture, the lights would be off.  The 4th time I went to take a picture I looked up and froze. I did not realize how close it had gotten. I t was huge. I was screaming at the top of my lungs for anyone to hear. I started to rationalize calling 911 ....I did not want  anyone to think I was crazy. Then it had gotten so close that I did not care who thought I was crazy. As I opened the phone to call.....It thundered to the west of me  and it startled me so I turned to look ..and the storm was hitting my property line. I immediately turned back to the east of me and the lights were dropping down below the tree line.  I was scared to death that it had landed...but I could not tell. The light flashes seemed to slow down and continue about three more times and then nothing. They just stopped flashing all together. Nothing happened . I have  never been so scared in my entire life. I felt I could not call the police because there was nothing for them to see. It just seemed to vanish. I stayed staring at the tree line and crying for over an hour waiting for the sun to rise enough to assure myself there was nothing there anymore.

I was sitting on my patio facing west.  At 2045 by my watch which is one minute faster than the official U.S. time, I observed four lights going from southwest to northeast, from my 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock position, at elevation about one half way between the horizon and directly overhead.  The lights were four abreast at first, top to bottom from my perspective and eqi-distant apart, which I thought was unusual for military aircraft.  If you hold your hand at arms length with your thumb and first finger about three inches apart, that would encompass the formation.  There was only one light per object and they were not blinking.  Each light was maybe three to four times the size of Venus, with a faintly greenish tinge, and appeared not distinct, but slightly hazy like looking through a fog.  They went through about twenty degrees of the sky and then one light dropped back into trail.  After going through another twenty degrees, they disappeared behind a cloud.  They traveled in a straight line.  The entire sighting lasted about twelve seconds.  I expected to hear sounds of jet engines following the lights, but heard nothing.  There was no vapor trail like I observed on other normal aircraft seen later. For many years, I have done a lot of fishing at night.  I have observed many aircraft flying overhead and have seen many shooting stars.  This was like nothing I have ever seen before and immediately caught my attention.  The unusual formation, speed, and lack of sound were unique.  To cross the sky that quickly, they had to be relatively low but I heard no sound.  If they were too high to be heard, they were going many times faster than other planes I have observed and were extremely large.  It was definitely not the ubiquitous weather balloon. To our south about thirty miles is Seymour Johnson AFB.  I was stationed there in the mid-60’s and am familiar with military planes.  Their F-15’s often fly over Greenville since their runway has a north-south heading.  They are generally low enough to be heard.  We also see the louder F-18's out of Virginia Beach.  Most aircraft have red, green, and white lights.  On most airplanes you can usually see blinking lights or rotating strobes and not all lights are visible from every direction.  The four lights I saw were steady and looked the same from a left to right forty degree arc.  Pitt-Greenville Airport is about four miles away to my northwest.  I worked there for three years ending two years ago.  Again I never saw anything like this during that time. About me.  I am sixty-four years old and retired.  I was in the air force four years, worked at Eastern Airlines for twelve, and was in computing for thirty-five years, the last eighteen with a university.  I do not believe in UFO’s, little green men, or alien abductions.  But I will admit that this was like nothing I’ve ever seen before and it was interesting.  I’d like to know what I really saw.",2008-04-17T00:00:00,35.60140526315789,-77.24022186234818

Date-   April 10, 2008   Location-   Arcata, California  Outside front entrance of Humboldt State University Weight Room on the staircase going downward to the men’s locker room. Time-   About 9:30 pm, nighttime  Time Started Writing this Report- About 10:00 pm  Just about a half hour ago, I finished my workout at the Humboldt State University weight room.  I walked out of the facility through the front entrance.  It was nighttime, and the moon was shaped like a smile.  I saw clear stars in the sky.  There was one bright light that I thought was a star when I first saw it.  However it was a big star and it was moving.  It actually looked more like it was glowing than twinkling like a normal star.  It was not moving fast or slow, but at medium speed.  No light was blinking on it like I would see on a normal airplane.  As it moved it looked as if it was slightly wiggling from side to side.  It looked as if it was more floating than flying.  The movement of the light seemed very smooth, unlike an airplane that deals with wind resistance.  Even as it moved almost directly above me, it was a big bright light directly facing me the whole time, like the image of a very big or bright star.  Normally when an airplane flies over me, the brightest front light of the plane faces the direction that the plane is moving.  An airplane front light does not continually face me as it passes over me, as it looked with this flying object I saw.  When an airplane passes over me, I usually see some kind of blinking light(s) on its wings and/or underbelly. It might have even been bigger than any star I ever saw.  It made no noise as it moved.  As it kept moving, it gradually started dimming, and eventually disappeared, where I saw just a little light before it totally faded into the night sky woodwork.  Keep in mind that this sighting happened all during the course of about seven or eight seconds. Also keep in mind that this was nighttime.  There might have been redwood trees that it went behind, and perhaps this was the reason it disappeared.  There also might have been fog that it disappeared behind.  However immediately after the experience I went to other locations to try and get a different view and angle of the area that I saw the light disappear to see if I could see any stars.  Well, in one of my other views, I saw stars, and there did not appear to be fog in that direction. I am going to return to my sighting location tomorrow during the day to see if some kind of object or redwood trees might have caused the object to disappear from where I was standing at the time of the sighting.  I will get back to you on this sighting after I do this, to judge whether or not I feel the flying object actually disappeared, or merely went behind some kind of object like redwood trees.

These helicopters were travelling at around 100-120mph but slowly came to a complete stop and went another 200 feet up.  About 10 seconds after this I noticed lots of small shapeless bright dots emerge from a cloud.  It looked very similar to the debris you get when rockets explode.  As more emerged from the cloud I realised it was not debris as they seemed to be 'falling' in a series of different single file rows.   As they approached the helicopters they were only 1/2 mile away and I got a scale and I quessed that these objects were about 5 by 5 feet big and looked as though they were wrapped in aluminium foil.  When they all completely got out the clouds they were all loosing altitude and travelling at about 80mph. I want to make it clear that the movements of the objects were very jurky which was very strange, as if they would fly 20 feet, then stop for a fraction of a second, a bit like watching a video which was not fully buffered.  As the objects approached the ground they got within 100 feet of the ground but then accelerated upwards at a 90 degree angle back into the clouds at a speed of 400mph.

About 5 minutes after this 1 helicopter left in a south easterly direction.10 minutes after this both remaining helicopters left steight south.  These two helicopters flew about 600 ft over some housing and US ARMY could clearly be seen on the side of the Helicopters.  One thing I did notice about them which I thought was strange was that there seemed to be a lampshade like object hanging from the bottom of these helicopters which omitted a yellow light every 4-5 seconds.

At 12:12 or 13 AM this date I witnessed a delta shaped aircraft or whatever of some kind over Tacoma, WA that was totally silent and a medium grey slightly towards the light grey side.  Just a little darker than the cloud that it flew over. I followed my wife outside with our dog for her last potty break before we planned on going to bed.  She and the dog went out the back door, which faces east.  I followed and stopped at the edge of our back porch to light a cigarette, but before lighting it, I looked to the east, up into the sky. I saw movement and noticed a triangle shaped craft at what I estimate to be 1500 to 2000’ in altitude about three seconds before it flew over a small cloud from south to north where it became invisible due to the color of the craft, and the thickness of the cloud.  As it moved north, I was able to see movement through thin spots in this cloud, but only two times.  The total time of this sighting did not last more than 5 or 6 seconds. This craft was moving at about 200 to 250 mph.  I base this on the fact that C-17s from McCord AFB fly over my home every day of the week, usually with full flaps and gear down, doing touch and goes. I do not know the speed of the C-17, but if for touch and goes with flaps and gear, I think they are traveling at about 200mph or a little less. A very large fir tree sits on the block just to the east of me.  When standing in the same place on my porch, extending my arm full out and placing my thumb on the top of the tree and where my little finger ended with my fingers spread out is the altitude this craft was at. With my hand spread out like that, my little finger will be on Orion and my thumb just shy of Sirius. There were no signs of any lights on this craft and it moved in a straight line and was approximately directly overhead of somewhere between D St. and Pacific Avenue South that run North and South in Tacoma, WA. At the distance is was from me I could put stretch my arm out, place my thumb over it and the tips of the wings could be seen just slightly past my thumb.  The tail of the craft had a slight protuberance past the back of the triangle. The craft flew in a straight line from south to north. There were no visible lights or marking of any kind. No exhaust trail. Not any hint of a cockpit or any raised part above the craft. However, the most peculiar thing is it was totally and completely silent. My wife did not see it as it happened too fast for me to even tell her until it was over with. There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity.  None from McChord and just a couple several miles away in flight patterns in and out of Sea-Tac Airport. I am 66 years old, served eight years in the US Air Force as an aircraft electronics tech for radio and radar and retired from a 30 year job as a Traffic Signal Technician.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

At approximately 10:05 pm my husband and I observed a quarter-moon shaped, golden object at the tree line due west from the front porch of our home. The object was shaped so much like the moon and was so close in size, too, that at first we thought it was just some sort of atmospheric condition causing an odd colored moon. It was sunset colored ""golden orange."" Then we realized that not only was the sky perfectly clear (we could see all of the stars; no clouds), but this ""moon"" was in the wrong position in the sky; it is always above the tree line and to the east at that time of night. We immediately began watching the object, discussing what it could be.  Over the course of 2-3 minutes, we both noted that the object began twinkling on the lower side, almost like some object lit with Christmas lights. The thought that it could be some sort of Christmas decoration entered our discussion, but our location is in the country in a wooded, secluded area; we cannot see any other houses from our home, and this object was not in a direction where any houses exist. Over the next few minutes, the entire object began dimming so that it was hard to see through the trees. It was almost as if clouds were passing over it and blocking it from view, even though there were no clouds anywhere; something seemed to be obstructing our view, and the object itself seemed to be changing positions.  We changed positions, trying to keep an eye on the object. It developed an orangey-red, fire colored orb over its top center area, and the entire object grew brighter momentarily. We almost called 911. We thought maybe there was a large fire in the woods. However, before we could do anything, the body of the object dimmed again. Over the next few minutes the orb grew smaller and smaller as if moving away from us. Then it just disappeared completely from sight.  There was a beeping sound that we noticed as soon as we’d gone outdoors, and this sound continued after the object disappeared. The beeping repetition and sound was similar to that of a house fire alarm, but it sounded, then paused for a few seconds, then sounded again, over and over. We’d never noticed that sound before the incident, and it stopped after a few hours. We’re not sure if it’s related or not, but since we both heard it, I thought we should mention it.

I was looking from the 20th floor of the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas towards the direction of Area  51. I was also overlooking the Las Vegas Airport late at night, as I usually do when I visit that city. Suddenly out in the distance, beyond the mountain range a ""BLUE ORB"" rose into the sky at an unbelievable speed, it did not travel in a straight direction at any time, it continued to fly erratically throughout the hour I stayed awake to watch it. This BLUE ORB would rise to, my guess 50,000 feet, and dive back behind the mountain range within seconds. The speed of this object far exceeded any military plane I have ever seen and could not begin to imagine that it was a manned vehicle.  It did appear to fly within a limited range and distance, as it did not approach the city, nor did it seem to fly far into the distance, but rather kept its location above and beyond the Nevada mountain range. Furthermore, as planes could be seen approaching from the distance, this BLUE ORB would disappear behind the mountains. I felt as if ""it"" was being tested with caution. What I mean is the orb would disappear when a commercial airplane was near and the orb would reappear when the skies were clear of visible traffic. I'm confident the skies above our US testing sights are secure, and air traffic above them is forbidden.  This object had no defined shape other than a Blue Ball of Light. It did not flash, it did not change color, it made no noise I could hear, IT DID FLY AT INCREDIBLE SPEEDS. IT MOVED BOTH IN ""S"" PATTERNS AS WELL AS STRIGHT AND ERRATIC. IT WOULD SOMETIMES STOP SUDDENLY, HOVER AND DIVE, AND SOMETIMES IT JUST DARTED AROUND SOMEWHAT UNCONTROLLABLY. WHILE I WAS FASCINATED, THIS ORB WAS COMING NO CLOSER AND I FELT THAT WHAT I SAW WAS ALL I WOULD SEE. I DID CONTACT HOTEL SECURITY IN THE MORNING AND THEY TOLD ME THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. Of course, I did not have my video camera and I stand alone as an Eye Witness.  Thanks for listening.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

There was a very thin cloud layer in the sky that did NOT obscure the stars.  The object was above this layer and I attribute its hazy appearance to that fact.   The light moved rapidly from a higher to lower altitude and seemed to follow a trajectory that made an angle of about 30 degrees with the ground.  From my vantage point at approximately 1250 feet in elevation, it appeared that the object was about 5 miles, or so, distant, and located over the Redstone Arsenal.  The object covered a large arc of sky in the very short time in which I viewed it.  The object gave the impression it would impact the ground somwhere south of my location.  I can see about 40 miles due to my mountain-top location.  I waited for several minutes for a sign of impact, but saw none.  The Alabama counties in which an impact could have taken place are Morgan and Marshall.  No sound from the object was audible.  I had attributed my sighting to a meteor, until a local newspaper ran an article about a similar sounding object that was seen a day later at a much earlier time (11/28/06 at 17:28).  Search lights, flares, rockets, missiles, and aitcraft are unlikely explanations for this object.  Humidity in the air would make search light beams visible and the shape of the spot on the clouds would have changed due to the angle of the light source.  The object maintained constant shape.  The apparent altitude and angle of sky covered would likely indicate supersonic velocity and probably a sonic boom, especially if the object had to avaoid collision with the ground.  The sudden appearance and disappearance of the object, and its constant luminance would also help rule out the other possibilities I mentioned.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,34.727967771639044,-86.62783879680786

Peter: Since 1984 I have been broadcasting space shuttle launches on a network of radio stations across the country. I have media credentials issued by NASA and am considered an authority on space hardware and systems. The UFO phenomena has always interested me but until 8:21:28 PM,  March 26, 2008, I had never seen one. I have a whole slew of computers and monitors in my home studio from which I broadcast the launches when I can’t get to the Kennedy Space Center. Upon entry and landing I plot all the trajectories and landing paths. On the 26th of March the shuttle Endeavor was waved off the first landing attempt due to weather conditions being unfavorable. That attempt would have brought the shuttle in over Miami and up the east coast of Florida. The second attempt meant an atmospheric entry interface and landing approach directly over my head in southeastern Hillsborough County (Tampa Bay). The evening was perfect for satellite watching; the weather was cool and dry and the sky completely clear. I had already plotted the tracks for the ATV and ISS as well as STS-123. The ATV was in the same orbit as the ISS only about 1,200 miles ( 5 minutes) in front it. Having just undocked from the space station, the shuttle was also in the same orbit except about 326 miles (1 minute) behind the ISS. So, orbital mechanics being what they are, there is absolutely no way for the shuttle to ever overtake either the ISS or the ATV. The ATV was scheduled to go over my house at 8:20 PM and the ISS at 8:25 PM. The shuttle, which by that time, would have been entering the atmosphere and slowing considerably, would be going over at about 8:33:40 PM on its way to an 8:39 PM landing at the cape. Gazing intently at the patch of sky dictated by my computer, we could not see the ATV, it was just too small and dark. At 8:21:28 we noticed a pinkish light moving across the sky. Initially I thought it was the ATV, albeit late.  Then the pink light veered off course and silently zipped in a highly controlled movement across our heads (several neighbors had come out to watch, too) to the southeast and then turned toward the northeast as if headed toward the Kennedy Space Center which is directly across the state from us. It made the trip from right above us to the vicinity of KSC in about 1 to 2 seconds.  I knew then that the object was not the ATV so my thoughts went to the shuttle. Problem being that at the altitude the shuttle flies by the time it gets to Tampa we get twin sonic booms off the nose and tail. This “UFOish” object produced no sonic boom despite the fact that it seemed to have been moving at thousands of miles an hour. Just as I was pondering the pink light, the ISS went by overhead at 17,500 mph in its orbit. Very bright but, compared to what I had just seen, laboriously slow. It took the ISS a good 2-3 minutes to move across the sky compared to only a second or two for the pink light. I have never seen anything travel that fast, including supersonic jets at closed to the public media events. I went back into the house and NASA-TV’s George Diller was saying that the shuttle was “…now just 9 minutes from landing at KSC and about 150 miles off the coast of Florida over the Gulf of Mexico.”  Going back outside, sure enough, right on schedule, I was greeted by the twin sonic booms that must have rattled windows all over the Bay area. The shuttle, however, was too dark to be seen without night vision goggles to pick up the residual heat from its reentry. Having watched many launches from my front yard, I have a keen awareness of exactly where the Kennedy Space Center is from my front door… exactly 142.6 miles to the parking lot at the VAB. I’m not saying it was alien, I don’t know what the little pink light was, but, whatever it was, it was not a plane in the conventional sense of that word. At first I thought its altitude was orbital but as it moved away from the orbit of the ISS, first to the southeast and then curving around to a northeast heading, it didn’t seem to be all that high. If I had to guess I would say maybe about 10,000 to 15,000 feet. Well, that’s about it. Enjoy your silo.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,27.927325837320573,-82.23285933014354

I observed a craft heading south-easterly, which had just passed over my house when I came outside.  The craft had (5) distinct lights and appeared to be like (2) boomerangs joined (facing one another by the points) in the middle.  The “middle”, where the craft(s) were joined had one large red light.  The “tips” of the boomerangs had white lights.  Their was no contrail.  At first, I did not believe this to be (2) separate crafts, as it appeared to be one large shaft and moved in a uniform and completely synchronized manner.  It was obvious, in my sight, that this was one craft.  The sound, size and shape of the craft intrigued me, so I called my husband outside.  He arrived within several seconds and watched this craft with me.  He said that it “might be military” although he said he had never seen anything like it.  We both continued to watch the craft, which proceeded at what I would consider a “normal” speed for a low-flying aircraft.  The craft was about the side of a grapefruit, with my hand held up in the air to reference it.  The craft was low-flying enough for me to barely make-out the joined “boomerang” shapes—what I would estimate to be about 500-feet of elevation.  As my husband and I watched this craft pull away, we then noticed that it split into (2) separate and distinct craft.  The craft split apart from one another by approx. 10-fingers width.  We could see the (2) crafts at slightly different elevations and they flew obviously apart from one another.  The red “center” light was no longer visible.  The craft then came back together, but “side-by side” with no “space” between them.  They flew together in this manner, never returning to the “joined boomerang shape.”  My husband, somewhat of a skeptic, even said that “was weird” and that he “had never seen anything like that before.”  He st! ated tha t it may have been mid-air refueling of an aircraft coming from Vandenberg.  I consider this as a possibility, but wonder, why would they need to conduct mid-air refueling so low over a populated area and so close to Vandenberg itself?  -Vandenberg is only about 18-miles away “as the crow flies.”  Environment:  It was a clear and star-filled night and the houses in my development are spaced-out by at least 100 (or so) feet between one another and the condo association itself takes great care to curtail light “pollution.”  -The motto in our area is “Turn-out the lights, see the stars.”",2008-03-31T00:00:00,34.61411041666667,-120.14132083333334

I looked up towards the Orion constellation thinking how bright the stars looked tonight, when I noticed a star as bright as Sirius, which was also visible from where I was standing, moving across the sky from the right of Orion on a straight course from S.W. to N.E. As I was trying to focus looking for the blinking lights of the airplanes I noticed it was traveling at least at 30,000 feet altitude without any sound. No blinking lights just a steady bright light, and as it went over a thin cloud it started to fade into a normal size star in the sky. When it came out from over the cloud it kept on getting dimmer although it was closer to my point of view by then. I lost sight of it behind a building. This is the 3rd incident in the past three months of witnessing an unusual flying object in this area.

I continued to watch when I lost track of the 2 jets and could see a red or reddish orange light sitting in the sky.  I thought it might have been a star because it was fairly small but the night was cloudy so that was out of the question.  The light was just sitting there, very still.  It wasn't growing or shrinking so I knew it wasnt moving towards or away from me, it just stood still.  Then it started to veer south fairly slow and as I could hear a jetcraft in the distance, the light got a little bigger, big enough I could see it changed colors from red to blue and then to yellow.

I am reporting the sighting of two black triangles flying south to north over Napa California.  I am a Police Officer at Napa State Hospital and was on duty during this sighting.  On 03-26-08 at 21:07 I was looking west at the constellation Orion and the Pleiades.  I noticed what at first looked like three stars in a triangular formation all moving together.  When I looked closer I could see the lights were on a triangular form that was darker than the sky background.  I watched the object move from south to north at what I approximate as between 500 to 1,000 feet in altitude.  I estimate the object was 20 miles west of me over the Napa / Sonoma County line.  The object seemed to be an equilateral triangle with a steady white light near each corner.  There was also a dimmer white light in the center of the object.  I would estimate that the distance between the outer lights near the corners was slightly less than the distance that separates the stars in Orion’s belt.  Based on these observations and my estimations, the object would have been quite large.  A rough estimate would place the sides of the object at 300 feet in length.  A better extrapolation could be ascertained from my previous estimations though.  The object was moving very swiftly and was completely silent.  I often watch aircraft take off and land at the Napa Airport while working on the west side of our facility in the evenings.  The evening was quiet and I could hear each aircraft as it passes over me, even those at high altitudes.  At the time I saw the object, there were no other aircraft in my field of view.  Additionally, I have some experience flying a Cessna 172 from the Napa Airport when I was taking flying lessons and am familiar with basic avionics and flight characteristics.  At the distance and altitude I estimate the object was from me, the object appeared to be flying at a rate at least ten times that of the many commercial and private jets I often observe in the air corridors above Napa.  I continued to watch the object as it disappeared behind some trees to the north of me.  I looked at my watch and marked the time at 21:07 then reached in my pocket for my cell phone.  I was trying to dial my phone by touch so as to preserve my night vision while looking back toward Orion.  As I did this I saw another identical object moving in the same manner as the first.  This was almost one minute from the sighting of the first object.  I continued to watch the object until it disappeared behind the same trees.  I returned my observation toward Orion to see if there were any more.  I watched this portion of the sky while glancing at other portions of the sky for another ten minutes before I stopped to call my friend to tell him about the sighting.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,38.46812121212121,-122.19507146464646

It hovered there for about 20 seconds and then went back east and out of my line of vision. One thing about this object is that it seemed to be revolving on its axis, because it would go white and gray and white again. Very strange. I would add that two days earlier, around the same time, I was 20 miles south in Norman, Oklahoma having lunch with my father-in-law, when I saw a bright object of similar size traveling in much the same fashion.  The difference was is that it seemed to leave a short ""exhaust"" trail or something behind it before disappearing in front of a cloud. I should also note that Tinker AFB is not far away from both sighting locations.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

I was taking random shots of the beach and of us and then just to test the camera I aimed it at the sky and snapped. At first all I got were black shots with tiny little dots for stars and then I got something that I had never seen before. At first I thought the meteoroid shower had started, but I couldn’t see anything with my naked eye and plus, these lights were going in all different directions. So I snapped another shot and again, the black screen with just the dots. Then I tried the ""series""option on the camera (takes several photos in one minute) and what I got was amazing.  A couple of the shots were just black, but I got 2 more pictures of these light streaks and I was baffled because I could not see any of this with my naked eye, only when I snapped the picture, and only 4 times out of the 50 something shots I took.

It could not have been Sirius as i've been mesmerised by Sirius for some time now since i discovered what a previous sighting i had from home was the dog star via the greenwich observatory. This 'star' as ill call it was so, so bright and just hung there in the sky.  it was constantly there just moving as we did so perhaps it may be explained as a planet.  it definately wasn't a plane as we came past stanstead airport and planes were taking off and landing and showing all characterristics of planes whereas this was just there. Stopping off at a place called Fourwentways in Cambridgeshire i could not see this 'star' even though this is a open place and the 'star' was so bright it should have been seen. Watching the skys as i always do on this long journey from Norfolk to London whilst keeping an eye out for this 'star' i noticed on the horizon various other extremely white lights or 'stars' and then every so often there would be a bright red 'star' which appeared to move.  one going high into the air and then back down to earth again.  I assumed these were arials of some kind but i then say some closer ariels that you could make out to be arials that the red light didnt move on yet these other red lights moved. Just past Stanstead Airport almost on the borders of Essex in a field to my left was what looked like a huge circle of flame but it was in such a way that it could not have been a field on fire it was moreso a complete unmoving circle of flame but it was only lit 3/4's round and not a complete circle and it wasn't out of control as a field fire would be.

'Dancing in the sky' On the night of February 12th of 2007 just after midnight I and five others which included my mother, Auntie, 1yr old daughter, boyfriend and the boat operator was onboard a small courier boat travelling from ‘Coco Beach’ back to ‘White beach’ where we were all based during our 3 week long holiday. Both of which are tourist beach resorts located in Oriental Mindoro, Batangas, Philippines. It was a 30 minute journey back and we have just finished a big meal from the Coco beach restaurant so we were all very tired.  Everyone around me just closed their eyes and I followed (except for the boat operator of course). At about 10-15mins after, I opened my eyes to look up at the sky.  The sky was clear and I can make out the star formations.  Exactly after a minute, I thought I witnessed a Shooting star as it appeared to shoot in one direction and quickly disappeared.  For 3 seconds I was thinking to myself I should make a wish. Then it reappeared moving in different directions at incredible speed. It had different coloured lights. I witnessed a colour formation of white, red, orange and blue. I froze and kept my eyes on it as I was afraid I’d lose sight of it. I couldn’t tell the distance but I know it was very far as it was more or less the same size of an average star. About 5 minutes of watching, I woke up my boyfriend who was snoozing with his head on his arms at the very front of the boat.  I told him to look up at the star that was moving in the dark sky and as he was in a daze he quickly dismissed it and said ‘Nah it’s because the boat is moving up and down’ (as in his own words). But I remained quiet until it reappeared brighter then proceeded to point again. ‘There it is, over there’, I said.  This time he was quiet trying to focus and concentrate.  We watched it swerve in zigzag motion and a straight line, speed up and then slow down again. For a split second I took my eyes of the UFO to look at the sheer concentration on my boyfriends face he let out a ‘Wow’.  I looked back at the object and he informed me that it just made a spectacular circular motion, which I just missed.  My boyfriend proceeded to record the object on his camcorder but resigned to the fact that it was too hard to focus on the object at such distance especially at the night sky.  Another significant detail was that there was an aeroplane that was coming from the far right moving towards the west and we conversed on comparing the two. I said, ‘there is no way that UFO is a plane. We have nothing that moves that fast’.  And so we concluded the same as the two objects aligned directly above each other.  Then we watched the UFO move the same way it was towards the west until it faded. We arrived at the shores in complete awe. It was one of the most memorable moments in my life and will probably never come across a UFO again.",2007-03-08T00:00:00,,

Our sidewalk makes a 90 degree turn halfway up it. As we began to make our turn, I happened to glance to my left. 	What I saw amazed me. It was in the clearing of a tree that is diagonal from our yard. I could not tell what shape it was, since it was very dark out. All we could see were 3 extremely bright white lights, and 1 dimmer red light, and 1 dimmer blue light. The pattern went like this. White light, red light, white light, blue light, and then the last white light. 	My sister and I stood there captivated by it, and watched it for what must have been 4 or 5 minutes. The lights were so bright, that it hurt my eyes just to look at them, but I could not look away. My sister and I didn't know what to do, so my sister kept her eyes on it, and we got in the car and began to drive. We saw it, and then when we had to pass the tree, it disappeared.

I went outside at approximately 4:30 in the morning and saw a bright star, or so I thought.  I thought that’s weird, it looks like the North Star in brightness, but I was facing due south.  I then noticed a sort of tail so to say pointing down.  It almost looked like the Star of Bethlehem, however flipped upside down.  As I sat and watched this thing, I thought is this an airplane?  I then noticed these red attachments to the object, which kind of attached themselves to the bottom of the tail like an upside down Y.  At one point it appeared that there were also Y attachments to the top that were green, but I only saw those on two short occasions, so I can’t say if that’s really what I saw or the brightness changing as it moved. As I sat and watched this object, it hovered about moving from the east to the west not fast, but just enough to where you could see it moving.  When I took a step back because I was alarmed, it sort of moved with me.  Not fast, but you could tell that it moved.  I took another step back, and it moved again.  It almost made me feel like it was watching me.  At this time I was beginning to get a little freaked out.  Ran in the house, made my husband wake up from bed to come and look at this object.  He did come, and he did see it, but he disregarded and went back to bed. I continued to watch the object for 40-45 minutes.  Again, the feeling of it watching me made me uneasy.  I did see faint beams of light on two occasions go thru the sky.  Not far, but almost like a spotlight effect.  I moved to my right, the object hovered to the right, I moved to the left, the object hovered to the left.  I tilted my head to the side, the object moved it’s apex to the right, so on and so forth.  I did notice six star like objects that blinked on and off.  I did look around at other stars to my east and west, and did not see any stars blinking on and off. I saw this object rotate on two occasions, like it almost wanted me to see its full self.  During rotation it looked like the inside of a Mercedes Benz symbol. I’ve never disregarded the fact of UFO sighting, but I never expected to see one myself.  I haven’t really ever explored or investigated these occurrences, but I definitely know what I saw was not an airplane or a satellite in the sky. Did anyone else see this object?

Then the disk turned so I could see the bottom,it was also chrome. The strange part was the sun was almost in front of me,but just a hair to the right.  So that means the sun was behind the disk. So how did the chrome body shine the way it did, but the strangest part is after a few seconds it disappered, just like some one turned off a light!!!  I never reappered. The sky was compelty clear,not a cloud in sight.

Also, the movement was dialognally down and the dialognally up and then the next instant, I could not not see it as it went farther over the horizon so I got on Golf Rd, to go east to follow is as it was not as high as the air traffic it looked about 5000-8000FT when I followed it for a minute and then stopped and looked down at my cell phone for a second and looked back up and it was completely gone in an empty sky.

As I averted my attention toward the dipper at her response, I could see what appeared to be two objects passing West to East.  Each object was a triangular arrangement of lights; white in color, not blinking, and about second magnitude.  They passed very near Mizar and Alcor, the southernmost object within a degree north.   The separation of the base lights of the triangle shape was almost equal to these previously mentioned stars, with the forward light about twice that separation.  Each object was about 4 degrees apart on a north-south line, and maintained that arrangement during the 45 seconds of observation.  They became too faint to track as they passed from 25 Boo to 36 Boo in Bootes.  There were no associated sounds.  I am an amateur astronomer, 50 years old.

April 16th, 2007, Brentwood, CA (East SF Bay Area)  Witness: 21 year old female  9:05 P.M. Lying in bed, I saw out my northeast-facing window what I first thought to be the reflection of a car headlight moving across the glass. It took me only a second to realize that the size, shape and movement of the light was all wrong and definitely not a reflection.  I got out of bed and was astonished to see a ball of orange light, emanating a sort of fiery glow.  I cannot stress enough the image of fire in this situation.   My first thought was that it was an airplane on fire in the distance or a flare, but it wasn’t falling and there was no smoke. Instead it moved from west to northeast in a very controlled motion.  When I determined that it was going slow enough that I would be able to alert my father and mother before it disappeared, I ran from the room.   Soon 4 of us were gathered on the front porch watching it move further away, getting smaller until it was only a pinprick of light and then gone. The weather was immaculate: clear skies and a very minimal amount of wind. The object made no sound and was visible to us for about 4-5 minutes. We debated who to call and finally decided to go to bed without doing anything. 9:15 P.M. I had just reentered my room and was in front of the window, opening my curtains a little more ""just in case"" when an even bigger ""orb"" came into sight from over my neighbors roof (the same direction as the first object.)   As far as size goes, it started out a little bit bigger than an aspirin held at arms length, gradually getting smaller as it moved further away.  I yelled for my family again and 4 of us ran out onto the porch once more.  My father snapped two pictures with a 35 mm (the film of which hasn’t been developed yet.)  This object did the exact same thing as the first - slowly fade into the northeastern sky - but seemed to move a tiny bit quicker, lasting around 3-4 minutes before it disappeared from sight. Our neighbors were outside and we cried, ""Are you seeing this?!"" They said it was like nothing they’d ever seen before. Back inside we called the National UFO Center in Davenport, WA and I spoke to a man and answered questions about what I had seen. He told me it was not a meteor and there were no scheduled missile launches in our area.  9:45 P.M. We were sitting down to write our own personal accounts when my youngest sister called out, ""It’s back!"" My entire family, this time including my other sister (making a total of 5 of us) stood on the porch staring in disbelief at the third ""orb.""   It behaved in an identical fashion as the first two.  Though the three did disappear in the same region of sky, they not disappear in identical places. Witness: 54 year old male   Approx. 9:05 P.M.  my daughter called me to come and look at a strange, glowing object in the sky.  I was in my bedroom upstairs and walked out of my room. There’s a window that looks out to the N.E. I saw an orange, glowing light moving slowly in the eastern sky.  It was clear night, no clouds. It appeared to be moving slowly away, getting smaller, but the light appeared to be pulsing and becoming dimmer. Not sure if it was because of distance as it moved away or was dimming.  We watched it for another few minutes.  I called my wife to come and see it. She saw it for a minute or so before it disappeared from view. We were all excited and mystified. It did not appear to be a plane and made no sound that we could hear. We talked about reporting it but decided we felt silly. I started to go back to bed. After another couple of minutes my daughter called out that she sees another one! I bolted out of my room in disbelief and witnessed another glowing object at 9:15 in the same location. I ran downstairs to run outside for a better unobstructed view. It seemed larger and very bright orange. It almost appeared to be on fire, like shimmering rising from a slow-moving, floating orb. I could not make out any details - only orange-red glowing as it moved from west to east. My daughter came up behind me from inside and handed me her 35 mm camera. I snapped 2 photos. We then called the Nat’l UFO Center in Davenport, WA. My daughter reported the incident to them on the phone.  Amazingly, my youngest daughter, who was able to see the 2nd orb was looking into the eastern sky and and yelled out that she sees another one! We thought she was joking, but we ran to the front door anyway and witnessed a 3rd identical object traveling in the same direction. We were somewhat alarmed by it by now. My neighbor was outside standing on his driveway, talking to a friend. I called over and said, ""C--, do you see that? What is it?""  He said he had never seen anything like it. We watched it disappear in the same direction after several minutes. Witness: 13 year old female  On April 16, 2007, I saw an orange fiery ball in the sky that I thought was a UFO. It started at about 9:05 and they were about 5 minutes long in the sky. My other 4 family members saw them in the sky. When I saw the second one it scared me and it looked like a ball of fire traveling northeast in the clear night sky. That one started at about 9:15. When I spotted the third one through my living room window, it was a little smaller than a full moon. When it traveled across the sky, it went left to right and then stopped. When it stopped it started to fade away. That was about 9:45 to 9:50 or 9:55. My dad got two shots of it with his camera.

It was about 9.55 p.m. PST.  My house faces NNE.  The planes approaching Orange County Airport approach my house from the NNE and go past North to my left to the NW to land at OC approximately 8-9 miles away.  Normally I can see the planes unaided and hear them as they descend. This night was overcast so I could hear some but not see them as they broke cloud cover once they had passed my house.  As I was standing on my driveway, I saw some blue light aloft to the North moving back and forth, almost flittering like a moth.  I initally thought it was a police helicopter.  This is a well populated suburb community and it's not unusual to see one of those things circling around.  What I thought was unusual was that it was moving more in a quick back and forth movement instead of what is usually seen as a slow circle.  Also, I could not see a strong search light or hear an engine sound.  It appeared that the object was 1-2 miles away.  I thought this was odd so I retrieved a pair of quality 20x binoculars that I keep hanging on a coat rack inside the front door.  What I saw raised the hair on the back of my neck.  These lights seemed to consist of a row of individual blue lights that first were traveling to the left.  As the object reversed direction, the object appeared to be first an ellipse and then a full circle that had maybe 24-30 individual blue lights around the perimeter.  It then traveled to the right and reversed the process again forming a circle at the end of its travel when reversing direction.  Its travel in each direction was maybe 3-5 seconds.  There were definitely no red/green port/starboard lights, only the blue perimeter lights and no strobe lights.  I watched this object for 2-3 minutes and I believe it was out there longer than that since I noticed it there soon after I initially stepped outside.  It finally disappeared into the cloud cover.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would come back but it was gone.  I don't have a working video camera and probably would not have had time to get it if I had.  I don't really want my name associated with this.  I'm a 55 year old engineer and I've never really believed that something like this could not be identified, but I have never seen anything like this.  I used to fly small aircraft so I have some experience with the shapes and types of various small planes.  BTW, the only thing I drank that night was a cup of tea and a glass of Metamucil so I was completely aware of what was happening.

What I would find crazy about this is if no one else saw it.

The object was very large; I would guess it to be about the size of a very large jumbo jet.  It was shaped like an isosceles triangle, with steady blue-white lights positioned at each of the points. The object seemed to be black in color and not extremely thick for its size, I would guess it to have been about 6-8 meters in thickness.  The most unusual characteristic of the object was a marked lack of engine noise.  I stopped the car, and got out to watch the object. I observed the object for about four minuets at about half a football field’s distance during which time the object slowly moved North East at seemingly moderate and steady pace, still without any real engine noise except a slight whirring noise.  I then returned to my car and went home unshaken by the experience but contemplating the unusualness of what I had just witnessed.

When almost immediately, I noticed an object that looked, to my first thought, like Saturn and it's rings.   I quickly dismissed this as A: the object appeared to be the size of the moon in the morning's sky, and it was far too low and to the north of us (appeared to be over an area following the Fraser River, or the mountains in behind Mission, BC, well to the north of us).   As we stopped at the intersection for a left turn, I watched the object closely as it slowly moved through the sky (moving west to east).  Noticing for the first time a single flashing light on the upper ceiling of the object (similar to those found on aircraft).  Other than this one flashing light on top, it was illuminated only by the rising sun (which was still blocked by mountains for us at ground level).   Drving along the main road through the city westbound, I kept watch between buildings for it.  My Fiance, who I'd pointed the object out to while stopped at the intersection, and I saw it continue slowly eastward.  The Second time that I got a good look at it, it had lost it's saturn effect, my guess is that it had been banking towards us at the time, and you could see the ring edge on.   I spotted the object a third time while driving, but we had driven far enough westward, and it moving eastward that the sunlight effect was't occuring anymore because of the object's position between the sun and ourselves.  It looked more like a dark blob in the dawn sky.   Belatedly, about a minute later, I recalled that my fiance had a camera phone and that I'd been too busy watching the object to even think that we could have taken a picture.  I've seen enough planes & jets & blimps in the many years I've lived in the city here, and I've never seen anything remotely like it. It was too slow to be an airliner, nor was it the correct shape.  With the annual airshow at the city's airport, I've seen everything from the Avro Vulcan to the Stealth Bomber.   I also rules out being some kind of blimp, as I've seen plenty of those every time the goodyear blimp has made flybys of the airshow.  We've also had our fair share of hot air balloons (Remax typically is the one flying around) but they're easy to spot because of the flame providing heat for lift.  I don't know what it was, hence I guess, the reason why they call them unidentified flying objects. But the usual suspects can pretty much be ruled out.  Short of it being some funky blimp or hot air balloon, which I've seen both and neither of which appears or behaves like this object did.   But I know I'll be keeping my eyes to the skies more frequently now.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,49.05030250696379,-122.29588941504178

We have called numerous individuals as well as several agencies without any help in return. During the day they appear on film and we have them recorded, yet to the plain ordinary eye they are not visible. When my wife and I first seen them we were filming our 6 year old son flying his kite when we first noticed them.  The same evening when this first occurred we had an experience that is still ongoing. At first we assumed that a child had a laser pointer, we seen a red laser enter into our master bedroom and literally bounced off our walls, our 6 year old son yelled at the same time and had the same red beam of light in his bedroom and that evening needless to say he slept with us.  We cannot explain this without coming across as insane, yet we are getting no help in regards to whom we have currently contacted. We now see these red beams during the day in our home and after trying to record them on film they disappear. Our son is petrified due to he stated that these red beams were talking to him and after we asked him what he meant he stated they were spelling out words as well as language to him.  I will not go into any detail as to what these beams have spelled out, we are in fear that it will get worse if even possible at this point in time. They claim to not be from Earth, furthermore they claim to do us harm.  We are at a dead end and ready to move and we are searching for anyone else in or around the Omaha area who has witnessed anything similar. These beams have been everywhere in our home and the troubling thing is what they spell out.  Again, in closing,  we only hope someone here might have had any similar problems with these types of beams and what have you done to stop them? We are one step away from moving. The language they have expressed through writing for a better word has been anything but friendly.

Then to their suprise it stopped moving and stayed there for about 5 minutes, then moved again in another direction. Every time it stopped we saw the light strobes coming out of it. Then we were standing by the street and a teen boy walked by and we asked him to look and he saw it with the lights coming out of it and said he never saw anything like that. We all laughed and said, ""us too"". Then, for more confirmation, I went to another nieghbors house also, to see if they had a telescope to investigate further. They did not, but they saw it too with the lights coming out and away from it but it was stationary at the time. They made some jokes about me smoking somthing, but a few minutes later it started to move again in the opposite direction. It moved, then they weren't joking anymore. They were freaking out too.

It was very high altitude as I had jet aircraft as well as the moon in the sky at the same time to use as a guage as to its height. I estimate the object to have been at ten to fifteen miles high. I had to strain to keep the object in my field of vision as I was in the swimming pool and I normally wear glasses. I observed the object approxmately fifteen minutes and during this time of observation the ufo moved only very perceptbly about a 45 degree trijectory from due east, from where it appeared,to south southwest when I was no longer to perceive it with the naked eye at about 18:50 hours. I had originally thought it could be a satelite of some sort but it didn't have a satelite or a weather balloons flight charcteristics at all.

This event occured around 8:30 pm near my home in Florida.   I was saying good bye to a friend of mine and we walked outside and talked for a few minutes and I was just observing the passing planes and happened to look Northward.  A plane caught my eye (I could make out the blinking navigational lights) and then near it I saw a smaller light resembling a star.  I could not make out if it was moving or not until the strangest thing happened. The light appeared to increase in brightness almost instantly and accelerate northward quickly.   I pointed for my friend to see and he watched it with me as it grew increasing brighter, acclerated in speed and then definately moved north and then made a curve off to the left(westard) at steady turn(then moving NorthnorthWest) until we both could only see it with our peripheral vision before it finally dissappeared. The light was definately in a higher atmosphere, because I couldn't hear and noises and I could not make out navigational lights. It moved rather smoothly to the north on and performed it's turn with ease.  I've seen shooting stars and this was moving way too slow, even when it acclerated and the shooting stars I've seen don't just steady turn, they have a basic straight course.  It's possible it could have been the afterburner of a jet engine, but my friend as well as myself could see the light dim before it increased into the vanishing white ball.   Another thing I would like to add was that there was no pulsation to the light, at least from my stand point, in Florida on a perfect evening with the right line of vision you can see miles. There were several planes in the air that night to make comparison to and none were acting in the manner this light was acting.

It then happened a second time less than a minute later, so I began to run toward where I might have a better vantage point, during which time the phenomenon occurred a third time, then did not reappear for approximately fifteen minutes. By this time I was standing between two fields and I could clearly see the horizon in the direction the objects appeared. Unfortunately, the objects began appearing much farther away, no more than ten degrees above the horizon NNW of my location in Palmyra. The lights would appear as if from a single source, then divide, forming a horizontal line of two to five distinct lights then descending a few degrees and vanishing. They were candle-flame in color, and appeared in this manner at least fourteen times in eight minutes, randomly covering an horizontal area of five or ten degrees.  I was able to take a camera phone picture of thirteen of these incidents.  There was a lot of air traffic at the time, and there is a small airport nearby, but these were not planes for obvious reasons. I was thinking perhaps they were come kind of emergency flare, however flares don't split like that, at least to my knowledge, and I should have seen the lights of the aircraft dropping them if they were flares. Also, as I said, the lights did not emerge from the sky in such a pattern indicating that they were being dropped by an aircraft; they would appear randomly within at most ten degrees of horizon. If they were being dropped, it would have been, in my opinion, a very fast moving aircraft following an erratic flight pattern at exceptionally high speed.  I did notice several other observers in the Harrisburg area reporting similar phenomena on this site. Perhaps the incidents are related.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,40.2923,-76.5909

On or about 8:40 PM, February 08, 2008, my 8 friends and I returned to my home and watched three objects appear in the western sky, one at a time. My home is located on the Pacific Ocean beach about 25 miles north of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and faces almost due West. The evening sky was clear and many stars were visible. At about 8:40 PM we noticed a bright orange colored object rising up from directly west over the ocean. We had an unobstructed view. The first one we spotted appeared to be some object burning up in the atmosphere as the light was not steady, but flashing more like a fire. Distance is hard to determine but I would guess that when first spotted they were 5-7 miles away and as they proceeded towards being overhead, they went further away. I immediately retrieved my 24 power telescope to get a better view. As the first one reached approximately 40 degrees from the horizon and appeared to be getting closer, I could see that it was cone shaped. It had 4 or 5 dark lines extending from the ‘nose’ towards the ‘rear’. It was heading in an easterly direction. When it was approaching 80 degrees, almost straight overhead, a couple of my friends shouted that there was another one coming from the same direction as the first one. I re-directed my telescope toward the second one and observed that it was similar to the first one. It appeared to be getting further away, diminishing in size, as it reached about 45 degrees off the horizon. It then stopped crossing the sky and remained in its current position for about 5-8 more minutes. A third object, similar in appearance, appeared coming from the same general direction as the two previous ones. I watched this one as it changed directions numerous times and seemed to approach the second one but not get too close. The general direction of its travels began as the others, from west to east, but it also turned toward the south and reversed direction as it approached the second one. It went back and forth changing directions 5-6 times and for about 10-30 seconds on each leg. At this time, I tried to re-locate the first one with no luck as it was diminishing in size and brightness. I returned to watch the third one for about 3 more minutes, until I could no longer see it. All three appeared to be of similar size and shape when we first spotted them. They all had coloration like that of an object burning up as it entered the atmosphere, very orange in color with the wide stripes extending from ‘front to rear’. The light emitted from them was flickering as a fire would, with occasional flashes of higher intensity. The flashes of fire were coming from the 'front' of the object. I hope that this is of some value to someone and of course, I hope that there are other sightings reported from this area with more detail.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

On Sunday, November 18, 2007, my partner and I observed three UFO's flying high in the late afternoon sky over Palm Springs, California. The sightings occurred at approximately 4:30 p.m. The crafts remained visible to the naked eye for about five minutes before disappearing.  We were in the downtown area of Palm Springs when the sighting occurred. I was the first to notice something unusual. I was looking up towards the moon (which was clearly visible to me at that hour) when I spotted an elongated boomerang, or triangular shaped craft flying in a southwest direction. At first, the object appeared to be flying in a straight line like a normal aircraft. It also seemed to be at about the same altitude that a commercial aircraft normally flies while at cruising altitude, approximately 25,000-35,000 feet. From that distance, I would estimate the size of the craft to be similar in size to a small to medium sized commercial aircraft.  While watching the unidentified craft for a minute or so, I noticed that it started to move in ways that normal aircraft don’t. It slowly came to a stop, suspended in midair like a helicopter. That’s when I pointed it out to my partner, who saw the object as clearly as I had. The craft then moved around its location sluggishly and, in what appeared to be, a somewhat erratic fashion. All of the sudden, two other identical craft came into view in close relative proximity to the fist craft. The three objects began to slowly “wobble” towards a center point. For about four or five minutes they leisurely moved around and, on occasion, become completely stationary. Once the objects reached their center point destination, they vanished from sight. It should be noted that the sky at that time of day was perfectly clear with exceptional visibility. Each craft was identical in size and shape to one another. Another unusual attribute of the crafts was that although they were shaped like a boomerang, they flew with the curvature to one side. In other words, the objects flew “sideways”. About the witnesses: I am a 47 year-old marketing executive and creative consultant to the motion picture industry. I hold a B.A. degree in Radio, Television, and Film from a major university in southern California.  I am an FAA licensed pilot certified to fly single engine aircraft.

While on top of Dante's View, a boy near me said to his mother, ""Hey mom, look, a UFO.  We should call the US Army.""   His mother didn't reply and only walked away, back up the hill toward the parking lot.  The boy watched for a few seconds and then walked away as well.  I started taking pictures with my film camera and then switched to my digital camera. The UFO was in the distance, but definitely over the valley itself.  Dante's View is almost directly across from Telescope Peak and looks directly down on Badwater Basin.  The object's distance from me was hard to gauge as the valley stretches across for miles and perspective can already be difficult.  The UFO was a black oval to my naked eye and hovered around.  It came from the south moving northward.  It made several circular motions while I took the pictures.  Before I could take more, the UFO began to descend slowly back toward the south.  I lost sight of it when a rock outcropping got in my way.  I quickly jogged around the rocks so I could see the rest of the descent (this took 10-15 seconds), but it had vanished from sight by the time I got around.  I'm not sure where it went, as it appeared to be hovering roughly over the center of the valley and was not descending fast enough to have gotten out of sight. I'm going to include pictures.  I took several, including some zoomed in.  In some you can see the foreground and the background.  I also have other pictures showing more of the foreground and background within ten minutes of the incident. Upon review of the photos, it is clearly an oval shape.  However, in one photo the oval appears to be tilted and there is clearly a lighter color (white or gray) on a side of it (it appears to be the top to me).

I spotted a very bright white light that was moving across the sky and pointed it out to my son and asked him if he thought it could be a satellite or an airplane. We both agreed it was far too bright and too close to be a satellite or airplane. Plus, it wasn’t making any noise. With the naked eye it appeared to be round in shape, but when I checked it out with my binoculars it looked more triangular. It continued to move across the sky from west to east. But what REALLY got our attention was when two much smaller circular lights flew right past it going the opposite direction and then appeared to circle around behind it. Surprisingly we weren’t really scared, but more interested than anything else. Could it have been some bizarre military flight, or was it truly a UFO? I’m convinced it was, even though no one really believes us. My son is a young teenager and I'm a late 40's business executive with no science background.

It appeared to be travelling in a slight zig-zag pattern and then stopped and hovered, I estimate between 5-10 miles away.   Shortly thereafter, a jet aircraft appeared moving very quickly and I believed that this might be an investigating fighter because of its speed but it continued right on past the red object. It was, I should point out, flying both higher and further away than the object. Within a matter of seconds of this passing, the object descended in a straight line below the trees in the neighborhood and out of sight. I grabbed my video recorder, jumped in my car and headed in that direction but did not find this object again. I have either been an AIr Force brat or active duty myself for all of my 45 years, I believe I know an airplane or helicopter when I see one.

Two white llights accelerating and changing directions in M31 binocular FOV observed from Mt. Pinos,"Chula Vista campground parking lot, Mt.

Pinos, CA Shape: Light Duration:15 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51215.html,"Two white llights accelerating and changing directions in M31 binocular FOV observed from Mt. Pinos Was observing and photographing all night at my usual dark-sky haunt on top of Mt. Pinos 8350 feet altitude in the Chula Vista campground parking lot.  About a dozen other astronomers were observing or doing astrophotography.   I was using my 15 X 70 binoculars (4.3 degrees TFOV) on top of my monopod/mount and was looking at M31, the Andromenda Galaxy, when I noticed two points of light enter the field of vision. They had no apparent diameter, similar to the field stars in the FOV.  I estimate their magnitude at about 8 or 9. They entered the FOV from the left (north-east) with one light leading the other by about half a degree.  At first they were almost on the same track, maybe just slightly offset.  Then the second following light accelerated and pulled abreast and below the first light.   At this time they were basically parallel with each other and about half a degree distance apart. I estimate their speed at about a half arc-minute per second. They stayed like that for about 2-3 seconds and were just below the galaxy.   Then the lower, second light accelerated slightly ahead of the first and then their trajectories started diverging with the lower light rapidly turning downward out of the FOV (eastward) while the top light started slowly rising (westward) out of the FOV.  Needless to say I was amazed at what I was seeing and was yelling to the rest of the crowd (some with binoculars) to quickly look at M31.  I was in a quandary as to which light to follow and I was wildly swinging from one diverging light to the other until I lost both.   Since I has lost them in the binoculars, I tried to see if I could see something with just my eyes.  I could not see anything near M31.  Limiting magnitude that night was the typical 6.1 for this location.  I am familiar with the behaviour of satellites as this is a very common sight at Pinos with the ISS, Intelsat, HST and Iridium constellation commonly visible.  It was not an Iridium satellite since the lights maintained their magnitude at all times with no dimming or brightening.  It was not any of the common satellites who usually have a much larger visual magnitude and always maintain the same speed and direction across the sky.  The lights had a much greater speed than other satellites that I have observed.  I have never witnessed a satellite changing accelerations and directions.  There were only the single points of white light.  I don't think they could have been extreme high altitude aircraft since I would think the only visible light from such aircraft would be their exhaust jet which at my observing location would have have been oblique to me.  Also if this was common high altitude aircraft then their speeds would have had to be very great at this long distance to account for my observations of extreme accelerations.  At this time I don't know what I observed.  Experimental military spacecraft or vehicles of LGM, I don't know, first time I saw anything out of the ordinary in the night sky. At least I have a story to tell now when the conversation turns to observed wierdness.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

It stopped moving east and thats when we noticed a red light not blinking, but ""scrolling"" across it.   After staring at it for a few more minutes it was confirmed from multiple people all observing that there were flashes of light, almost like fire flies dancing around it.  It was hard to count since they were not constant in their luminescence, however we did note their patterns etc.  They seemed to be all around it and the lights formed a larger sphere orbiting around the object which seemed to be some kind of EM field.  Everyone confirmed they saw this sphere of lights around the object.   The object made a sudden arc of altitude as it moved west.  The arc that it made in the sky would be about the size of the moon or so (.5-1 Deg).  After about another minute or 2 the object became smaller as it apparently moved north and gained altitude and it was finally lost in the incoming darkness.

Sunday, July 2nd, 2006 around 6:30 - 7:00 pm a storm was coming in, i went to go close my window and i glanced in the sky a few hundred feet over the building across the street and seen what i thought was a hot air balloon and thinking what are they nuts!?!? flying a balloon in Brooklyn? in a storm? then i got a better look as it flowed towards me and realized, holy $h#* what is that?!?!it was triangular in shape, but reminded me of a stingray fish. very aero dynamic, it was porcelain white in color very shiny, had a bright orange glowing border, and a metallic sphere orb attached at the center bottom of the craft. turned on it side slowly hovering back and forth carefully. all of a sudden a bolt of lightning came sideways from a cloud and hit the metallic sphere. in an instant it made a air burst sound, completely turned bright red orange, then gone. at first i thought it exploded so i kinda jumped back. but it just like magic, disappeared. i freaked out because i always imagined if i did see one, it would be at night, all the way up in the sky flying around with lights. never would i have expected it to be this way. i mean broad daylight, just above the buildings. and i seen it if it were the size of a baseball! right in front of my eyes! everyone should have seen it, it was very large and right there!! i can't sleep. i can't stop thinking about it. i can't stop going to the window out of curiosity. i was afraid to tell anyone for the reason of people thinking im on drugs, or am just crazy! that's what i would have thought! thank god my girlfriend heard the sound. later on around 10:00 pm i went to the store, i look up in the same area, and see a white orb floating very slow and straight towards the gowanas. i said this can't be! i shook my head and convinced myself it was a bird or something. then i look again and see a black orb leading 2 more white orbs in a triangle formation and said i must be going crazy!. i walk fast toward the pizza store and the guy asked ""you ok?"" i said no but if told you i would just be a nut so forget it. the guy said i tell you something people think im crazy that last week i saw a ufo in bensonhurst. i almost had a break down and got this feeling of being in like the twilight zone or dreaming. this cant be happening i said. i told him that is exactly why i am freaking out. so he tells me to tell his friends at work the story i just explained and they all look real scared. they say word for word it was the same story except for the lightning  hitting it. and for a week they were all abusing him about it. so we basically felt a huge sigh of relief. says that his brother seen it as well but did not hear the noise he heard which was strange and could tell that confused him the most. so i go home bugging out and just see and search google not expecting anything to come up, but to my surprise i was not the only one. very similar stories and descriptions all over. my gut tells me it is dimensional. like beings from other dimensions or something. i mean the way it just flashed gone!! like a light switch. the craft honestly was beautiful! perfect! floated like a balloon. like it weighed nothing. i think it was searching for the lightning to give it that charge boost or refueling. it was just moving in a way that it seemed to like get the right spot. like fine tuning a radio station. or harpooning a fish. what i saw was surreal. i mean right there!! in front of me and my eyes! in real time! wow i can't stop picturing it! it all happened in like not even 1 minute which seemed like 10 min. i was speechless and in shock at the moment. lost for words. and was shaking like a leaf. never would i think i would be one of those people who had a story like this to tell. now i am one of the so called crazy ones. all i have is my sketch of the craft and in my view is a very good one. i know i will always be lookin in the sky from now on. its not the question anymore if they really exist, but what does earth, or the 3rd dimension do they seek or need.  and is the goverment involved? because now i do reserch and see that there are hundreds of sightings per year!! and we deny them. are they here to help, or destroy? too many questions i now have and definitly wont be sleeping tonight! wow is all i keep saying. for the records i got this impression, or feeling that they or it knew i saw this. for what ever reason. hands down the most shocking thing i ever seen. this exp. made me a skywatcher.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

At first I thought it was some sort of plane, perhaps a small aircraft flying straight towards my direction.  After a couple of minutes I noticed that the object appeared to be larger and brighter, at this point I realized that the craft’s lights seemed odd since none  appeared to be what I’ve come to recognize as conventional aircraft strobe lights. The lights did change either color or brightness, I’m not certain which, it may have been doing both. However, they did not appear to be those of an airplane and I  then thought it may be a helicopter, but did  think it would be odd to see one near this location at just over 3:30 am. As I continued driving towards it I fixated on the object since it appeared to remain stationary over I-88, and I didn’t seemed to be getting any closer to it. It did appeared to be increasing and decreasing in size from time to time, it also became brighter and seemed more colorful. After what might have been 5 minutes I noticed that the objected moved in a semi-circular fashion. It appeared to have flown away in an upwards direction and then circle back towards my direction while remaining higher in the sky than it had previously been.  It moved in this manner a couple of times and was very easy to keep track of since the sky was absolutely clear.   In this stretch of high-way there aren’t many lights and the moon was no longer present. The sky was absolutely dark except for all the bright stars and the craft that was flying/hovering around. A moment later the craft was almost directly over my vehicle, at this point I came to almost a complete stop, pulled onto the shoulder and rolled my window down to get a better look at the object.  I became a bit anxious at this point since I still did not recognize this flying object, and it seemed to be moving in a fashion that it just doesn’t seem to fit any conventional aircraft that I’m familiar with. As I was looking almost directly up at the object, I could clearly see several lights that appeared to be located under a solid structure. The lights were different colors and I believe some seemed to be located around or near the edge of the object while other lights seemed to be fixated directly under the object.  It remained in this position for a few seconds, perhaps 10, and then appeared to ascend straight up. I assumed it ascended because it became smaller. Then all the lights appeared to have faded at the same time and then the object simply disappeared into a completely clear sky. I did not loose sight of it because it increased it’s altitude to the point where I lost sight of it and it did not fly off in another direction, or through a cloud, even though it pretty much appeared to have done just that . It simply dimmed quickly and vanished. Again, there were no clouds present what so ever and I was able to see stars in the exact spot of the sky the object had just occupied. Soon after I saw a couple of aircraft circling the area. For the last three years I have driven this road nightly five to six times a week from Chicago Illinois to Iowa City and back. I have never seen anything remotely resembling this object, and while I have seen occasional small aircraft from time to time, none have ever behaved anywhere near this manner. I’m also able to recognize how planes of all sorts generally appear in the night sky because first of all I attended flight school for 2 years at Lewis University in Romeoville Illinois, and I later worked at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport for ten years. I actually worked as the Night Hotel Manager at the Hilton Chicago O’Hare located directly in the middle of the airport itself. It’s a ten floor building. It’s the tallest structure except for the control tower. I mentioned this because I routinely spent my break on the roof of the hotel seeing aircraft land, take off, and fly holding patterns a countless amount of times. I also lived only ten minutes away from the airport itself.  So I’m very familiar with how aircraft look and fly and generally behave in the night sky and I’m convinced that what I witnessed on this Tuesday morning of January 2008 was not a conventional aircraft. There were other vehicles in the area, not many, but I’m sure others saw this object as well. Please let me know, via e-mail, if you are aware of any other reports regarding this incident  Thank You,",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

January 15th, 2008 at 6:15 am in Hamilton, Texas I was taking my dog outside to let it use the bathroom. I looked to the East, where I have seen objects appear in the past, and I saw a light that was not a light in the usual constellation patterns. I look at the sky in this direction every time I take my dog outside, so I know right away if a light is appearing in a spot where there is normally not a light/star.  It moved around a bit, and then grew very bright, like a car headlight coming at me, and was very large, then dimmed to the brightness of a star, and then repeated the sequence again at least 3 or 4 times, while hovering and moving about slowly in random directions. It looked to be about at the height that a helicopter flies, but it definitely was not moving the way I have seen helicopters maneuver. It was about 4 miles away from where I was.  I was in the US Army for 6 ½ years, so I have seen quite a few varieties of aircraft, and know when something is moving in the sky, in a non-traditional aircraft way.  Off to the right (South) of that light, there was a smaller object, which had a small white light in the center, and a ring of flashing colored lights across the center of the object. The flashing lights were mostly blue and red. This smaller object moved around in random directions more than the larger object did.  I watched it for about 20 minutes and then went back into the house.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,31.7126,-98.2143

I looked at it for a bit and decided that it was probably a star- but it just didn’t seem like the right place for one- not too mention I didn’t see any other stars.  So, I just watched it as I traveled east.  As I headed east, I went onto the Basin Bridge, also known as the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway.  Light began to break and I watched the light, I had also thought maybe it was an airplane, but it had no Navigational Lights and it should have passed me by now.  At about 6:40 am, I was nearing the end of the bridge about the 134 mile marker and there was more light out side, when I could see that it was cloudy above this “light”, in fact it was very cloudy with the high altitude clouds.  And this light was actually not all that far up in the air…  It was stationary and I watched it until I was under it, I moved the truck onto the shoulder and I could not see it anymore, I looked in the mirror and I still could not see it.  The area that it was over, is also the same area where the Natural Gas Pipe blew up in December. (I think that’s the right month.)  This is at mile marker 135 on the I-10.

This event happened on Tuesday, January 15, 2008  I was driving on the 30 Freeway in Highland, California at about 9:10 AM heading west past Victoria Avenue. I noticed something that looked like silver sphere hovering in the air to my left, which would be southwest from my location, and I tracked it from my 11 o’clock position to about my 7 o’clock position as I drove in the number one (fast lane) at about 75 mph.  There were no visible rotors, blades or cockpit. It looked solid to me and it was a good distance (1 mile?) away with a good amount of height (300 -500 feet?). I originally estimated its size at about half that of a VW Beetle, but I later changed my mind after comparing the size of the old Norton water tower, which is plainly recognizable as a very large water tower in the distance. I now think the sphere was larger – maybe 10 feet in diameter.  The object caught my attention because it hovered in the sky much higher than a streetlight or radio antenna and did not look like a helicopter, airplane or balloon. In my opinion, the object had no visible means of propulsion (blades/ intake) and no visible cockpit. It was not an obstruction caused by moving traffic or other nearby obstructions. It was in the distance and initially not moving. To me, this is an odd phenomenon, especially on a clear day. As I observed, I watched it maneuver upwards in a reverse “J” – it must have gained in elevation about one or two hundred feet in less than a second. It then stopped or slowed dramatically at the peak of its ascent and moved to the right a bit.  I looked at the object for about three seconds before I lost visual contact due to moving traffic. I could no longer “spot” it because it was now behind me to my left. I looked at a map of San Bernardino and it looked as if it was in the direction of the old Norton Air Force Base (San Bernardino International Airport). I had to take my eyes off the object because I almost drove off the freeway.  At the moment of this observance, I was in the number one (far left) lane with no obstructions from westward traffic or streetlights. My car was clean with no spots on the windshield, there was no glare from the sun and I was sober and alert. The entire event (while short) caused me enough stress to almost crash my car and I immediately called my family and friends to tell them what I saw. I don’t think it was a weather balloon because of the extremely fast movements (stop-maneuver-stop). I don’t know what it was; it was an unidentified flying object. I noticed a change in color from silver or grey to dark grey or black - this was in my opinion caused by the object's shadow, but I'm not 100% sure.  I am a 32-year-old married white male that has experience in practical special effects for film and television, I have 20/15-eyesight with no physical impairments and I am an avid outdoorsman.

It was extremely fast and then seemed to fade out similar to a meteor.  However, even being a bit disoriented, I could tell the light was low.  It was very low and very very fast.

It almost seemed like a lighthouse beacon. Approx. 12 seconds later the same flash occurred in the same exact spot.  As clear as it was, no craft could be seen.  After the same time interval, there was another flash and at that point  I alerted the other two men to direct their attention at that specific point in the sky and just watch.  The younger man, self-admittedly has bad eyesight and his glasses were in the house.  The older gentleman witnessed the flash occur again.  Together, we watched this same flash in the sky in the same exact position (5) more times.  The older gentleman, an admitted skeptic was fairly amazed.  After the last flash was witnessed, it just dissappeared (stopped flashing) entirely. It didn't seem to be too high or far away. (A total guess would be 1000' high and perhaps 1 mile away). There were no other lights seen. The object had not moved laterally, closer or further during the entire sighting.

We arrived at the fishing place at about 4:00PM.  The sky was clear, and it was very windy.  It wasn't too hot because of the wind.  At that time, not too many people were catching fish.  The tide was going out into the Gulf, and quicker as each hour passing thus creating a swift current in the boating channel.  Around 8:00PM, darkness  began.  Stars also began appearing.  When it got dark, the fish bites became more regular rather then far between.  I was fixated on this large star located due east, probably a planet because it was so large.  Around 9:00PM while glancing now and then at this large star, I noticed  star like object appear near the large star. At first, I thought another star was appearing as the night time sky above was slowly rotated over us.  My thoughts then changed to possibly a plane approaching us, but if it was a plane, it wasn't the normal white light that a plane normally projects forward as it fly in the sky.  At one point while I was watching this object get closer to our position which I estimated the object was at least five miles away, I thought I saw it jitter up and down.  I squint with my eyes thinking maybe the wind was tossing me around a little thus causing me to see this object jiggling up and down slightly.  That didn't help, the object still appeared to be jiggling around almost as in sharp jerks of up, down, and sideways motion.  I called out to my friend who was intensely fishing, ""Do you see that star""?  She was almost ignoring me when she finally look up at me and saw me pointing to the star like object, then she glanced at the star like object. I then said, ""I think it! s an UFO "".  She looked at it for a few seconds then went back fishing not saying a word since a fish was tugging at her pole which she caught. When I first saw this object, it was about the same size as the star like planet, but slightly smaller.  Then something very odd happen which I now changed my mind of it being a star or plane. The object was probably about two or three miles away at about 5,000 feet in altitude from our position when it made a wide turn to the north.  If it was a plane, technically, I shouldn't have longer seen its headlights.  Not only that, I should have seen its strobe lights flashing to indicate that it was a plane.  No identification lights were seen.  And it still look like a star.  The altitude the object was at was extremely way too low for it to be a satellite.  The alarm bells went off inside me: UFO.  I always carry a camera in my car and luckily, the battery was still charged, and I haven't used up all of the digital space.  I quickly walked to the car and grab the camera. I could have quickly took some pictures in automatic mode, but I didn't trust that the camera would take a picture in that mode, especially with the flash possibly occurring and distorting the picture.  I quickly search for the night time mode of available light on my camera knowing that I should get a  picture in that mode, but forgot about the shutter speed, it was too was slow.  I found the object in the sky now looking at its backside which it is also getting further away from me at the speed of a slow moving jet.  I took the first picture shot and I was stun because the shutter was staying opened too long, so I tried as best as I could to hold the camera steady.  After about a second, the stutter closed.  I was really worried that the shutter would stay open for about five seconds.  Anybody who has ever tried to take night picture could probably tell you what will happen if you hold the camera while the shutter is too slow.  I had no time to change the mode, so I took another picture holding the camera as steady as possible.  I was able to get four pictures before I could no longer see the object in the monitor. While I was taking the pictures, one of the fishermen look at me and then looked at the direction I was taking the picture.  He noticed the object and asked me, ""What is it""?  I replied, ""Probably an UFO"".  He looked back at it again then looked at me strangely then continue on fishing.  For the rest of the night, he just ignored me as if I was a fruit cake or a nut. People, I just don't understand while some people can't believe that UFO's can be possible.  Some worried that by believing UFO's are possible may affect their religious beliefs.  I'm religious, but it hasn't affect by beliefs.  As one person said to me, ""I'll believe UFO's are real when one lands on my front door steps and knocks on my front door.""  I'm not a fruit cake, but a very well educated person with a open mind, not closed as of some people.  Something is flying in our skies, and its not just a plane, balloons, kites, meteorites, birds, etc.   And the government needs to get involved in explaining some of these flying object because I beginning to think they are UFOs.   Picture of what I have taken that night is being sent via email. Not great pictures, but it something. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source.

With darkness nearing, the storm was slowly drifting my way. I suddenly caught a movement to my left, and looked just as an extremely bright white orb came cruising in from the SW, approaching the storm.  It moved fast, but began to slow down as it approached the storm.  As soon as I thought it had stopped, it moved north along the western edge of the storm IN AN ARC, taking about two or three seconds to cover at least 5 miles.  Then, as soon as it looked like it had stopped, it moved away at an extremely high rate of speed.  It stunned me because of how the brightness was so much more intense than any plane lighting I’ve seen before, then stunned me by how it moved.  Wow.  But that wasn’t all. While I could still see stars overhead of me (the storm hadn’t blocked them out yet), a smaller, dim orange/red orb just appeared beneath the high crest of the creeping cel.  It was like a light had just come on.  The thing was, it just hovered there for a good minute, motionless, maybe a couple thousand feet up and a mile to my NE.  The storm moved over and around it, so I finally lost sight of it. Incidentally, a lot of planes appeared in the area immediately after I lost sight of the last object, and I could later see a chopper flying around shining a spotlight up into the clouds!  Quite an unexpected treat.  The first light in particular, though, made me feel very uncomfortable.  It was only a little closer and lower than the second one, and it didn’t move, nor look, like anything I’ve seen before.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,47.2724,-119.59000000000002

See addendum below.  PD)) Photographed triangular object moving slowly 30'-50' over Tacoma narrows heading north: 2min duration. I’m a photographer.  I was on the walkway along the beach at Titlow Beach Park in Tacoma, Washington between 8:30 and noon 24 January 2007.  I was there for the purpose of photographing trains on the BNSF tracks that run along the shoreline.  While waiting for trains I photographed cormorants perched on pilings just offshore using a Nikon D80, Nikkor 70-200mm lens with a Nikkor TC2EII teleconverter. There was a varying layer of fog over the area during this time period with the sun occasionally shining through.  While looking for a good shot of the cormorants I saw two bright reflections coming through the fog (looking west across the water).  At first I thought them to be reflections from windows on a house across the narrows on Point Fosdick.  But as I watched the reflections were moving slowly northward.  I estimate they were moving about 5 mph. I zoomed my lens to 400mm and looked at the reflections through the camera-lens.  Through the lens I saw that the reflections were coming from two rectangular surfaces on a triangular shaped object.  The object appeared to be roughly 30’-50’ above the surface of the water.  I watched it for about two minutes.  It was difficult to judge the distance above the water due to the fog obscuring the far shoreline.  I estimated the object to be a half mile away.  I wondered if I was just seeing the top of a barge or tug but I could see nothing below the triangle which I could see fairly well.  I shot two photographs of the object.  In subsequent review of the images I can discern nothing below the triangular object. I heard no sound that I could attribute to the object although I could hear traffic noise from the Narrows Bridge a mile to the north.  After taking the two photos I looked around to see if there was anyone nearby to ask if they had seen the object.  There was nobody nearby and when I looked back the object was gone.  I continued to look out across the water for the next five minutes or so and did not see the object again.  I specifically looked farther to the north to see if this was a barge or tug and did not see anything even though the fog was thinner in that direction and I could clearly see the Dockwise, the bridge deck carrier ship anchored under the bridge. ((ADDENDUM #1 OF 2)) Here are the two original images I photographed 24 Jan 2007 of a triangular object moving slowly northward over (estimate 30’-50’) the Tacoma narrows.  Photos taken westward from the shoreline along Titlow Beach Park, Tacoma Wa toward Point Fosdick. ((name deleted)) I’m really hoping someone can identify this object so that it will no linger be ‘unidentified’ to me. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #2 OF 2)) Hello, I really thought I’d seen and photographed a UFO yesterday 24 Jan 2007.  I emailed the two original images to this email address yesterday. I spent several hours yesterday enhancing the images using photoshop and consulted with some photographer friends of mine.  We came to the conclusion that I had become disoriented in the fog and my perception of where the far shoreline was in my photos was incorrect.  We have also come to the conclusion that what I photographed was in fact something floating IN the Tacoma narrows rather than something moving ABOVE the narrows.  Our best guess is that it is a partially sunk dock that has broken away from its original mooring. I went back out to the location this morning and using the same camera, lens and focal length re-shot the scene from the exact same vantage point using the same two pilings as reference. I’ve enclosed a photoshopped image of my now tentatively identified ufo with a line marking where the far shoreline really was (upper line) and another line (lower) to indicate where I had thought the far shoreline was in the fog.  I superimposed today’s image over yesterday’s to locate the lines. I’m very sorry to have taken your time and even sorrier that I filed a report when in fact what I saw was not a UFO.  Please know that I did not do this as a hoax; at the time I really thought that what I saw was slowly floating 30’-50’ feet above the water.  Also, until I had the chance to enhance the image using photoshop (unfortunately after I’d made my call and report) I could not make out the details of the object I’d seen with my eyes. Again, I’m sorry to have taken your time.  Can you please remove the report I made from your database?

My sister sighted unusual lights in the sky about 10 miles West outside of the community of Leupp, AZ.   The lights came from the southwest and I noticed it flew east while going in a 3-mile wide circumference circling around our car.  It circled our car about four times.  The only 3 lights on the craft were in a triangular shape always the same distance from each other.  The lights were yellow and did not blink at all.  At 7:50 p.m.  I was still watching the lights.  We were 3 miles outside of Leupp.  The lights were still doing its circular turns in a counterclockwise direction while we were headed east.  The craft came down to a low altitude as it flew over the Leupp Public School.  I noticed that the outline of it was distinguishable to a disk with 4 lights, equal distance from each other on the circumference of it.  Then all of the lights went out as it flew over the community and one light came on in the middle.  I saw the craft was about twice the size of the school gym at the school.   As it passed over the community it turned on its side and kept going toward the East in a straight line. At 8:04 p.m. I got home.   It was still headed east and starting to make the circles again with the one light in the middle.  I saw 2 jets intercept and follow it east out of sight.  The lights made no sound even when low to the ground but you could clearly hear the sound of the jets.   At 8:08 p.m. the lights looped around and went back over the community.  I noticed that the craft had 5 lights on it, 4 around it and the last light in the dead center of it.  The craft then headed east and out of sight at 8:35 p.m. At about the same time a larger jet showed up and my dad said that it looked like they were doing aerial refueling as small jets would come close behind it and then leave toward the East where the lights had disappeared.

In the early evening of 01/24/07, around 20:00 hours (8:00 pm Eastern Standard time), thousands of local residents began calling into local news stations and the local police call center to report a bright, color-changing object in the sky.    As reports continued to be filed, the magnitude of this occurrence began to be more fully understood.  People within a several hundred mile radius (myself included) witnessed a high velocity blue light, moving across the sky in a southern direction, leaving a trail behind it.  This ""light"" changed in color from blue, to White, to green.   From my vantage point, the light (at this point was green in color) seemed to take a sharp dive toward the ground and was lost behind the tree line.  Shortly before it reached the tree line, a smokey or hazy effect surounding the light became visible.  The sky was partly cloudy that evening, and the light seemed to pass between myself and the clouds upon its descent.  [Note:  This haze may have been the light passing through a low cloud, giving it a smokey look...it happened very fast, and the refraction of light in cloud vapor may very well be the source of the haze.]   The national weather service has begun investigating, but so far has not yielded any results.  There are various reports of Government entities in the area including FBI and NSA, but no comments or official statements have been released thus far.   The Greenville/Spartanburg Airport has not released any information as to a possible radar tagging of this object, and anyone official that could possibly verify the presence of something in the South Carolina skies that night has remained annoyingly mum.   Those of us that witnessed the event all agree that this object was far to bright and concentrated to be weather related, and the nature of its movements, and the brilliance of the light that was emitted, lead all of us to believe that it was not an airplane, or known  aerial craft.   The presence of these government agencies in our relatively small southern town has raised a few eyebrows.   Was this a UFO?  I have no clue, but I have never seen anything like it, and I am anxiously awaiting an official answer/report on the phenomenon.

Charlotte Observer, The (NC) January 26, 2007 Section: MAIN Edition: ONE-THREE Page: 1A     WHAT WAS THAT LIGHT IN THE SKY? UNKNOWN FREAKY ORB DREW EYES, IMAGINATIONS ACROSS AREA   Earthlings, you've had an otherworldly experience, a cosmic encounter.  About 8 p.m. Wednesday, something peculiar flashed in the sky - something twinkly, something colorful, something eye-catching. Something strange. And blue. Or green. Or blue-green.  ""Bright blue-green ball with a white tail,"" says one man from Shelby, who spotted it just west of Blacksburg, S.C., after dinner at a Steak House.  ""A greenish-like light low in the sky,"" says a woman, driving home from church with her kids near Matthews. ""We thought a small plane or helicopter was going to crash.""  ""A slow-moving bluish glow,"" says a man from Polkton and who watched it while soaking in his hot tub.  ""Large, bright green ball,"" says another man, who was headed to Chick-fil-A in Gastonia with his wife and four children after church. ""Had a haze about it.""  ""Almost looked like a flare,"" reports a lady, who was on Interstate 485. ""Kind of creepy.""  Venus, perhaps? It's often a suspect in UFO sightings, particularly when it's as bright as it is right now.  Not Venus. It vanished beneath the horizon about 7 p.m.  Stricken plane?  Nope. All aircraft accounted for.  Space junk? Errant satellite?  Negative, says NORAD. No re-entries of the sizable man-made objects they track.  OK. So ... alien object?  Bingo. But not the E.T. variety.  ""A fireball,"" says the observatory director and astronomy professor at Appalachian State University in Boone.  Based on the reports, the director believes it was an unusually bright meteor that burned up about 30 miles high in the atmosphere somewhere above Charlotte. Sightings came from more than 100 miles away.  Many witnesses say the light appeared to fizzle at the end and break into pieces, making it a special kind of fireball called a bolide. In the universe of meteors, they're A-List entertainers, known for their splashy finales.  Each day, an estimated 4 billion meteors burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Most are the size of sand grains, but rocks tumble in, too. NASA estimates that the Earth packs on several tons a day in meteors.  Some witnesses who contacted the Observer on Thursday wondered whether it could be debris from the recent anti-satellite test by China.  Probably not - but maybe, says a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command near Colorado Springs, Colo., which tracks satellites and space junk - everything from lost screwdrivers to astronaut gloves. He says he's been getting an unusually high number of calls this week about things spotted in the sky.  China's satellite-zapping exercise has probably increased space litter by about a million pieces, making it nearly as untidy as Interstate 77 in Charlotte.  ""It's anybody's guess,"" the spokesman says, ""what direction this stuff has gone.""",2007-02-01T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

Unable to look at the lights for a prolonged period of time while driving and so as not to alarm my son I initially thought the lights must be that of approaching planes landing gear.  As I continued to glance from the road to the sky to my right, I realized the lights were not moving, were very bright, and appeared to be over one another like a bright landing tower pole, only they were in mid air. The lights were very bright golden yellow in the center throughout and tipped on opposite ends in red, and were stationary non flashing lights.  The brightness of the light around the objects appeared to blur at the edges.  These lights appeared to resemble a long thin backwards K.  The lights appeared large in size, each K leg spanning approximately 30 to 50 feet and the lights appeared very low to the ground (less than ½ to one mile up in the sky.)   As I reached the Eastgate exit, the top light object began to lift up slightly, then appeared to tip completely sideways and disappeared in a northeast direction very quickly.  The object disappeared from view within 3 seconds.  The 2nd light object remained stationary.  As I made my way towards Factoria; I pulled off into the Korean restaurant parking lot and faced the car northeast to better observe the remaining light.  By this time I had exhausted all logical possibilities, such as weather balloons, Boeing testing aircraft, or satellites, and had to admit to my son that I didn’t know what they were. My sons view was obstructed by the parking lot trees and so I decided to venture further toward Factoria as the road parallels the freeway all the way there.  As I reached the summit of 36th Street (near the Bellevue Community college over ramp) I pulled over and dialed 911 and gave the description of my observation to the dispatcher and they referred me to the National UFO Hotline.  I then dialed the hotline, (bear in mind the light object remained stationary during this entire time.)   Just as I began to relay my story to the hotline, the light object hovered straight up slowly, paused for a moment, then moved upward and left (imagine the pattern of left side of a Y in a broken movement).

I then turned on my police scanner and the dispatch was getting numerous 911 calls (around 30 from what I heard) from people in the area. All reporting a bright blue flash that came with the blasts. From the calls it seems to be that the callers ranged about a 1/2 mile in distance.  The Police scanned the area for 2 hours. And also contacted the Power Companies to see if any transformers had blown. All seemed to be ok, and the Police could not pin point the area of the blast.

The evening of February 5, 2007 at approximately 7:15 PM my wife had stepped out onto the front porch to smoke a cigarette. She was facing east with her back to the front door when she saw lights moving above and to the left of her in the sky. The lights were to the north of our house approximately 200 yards and appeared to her to be about 200 feet in the sky. She noticed them as they cleared the roofline of our house.  The moon on this evening rose around 9:15 PM so this was the darkest part of the night. We live in a very rural part of the county so there are very few lights and almost no noise except for the occasional coyotes and dogs barking. There were no vehicles on the nearest road during the sighting. The air was clear.  My wife called to me through the front door. As I stepped out on the porch I immediately saw the lights tracking due east. My immediate impression was that the object was very large due to the spacing of the lights and the way the lights slowly, consistently tracked without any variation in speed or direction. At no time during our observation were we able to discern any physical form.  The night was absolutely still. I thought I could hear a faint sound like a commercial jet way out in the distance. It was like a slight wavering rumble, just barely discernable. I wasn’t sure the sound was emanating from the lights so I quickly scanned the sky for aircraft marker lights but none were seen. During this event no dogs barked which is remarkable in it’s self.  As you consider the line of travel, there were two lights in the rear oriented much like taillights. These lights where about 3 feet wide by 4 feet tall and 20 feet apart. They had square corners and were flat. They shown like frosted glass with yellow incandescent light coming from within. They were at a medium glow and no light reflected from anything structural around them.  About 4 feet above the right taillight, and about 10 feet to the right, there were 3 more lights. These were about 1 foot square with tight radius corners much like a passenger jet window. These were spaced about 7 feet apart horizontally. The line they formed to the right, and forward of the taillights, gave me the impression they were mounted on a curved surface. They were facing the 4 o’clock position and were the same color and intensity as the taillights.  I grabbed some binoculars I keep by the front door and we proceeded to watch the object as it continued its track low and slow. I had to move around to keep a line of sight through the trees. I noted at its most distant observation the 3 window lights were situated so that the center light was above the right taillight. I didn’t see them move, I just noticed they were in a different position.  This event covered a span of 2 to 3 minutes. We estimated the speed of the object to be 35 to 45 MPH.",2007-02-24T00:00:00,44.1066,-120.66420000000001

The then asked the angle of the objects relative to the perceived horizon, and she reported that they were between twenty and thirty degrees above it, meaning that they were at relatively low altitude. She also informed me that the objects appeared to be in the vicinity of, or over, a local park at Sandy Lane (Lat: 50o 57’ 55.7” N / 1o 18’ 11.7” W), a former gravel pit, now grassed over, and that they were maneuvering around in the sky in a smooth motion, with one or more of the objects repeatedly descending smoothly and then ascending. While she watched the objects formed up into an equilateral triangle formation and maintained it until they were lost from sight into low, heavy rain and ice clouds, which had been moving through the area all day.

Two minutes of video has been recorded on a cell phone showing a stationary and erratically flashing bluish light. At approximately 9:40 a small blue light seemed to approach the flashing object from below and roughly east. At this point the larger stationary light ceases flashing and is replaced by a dim blue light at a constant brightness, and begins to travel roughly west, and away (and out of my view) from the approaching object – which also changes course, leaving the two lights moving in separate directions, almost simultaneously. It should be noted that the first, larger object/light had flight characteristics similar to a helicopter (though no sound was observed). The cell phone footage taken clearly shows the object as being stationary for the better part of two minutes. The footage also shows the light as flashing erratically and alternating between blue and possibly light green. At 10:02PM, a third object was observed. This time a neighbor witnessed. We both agreed that it was large, and didn’t behave or sound like any plane we knew of as it flew very low and very slow with only a very slight humming sound. It was observed in the distance as hovering initially by myself. The neighbor observed it only after it began moving east from roughly the same area as the original lights were observed at 9:39-9:40PM. This object flew approximately 1-2 miles from our vantage point (near highways 55 and 540, and at approximately 1,000 ft. It traveled no faster than 80-100 mph as a rough estimate. We observed this object as having approximately 6-7 lights. A bright yellowish green light in front, three or more red lights around its center, and two flashing blue lights near the rear. It disappeared behind a row of trees after approximately 1-2 minutes. Given the relative proximity to RDU Airport, we agreed that it could possibly have been some sort or plane.

I am an avid sky watcher so I know quite a bit about the night sky. I reguarly read Astronomy magazine and know what I am looking at and what to look for more than most. clear night with nothing blocking a nice view of the stars and planets and satalites above. I know a satalite when I see one as the spin and reflect the light of the sun as they go accross the sky. I know the space station as I point it out to my son early morning.  This is what my wife, my son and I saw:  As I was pointing out  the most visible of objects in the night sky like Mars we focused all of our attention on Mars it is clear as can be also very bright and red.  It was not moving at all as planets only can move as fast as the earth can spin.  Mars is what we really knew we were looking at.   Until it began to move in an od fassion from above to the North first slow almost un-noticable then abruptly it began an Easterly path for about 15 seconds slowly then rapidly began a southerly path before moving West then East again.  This is od very od planets, stars, satalites and Earthly airborn objects do not as we know yet move in this fassion yet.  The altitude of tje object apeared to be high so high it was mistaken orriginaly for Mars.  We all know Mars doesnt move from a stationary position above head directly to the North, East, South then West then East again.  The movement from each direction was abrupt and smooth with a clear scense of thought behind each action.  Nothing in nature can cause stars to move like this, planets or even satalite to move like this.   Again the motion was stationary directly overhead 30 seconds for argument sake then slow movement to the North 15 seconds then to the East abruptly 15 seconds then to the South abeuptly for 15 seconds then to the West abruptly foe 15 seconds then to the East again abruptly for 1 minute.  This one minute East path was the final direction of the object after that 1 minute East the object began to speed up first slowly picked up speed then faster and then faster then even faster appearing to move East and get higher in altitude until disapearing before our eyes not over the horizon but up up and out of sight.  No clouds to hide behind no other thing up in the sky to mistake it for.  This is what I saw my wife saw and my son who is very young saw.  But my wife and I are skepticle about UFO's due to the great distances needed to traverse in space-time.  This leads me to believe that what we saw was extraterestrial in its nature.  Since then I have kept my head up and looking and again the very next evening at 8:45 I looked at my watch first then to the sky and saw a simmilar object, this time same type of object as far as brightness and size was moving north for 30-40 seconds before moving West then speeding off West and increasing altitude and disapearing into the clear night.   Again the following night I look upward at around 9:15 and see a much brighter object as seen the two previous evenings.  This object was 10 times the luminosity also same type of motion just brighter.  Exactly the 3rd sighting goes like this I come home park the car and exit the vehicle.  I look up to admire the stars and I see clear as day a bright planet but this night it apears to have the luminosity of ten versus the previous two evenings this 3rd time the motion from up above to the north increasing altitude until disapearing.   Note none of the sightings did the objects disapear over the horizon rather disapeared into a higher altitude vanishing.  No sound ever.   And again I am an avid sky watcher and know what I am looking at and what for. This is what leads my skepticle mind to believe what I have been seing for three nights to be a clear ET Event.  I do think again if I look up I will see again soething that others with fancy equipment could video tape and verify.  I am an educated sky watcher and a skeptic due to the fantastic distances.   Make note of what I have seen please as the next person to see what I've seem won't think they are crazy. thank you kindly. S",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

It was very bright, sunny day, with wispy high clouds that moved fairly rapidly as it was quite windy.  My first thought that is was possibly a weather balloon.  It was difficult to spot, and the fourth person was not able to see it because of the bright sky, though the sun was behind and above us.  I took photos with my cell phone, but strangely there is the pole I used as a marker but instead of the very small object we were looking at there is an oval large bright light.  This happened in two consecutive photos. I was wondering if anyone else has reported anything like this today.  There was a tremendous amount of jet traffic and contrails in that sector of the sky. As far as I have checked there were no unusual celestial events going on either.  I thought I would go ahead and report this since we have had some ufo sightings in this area recently.

First of all, Im not sure what we saw that night but it had everyone thinking.  The four of us were boating down the river doing some fishing when I noticed something moving in the sky around the Little Dipper.  It was circular and a bright white color moving from left to right.  As I was looking at this object the other people in the boat noticed it too and one of them made the comment that it was just a plane but it was moving too fast, and there were no other lights, just a solid white light.  The next conclusion was that it could have been a satelite which it could have been, but the speed and the amount of area that it covered as it moved across the sky was amazing. In about a minute or so this object appeared at my far left and streaked across the sky to my far right before we lost it over the mountain. I was in the military and have seen and been around planes, jets, helo's and I've never seen something move this fast, I was astonished. Maybe twenty to thirty seconds after we lost sight of this object, my friend pointed out a group of aircraft behind us. They were in fairly perfect formation with the same lights with a differant aircraft behind them (I say diff. because the lights were diff. on this one) and were moving in the direction of where we last saw the object before it went out of sight over the mountain. In all there were five aircraft, and all seemed to be tailing this object that we saw. We watched for another minute before they too moved across the mountain out of sight. This may not be a ufo sighting but it was too wierd not to report to someone. If anyone else had the same sighting that night, hopefully they report it so that we can find out what it was or wasn't.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,,

It was one of those beautiful starlit nights that can only be experienced in the mountains.  The moon had not yet risen and the sky was magnificantly clear.  I stood looking up at the stars and could see Orion and the Pleiades in the western sky.  I then noticed a very bright white light traveling from west to east directly toward me.  As there were no blinking wing lights I assumed it to be a satellite.  As it came toward me I thought that it was traveling at an uncommonly fast speed for a satellite and seemed to be at a much lower evelation than you would expect a satellite to be.  I then heard the distant sound of a jet and noticed a plane traveling in a NW to SE direction above the western horizon over the mountains.  I looked back up at the light which was almost directly above me and then noticed another plane on the eastern horizon traveling in a NNW direction above the eastern horizon.  Both planes seemed to be at a greater altitude than the light. The bright light came to a stop almost directly above me, made a 90 degree turn to the north and then very rapidly gained altitude, growing smaller and smaller in my vision until it dispeared altogether all in just a few seconds.

At which point I was surprised to see an object hovering about 20 feet above my next door neighbor’s house. The object was black and had 2 lights on each side of the front of it. The sky was black and the object was black so it was difficult to see exactly how large it was, but the part of the object that I did see, was approx. 3 times larger than the house that it hovered over. The house is a basic one floor single family unit. I did see that the object was black, but I could not make out the exact shape of the object. (I’m positive it was ‘cloaked’ in some way. The object also had 2 white lights on its front side. They were spaced out, spanning the approx. size of the house under it. I don’t think they spanned to the exact sides of the craft. They were closer together than that.  When I stepped outside of the door and noticed the object, it seemed to have noticed me at the same time. It began moving very slowly over to my house (in my estimation, approx. 2 miles per hour).  At that point, I ran back into my house. It felt as though it had targeted me.  As, I walked through my kitchen, I saw the object over my yard, and moving to the top of my house. Again, it was moving very slowly, as if it were in a ‘hovering movement state’. I then watched it move from the side of my house to the top of my house. I could not longer see it at that point, as it was on top of my house. Again, it hovered not more than 20 feet above my house. Perhaps it hovered even lower than that.  It was then, that I ran into my son’s room and told him about it. He wanted to go look at it and would have seen it, but I was afraid that it was coming to my house because it possibly had the intentions of abducting a human (and there we were.. ), so I wouldn’t allow my son to go out to look at it, for fear that he would be abducted.  I hid for about 30 minutes... then I felt ok again. I went to bed. Approx. 30 minutes after I got into bed, I saw the UFO once again (out of my bedroom window, to the south). This time it was rapidly flying away from my neighborhood. It was flying south (towards Tacoma). I could not determine its size. But I did see all of its lights. I will try to draw the pattern below:   					*   			*				*   		*			*			*   			*				*   					*  The lights were pulsing brightly at approx. 5 second intervals. When they pulsed brightly, they actually became almost one light and I had to close my eyes as a result of the brightness. Mind you, the object was approx. 1 to 2 miles away at that point. I watched the object fly over and up (to an area of the sky) where there was a round white light enshrouded by a thick black cloud (the cloud receded occasionally, in the same manner that clouds recede and thicken). When the cloud receded I could see that the white light looked exactly like the moon. Mind you, this was approx. 6 or 6:15 AM. The moon does not shine outside of my bedroom window at that time of the morning. (I am absolutely positive, as I watch it constantly). The object that I was watching seemed to fly up to the cloud where the ""moon"" was residing  This is when the object disappeared. The ‘moon’ went behind the black cloud. It stayed dark for at least 10 minutes and I didn’t watch to see if it showed up again after that. Curiously, I have been seeing this ‘moon’ at odd times (2am, 3am) during the night for the past week or so. I don’t know if it has anything to do with the object that I saw, but it was a very odd sight. This is a true report. I am a professional. I have worked IT for the past 15 years and before that I was the Director of a HUD program for 10 years.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,47.2585,-122.246

Timepiece anomoly also occured At the annual UFO Conference put on by the UFO Watchtower in Hooper, CO several people had the opportunity to witness UFOs.  About 2:00 PM Stan Romanek (one of the featured speakers at the event) was near the parking area outside the presentation building and was excited as he told me about the UFO he had just witnessed and taken some pictures of.  He was really excited that he got pictures of it.  He pointed out a spot above a patch of clouds near where the object was about 4 fingers (at arms length) above the distant mountain horizon in the northwest sky. He mentioned what he saw to a couple other people earlier and walked across the field to the RV he was staying in about 1:30 PM.  He was going to put the image on his laptop computer and bring it back so we could all see what the picture looked like.  He returned and set the laptop up on a table outside under the shade of a canopy of an RV set up to serve food.  As he got the computer set up I continued to scan the skies, especially in the area he had seen the object.  We were excited to see that he did get a picture of it.  It was white in color and although it was a digital image at a distance you could make out the classic saucer shape with a bubble protrusion on top.  A few of us were taking turns looking at the image because the brightness of reflection of the sky in the monitor made it difficult to see well unless you stood directly in front of it. While about 5 or 6 people were marveling at the picture Stan had just taken (with a Nikon Coolpix 6 mega pixel digital camera) I saw what appeared to be the same object in the same location off in the distant N/W horizon.  I would guess the distance to be at least 35 miles away based on the distance of the mountain range it appeared to be over.  It was very white and was dramatically accentuated by the darker blue sky background.  It was also about 4 fingers (arms length) above the distant mountaintop to the northwest about the width of my pinkie finger above the white cloud bank below. I described the location as I pointed to the object for the others to identify also.  They were as excited as I was to realize for themselves how fascinating it was to watch.  You could easily see that the object was not a cloud, balloon or plane.  It stood perfectly still and the distinct sharpness of the edges eliminated it being a cloud as you could compare it to other clouds in the area. We all watched as the stationery object defied cloud movement and all other rational or logical cross references we could use.  Someone noticed an identical object about a pinkie width directly above the one we were watching.  The one above slowly moved downward toward the original object until it was directly over the other nearly touching it. After watching the object for a minute or two to eliminate any plausible explanation for what I was witnessing I went to get my camera and took 3 pictures.  The 5 mega pixel Kodak photos were not distinct as the ones Stan took and only showed a white spot with no definition.  At that time I left to tell others in the nearby building attending the conference about what was happening outside.  By the time I returned both objects had left in different directions according to those watching it. I served in the military in the mid- late 1960s in Naval Air Intelligence and was trained in aircraft identification.  I am confident this was a physical object and not any kind of natural phenomenon.  I have attached the 2 photos I took even though they are very poor quality compared to what we were visibly seeing. Another odd note is that 6 individuals’ cell phones or watches were 1 hour off that morning plus another was 2 hours and another was off by 3 hours.  The cell phone services were provided by at least 3 different services.  No one had any explanation for this oddity. This is the first time I’ve reported a sighting.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

While we were watching them just sit there, we noticed an opposite direction satellite go zooming by, not sure if it was related or not.

I'm a 66 years old native Virginian and retired police officer from Anchorage, Alaska. I had my own small plane in Alaska so am somewhat knowledgeable of aircraft. I was sitting on my back porch about 10 PM on Saturday, July 28, 2007 when I saw what appeared to be a low flying aircraft without any noise traveling south at a high speed. It was traveling at least 3 to 4 times faster than a small airplane would at about 1,000 feet, so I would guess between 300 and 400 MPH if at that altitude. If it were higher it obviously would have been a greater speed. If I had been driving a car I would have thought it to be a low flying Lear Jet sized aircraft without running lights, but I was on my back porch in the quiet country. I have no close neighbors or noise polluting source. The noisless aircraft had 3 round lights in a row that appeared to be windows lit up brightly. There were no red or green running lights, nothing but the window lights. The full moon slightly shadowed what appeared to be an oblong fuselage but no wings could be seen (but could have existed). It traveled south in a level straight line at about a 40 degree angle above the horizon. It passed behind a large backyard Chestnut tree and I waited to see it emerge on the other side. It didn't, so must have turned south or north over my house, where I would not have been able to see it. It is unlikely that the aircraft was small because of the 3 windows and speed. I'd estimate it about the size of a Lear Jet at 1,000 feet. It is unlikely the aircraft was coasting without power because there are no landing areas nearby for one that large and I would have heard it power up. There is a small grass private airstrip about 1.5 miles south but it couldn't have landed there. The nearest airport large enough is about 10 miles north and the aircraft could not have made it a fraction of that distance without power. I do not believe in UFOs from another world. However, I do believe it was an aircraft, possibly a small noiseless jet, that could be a secrete. If this is the case, I can't believe it would be flying over Patrick County, Virginia on a full moon night where it could be observed. There were no media reports related to what I saw and it is very puzzling. It isn't like any UFOs that I have read about in the past. Any ideas?  Ed.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,36.6946,-80.2309

A few nights ago I awoke from a particularly bad case of sleep paralysis around 3am when I heard the sound of several neighborhood dogs barking, something was obviously disturbing them. This lead me to look out my bedroom window to investigate. I then saw what at first appeared to be shooting stars in the sky. While I was wondering why there were so many of them or why they were so frequent, i then realized they were not shooting stars at all. These objects would fly one direction, then suddenly turn in another. Some would hover still for a few seconds. Every now and then I'd see one ""flash"" then shoot off in a direction at incredible speed. I must point out that these objects did seem to be flying rather randomly. In fact, I later joked to my girlfriend ""if they were aliens, well they were obviously driving drunk"". The lights do however seem to occasionally ""interact"" with one another, flying near to each other, hovering then flying away. These lights were visible outside my window until I fell asleep at 6am. For the most part I heard no sound connected with the objects, although I did often hear the sound of helicopters - far more frequently then i would normally in my area. I saw a helicopter only once, it did match the description of ""black helicopters"" that I have read. Being somewhat of a skeptic, as well as being aware of the effects of sleep paralysis - I at first put off these lights to being hypnagognic hallucination. This explanation, however was proven wrong when tonight I saw the same thing, also shortly after 3am. This time my sighting was not following sleep and my girlfriend was over and saw them too. Also, tonight at one point I saw a much larger and much brighter light. This light suddenly appeared in the sky, and then moved slowly to the left. I called in my girlfriend who saw it and became rather frightened. I turned to comfort her and upon me turning back, it was gone. These lights are visible outside my window now. I am aware many times alien abductions have been explained away as sleep paralysis. The fact that I had sleep paralysis before my first time witnessing these lights has me wondering if the two are in fact connected somehow. This is why I am checking the ""possible UFO abduction case"" box below. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked to my left out the door, which is the North, and saw two HUGE what looked like white headlights moving slowly and fairly low over the trees next to our apartments. They were NOT airplane headlights as I have seen them go over many times as they pass to go over to the nearby airport.  I called to my daughter to come and look and she came over. The next thing we saw was the headlights went out and three white lights came on and formed a huge triangle shape. I told my daughter to grab our binoculars so we could see up close what this thing was. The thing made no noise whatsoever the whole time. Suddenly it began flashing red and white lights, the kind I've never seen before. They sparkled like diamonds and were flashing in all directions and the (what I call) spacecraft, stopped and hovered up in the sky above our complex.  Nobody else was outside except just me and my daughter. I grabbed the binoculars and took a look and saw the ship was moving in it's place and spinning slowly in the sky and I could see detail of the markings on the ship through my binoculars. The ship was a dark grey metal with squiggly looking lines and shapes all over it. I got scared and handed the binoculars to my daughter to make sure that what I was seeing was real.  She looked and got scared and tried to pull me into the apartment. I said did you see what I saw? And she said YES!!  It's a UFO, get in here!

I was perfectly sober though a little tired from the show, so I was sitting on the curb behind the HOB waiting for autographs in a crowd of about 30 people and was facing due E. At the risk of sounding like a fool to these strangers and losing sight of it in the sky by trying to share it, I chose not to draw attention to what I saw. I wish I would have thought to take the camera in my pocket out and snap a few shots, but I was in a state of shock.  It was just a hazy light ball and it was definitely airborne because along the back of the HOB is a fence that is at least a little bit taller than I am, but it is also 20-30 ft. away from the curb I was sitting on. Perspective-wise it was a good couple of feet above the fence. Behind the fence and off to the right, (the direction it was traveling), was a light pole some distance away with a light gleaming away in my face, and hotels in the distance along with shrubbery and branches along the back of the fence. It was a windy night, pretty clear and it was sometime between 11:30 and 12:00 AM. I was sitting on the curb smoking a cigarette and chillin' facing about E, away from the HOB towards the ocean and checking out the stars. I saw the typical air traffic and seagulls enjoying the windy night.  It was a small, faint and hazy white light and at first I thought, ""That jet is hauling a$$!!  I’ve never seen a jet moving that fast"", then it struck me how much like a star it resembled. Because it was just a ball of light it was hard to judge it's size and distance, however if the planes that appeared after I saw it presumably went to the general area it was at, and my own judgement of perspective wasn’t too far off, it was definitely waaay out over the ocean. I checked it out on Google Earth; from the direction I was facing the shore was roughly .7 of a mile away, these planes and my own judgement of perspective put it AT LEAST a mile or more away.  It's path, from when I first noticed it started out parallel to the earth and traveled like this for maybe 5 seconds. Then almost a 90 degree turn at what seemed to be straight up, then another sharp degree of turn up and away at an angle, then another turn at a downward angle, and yet another at a down and backwards angle, then once it reached about where it's original path was, it resumed. Half of these turns were in a span of maybe 1-2 seconds, but no more than 3 at the absolute most and the other two were really short. Once it resumed it's ""original"" path it faded out after about 3 seconds. Like a lightbulb slowly going out, then instantly it began glowing again, so quickly I never lost track of it. From my perspective it was headed into the gleaming light, but it faded out for about a second, if only for a second and then came back to full glow before it ""passed"" behind the light pole and remained glowing, so I never lost it through the light. Now, on the other side of the light pole and after about another 2-4 seconds it faded out again for the second time and that's when I never saw it again.  I kept watching for it, but it never reappeared. It's path was straight, and looked very deliberate, not like it was a trashbag blowing in the wind or another seagull or something. The three things that have me pretty much convinced what I saw is some sort of a UFO is the blazing speed, the ease of the change of direction without even slowing down and that it was traveling in straight lines, not circling or twirling as if something caught in the wind. It was like someone was holding one of those laser pointers in the sky only it was faint and white.  I was glued to the sky, but saw no more. About 5-7 minutes later I saw two planes coming from the N along the coastline or there abouts and heading that direction, about the time they got where it was, I noticed another plane that must've come from the SW or that general direction. The two planes from the N went further S and I almost lost them behind the hotels and stuff on the horizon and then returned, while the other plane continued N for a few minutes and returned. I wasn’t sure what I was seeing, so I just stared in disbelief. I thought about telling some of my friends, but decided not to get picked on that night.  I documented this the next morning and waited to see if someone else reported this, but I’ve not seen anything yet.  I am a believer and was before this incident, but still remain skeptical as to what I saw.  If you also saw this, I urge you to report it. I also am attaching various files that may explain this in greater detail.",2007-03-08T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

I got the binoculars on it and it appeared simply as one of the brighter stars, in motion and with a constant glow. It repeated this twice, on the last ""illumination"" it came to a dead stop, increased in brightness @ 4X, remained at this maximum illumination for @ 2 seconds, and disappeared. That's it.

As for altitude I can't speculate beyond that, though not in what would be called space, it was MUCH higher than conventional civilian/commercial aircraft operate at. I've no idea what it was.",2007-08-14T00:00:00,38.62382493417588,-90.30852769878884

I was walking back from my car toward my girlfriend’s house when I happened to look up.  As soon as I did, I witnessed a single bright orange ball moving extremely fast from west-to-east in a straight line, and the color did not appear to shift or become dimmer at any point.  By the time I came around to the front of the house and tried to get a better look, I could no longer see the orb.  The object was certainly not any sort of aircraft I have ever seen.  It appeared to be solid, and its height did not appear to fluctuate.  In other words, the motion was completely lateral--parallel to the surface of the Earth.  There was no tail, so I immediately ruled out the possibility of a meteor or comet, not to mention the fact that the object was certainly not falling.  If I were to wager a guess, I would say it was flying at an altitude of 1000-1500 feet.

Told my wife about the event and couldn't figure it out.   Went online to check local weather and current lighting strikes.  Nearest strike was in Abliene, TX.   Not a cloud in the sky. This got me curious, so I was looking in the sky for clouds or a storm.  Looking to the northwest low to the horizon (now about 5- 10 mins later), I saw 4-5 faint star looking objects floating around doing unbelievable manuvers. These objects would be moving slow at first, then at lighting speed change direction.  Sometimes you see only 1 at a time.  Sometimes two or three at a time.   The best I can describe it was it looked like a ""dog-fight"" between stars. They would move up and down, left to right,  figure eights, you name it, zig-zag, at all different speeds. Their speed was unbelievable.  This was not man-made!   Notified my wife and woke up my 8 yr. old son to witness.  My son got very scared and started crying, my wife couldn't comment.  Called a buddy who lives west of me about 7mi. Told him where to look, he didn't see anything, but his wife did.  Haven't spoke to her yet on what exactly see saw.  The whole event lasted approx. 15-20 mins.  All their manuvers stayed in the general location.  Notified local UFO hot-line and made a report.  I do not know who to turn to or what?

The 'ball' stopped almost directly over my head (it didn't stop abruptly, just slowed to a stop).  It stayed in that position without any movement at all for approx 10 minutes.  It then moved a few degrees sosuth, then north, then south again.  I lost sight of it when it disappeared behind some clouds.  Based on observing aircraft (737 type) landing at the nearby airport at roughly the same height I would estimate the object to be quite small, maybe 10 feet across. There was no sound associated with the ball.

It goes with my belief that they (who ever they are or whatever) are able to tell when I see them and hide or move when I try to focus on them.  I had thought that if I used mirrors and took a pic I might be able to fool them!  I think I found a way of confusing them.  My camera takes the shot milliseconds after I push the button.

Since me and sister have affected so much,now we cannot open the curtains as we might encounter with a weird,horrible creature or ship but now we are always looking the place we saw it to see again.Yet nobody has believed us:mum,dad,our close friends.but we are 100%sure that there are sth or sb who is capable of building a ship like this,flying,turning...so mr.davenport I hope you will believe us,then at least you can help us to release ourselves..sorry for my english ,   ((name deleted))     ankara,turkey ((END ADDENDUM))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

At that point I noticed a fast moving object that was much higher than the commercial plane so I'm certain well above 32k feet. I focused on this object which seemed shiny which is why i noticed it.  So, i ran to get my camera with a 160-480mm zoom lens, and even with that it was still hard to get a clean image of the object.  As I'm focusing i noticed another similar object moving fast toward the first object I saw, and it caught up.  At that point they blended together so it now looked like a single object. Now, at this point the sky is very clear and blue and the (now joined) single object continued to move until it reached above a cloud (not thick, so it wasn't hard to see through it)  At this point the object stopped above this very high cloud.  I realized that this could not be a satelite, and I don't believe weather balloons can be controlled in this manner (go/stop/change direction)?    After the object stopped over the cloud, it was there for approximately 3-4 minutes after which it started moving back in the direction it came from, after I looked away to re adjust my eyes (staring hard to focus)  I then noticed another similar object so my guess is it may have been a third one. The best description I can give is they just looked like spheres (only shapes i could make out). I did not have my battery in the digital slr, but I really don't think it would have shown anything of significance. Although my wife was home she was aware I was looking at something but she didn't look. Now I am somewhat aware of how high commercial airliners fly and am very familiar with seeing them at great heights. I can't confirm or even saw any details on the objects, just somewhat fast moving objects that looked spherical and I'm ceratain it was higher than what any commercial planes fly. I've never witnessed or reported such events but i figure I may as well.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,42.39288571428572,-83.28791020408163

I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado. On Oct. 2, 2007 around 11:00 PM I was outside saying goodbye to a few friends.  As they drove away I looked up at the night stars and noticed something strange.  There was what appeared at first to be an airplane flying east to west toward an area between Pikes Peak and Cheyenne Mountain. The object was flashing red and white lights and was flying in and unusual jerking manner.  It may have been the irregually flashing lights that made it appear to be not flying straight.  A couple neighbors where out walking.  I mentioned what I was watching and they stopped for about 5 mins. and also saw the object.  After watching for about 10 mins. the object moved more south toward Cheyenne Mt. It was over the mountains now.  Then it disappeard for a quick second or two. When it reappeard there were two objects now flashing. They stayed together for only a couple mins.  The first (I think it was the first object) began heading back toward the east the same way it had come.  The other object remained stationary above the mountain.  The object above the mountain slowly ""flickered out"" over several minutes.  The other object continued headed east. As it passed overhead I could make out the shape of the craft by the configuration of the lights. I could make out four distinct lights.  It was triangular. After a few more minutes the object was no longer in my view.  It seemed like the second object became visible when the first object reached it's destination. I have seen similar objects with these kind of flickering lights over Colorado Springs previously.  However, I have never seen one appear out of no where.  They usually just fly a straight path until they're out of sight.  This one had a purpose to it's flight.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

Broadcasters and emergency dispatchers got hundreds of calls from people who saw the object traveling from the northeast to the southwest.  The FAA received no reports of anything falling from any airplanes in the area, leading to speculation that it was a meteor that burned up in the atmosphere, since no crash site has been identified.  Residents of Lyon County in far southwestern Minnesota reported a loud boom that might have been connected with the sightings in the Twin Cities.

They were tiny, like pinheads and flew randomly, quickly. They would appear and disappear from sight. Before they would disappear, they would turn dull, then dark (aImost black). They would reappear suddenly. There movement was very similar to a swarm of fruitflie:, in close proximity to each other, very random, in all directions.   I thought perhaps they were floaters in my eyes, but when I closed them, I didn't see anything; when I followed the objects, they didn't move in my field of vision like floaters would. They'd stay where I focussed or followed their movement. I said ""Wow! Look at this!,"" to alert my co-driver, but I couldn't get him to see where I indicated, before they all faded and disappeared. ""You seeing UFOs?,"" he said sarcastically.   Then a single silver orb appeared in the east and flew west, which he did see. It was a bit larger (maybe lower) than the others. This one crossed the sky like an aircraft would, but he agreed it looked strange and not like a plane at all. It moved too slow for a plane at that altitude. It had an aura around it and left a slight trail.  It kept going in a straight line until we lost sight of it due to the sun.

I am a female and I'm 26 years old.  My brother who is the other witness is 19 years old.  I have seen UFO's before, but nothing like this.  It was about 7:15pm, the sun was down, but it was still a little light out. I was driving back home on 35W with my brother and I noticed a bright light in the sky. I'm so used to seeing jets and airplanes around here, I know what they look like in the sky, but this light was much different. Well as we were getting closer to home I noticed another light, then a couple seconds later another one appeared and I noticed they all formed a weird triangle formation. Well trees got in the way and I couldn't see the UFO's any more. Well about ten minutes later my jaw just dropped to the floor, because I saw five lights all spaced out equally and they were in a slight V-shape formation. Right away I thought of the Phoenix Lights, because I do remember what they looked liked. Now I knew these had to be UFO's and I got all excited. I told my brother to look and I told him that there is no way that those are jets, because they were too close together. My brother was just as amazed as I was and he wanted to take some pictures, so we took our exit and went straight to this service road that brought us closer to the lights. We pulled in a parking lot since it was uphill and we could get a better view. I noticed two other lights as I pulled into the parking lot but they were not part of the formation. We got out of my car and I took a couple pictures with my cellphone. We were facing north and we could see Downtown Minneapolis from where we were.  The UFO's were hovering above or at least along the banks of the Minnesota River, it was hard to tell. The whole formation was about a mile across. That's my best guest. I noticed that there was one UFO that was brighter than the rest and it was right in the middle. The color was a very bright golden-white.  I could see three seperate lights from that UFO, but the lights were so bright it looked like one. The rest of the UF! O's were n't as bright as this one, but they were of the same color. The UFO's didn't move forward or backwards. They just stayed there for five minutes or so and then they moved up or down, but just a little bit. We watched them for about 20mins and the formation changed a couple of times. Then all of a sudden one UFO that was on end of the right side moved out of formation and was moving slowly toward us. On this UFO I could see that it also had about three lights. I almost thought it was a airplane because of it's size, but then the lights weren't flashing and it looked like a boomerang? My brother got scared thinking that we were going to get abducted by this UFO and he wanted me to drive out of there. We got back in the car and I drove back home. I wanted to go back there and take better pictures with my digital camera. We only live five minutes from the parking lot, so I figured we would have some time to see them again. I got the camera and we went back to the parking lot. Sure enough they were still there! The time was around 8pm and there were just four lights. Now the brightest of the UFO's, the one in the middle drifted off and did it's own thing for a minute or so and then it went back to the middle again. I used my camera to take some pictures, but it came out crappy. I also video taped it, but that didn't come out as nice either. After I felt I couldn't get any good pictures from where we were, I decided to drive closer. I went back to 35W going north and as I was crossing the Minnesota River I looked to my right and I could see the UFO that was once in the middle of the formation, the really bright UFO I mentioned before. Since I was closer to the UFO I could see that the color of the light was a super bright white, the brightest light I have ever seen in my life. The best way I can describe the brightness is that it was like stadium lights. It also was hovering very low near the river. To me it looked like it was searching for something, because it was so low. I later heard from my mom that some t! ime in t he afternoon some people around the Twin Cities reported a metallic or flaming ball in the sky and some reported hearing a loud boom. My other brother has told me that some UFO's appear during or after a meteor?? If anyone is interested in my story or would like to help me figure out how I could get my video and or pictures in better quality, please contact me! Thanks! P.S. The two pictures have not been messed with and they are small in size since I took them with my cell phone and as for the video, I used my digital camera. I hope to at least get the video in better quality.  P.S. The whole UFO event lasted about an hour and a half.  From about 7:15pm to 8:45pm.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,44.768986757990874,-93.27707899543378

While on my way home from a little league baseball game on 10-3-07, my fiancée and I witnessed a UFO.  While traveling north on Scott Blvd., my S.O. pointed to the 4:00 position, as viewed through the front windshield and said, “Is that a UFO.”  It seemed to be approximately ¼ mile or less from our position and moving very slowly (drifting) to the west, very low, less than a 1000 ft. altitude.   I have been an aviation buff my entire life and have observed anything that flies at one time or another in all types of conditions.  This was close and strange, no sound, appeared spherical (i.e. best guess 60 – 80 ft. diameter), flat metal or gray color and four small lights, my S.O. reported that the lights changed at one point, however, they all appeared red to me, which was my first clue that this was something odd (i.e. not standard aircraft lights.)   I attempted to follow the craft, as I was in somewhat in shock, I was actually looking at something I couldn’t ID.  I attempted to follow it as it drifted west, I turned off of Scott into a neighborhood trying to follow it, but it eventually drifted behind a tree line.  I then thought I would try to get on highway 70 west in hopes of seeing the object out in the open, however, it took a few minutes to get to 70 and it was just gone.    My fiancée previously adamantly disbelieved in the possibility of UFO’s, in fact she made fun of my interest frequently.  However, as I was driving and trying not to wreck the car, she got a better look than I did and couldn’t deny what she saw, she was actually sick after the event and somewhat in shock.  We were both sick, as we couldn’t believe what just happened.   Extensive vehicle traffic was present, I expected people to be parked and watching the object, however, the traffic just kept flowing.  Other people had to have seen this, we just don’t want to ask anyone because we both work in a professional field.  I know I saw something I couldn’t ID, I want to know if other people saw it.  Even though we both saw it, both of us have some fear that we are crazy, neither of us slept last night, things were just strange.  I always had hoped I would see a UFO,  but driving home from a baseball game, in the middle of traffic and in a populated area, it caught us completely off guard.  I desperately want to talk to someone about it, we both still feel a little sick.   As the event happened last night and I missed part of the local news, I don’t know if it is in the Columbia News or paper, I will monitor throughout the day. Additional note:   Before the event I was at a little league baseball game on Scott Blvd., a mile or so from our UFO event.  At 5:50p.m. approximately, a C130 flew over the field fairly low, maybe 3000 ft. or less.  My S.O. asked me to ID the plane, I told her, she said , “why is a military plane flying so low.”  I didn’t think it was anything strange until after the event she mentioned the C130 again, might be nothing, but just wanted to include.  Also, as I was driving, frantic, trying to watch the UFO, it’s possible my directions are off, but I did review a map of the area after the event and I do believe the UFO was drifting to the west. My phone # is 573-((number deleted)), if someone wants to talk to me, please don’t release my phone number to anyone else, thanks.   Also I tried to send this same message earlier, don't know if if went through, as I have an old computer, also may have used the wrong month, it was last night, 10-3-07.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,38.91147669172933,-92.30242962406015

On the night of october 3, 2007 8 30 pm ish, I walked out my back door for a cigarette.  Right over my yard, and I will have to guess at the altitude, 1000 ft, perhaps only about 500, as i am not good at judging distance at night,, I saw a bright light, very similar to how a street light looks, only it was traveling from south to north very slowly.  In my mind, I was thinking that if it were a plane it should have flashing lights, and as close as it was, I would definitely  be able to hear it.  this was absolutely silent.  As I was watching, ""they, meaning the pilot(s)"" turned off the ""light"".  It did not instantly go dark, but it gradually dimmed.  Sort of like when you turn off your tv at night, it ""glows"" for a few moments, before going black. Thats what this thing did.  And during the 4 or 5 seconds it took from going from bright light to dim then dark, I could clearly see it make a sharp turn to the east, and continued in a eastward direction before it completely disappeared from my sight.  In my opinion, it disappeared from my sight because it was no longer illuminated, as I believe that it continued to travel to the east, rather than disappear "" up into space"".  I was actually quite shaken by this, as I was by myself, but I was not in disbelief, because I have seen similar unexplainable flying objects on several other occasions.  This was different in that it was very close, and also directly over my back yard.  So I went back inside, and watched tv for about an hour, to calm down, and I decided to go back outside and have another look, to see if I saw anything again.  A couple minutes after stepping out my back door, I saw a VERY bright ""meteor?"", or what looked like a meteor, or falling star, except VERY close to the earth, and ""fell"" from northwest, towards the southeast, and left a very long tail.  This fell, not down from the sky, but fell or traveled horizontally to the earth.  I have seen lots of falling stars before and have seen meteor  showers and the like, but this was the biggest, brightest, and longest lasting thing of that type that I have ever seen.  Needless to say, at this point, i was inclined to go inside the house and stay there. This meteor thing could very well be just that, a meteor, but I found it unusually coincidental that it occurred such a short time after seeing the lit up craft over my yard.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,39.6843,-89.7237

I was getting a drink of water and looked out my kitchen window into the sky. I saw what appeared to be an airplane light. It was much brighter than the stars, at first I did not think anything of it, but then I noticed that the light was not moving across the sky like it should have been. I also noticed at that point that it seemed to be flashing an almost red/blue/white alternation, except there seemed to be no pattern. It was kind of sporattic. So I started to get a closer look at it.  At that point I decided to go outside into the driveway to get a clearer view. After examining the light for about 10 minutes, I noticed that it was not a stationary light. My first thought was that it may have been a helicopter. I do live near a Naval Submarine Base, so it may not be uncommon to have helicopters in the area. But this was not moving like a normal aircraft. It seemed to bob up and down fairly gently and occasionally side to side. As if it was moving toward or away, but it never moved. I called one of my roommates out to look at it, he shrugged it off, said it was probably a helicopter, and went to bed. I also called a friend of mine who lives closer to where the light was coming from, but his house is surrounded by trees, so it was hard for him to see anything.  After about 45 minutes I decided to see if I could get any closer. It looked pretty far away, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I drove south toward the St. Marys River, which separates Georgia and Florida, just across is Fernandina Beach, Florida. I could go no further, so that's where my journey ended. It looked as if I got no closer, so I drove back home. When I got back to my house, I looked at it, and while on the telephone with a friend in California, I noticed that the light had moved slightly to the right. Before, it was a bit left below Orien's Belt. If you drew a light through the three stars in the belt and took it down to nearly where the trees meet the sky from my point of view, it was to the left of the line. When I got home, it was further to the right, on the right side of that line. So apparently the light moved, however it was such a slow movement that I didn't notice as it was happening. At around 01:00 I got tired of watching, and came in to write this up. As of 01:07 the light is still there, and still is ""twinkling"" and bobbing ever so slightly.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

I forgot my wallet and began going inside the house.  I had just peeked up towards the south sky for a second and thought I had seen a satellite or fireball at first moving across the sky. I took a couple of steps back to see around my roof line by my front porch and noticed not only 1 large star, but one small one directly under it and moving exactly with it. Measurements are hard to describe but it must have been low and very large as I will explain. As it moved east slowly, I noticed it must have been a solid object since it would block out other stars in between the two star type lights. It suddenly stopped and began going south, now directly in front of me, and as the lights seemed to dim and become closer and go up higher , the more stars would show around it so I know it was moving upwards and away from me at the same time.

The only example I can give is to look at the two end stars on the cup of the big dipper as that was ""aproximately"" the distance between them, and picture those two stars moving in unisen sideways. There was no noise at all, not even a whoosh or anything, like it was gliding in a sound proof room. The two lights eventually looked like one as they seemed to merge and at this point very faint, and then just dissappeared. I may add that there were no planes and living in the country , it's easy to hear even a small plane or jet that is very high.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,45.8809,-87.0504

I woke up at 4:00 AM to get a glass of water when I saw, what I thought was a really bright star out my window.  When I went to lie down, I kept thinking how peculiar it was for the star to be so bright.  I went back to my window and with my glasses and notice that the light looked like it was pulsing.  It would be bright, and then it would not.  So mulling it over I thought, this is really a UFO so I grabbed my camera and zoomed in.  My camera is a Sony Cybershot so picture quality is not as good of professional photographer quality.  When I zoomed into what I thought was a start, I realized I was gazing at a circular ball of light with the colors of fire (red, blue, yellow).  I took note that this light had a pattern which was, after a few minutes, easy to follow.  At the end of the red, blue, and yellow the light expanded.  When I took the picture I would get a disk in the photo, it looks like a disk of energy.  The light would move far away, then it would come back.  I think it had to be several miles away in the sky.  When I started to look around there were 5 others but not as bright, my camera could not even zoom in that far.  I actually when back to bed around 6:30 AM when the light was far away enough that I new it was leaving.  I am 30 yrs old, hispanic, educated with a bachelors in business, I work a full time job, and very credible. This is my 3rd time seeing strange light in the sky, but the first time I got a picture and could verify that it was not just a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

I always try to watch all of the rockets, especially the space shuttles launch from Cape Canaveral.  On July 4, 2006, the space shuttle Discovery took off at 2:37 PM. I wasn't in a good spot to see the launch (trees in the way), so about ten minutes before the shuttle took off, I started driving from Deltona looking for a unobstructed view of the east.  I was hoping to get to the St. Johns River bridge along 415 and pull over there to watch the shuttle since there would be no obstructions over the river.  I didn't make it that far, and at 2:37 I pulled over into a church parking lot in Osteen that had an open field behind it. By the time I got my camera out, the shuttle was probably about 30 seconds into it's launch.  I started taping the launch, and once the shuttle was no longer visible, I noticed something else in the sky.  It was round black object up in the sky off in the distance in the same direction that the shuttle took off from.  Judging from the clouds that the shuttle passed behind, and what the object was in front of, the black object was closer than the shuttle, but it was hard for me to estimate a size.  My initial though was that somebody released a balloon that was rising.  After watching the object a bit, I realized it wasn't moving correctly to be a balloon.  For example, it would be at one spot in the sky, and then would move back and forth horizontally.  Another time it started getting low in the sky rather quickly compared to the speed that it was drifting at at other times.  It also appeared to be just barely entering clouds at times.  It would fade behind a cloud, but never actually disappear totally.  I watched (and video taped) the object for about 10 minutes until I finally left.  About 5 minutes later, I was able to look past the trees after driving along 415 in the direction of Sanford and still see the object.  Later on, as I am writing this, I looked at the video that I took of the object and the shuttle launch.  At one point I am not paying attention, and move the camera off of the shuttle, and the object shows up there showing that the object was in the sky before I noticed it too.  I have video footage, along with still frames that I took from the video that I will send to you.  With so many people watching the shuttle launch, I wonder if anyone else saw something similar?",2006-07-16T00:00:00,28.8558,-81.0603

The object was to our East, between Fletcher Hills and the City of El Cajon in California about 15 miles East of San Diego.  The lights appeared to be moving away from us slowly in an Eastward direction. The three lights formed a triangular shape, and the top light would pulsate on and off, as well as the red on all three lights would change in color and intensity. The red color was about as red and bright as a laser pointing device. There was numerous small aircraft in the area from Gillespie Field  (Three letter airport code: SEE)in El cajon and as well, many commercial airliners passing overhead (altitude would be about 3000 to 6000 feet for the commericial aircraft on this approach - yes I am a rated private pilot) in the approach pattern to Lindbergh Field in San Diego. However, the light pattern was not conistent with an airplane, nor was the movement consistent with either a helicopter or airplane. The object appeared to be steady (non-moving) for about 5 minutes, then it started drifting slowly to the ESE. The object then vanished. Our view was not blocked or obstructed, so it did not go behind a building, tree, cloud, etc., it just appeared to go dark all of a sudden. A small plane in the touch and go landing pattern at Gillespie Field (they use runway 27R during night ops) flew through the area within two minutes of us losing visual contact of the object. We tried to take digital photographs, but my son has yet to download them to the computer so we can see if we captured anything or not. This was also not mistaking the local fireworks displays going on around town, as we could not see any fireworks from our location and the object bore no resemblence to any fireworks. The weather was clear, with no clouds or low lying fog in the area - visibility was about 20 miles, temperature was approximately 80 Deg F, with light winds. We could see plenty of stars in and around where we saw the object both before, during and after the event. There was no sound heard from the object, nor was there any sudden movements. The appearence and disappearence were the only quick actions by the object, and the movement was similiar to a hot air ballon, in that it seemed to drift more than fly. We have seen many hot air ballons, and there was no flame present such as what a hot air ballon would have, only three red lights and a visible dark area between the lights, which we believed to be the structure of the object. I tried to logically explain what it was to myself since observing the object last night, but I can not come up with anything which I can say, yes that is what it was. I have had to file this in my mind as ""unknown"" or when my son asked me what it was, I said ""I have no idea kiddo"" and that is where it remains.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,32.80505052631579,-116.91756842105264

I was driving at 35 mph and spotted a large object with a bright white light surrounded by two larger red lights hovering just above the treetops surrounding Estes Drive Elementary School. It was approximately 200-250 ft. in the air.  There is a small airport close by, but this was not a plane. The object was moving extremely slowly in a straight line.  It made no sound, and the lights were steady, and did not blink.

First I need to apologize.  I originally submitted this report without cutting and pasting on Microsoft, so I am resending it.  Also, I have a feeling I accidentally put the year as 2007 instead of 2008.  At approximately 8pm CST on January 16, 2008 I took my dog out for a walk.  It was a relatively clear night, but very cold and no other people were out walking.  We walked to the end of our neighborhood (The Landings at Far Oaks) and stood in an empty lot.  Directly across from our neighborhood is a large cornfield.  The cross street is Old Collinsville Road.  My dog likes this empty lot and while she was sniffing around I glanced up and thought I saw an airplane flying low to the ground.  The plane appeared to behave strangely--- suddenly zooming up and then going low.  I kept watching and then it started coming towards me and I could not believe what I saw!  I am not 100% certain but I think it was gray and had 2 bright white lights in front.  On the side there was a red flashing light that moved alongside the craft.  I think triangle shaped is the best description, but it was dark and I was freaked out and can't be 100% sure.  Also, it was silent.  I panicked and ran home as it appeared to hover behind me.  While I was running I was too afraid to look back.  There were lots of lights on in several homes and one house seemed to be having a party (5-7 cars parked on the street).  However, I don't know these people and was too embarrassed to knock on the door about a UFO.  I also did not know who to call.  Maybe I should have called the police.  I then watched the UFO from my driveway.  It continued to go high and low and I couldn't find binoculars and didn't have a camera.  However, within about 30 minutes there were several airplanes in the sky and a large, dark black, very loud craft that I suspect was a military helicopter.  This craft was definetly chasing the UFO and stayed in the area back tracking for at least 40 minutes.  There were 2 small planes from a distance that seemed to be flying too close together, but I'm pretty sure they were small personal aircraft and probably were looking for the UFO.  There seemed to be an unusual number of airplanes in the sky on that night.  I lost sight of the object because I was too afraid to get in my car and follow it.  Today, I very much regret that I did not do exactly that, but I was alone and don't know my neighbors.  I wish that my name does not appear on the internet.  However, if you want to ask me any additional questions please feel free to call me on my cell phone listed above.  Although I'm not sure if I would be able to  provide any more relevant information.  Today I am really wondering if  anyone else witnessed this event.  I will call this into the hotline today (1-19-08) or tomorrow as I am going on a short trip out of stae.  For the record, I have always believed in the existence of UFO's. However, I NEVER expected to see one up close!!  I don't read about UFOs orwatch tv specials about them.  However, I did watch a special calledUFO in Illinois on the Travel Channel about 6 months - 1 year ago.  I was just flipping the channel and the show caught my attention because I had just moved here from out of stae.  The show was a detailed account over several hours about a flying object that police chased for several hours in the surrounding communities where I live.  I now wonder how many UFO sightings occur in the St. Louis area.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

It changed or emitted colors bluish/green and orangish/red in flashes.  We could not make out the shape as the object was very far away and we were looking through binoculars.  The binoculars brought the colors into focus, otherwise it looked like a bright object.  What caught our attention was the brightness of the object and the fact that the object did not move from the same position and when we looked at it through binoculars we noted the color patterns.  Fast forward three weeks until 10/28.  We noticed the same sentinel object in the northeastern sky as night fell.  This time my husband saw it go into position.

My friend and I decided to drive out to Cranberry Flats to sit in the parking lot and tell ghost stories since we had no halloween party to attend this year.  We turned south towards Cranberry Flats when I saw two very dark objects speed over us. I ignored them, thought they were birds (maybe they were). Then I started noticing streams of light going over the road, at first they looked like falling stars and kept going from left to right. Then they starting sort of going back and forth, like two of them swirling, but I rationalized it as the reflection of our headlights against power lines. They also kept changing colour, the ones we noticed were purple, green, orange, blue, yellow, and white. I should also say they started out very thin, and slowly swelled up into the size of large ovals. The further we got to Cranberry Flats, the brighter they got, two white ovals slowly circling each other. At this point I was trying to rationalize it as spotlights. Neither my friend or I were saying anything to each other, I didn't want to say something in case I was totally hallucinating, and I didn't mind it if I was hallucinating. Anyway, the further out of town we get the brighter it is. Total silence, we miss the turn off to Cranberry Flats and she pulls into a side road to turn around to go back to the Flats. At this point I notice that the lights hovering and swirling in the sky are staying in one place. I think at this point I said to her ""What are those?""  ""You noticed them too.""  We turn around and start driving back into town, neither of us wants to look back. This time back into town I realize: There are no power lines going across the road. They are all along the side of the road. We're starting to compare notes and realizing we've seen exactly the same thing. Both of us are terrified. Then my friend stops along the roadside to get out and see if they're still there, and they are, so she freaks out and jumps into the car. We keep driving until the turn off going east, and we look back and they are still there, still glowing white ovals.  We're finally in town, I'm still freaked out, and we go to Diefenbaker to see if we can see them from there. Sure enough, there's those two swirling lights.  She drives me home and then after much debate convinces me to go out there with her again. And so I do, after MUCH reluctance.  Anyway, we get back to Diefenbaker by about 11:30 and they've changed. They're still swirling, but this time they're green and acting somewhat like northern lights, just the way you see energy ripple off them. Some other people in the park seemed to be seeing them too.  We drive to a couple other places in the city to see if we can see them from there, nada.  Then we get some binoculars and go back out to look at them. This is about three hours after they first appeared, about 1 in the morning. This time, they're more like green ovally lights, without the nerthern-light type ripple, but they're moving COMPLETELY differently. Sometimes they swirl, sometimes they flash on and off. Sometimes they just speed past each other. Sometimes they change direction, sometimes they drive bomb, and just as we were driving away I also noticed them leap frogging and chasing each other.  Also twice during our sightings they went from just a glow to a solid light. I should mention it was cloudy so they might have been in the clouds.

I think those were all the colors.  The craft had a circular shape in general with pointed ends around it at each different colored light. I estimate that it was close to 17-25 feet in diameter.

It moved swiftly but seemingly slowly - I believe as a result of the non-sound and it distance from me.  Again it seemed actually fairly close - like I told the director on the phone - the size of a regular ish 727 - but now it seemed larger and further away.  Why didn't it make sound?

At first, I assumed it was a firefly since I live in the woods, but this light did NOT blink.  I also thought it was an airplane because they are constantly traveling back and forth from Atlanta but there were no red, blue, or blinking lights.  Next, I thought it could be a shooting star but it had no tail of debree and remained in my view for an extended period.  As the object moved in a straight line to the north, it changed direction, which seemed to defy the laws of physics, and headed west.  This is when I knew it was not a shooting star because this object also zigzagged a couple of seconds after changing direction in a ""S"" type curve.  The change of direction and zigzag motion seemed to last approximately 5 seconds.  This object had to be moving at least twice as fast as a commercial airplane.

A friend of mine who is staying at the house was standing near our shop building, which is approximately 50 yards from the main house, looking into the sky.  When I approached him, he asked if I saw anything flying low and silent on my way there.  I had not seen anything out of the ordinary.  He described a pair of non-flashing lights, red and blue, on opposing ends of the ‘craft.’ It flew on an east-to-west bearing, and quickly altered direction to the north and dimmed to non-visible.  The total duration was 2-4 minutes and was approximately 1 mile away at its closest point to his position.  He also commented that animals in the neighborhood were acting peculiar in that the horses next door were in a state of unrest and that dogs all around the area were barking loudly, many at once.  Within 5 minutes of my arrival, two bright lights appeared in polar-opposite positions to each other, one to the northwest, and the other to the southeast.  Each one brightened and dimmed at no certain interval and independently of one another.  Each one also seemed to ‘flicker’ and several times changed from a reddish hue to a bluish or greenish tone.   Additionally, there were three short ‘flashes’ from the northernmost ‘object.’  It may be important to note that two of the 4 observers of this event confirmed that there may have been two distinct lights on the northern object, or possibly two objects.  These two ‘objects’ seemed to be on an approximate inclination (relative to our position) of 40°.  The distance from my location could not be determined; therefore I cannot be certain about the approximate height of the object from the ground. The total duration of this event was around 25 minutes.  By 11:10 PM (2310 hours), neither object was visible. Notes:  Weather Conditions: Clear, full visibility.  75° F. Lighting Conditions: Dark, no city street light interference.  Location south of Midland, Texas city limits approximately 7 miles. It might be worth noting that in 3 different locations which I can pinpoint by map, local police and sheriff patrol units were sitting beside the road.  Also, after leaving the location of our sighting, my friend told me that two patrol units were driving around the area.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,31.994822560975607,-102.09599847560976

I was sitting in my back yard on the east side of Tucson having a break from yard work and visiting with a friend. We apparently live in a flight path as we often have jets from Davis Monthan AFB flying over and often helicopters at a lower level. As we were talking, I noticed what my mind assumed were jets practicing for an upcoming air show in the sky behind my friend. I had this initial thought because the maneuvers of the 3 ""jets"" seemed very much like what we see when the pilots practice. As I was talking my eyes kept going back until I had to interrupt the conversation. I suddenly realized they were not only very oddly shaped, (oblong and black) but they were very close and there was zero sound. We got up and went to the edge of the yard as they were coming closer. My friend said they look like sky divers as they were apparently connecting then releasing in a triangular and straight pattern. It looked as if 2 would connect and let go then all three would do the same. This went on for a few more minutes and we both commented on things like weather balloons of some sort or perhaps some kind of weather anomaly. We were both trying to figure out the explanation. They began flashing what would be best described as, a silver light. Not in a specific pattern (not that we recognized) but random and they would stay lit when they connected into the straight pattern. It became more and more obvious that we had no idea what we were looking at. When they connected and lit, it seemed as if they ""melted"" into a single craft. Then a jet passed over the area above them. This reinforced the lack of sound as we could hear this jet quite well and it was farther than the unidentified crafts. They then began to rise into the sky as we watched the display of aerodynamics and the light show. My friend called her daughter in-law who was in the neighborhood. She told her to go outside and my friend tried to help her locate them over the phone. I ran in the house and took a 12"" x 12 mirror off the wall. We h! ad alrea dy decided that a photo at this point would be useless. When they were at their closest, we were still trying to rationalize and now they would just be too far away.  I went back out and tried reflecting light towards the ground at first to see if I could get the same reflection off the mirror in proportion to where I was situated on the ground. (They were NNW of my home when we first spotted them) After realizing I could not reflect in this direction I began trying to flash the mirror, in theirs. Perhaps I was looking for some kind of a response. My friend went to meet the daughter in-law as she was terribly excited and wanted my friend to point out what we were seeing. She was not able to find them again to show her daughter in-law, after she left my house. I watched them a total of about 30 to 40min more until they had gone so high, they were just a periodic spec of light, and then they were gone. I am no aviation expert but I have never, ever seen a plane or any other piloted craft go so high up. I keep trying to make sense of what we saw. If I had been alone, I would not have told anyone what I had seen and I would have been sure to stay out of the sun for the remainder of the day. I am considered by others and myself to be a skeptical person, so I welcome any logic that could explain all of this.",2007-02-24T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

My first thought was that it was a plane, but that quickly faded the more I looked at it.  It was not moving, just sitting still in the air.  I could see traces of light or smoke (looked kind of like what sparklers do when you light them and swing them around) and it was a bluish color.  I watched the object for the entire period.  It all of a sudden went slowly higher and the light became a small dot in the sky, and then proceeded to fly out of sight.  I know that it was indeed not a plane because I have a hot tub outside and have seen many planes fly over at night, and this was totally different.
