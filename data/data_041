My friend and I were driving cross country from Missouri.  We drove over a hill on I-70 and saw 2 lights in the sky.  We were both immediately drawn to them, and we assumed that it was just a plane.  I commented on the size of the plane considering how far apart the lights were.  We kept watching it and realized that it was not moving.  My friend said that it must be an airplane tower, but as we kept driving we realized that it was directly over the highway and it was not moving.  All we saw was two lights until we were directly in front of it when we realized that it was a ufo.  It was very flat and cylindric and sort of a gray color.  We were both mesmorized by it and everything seemed to just stand still.  The entire trip it had been very windy and the car was knocked around a lot but for the time that we were driving underneath this the wind stopped, there didn't seem to be any weather or temperature.  Neither of us were even paying attention to driving, we were just staring upward at this ship.  As we entered the middle of it it went up into a dome.  There was a flashing red light at the center of the dome, and I don't remember anything after that until we were a few miles away.  We then noticed that there were a lot of lights in the sky and we could still see the ufo in the air behind us.  THe new lights turned out to be a swarm of army helicopters that were all formed together throughout the sky all headed toward the ufo.  I watched the ufo sit there, and then all of a sudden shoot up directly into the sky.  It zoomed around the sky for a while shooting back and forth, almost like it was messing with the helicopters.  It would come right back down to being 200 feet off the ground right behind our car and then it would shoot back up in the air.  We then pulled over and got a hotel room once the ufo vanished for good, but for and hour afterward we saw the apache helicopters in the sky in the same place the ufo was.  There were alot of police officers out also that night zooming down the highway in the same place the ufo was.  My friend had his window down when we went underneath it and when we arrived at the hotel we noticed that he had what looked like a bruise on his face and we were both nauseaus and had very bad migraines.  We took blood tests to test for radiation poisoning and both were inconclusive.  My friend didn't sleep for 3 days after this happened.  Also the same night that we saw it we heard very unnatural things in the air all night, sounds that we have never heard before and things that we can't explain.  The next day my friend and I checked our cell phones to see what time this had occured, since we had made several phone calls and received several in that hour timeframe, and found that our cell phone call list had been deleted.  The calls made before 7pm were still in there and the calls made after 10pm were in there, but the calls during that time were not even in the record.  Also 1/2 tank of gas was gone for some reason.",2005-02-08T00:00:00,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

I stepped out and looked around to see if anyone could give me a jumpstart. Suddenly, I heard weird pinging sounds. I looked up and saw three saucers zipping through. There were green trails where the aircrafts had flown by. They were in a tight triangular formation. Suddenly, four or five more saucers in loose formation shot out from the clouds after the previous UFOs (which I think they were). Suddenly, a light shot out from one of the pursuiting crafts after the ones that had previously zipped by. It hit one, and it instantly blew up. When the green phosphorous light caused by what I think was a missile cleared, there was no more light there. From the rear, more missiles shot out. One of the lead UFOs took a sharp banking turn (the light started dimming, which I think means he turned away) and the missile just continued on its path. The other one took a critical hit, and the same thing happened. There was nothing else. The four or five planes in the back seemed to have disappeared because it didn't glow anymore, but later, I saw flashing lights, which I think were indicator lights. Therefore, I concluded that only the first three planes were UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I saw something extraordinary tonight, Sunday, October 16, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and I want to report it.  First, let me say a few things about myself:  I know something about aircraft.  I am an aviation enthusiast, and I am always observing things in the air.  Professionally, I am a ((deleted--media person, involved with cameras and production)).  One of the subjects I ((deleted--interested in))  is aircraft and air-shows.  In the past few months I have shot F-18’s flying at extreme rates of speed, Harriers going more up than out, high level bombers cruising at altitude, and, of course, the slower and more conventional vintage war birds.  I do this work as an officially ((specialty deleted)), not just an enthusiast.  I am not an aviation know-it-all, but I have carefully observed most known aircraft, including rockets and space shuttles.  What I saw tonight doesn’t fit into any known aircraft category in any way.  I stepped out into my back yard after 7:25.  I wandered toward the west and I saw something streaking from south to north.  It was not lit up like an aircraft should be, and it was moving faster than anything I‘ve ever seen.  It wasn’t too far away, but that was hard to judge (maybe a few blocks?).  It was moving so incredibly fast that I might have thought it was an aberration in my eyes, but then I saw it slow down and head more easterly.   Every hair on my body stood up perpendicular to my body.  It wasn’t static electricity, it was the chills.  I was terrified at that moment.  I ran under the big tree to hide from it.  I stayed there for about 10 seconds, but I couldn’t stand it.  I went northerly to get out from under the tree, and there it was--almost due north of me!  It was traveling east-south-easterly at a more normal rate of speed, like a small Cessna would.   There were absolutely no lights visible, inside or outside.  I couldn’t see any windows or markings of any kind.  It was relatively hard to see, and even if I’d have had my TV camera with me, it probably would have been impossible to shoot, because it was only visible due to the bright moon that was rising to my right.  At that time it appeared almost like a cloud, sort of in the shape of an oval from my perspective.  It seemed to be gray in color. I thought the oval-like shape was weird, because when I had first noticed it (when it was moving very fast) it seemed more angular, almost like a long rectangle.   Then it paused when it was NNE of me at about 100-300 feet off the ground.  It seemed to stay there for about 10 seconds, then as it was getting larger, I thought it was coming toward me, and I got more scared and ran toward my back door (to the south).  Then I watched it from there for what seemed like 15 seconds.   I noticed the dog two doors down was barking, and that was all I could hear.  He is usually a very quiet dog.   Then the object got smaller, or farther away.  Then it just seemed to get a little smaller still, and then it was gone.  It may have gone north or east, but I can’t be sure, because it disappeared very quickly.    I looked all around for a few minutes, but it was gone!  I don’t know how close it came to me, but it is possible that it came as close as a block away.  If it was a block away, then it must have been about 30-40 feet long.  I went inside to document the time, and it was after 7:50, so it must have happened about 7:46, and it only lasted what seemed to be a minute or less, but maybe it was longer, because I was outside for up to 25 minutes.   It was very surreal to me, and I can’t be sure about that.  What I am sure about is that the experience was exceptionally unusual. In summary, when it wasn’t moving so fast, it looked sort of like a small cloud on a moonlit night.  However, it definitely went easterly.  I noticed a short time later that there were a few clouds in the north heading westerly.  I verified this less than two hours later on the Weather Channel when I was trying to figure out what had happened.  The clouds are definitely going toward the ocean tonight!  There were no clouds in that direction at that time.   Had I not seen it moving so extremely, I would have thought it was just a cloud.  I don’t know what it was, and, unfortunately, I was alone, so I don’t have a witness or a second opinion of any kind that I’m aware of.

As we stopped for a few seconds, I looked up at the sky, which is my habit to do. At about 75 degrees up from the horizon, I saw what looked like a small star emerge from another, larger star...this was probably an illusion,as I believe the smaller object simply passed in front of the larger one. But it was this emerging that got my attention.  I thought, ""Cool...a satellite"", as the small object moved from west to east. I then noticed the quality of its illumination, which seemed to be more of a glow as opposed to reflected light or from an incandescent source.  I watched it for about 4 or 5 seconds, as it moved at what seemed to be a believable speed for a satellite(don't really know, as I am not familiar with this enough to know for certain), when it came to a complete stop.  While stopped, it remained the size it had been (a bit larger than pin head), so I do not think it was coming more in my direction, but was at a standstill.  If I had held a ruler up to the sky along the path it traveled, it would have gone a few inches over a foot, in a straight line, before stopping.  After a second or 2, it bolted in a more northerly direction...this was at about a 30 degree angle to its stopped position, and moving at least 4 times as fast as it had been ( I say this as it appeared to cover as much space going in this new direction in a little over a second as it did when moving in the beginning of my sighting, which lasted 5 seconds).  As it bolted away, it never seemed to get any closer to the horizon, which also struck me as a bit odd.  It remained very visible, and then, it was gone.  I will draw an illustration of this event, scan it, and send it via email soon.",2005-10-20T00:00:00,28.519246697974758,-81.35409597886704

My girlfriend and myself had been visiting friends up in Traverse City over the fourth of July weekend and had just left their home and were headed North along US 31.  I drive a convertible so we could see the sky for miles around us. I glanced out the front windshield in the direction towards the passenger seat and saw four lights (three white one red) over a small wooded area slightly higher then the trees (maybe 150-200 feet).  I asked her what that was since I needed to concentrate on the road.  She stated she thought it was lights overlooking a baseball diamond.  I looked again and said there was no pole or any other mechanism holding it up, and besides there was a red light right in the middle.  She looked again as we passed and said she wasn't sure.  With the top down and the radio off we heard nothing more then road noise, no sound to indicate a helicopter, plane, etc...especially one that low.  We pulled into Burger King parking lot and turned around so we were once again facing the object and studied it for a matter of seconds before I made the decision to see if we could get closer.  I pulled out and headed back in its general direction and before I even drove 100 feet it took off out across Grand Traverse Bay, and seemed to disappear instantaneously.  These lights moved faster then any jet or plane I have ever seen fly over head.  We drove back and forth along US 31 three more times looking out over US 31 before we decided to head home.  We contacted Traverse City Police asking if they had received any ""odd"" reports tonight and they said they had not.  We both discussed it for the next 20-30 minutes and neither of us could come up with an explanation.  Two days later I did a search on the internet finding many sites that showed and described things similar to what we had witnessed.Therefore I decided to post this account.

They were increasing and decreasing in size, and pulsating a bright inner white glow.  They also spun in clockwise/counter-clockwise rotations, moved at inconsistent speeds, and made split second changes in direction.  The first ""light"" came from below the tree line on the Eastern side of the bay, it literally lit up the trees and the surrounding forest as it moved upwards and then sort of ""danced"" above the tree tops...it then drifted out over the bay where I could see it reflecting in the water and then it >poof< vanished.  The next 3 lights appeared from same area on the eastern part of the bay and moved in a very slow, stop and go fashion over the water, moving up and down, left to right, sort of dancing, and then gradually dimmed out and disapeared, or moved out of my line of sight.

It reminded me of a train headlight because it seemed to be a single light and very bright.  I asked my wife if she saw it and she said ""yes"". I watched it as I drove on and another light appeared to the south of the first light at the same height.  As the second light appeared, I noticed the first light either turn or dim.  It looked like it turned but I could still see it only dimmer.  The second light then disappeared or went out and a few seconds later the first light was back to its' original brightness.  The second light then came back on for about 20 seconds and then went out. We kept driving and the lights disappeared behind the hills before we got back to Hwy. 93.  I have seen video of sightings that were dismissed as military night training flairs and such and would like to know if this could have been something like that.  I have never seen anything like this before and the flairs explanation doesn't make sense if the light goes out or dims and then returns in the same location.  I regret not stopping along the road to watch these lights instead of continuing to drive.  My wife says it was probably something explanable but she did see them also.

It was still light out, though very cloudy.  Shortly thereafter, I was in the neighborhood directly behind my parent's house when a helicopter streaked by, headed in the general direction of south. I was wearing headphones, and I could hear the helicopter over the music. It made a wide arc to the right, turned around, and passed directly over my head.  It was a black helicopter, which is more than a rarity in my area.  It promptly turned around again, and began to circle directly above me. It circled 15-20 times, getting lower and lower, as if it was out of control or looking for a spot to land.   I then took my headphones off and got my cell phone out to call my fiancee.  At this time, the helicopter was 200 or so feet in the air, very low. It was approximately 7:40.  When I began to dial, the helicopter pulled out of its low circling routine and shot off south again, flying higher and eventually up into cloud cover.   I made calls to my fiancee and my sister, but neither of them was home. I began to run again, out of the neighborhood and on a major road at this point.  With my headphones on again, I could swear I heard more helicopters.  To satisfy my curiosity, I took off the headphones once more, and sure enough, several helicopters could be heard, but they were not visible and were likely covered by clouds.  I reached a bypass in the road at a very busy intersection.  Waiting for a green light, I began to here much more air traffic, and I searched the skies convinced that I would see a helicopter.   At approximately 7:45, in the distance, due north, I thought I saw a helicopter headed in my direction. I stood and watched it for about 30 seconds until it was close enough for me to discern that this was not a helicopter.  3 triangles appeared to be traveling in formation, each one rotating on its own axis, all 3 of them rotating around eachother, with seeminly no laws of physics applying to the locomotion of these objects.  At first, since they were headed toward me, I had no real sense of their speed, and I assumed that they were slow moving, perhaps floating the same way a kite might float. The strangest thing was that, the more I stared at them, the harder they were to focus on.  What appeared to be a bubble surrounded the 3 objects, similar to the ring you can see around a full moon.  I called my fiancee and my sister again and left frantic and frustrated messages. I watched for about 2-3 minutes when they began to head off in a more westerly direction. It occurred to me to call my mother, who was back at the house I had just left. She answered, and I begged her to go out in the yard and look in the sky. She had no luck in seeing this object do to the combination of its distance, it being fairly low on the horizon, and the amount of trees surrounding my parents' house. She did, however, say how strange that was considering that she and my father had just witnessed a black helicopter acting very peculiar over the neighborhood behind us. They said the helicopter sounded as if the engine had cut out or gone out of control, as if it was in a spin before a crash. She suggested that the helicopter may have been in pursuit. I suggested the opposite as a joke. We got off of the phone, and I was still stuck in my tracks, staring at three triangles moving highly unnaturally and surrounded by a ring of strange light in broad daylight. At one point, the bottom triangle appeared to push out smoke or a vapor trail but I believe it was most likely a low flying cloud, approximately the size of two of these objects. If I were to make a hypothesis as to the size of these objects, I would have to say they could have been anywhere between the size of a commercial airliner or the size of a football field. It was very unclear, due to the varying speeds at which they moved and the fact that they were fairly distant, possibly a mile or two away, maybe more, maybe less. Not being an expert on judging things like that, I'm not exactly quick to make a concrete analysis. I was very tempted to get somebody out of their car at a red light, but I'm a really big guy, and that probably wouldn't have gone over so well. This whole incident happened over the course of about 20 minutes, but I was able to watch the objects in the sky for about 10 minutes total. For the rest of my 5 mile run, I heard several more helicopters, which is very uncommon where I live. Beyond that, I can't say I remember ever seeing a black helicopter around here. I do live 15-20 minutes southwest of Trenton's airport, 40 minutes north of Philadelphia's airport. To top it off, Newtown is home to a branch of Lockheed Martin, and the field across from Lockheed Martin played host to a President Bush rally last year. I have yet to contact local authorities or local newspapers.",2005-07-13T00:00:00,,

It was a Stealth aircraft, but I wanted to alert the center in case of sightings related to this craft under mistaken identity. I was taking my trash to the curb in my subdivision which is in a residential/agricultural community. Coming from NE to SW is a regular flight path for commercial aircraft coming into and leaving Hartsfield in Atlanta so the distant lights and noise are normal to me at all hours. We also have a local airfield in Lawrenceville, GA which accommodates helos and twin-engine craft for the private as well as business sector. However when I first took the bin to the curb I noticed in a more northerly direction a rather intense bright white light twice the size of the North Star usually seen. I stared at it for a moment then returned to get the recycling bin which took perhaps 30 seconds at most. When I looked up again the 'light' had become a huge light within a vast black 'triangle' to include a slowly flashing red light and green light in the respective lower corner angles. In the middle and slightly into the craft was a very swiftly flashing red light. I'm really bad as far as judging distance so here goes my method: Holding my hand up at arms length, and ""pinching"" the object = the commercial jets way up are about 1/4"" but this craft was about 3""! So it was very close to earth in flight. And it was totally silent! I watched it go over the roof of my house in the normal flight route and ran to the back to watch it disappear over the treeline to the SW about 30 degrees more than the commercial flight paths. My husband is in the Navy so I called him before getting excited about a UFO. He told me it was a Stealth Aircraft probably heading out toward Texas. He couldn't elaborate on anything further and I understood. I have had only one other encounter with a triangular object such as this and when I explained that one to him, he said it was most definitely NOT a Stealth aircraft! I shall report that incident next although it took place in MA back in the early 90's. I just wanted to let you know that if anyone reported this object from the past week.

I was facing south looking towards the side of the K-Mart store a few houses down at the end of my street wishing to myself that there were not so many lights on that street when, off in the distance, I (barely) noticed this orb-like object.  My first idea was that it was a planet, though that did not make rational sense because it appeared much closer than a planet would to the naked eye.  Suddenly, this object moved sideways to the right, then the left, then upwards a bit and again erratically sideways, sometimes hovering for a second or two but then always resuming its path in moving up.  By this point, my heart began racing because I realized that what I was seeing did not make any sense.  I stood there and watched the object as it continued this erratic pattern across the sky until my view was obscured by the roof over my porch.  I ran outside to the other side of the house so that I was facing east and again found the object continuing its path.  Some people on the beach (I live 2 blocks from the beach) set off some fireworks (the low-grade kind that can be bought at any store around here).  The fireworks shot into the sky a distance roughly equal to 4 or 5 two-story houses.  The orb, by this point, had moved north/northeast past the fireworks and--even with the extra light in the sky, the object did not appear to reflect the light.  For a moment after the fireworks, the object seemed to move a little fast and within seconds of that it disappeared into the clouds.  I stood there in awe for a few seconds waiting for any possible reappearance, but nothing.  Immediately afterwards, I called my family to share what I had just seen.  I am still unable to make rational sense of this.  The object made no sound and moved steadily as if on a path, but erratically.  Additionally, the object did not seem to give off any colors as an airplane or helicopter would.  The object was perfectly round, which is why I describe it as an orb.  Because it was night, it was hard to tell if the object itself was colored, the only way I can describe it is that it seemed to blend in with the night sky.  The only reason I noticed the shape is because it had a faint, but distinct outline which seemed to give off a soft glow.  By glow, I do not mean that the object itself was glowing.  I mean the only glow was in the outline.  Beyond that, the only other description I can offer is that the object appeared to have been a dark or matte metallic.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,36.02,-75.6699

As I looked at it my thought changed.  We live in a flight path of our air port and often on hazy nights when planes come in their lights look orange.  Having a love for aviation I always watch planes flying by.  As I was watching the stationary bright orange light that appeared low in the horizon, suddenly a second light light up just adjacent to the first as it went out, then a third light further away light up and the second one went out.  Each lasting about 2-3 seconds.  All of the lights seemed to be in a horizontal plane.  As I could not believe what i just saw, I stood there watching the sky.

These objects were much lower to the ground and moving much slower than traditional aircraft.  I can say this with certainty because there were planes simultaneously flying in the area (there were much higher and faster).   These objects seemed to ascent individually, one at a time.  Each ascended at an angle similar to that of a plane taking off--but this inclined ascent was done from mid-air, not from the ground.  In one instance, an ascending object appeared to come very close to a jet in the air.  After watching 2-3 do this, I lost track of the objects.   About an hour later, I saw another cluster of lights in approximately the same area of the first cluster (within several miles of each other--at the most).  This cluster more resembled a constellation than the previous one, almost like the Big Dipper where one can visually connect the objects in an ascending line.  Again, these objects were much lower to the ground and much slower moving than aircraft that was simultaneously in the same airspace.  At times, it seemed that these objects disappeared, and then reappeared shortly thereafter.  However, I did not witness the process of re-appearance because I was traveling home in a car by this point.  It is now approximately 90 minutes after I first saw this strange occurrence, and I cannot see these lights from my home.  I have never reported a UFO sighting in my life, and never before today had I ever believed I saw UFOs.  However, this occurrence was incredibly unusual, and I genuinely feel that what I witnessed was likely alien related.

I then realized that it was not just 2 but four objects traveling in a formation with one in front , the 2 in the middle (still traveling together in parallel and the last object about the same distance from the middle two as the first was and all four traveling at an apparently equal speed.  All four objects were of the same color light as the first 2 I had noticed and I also realized that the seemed to flicker a little, almost as ember that will sometimes escape from a wood fire will tend to do.    I realized that this was something very unusual so I went inside my home to get my brother and let him see these same objects to see if maybe I was jumping to conclusions to quickly.  He also couldn't figure out what these objects were but we were quite sure it was not a normal aircraft.   The total amount of time from when I first noticed these objects to when I told my brother and he stepped outside was no more than 10 minutes.   About half-way through the total course of what I could observe of these 4 objects, the 2 middle objects started altering their formation from parallel travel to an in-line formation, which put all 4 objects into one single line but all four still traveling at the same speed.  As soon as the 2 middle objects finished getting in the same line the first object in the front of the formation started to drop or lose something that to me appeared almost like little embers from the bottom of the object.  At about the same time the objects light intensity started diminishing rapidly and also the object started to increase its observed speed.  At about the same point at which the first object started to change it's appearance, the 2nd one started to alter in the same manner and as the 3rd and 4th objects reached the same point the same exact changes occurred.   When these objects would reach their dimmest but still visible appearance is when objects appeared to reach the highest observable speed before dissapearing completely from my sight.   All four objects went through the same process in the same manner from the same points in the sky but only as they reached what was the initial point of the first object in the formation.   The weather coditions were almost clear skys with only some small amounts of hazy patches of clouds at different points of the sky around my area.

In a clear section of the sky aprx 60-75 degrees i spotted some stars. I didnt know what constellation i was looking at, but after 10 seconds 1 of the stars started moving.  I thought wow that PLANE is waaaay up there.  but then another star followed the first. then i said what in the heck is that?  Then a third ""Star"" followed the second star. Peter, I realized I was staring at a triangular craft, at first on its side, then it slowly turned, and i saw the ""triangular"" formation.  Now i am pretty sure it was one craft. The lights on the craft was as bright as a small star, You had to STARE at it to even see it. there were 3 lights, one on each angle of the craft.  there was no middle light that i could see.  The craft had no color.  It look like it was tranparent, or the color of the sky. If it wasn't one craft then it was 3 lights in a Triangular formation. I saw it slowly glide for about 20 seconds before i lost it in the heavy cloud cover. The LIGHTs NEVER BLINKed, NOR FLASHED.  like i said THEY looked like 3 stars. Whatever it was it sure used the night sky as CAMOFLOGUE.  I hope you can use this.  I am i huge Art bell fan and a big fan of yours.

I could not see what cast it but it was hovering, spherical and moving across.  There was an odd humming sound.  Despite my best efforts I could not see the object fully above as it was directly over my house.  I did howver manager to make out a grey rum of whatever it was.  It was a durable looking material that must have been metal although seemed to be different to what I've seen before.  It's hard to describe but it seemed a cross between metal, plastic and foam.   It was extremly low and probably about the size of a small car.  It was definitely hovering at what I'd say was about 20 ft above my house roof.  One of the things I remember most was an odd irritating heat sensation that seemed to come over me like a hot flush.  Being inside in a cool envirnonment meant that whatever it was wasnt affecting the temperature of the environment but just my body.  It was I'm afraid to say quite frightening for myself.  I called up my son ((name deleted))' to come and try to see the object and he looked out of his window which is at the front of the house.

When the object would descend and climb it would strobe 4-6 lights in front of it and when it would spiral it would only have 2 red lights at the tips of the craft.   My daughter and I watched the lights/object in the sky for about five minutes till it disappeared.  Then I picked up my son a few minutes later at kids club and started telling him what we saw and where in the sky.   Then my son spotted the lights in the sky and so we watched the lights in the sky while in the car driving east on Chapman Avenue we stopped at the red waiting to make a left (north) on Knott avenue, that's when we noticed the second craft in the sky with the same exact characteristics as the first one and we watched the two(2) objects flying in the sky flashing their lights and spiralling in all directions.  That's when the signal light turned green and I raced down the street to pick up my wife from work and I got to her worked I parked in front and honked like a mad man telling her to hurry and get in the car so I can show her the lights in the sky so I raced around the office buildings to the back where there was a clear view of the sky but when we parked we only saw one of the objects about 3-5 miles south east but she was able to see the objects lights and its extraordinary maneuvering capabilities.   We watched the objects for approximately 2-3 minutes till we lost sight of it.   The whole sequence lasted about 30 minutes from 5:30 pm till 6 pm.

It was moving from West to East.  After looking at it for a few seconds I realized it was something unusual. I ran in my house and grabbed my binoculars and now was standing on my back porch. As the object came over my house and back into view I looked at it through the binoculars and I could see only a perfectly round white object. It had no blinking aviation lights and was moving extremely slow like it was gliding or floating. I heard absolutely no noise for as a plane at that height of which I estimate to be between 4,000 and 10,000 feet I would have heard. The light did not change in hue or intensity no matter what angle on the horizon the object moved. The shade of white also did not resemble a plane's lights. As if flew over my house and was now 30 degrees in the sky and flying away from me, the light started to fade, not turn off but get dimmer and dimmer (in a cloudless clear sky) and then disappeared with no other lights visible. What was strange was 3 things. First there was only one bright perfectly round white light with no other aviation lights, 2./It moved extremely slow at the level it was at-It seemed that it was moving so slow that a plane couldn't have flew that slow and finally 3./there was absolutely no noise at the altitude it was at. I had realized within about 2 seconds that this was not a plane. As to what it was, I don't know just that it was unusual.

We live in a very rural area, with no city lights to obstruct the night sky view and it was perfectly clear this evening so every star seemed visible.  As soon as we pulled out of our driveway and headed south we saw 4-5 VERY bright lights in a row at about 45 degrees up from the horizon in the south western night sky.  We noticed them at the same time and simultaneously we said to each other ""What the h--- is that?""  The lights were in a row and glowing very brightly, probably 5x the brightness of the brightest planet/star in the sky.  They were so bright that we thought at first someone was shooting off fireworks somehwere south of us.  But it only took a second to realize that these lights were standing still, in a row.  We stopped the truck and got out to see better as soon as we saw them.   Suddenly they began to move slowly to the west in this manner: the light to the far left end  of the row of lights would fade completely out and a new light would appear to the right end of the line and then the last one on the left would fade, then a new one appear to the right end of the line.  It kind of snaked its way along like that for about a minute.  Then, we saw three more lights of equal brightness forming what appeared to be a large triangle formation around the first group of lights, but at a distance.  These lights glowed brightly, then dimmed completely out, then glowed brightly again, then dimmed completely out.  After about 4 repetitions, all the lights diappeared, then the sky in the area they had been in was filled with random sparkles of light, much smaller then the first lights.   After about another 30 seconds we saw a single bright light identical to the first ones more to the south and higher in the sky.  It got very bright then dimmed completely out probably 3 times before disappearing.  Then we spotted another one, this time in the west, about 70 degrees up from the horizon.  Same bright light, exact same intensity, same glowing and dimming pattern.  After about three reps it, too, faded completely out and we saw more of the small sparkles.  At first I thought 'meteor shower' but meteors don't come in in lines, nor fade and glow over and over, do they?  The last set of sparkles took on a pattern, like: 3 blinks, no blinks, 3 blinks, no blinks, and moved in a very randam, almost haphazard pattern.  It was too weird.  This all took place in about a five minute time span.   We got back in the truck, going on and on to each other about how cool and weird that was.  We headed east toward town and I spotted another light, exact same brilliance, to the southwest again, same dimming and glowing pattern, then disappearing.  And again, after it disappeared, there were two sparkly lights, doing the 3x blink pattern.  I have never seen anything like this before, and would welcome any sensible explanation!   We saw several airplane lights in the sky at the same time, as we alwasy do at night, but they were obviously just that, airplanes, blinking, moving slowly across the sky.

I gazed up at the sky to see if I could find Mars at that hour, when suddenly I saw a ball of light flash (to the west).   At first I simply thought it was a light flashing from an airplane, however, as I searched the sky I could see another airplane off to the left traveling southeast with it's lights flashing.   The plane was further in the distance, but I was actually able to discern the form of the plane when its lights flashed.  But, the other light I saw was bigger and closer, but there was no form of an airplane visible.   I continued to observe the sky to see if I could follow the path of the light object to determine if it was a plane.  I continued to see this light flash quite a few times in various random places in the sky.  It did not travel in a straight-line movement like a plane, but somewhat in a wide zig-zag pattern, but more random--and it appeared to move towards my house.   The sighting ended in an instant with a large burst or flash of light energy.  The light that was round--morphed or opened up into a long rod shape (about a 180 degrees angle), and almost instantly disappeared.   At this time the object was nearly overhead and to my right, which was a west northwest direction.  After the large burst, I continued to search the sky for another few minutes to see if I could find this object, but it was simply gone.

The object was in the western sky and much nearer the horizon so that we had our backs to Mars as we watched the object. We observed the object with binoculars which made the changing colors, not just a distorted shimmer but a flashing, more apparent. It isn't the usual 'twinkle'. I checked periodically last night waiting for the object to appear and when I looked out about 23:00, there it was. The night before last, it was moving very distinctly in small increments back and forth and up and down. That's what really threw us. It didn't move as much last night.

I believe this object and all the other's that I've seen are in the stratosphere and or near space.  It's hard to tell the size.  It all depends how far out they are. If you've ever seen a satillite, it's very close to looking like that.  The difference is, when I was younger in the 1980's, they used to arc very predictably across the sky. These do appear like a dot of light in the heavens, except that these things tac like a boat would if you wanted to turn on the open sea. Left-Right-Left-Right.   The object I saw tonight though was moving so extreme I felt compelled to report it.  If you've ever seen any video of how these things move, you know what I'm talking about.  My background: I've been a Machinist for over a decade. I have a 4 year old daughter.

It was at about 30 degrees above the horizon on an apparent bearing of east by north from reference point intersection of I-26 and US64 in Hendersonville, NC moving on an apparent north-south axis across a roughly 20 degree arc, back and forth.  Range undeterminable.   Apparent speed varied from about that of a high altitude passenger jet to twice or more, usually with the lower speed for a distance followed by a high speed burst of from one to seven seconds. The short bursts were sometimes a few seconds apart; the longer isolated bursts were after a time at the lower speed.  A passenger jet was crossing at crusing speed north of the area of observation for a speed reference.  There were no audible indications of power plant noise, and no sonic booms, suggestingit wws out of sonic range. The observed object was operating in a traffic free zone.  Acceleration - deceleration was almost instantaneous. Change of course was almost instantaneous, including 180 degree course reversals. Apparent altitude was mainly constant, except for shallow apparent dives during highest speed bursts. In the high speed operations, a hint of a wake or propulsion-generated whitish exhaust could be inferred, but this could not be confirmed. Observatons were from 2,200 feet in a residential area. A yellow street light was behind me. The sky was partly cloudy, but the observed area stayed clear until the end of the observation when the light disappeared behind an apparently very much lower passing cloud. Visibility was very clear.  I am an engineer (BSEE-51, Southern Methodist University) who worked in antisubmarine warfare weapons, systems and tactics for 20 years including R&D operations at sea. I held secret clerance, top secret clearance during the latter part of that time. This was followed by analysis of various advanced electronically controlled capital goods systems. I was a Merchant Marine officer (radio communications) from 1945 through 1950. I do not want publicity. This is in effect a confidential report of observed data for those who can make use of it in a ""scientific"" analysis. I would be pleased to cooperate in analyzing this incident, if desirable. My engineering background says ""extreme performance aircraft"" in which case I have no need-to-know. The only other things I can think of at the moment are: 1) High intensity light beam played on the bottom of clouds or a vapor layer. But no clouds or vapor layer were evident, nor any ""beam"" effect. 2) A large insect close at hand (erratic flight pattern and high rate maneuvers), lighted from below. But, no beam effect, and it would require high intensity lighting from nearby source - none observed).

I live in the Sanbernardino mountains and the skys are very clear with very little light polution. Outside my bedroom I can see millions of stars at night. There is a large cedar tree about 25 feet from my window that blocks some of my view. As I woke up to see this object, it was very peculiar because of it's size. I see jet plane, helicopters, etc. all the time up here and can tell the difference between them very easily. I have also had many encounters with UFO's in my past and I know what to look for and what many of the types look like. As this bright white object traveled, it went about a slow as a satelight moves. I see many of them also but this light was much bigger and was a lot lower in the horizon then satelights. This object faded out a few times then got brighter. Just as it went behind the big cedar tree, I lost sight of it for a while but because I knew this was no ordinary object, I got out of bed to go out on the deck to see it emerge from the other side of the tree. I was tempted to wake up my wife but I didn't want to lose sight of it, so I stayed there watching it. Now as it emerged from behind the tree, it did something very common of UFO's. It stayed bright and I could make out it's shape as a circle with no haze or glow around it. It was completely circular and contained it's brightness within it self. It was much brighter then the stars and the brightness was steady and not twinklely like stars. Then, it began to dim and them brighten up again then dim. Now its was fading, not moving fast, just fading until it completely disapeared within a second right before my eyes. I watched to see if it would appear again down further, but it didn't. It just went out of sight. But before it completely dissapeared, it faded into catregories of brightness. The more it faded the more I could see it was completely round until it dissapeared completely, almost as if it went from very bright to a transparency with just the outline of the circle about it. It was strange but very exciting at the same time. Also this UFO made no sound what so ever. I am an avid UFO watcher and always look up to ketch a glimps of one of these wonders. For some reason, I was woke up at the right time to witness one of these UFO's. This will be the 4th UFO that I  have seen since I've lived up here in the last 11 years. MY son has seen 2 of them also. We often go outside at night to look for them. This is one of my favorite past times. I have also written a full report of a very close encounter of the fourth kind that happened to me in 1963. There were many witnesses to this particular UFO that made the headlines in the local papers. I was 14 at the time and a UFO actually gave me a ride in it's craft. I talked to it's occupants and can veryfy every bit of it! If you would like to read this account look up 1963, New Kensington, Pa.

Shiny distant metallic silver object through binoculars at sunset...Associated with a rising black balloon-like object.,Seattle,WA,2005-06-13T20:34:00,unknown,4 minutes,"Occurred : 6/13/2005 20:34  (Entered as : 06/13/1905 20:34) Reported: 6/13/2005 10:08:51 PM 22:08 Posted: 6/20/2005 Location: Seattle/Tacoma (between), WA Shape: Unknown Duration:4 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44393.html,"Shiny distant metallic silver object through binoculars at sunset...Associated with a rising black balloon-like object. While eating outside I looked to the NW (the direction of the setting sun on this mostly clear day under weak surficial high pressure) and noted interesting cloud fomations that I looked at through binoculars.  Much to my amazement from 2034p-2038p through the binoculars I noted a silver object (elv. 30 degrees at 285 degrees, i.e. close to the horizon to the WNW) of undetermined shape far in the distance moving VERY slowly (one twentieth the speed of a plane) and either slowing its motion or stopping every few seconds.  It was going so slowly that I really could not tell its intended direction, if any, perhaps N to S.  It was so far away that I could not make out its shape with ordinary 7X binoculars.  It was metallic silver and shiny and would have irritated the eyes if it had been closer.  Note: It was SO SMALL that I would NOT have detected it if I had not already been looking through binoculars at the time.  At 2038, a large black balloon-like object probably closer to me began moving upwards with the prevailing surface winds towards the object! (SW to NE under weak surficial high pressure).  The two objects never came in contact.  Then at 2038p I stopped to take notes thinking the silver object would just stay there and cooperate.  Well, of course, UFO’s never do, and by 2039p I could not find either object.  Conclusion:  While the silver object is a UFO since it has no explanation, the black object that was clearly below 5,000’ may have been a balloon escaping from the wealthy citizens who hold summer parties down the hill.  Anyway, I’m sure there are thousands of distant shiny silver objects reported to you that really have no significance.  Many are probably airplanes with the rising or setting sun.  However, in this instance the object was more or less stationary for 4 minutes.  But it is certainly possible that it was an airplane departing to the WNW at 285 degrees and catching the setting sun.  Yet four minutes is a long time (2034-2038).  I have some experience in meteorology yet none in aviation...and I certainly know that atmospheric illusions occur at sunset and sunrise.  I would hope to think of an alternative explanation for this yet for now it remains a UFO.  The black balloon adds interest, but I can’t say for sure if it really was a balloon from a party or not.

My wife pointed out an object flying in the sky above us, and about 7 of us saw it (four adults and three children).  The object was a boomerang/flying wing shape, and it was very large, larger than any craft that I have seen or am familiar with.  It was flying slowly across the sky approximately south, and it had a unique engine sounds, similar to powerful jet engines, but quieter.  The body was dark and barely visible, and it had small blinking red lights across the length of the craft (approximately 7 or 8 lights).  The lights appeared to blink without a pattern, which seemed kind of strange, and they did not resemble the lights normally seen on the commercial aircraft that fly over regularly.  There was (what appeared to be) a fighter aircraft that flew by a bit west and somewhat behind the craft.  We assumed that it was an escort, as it did not appear to be in pursuit, although it was clearly following/staying close.  It would occasionally bank and maneuver.  Strangely, about 10 minutes later, another similar craft flew over going in the same direction.  This one was further away from us, but it also appeared to be smaller.  It had similar lights and appeared to have a similar body shape, although it was difficult to tell.  It also emitted the same jetlike sounds. A few minutes later, a fighter aircraft flew back in the opposite direction and then banked east and flew off.  We are in a flight path of Burbank Airport, but there were no other commercial jets flying over at the time.  We are also about 50 miles from Edwards Air Force Base.  The crafts appeared terrestrial (as opposed to the object I reported in November of 2003 over Valencia, CA, which was extremely out of the ordinary).

One was in the lead, the other two were following, one on either side.  As I watched, I turned on my night vision to possibly get a better look.  Looking through the night vision, I confirmed the three objects and noted that they seemed to be travling either East or maybe away from earth. They were not moving really fast or anything, just moving enough that you could tell they were not stars.  They were definately not in our atmosphere, WAY UP. Anyway, the one behind and to the right of the lead one began overtaking the lead one and then they dimmed out into nothing, disappeared, whatever.  I don't know.  What was it?  You Tell Me?  The NEO website did not show three things that were supposed to be together in that area of the sky at that time.  I don't believe there are aliens prowling around, I don't believe in them at all.

One problem I have with UFO sightings is this, If these beings are so advanced and traveled so far to get here to our insignificant planet, then why do they need running lights on there space craft?

Suddenly, a blueish light sphere in the sky cought my eye. At first sight, I thought it was a planet because it was so bright, but I then noticed it was moving slowly so I started eliminating the facts of what it couln't be.  Fact 1- Even though it was as bright as Venus or possibly more, it couln't be a planet, because it was moving.  Fact 2- Air planes flew by higher up in the sky, so its altitude suggested it definatly couln't be the space station or a satilite.  Fact 3- Comparing it to a plane or hellicopter, their were no flashing lights on its sides, or under it, or over it. Just a bright white ball of light.  Fact 4- No sound was coming from it. At that altitude, about that of a small plane, or hellicopter, I would have been able to hear sound coming from it, yet there was none.  Fact 5- As it passed over me and headed away from me, the bright light/sphere simply faded away after about 30 seconds.  Fact 6- It couldn't have disapeared into the thin clouds in the distance, cause it wasn't high enough. Plus I could see faint stars through those clouds, so I would have been able to see the object very clearly. I was able to see the light sphere for about 20-30 seconds at most.  What was interresting too is that during 14 minutes after the sighting of the light sphere, I saw two satellights and a shooting star near the constellation Cassiopeia. I also saw a dot (like the appearence of a satellite) at the altitude of a satellite traveling about twice as fast as the previous satellite I saw a second ago.

The contractors humorously likened the object's configuration to that of a huge jelly fish.  The object remained static and fixed in its position for more than three hours. The contractors reported that it eventually ascended and moved westward out of sight at approximately 11:00 AM. A friend later called to report that he initially observed the same object at daybreak hovering over his nearby home in Scottsdale.

Then it slowly hovered in the direction down river. I estimate that I watched it for about4-7 minutes. This was in no way anything but some type of flying craft. It had no lights as it was as dark gray as it could be without being black and it had multiple windows around it's rim. The bottom did not constntly keep it's round shape but seemed to shimmy an shake like mercury dropped on the table. When it came down and stopped i thought i saw some type of wave in the air from the bottom. This really freaked me out!

It was near sunset,  mostly a cold day, my boyfriend and I were walking back to our hotel room after inspecting this neat train yard nearby. The little bit of sun left reflected off of something in the sky, a plane I had assumed, and I looked up to see why it was so bright. As I stopped and waited for the reflection to dissipate I realized that there was absolutely no noise accompanying this ""plane"" so I asked my boyfriend to look up at it as well. when the reflection finally dissolved I couldn't understand what I was looking at, it was a perfect oval, a brilliant smooth silver surface covered this ovular shaped object and it glided, smoothly, accross the sky. It kind of hovered, it moved without any noise, swiftly but gently accross the sky. I thought ""this has to be a plane or a helicopter or something like that, maybe a toy blimp some kid is playing with"" but it made absolutely no noise, and living in the town I do it isn't hard to hear noise it is that quiet. My boyfriend and I just stood there, baffled, wondering what the hell it was, trying to come up with what it could possibly be. We even went so far as to (later that evening while we were still in awe at the encounter) look in the phonebook and ask around about any nearby military bases that may be working on aircrafts. We came up with no leads. This solid, smooth, silver, soundless, oval had no windows. at first I thought it to be small, but as it neared directly above my boyfriend and I, we realized it was huge, and it was closer to the groud than any helicopter or plane could be, it was too big to be a toy or a kite, there were no windows! How was it operating if it had no windows or a remote control? After it had passed over us this, oval (as I like to call it), shot off, extremely fast, and seemingly dissappeared from sight. I have only ever seen it one time again, when I was walking in the mountains, alone, and I dare say I ran back to my dorm room (college student) as quickly as I could because I have heard too many scary tales to open a tale of my own. Believe me, I am not a natural believer of the supernatural, I do believe in ghosts, but I didn't really until I encountered one, I assure you now I am also a firm believer of aliens, as crazy as it may seem I cannot deny what my eyes beheld on that strange october day.

Out of a burning curiosity, we drove towards the object and eventually pulled over to photograph it.  We took several still photos with a Nikon CoolPix 8700 camera.  Initially, my friend insisted that it must be Venus, but upon further observation we determined that it was too large, too bright, and not where Venus should have been.   The object looked much like an extremely large, bright star.  It remained stationary for about an hour and then seemed to ""fade away,"" or possibly was covered by clouds.   We inspected the photos we had taken and then blew them up in photoshop.  The enlarged images reveal an object that was split in two-- or, possibly, two spherical objects.   We have looked all over the internet in an attempt to discover what we just witnessed and have found similar sightings.  Unfortunately, no one seems to know what it is.

I work as a night security guard just north of Deer Valley Airport in North Phoenix. I have seen the ""Phoenix Lights"" many times from this location and a few others, perhaps altogether 12 times total.  I saw them again last night (5-18-05) around 10:00pm just southwest of Deer Valley Airport over the city. It was hard to get an exact count of the number of lights involved, but I counted at least 5 which hovered stationary for about 10-15 minutes in exactly the same spot.  Eventually, a small plane which had come in for a landing at the airport swooped back up and headed in the direction of the lights; the lights faded out one by one as the small plane approached them. One of the lights seemed to pulsate red in light color while the others were yellowish orange.  In past sightings I had seen these lights in more of an amber color. Based on the color of the amber street lights both near and far (because there is a light refraction effect due to the atmosphere causing slight change in color over distance) and the observable size comparison between the ""Phoenix Lights"" and the street lights, I estimate that the ""Phoenix Lights"" would have to have been at least three feet in diameter and at least three miles from my location.  As student with a physics major at ASU, after my last sighting I had devised this basic concept in order to guage the size of what I was seeing. I know that this is not a concrete method and is only a somewhat successful estimate. I will be conducting some experiments along this line which may give me a more solid premise. The real key here is exactly what color light was actually being emitted and consequently refracted, so I have used past experiences as a model for the test method.  Over a year ago I had witnessed the lights in front of South Mountain which I later measured with my tripometer in my car to have been no more than ten miles away. Based on my recollection of the color and size from that experience and this new experience, I have come to the conclusion that the light source must be somewhere between 5 to 15 feet in diameter most likely. Hopefully, I will have devised a more precise guaging method by the next time I see them.  During this siting the lights did appear once more about 15 minutes later much farther away and appearing more orange in color; the duration of this second instance was approximately two minutes. If my estimates are correct, these are not common flares as so many debunkers (I believe someone from NUFORC even attested to these lights having been flares on Coast to Coast AM if I am not mistaken because of a statement from what was referred to as a credible source's observation) have testified in the past.  I have seen these lights do some amazing things in the past with formations and maneuvers. According to my estimates of size, these light sources would have to be remotely flown or possibly manned flights. My curiosity is piqued.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

My wife stood to see what it was and she immediately said ""stand up, you have got to see this; Hurry , Hurry!""   I caught sight of the light (which had a red tint to it) racing across the sky.

Then the light stopped dead still in the sky, within the same visual space as the star we had observed earlier. The object sat motionless for about 1 to 2 seconds, then moved left at about half the original speed for about 2 seconds.

It was spewing thick black exhasut only intermitantly as it flew.  To note"" the plane was only 1000 ft above the city.  After about 10-15 minutes of this, it flew off towards the NW over Endwell and Maine, NY. This is becoming a frquent occurance. The plane is usually grey with no symbols, tail color, or numbers on it.  Once it was seen as white with an orange tail.  I find these colors to be very peculiar.  About a year and a half ago, I saw this plane do the same thing even lower over the city.  It was a warm day, and I had the window open.  It was spewing out the same thick smoke.  After a little while, I started to have throat iratation, and sinus pain.  Very unusal for me.  Is anyone else seeing this? Please let the world know.  By the way, this plane comes around whenever there is UFO activity in the area like Bainbridge and Vestal in the last month.  Also, when this plane is around, there are no other aircraft in the sky, and Binghamton is 5 miles from a regularly used airport that services major cities.

I came out of the building where I work and looked up only to catch a glimpse of what I thought at first was a plane. However I looked again because the shape was strange and the object was very shiny, chrome like.  It was high in the air, hard to judge the distance. Not 30,000 ft, more like 5 to 10,000ft up. The shape was more egg-like than anything else but the image I was looking at seemed blury.  It seemed to be flatter on the bottom and curved on the top. The middle was unclear as if there were something around it or vapor maybe.  No I do not need glasses to see clearly. It's just that It looked like something with heat coming off of it, you know what I mean.The sun actually reflected off one part of it. It was seen while I was looking up high in the sky facing east.  It was a clear and sunny day with some scattered higher clouds.   The object was moving to the south, but did not move very fast. It was a steady movement though. There were four tall trees that were about to block my view after watching for around 6 or 7 seconds. I waited for the object to come from behind the trees. While I waited a jet came over the building behind me. Slightly lower than what I had seen, and headed east.  I knew for sure that I had not been watching a plane or jet. I continued to wait to see it come from behind the trees. It never did. I walked quickly to the south to look further but it was gone. Just not there. It could not have traveled to low for me to see and should have come out from the trees in about another 10 seconds from when it went in. It didn't! I looked around alittle longer and kept searching around when I drove to the east but never saw another sign of it. I am a Truck Driver for CCX co. and am 51 Years old.

Then we proceeded to watch it for 45 mins until it ent out of view as it was moving with the star contstellation as mentioned. The ufo was moving eratically, a rythmn was hard to determine but smaller pins of light were evidently working with the main star shooting towards and away from it like a worker bee. The main star also formed a halo of light around it that built up of about 2 seconds then the halo would shoot out like a ripple in a pond. The experience was profound and has left us both very excited, they were without doubt using the star constellation as a disguise so not to attract too much atention.

I believed it to be from X-mas light reflection, but then I noticed the light would move quickly from right to left. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I got up to see what it was and if it was windy outside. No wind and the sky was bright like a full moon. When I noticed that the light could not be from X-Mas lights or anything imaginable I took out my binoculars and noticed the light was bright white and moving in a circular motion vertically and would shift from right to left hundreds of feet and stop. Occasionally a bright white light would reflect off the mountains below this light lighting up the entire top of the mountains. I watched this light for about 20 minutes then woke my wife to see what I was watching. Within five minutes of this the light dimmed into a glow and suddenly disappeared.

Sighting took place at Lincoln and Montana street with clear blue skies. When I first sighted the object it looked like a bright white star, at very high altitude, and was motionless.  Then it started moving at a steady speed which appeared to be slow, and then stopped and remained motionless again for a couple minutes.  It then proceeded to continue on its course when another craft, which looked much smaller and at a higher altitude traveling in a direction toward the first observed craft at a much higher speed, intersected with it and continued on its course until it disappeared. At this point another object that was egg shaped and wingless with no contrail was sighted coming from the south going in a direction towards the first sighted object it did not appear to be chasing the first object or even related to it, the main aspect I noticed was the absence of wings. (Over Santa Monica there is a lot of conventional aircraft traffic and it is easy to see wings even on very high altitude aircrafts).  The first craft's flight path consisted of a huge triangle pattern over the skies, covering almost the entire field of view:  the first leg of the flight path was the high altitude part in a northerly direction; it had almost traveled out of the field of view when it came to a stop for about five to ten minutes, then changed direction and came back toward us in a southwest path, lowering its altitude, moving slow, getting brighter and bigger until we could observe it as  a delta shaped object with constant rotation; a martini glass shape would best describe it (without the stem), with one side of the triangle being rounded and the other two sides coming to a point.  While observing the object at this lower altitude and rotation another dot of light object could be seen closing on it and intersecting with it, after which the main craft hovered a while and then started heading northeast, eventually traveling out of sight.

Guardalavaca is situated about 1 hours drive from the major city of Holguin, and is on the coast. We had recently started our meal, and with me at a round table of 5 people was my brother, neice, sister, and a family friend. It was a clear sky, and the sun had just about gone down, but it was not yet complete darkness. I had my back to the view facing the coast, and the open air restaurant we were in was only a 5 minute walk to the beach.  At precisely 19.05, my brother sat opposite said 'whats that light in the sky'. We all began to observe a very bright light at about a 45 deg angle in the sky over the sea. We had been observing the stars every night, as they are so clear in the Cuban sky from what we see in the UK, and we knew instantly this was no planet or star. The light was a pulsating orange light, that was motionless. My brother said he had been watching it for a few minutes previous, and only mentioned it when he saw another orange light slowly join it. To me it was one light, but some at our table thought there could be up to four lights close together. I estimated the light to be no more than 3 or 4 miles away. We all agreed the light was orange, and slightly pulsating, or possibly expanding and contracting. Other diners noticed our looking, and they began to observe the object. Then the waiters became interested, followed by the kitchen staff who all came out and went to the edge of the restaurant for the clearest view. This was the best indication that we were observing something unusual, as the Cuban staff seemed so fascinated themselves. In all there were about 20 people watching the object.  We observed this object all together for about 5 minutes. It was about 19.10 when the light just faded and was gone. Unfortunately I did not have my camera with me this evening.  There was some background music playing in the restaurant, so we could not hear any other sound.  We ruled out any type of conventional aircraft, and as I work for an aviation company, I could only imagine helicopter(s) could create this illumination. But why anyone would want to create a bright unexplained orange light, near a tourist resort, that the Cuban staff could not explain, within Cuban airspace, is beyond me.  Our unanimous decision that evening is that we literally witnessed a UFO.  Coincidentally, the next morning my neice heard on TV that a UFO, picked up on radar, had been reported in the Jacarta region of Indonesia. Even more coincidentally, this seemed exactlty one week to the day when the major earthquake hit SE Asia just off Indonesia's coast.  Was there any conection between the Indonesia incident, and the worlds most devastating earthquake in the last 40 years, and maybe more?

PD)) GUFOG Report of Minor Observation During MUFON of Georgia Skywatch On 13Aug05 GUFOG's friend and associate, Georgia MUFON Director Mark Ausmus, was holding a Skywatch atop Brasstown Bald (BTB), the highest point in Georgia at 4,784 feet. BTB is located within the Chattahoochee WMA directly on the boundary separating Union and Towns Counties. BTB is located appx. 82 miles NNW of Atlanta. This writer arrived on BTB at about 10:00PM and met with Mark and four of his MUFON staff. This local surveillance began from the large parking and picnic area atop the mountain.   Earlier in the afternoon and evening there had occurred an EXTREMELY HEAVY period of rain which began to clear off by 7:30-8:00PM. Mist and light clouds remained down below, but the top of BTB was far above this and offered almost crystal clear dark skies overhead, with the Milky Way in plain view. Some light mist would occasionally show on the distant horizon, but it would clear off or shift, not much interfering in any way with the excellent visibility and ceiling. The moon had set by about midnight or so. Conditions for a Skywatch seemed to be mostly perfect. The wind was calm and temperatures dropped into the 60's at that elevation.   The post-peak Perseid meteor activity was consistent and rather ""busy"" at times.   At 3:57PM, the group was facing more or less to the west, with frequent 360 degree scans and a check of the rear (east) horizon. This writer had turned toward the east for just such a scan. This writer, looking toward the east, observed what appeared to be a light approaching from the NNE appearing to be traveling generally south. It appeared LARGER and BRIGHTER than the starry background. Observed with the naked eye, this light made an obvious swerving motion which seemed to make it EVEN bigger and brighter AS IF coming closer, i.e. seeming to quickly and briefly veer SW TOWARD our location. It is estimated that this light was about 20 degrees above the horizon.   The writer quickly trained 7X50 binoculars on the light and alerted the other members of the party. Upon viewing with magnification, the light appeared to be a TINY PEARL-LIKE GLOWING ORB that was proceeding quickly on a generally N to S course, it's movements being several rapid ""swerves"" upward and then levelling off, then repeating this......swerving upward and levelling off, as it traveled N to S. This N to S course was parallel to the large parking/picnic area on top of BTB. This swerving motion was OBVIOUS and seemed almost looping or ""snake-like"", especially in the first few seconds. As the ORB continued past, it seemed to get smaller and dimmer and this writer had the impression that it was veering off to the SE, AWAY from the Skywatch's BTB location. This continued until the ORB vanished among the LOW background of stars. Event duration is estimated at about 10 seconds. Even with the difficulties of determining range or distance at night, this writer had the impression that the ORB was definitely MORE than a mile away and DID in fact come a bit closer to the BTB location for a very brief period during it's N to S transit i.e. the first few seconds of observation. Afterwards, the group discussed a satellite, but the DEFINITE swerving observed by this witness was SURE and DISTINCT. This ORB was also low down toward the horizon and seemed to be traveling MUCH faster than any satellite (or even commercial aircraft) previously observed by this writer.  The horizon was noted to be crystal clear at the time of this observation.   Though this observation seems A RATHER MINOR EPISODE, recent reports of unusual and unknown aerial activity from this same mountainous region makes it advisable to describe the event for documentation.   An effort to identify this event as PROSAIC was initiated by this investigator.   The database of the ""Heavens-Above""  (HA) site was consulted.  It revealed that the closest ""known"" and readily visible satellite to the time period in question (3:57AM 14Aug05) was the ISS.  The HA database indicated that the ISS would appear at about 3.0 magnitude at 4:10:24AM at 10 degrees in the NE........maximum altitude for the ISS at that time would REMAIN at 10 degrees in the NE......the ISS appearance then ENDING at the same 10 degrees in the NE at 4:10:28.......being visible for ONLY four seconds. This is 13 minutes AFTER the observation described above by this writer.   This writer, as former MUFON of Georgia SD, ISUR Board member and founder of GUFOG, has utilized the ""Heavens-Above"" (HA) database for numerous years. It has always proven accurate during many case investigations. One glaring example of HA's accuracy would be a central Georgia investigation from a few years ago.  While interviewing a witness, she was pointing out the sky movements of an unknown craft observed the night before.  A BRILLIANT flash, almost like some high, fiery pyrotechnic device, surprised both the witness and this writer as we looked up. Upon returning to the office, the writer checked with HA and found a predicted Iridium flare AT THE EXACT LOCATION AND EXACT TIME as the aforementioned flare.  Precise information indeed.   As described above, this writer's observation from BTB at 3:57AM was 13 minutes EARLIER than the predicted appearance of the ISS.  It was also higher than the predicted ISS and TRAVELED at least 40 degrees on the compass before vanishing appx. in the SE.  Said travel seeming FASTER than previously observed satellites or even commercial aircraft.  Lastly, the movement itself was unique....seeming to ""swerve"" closer to BTB during the first few seconds, then with ""snake-like"" motion and swerves, moved NOTICEABLY UPWARDS, then leveling off, upwards then leveling off, repeating several times.   This writer is continuing with the effort to identify this MINOR unknown observation, but at this time ALSO considers the ""Heavens-Above"" information to be true and correct. Probably indicating that the unknown observation and the predicted appearance of the ISS to be separate issues.   W.T.

Also, about a month ago my son and his girlfriend were on old hwy 40 by Brookville Kansas (about 20 miles from my sighting) and spotted what appeared to be the tale of a very, very large aircraft with a set of verticle lights.  It appeared to be turning and they just saw the tail end of it, and then it suddenly flew away at unexplainable speeds (he described it like what is shown on scifi tv programs as going into hyperspeed, where it just flashes and shoots away) and he feels certain there is nothing he's ever heard of existing that could move that fast.

I was pulling off of the highway and thought I was seeing mars in the distance.  I was driving towards it in my car and noticed it was too close to be mars because it was growing in size with regards to my approach.   I pulled towards it and noticed some blinking lights... but it was not moving or not moving much.  I pulled into the CompUSA parking lot on Hopkins Crossroad and 394 and observed it some more... it seemed to be about 200 feet away.   At first I thought it was a plane, but it wasn't moving quickly enough.  It was very close.  I considered a helicopter, but it didn't seem to be the right shape or light configuration.   I parked my car, grabbed my camera, and stepped out into the parking lot.  As I grabbed my camera, it started to move.  Outside of the car I could hear a slight whirring sound like the sound of a jet, but it was way too quiet to be that close to me.  In addition, the sound was not shifting like a Doppler effect would cause.  It was constant.   I had been taking photos of the moon (or trying to), so my camera was set to accommodate the brightness of the moon against the night sky.  I was not thinking straight enough to realize this until after around five photos taken... probably over the course of 10 seconds.  Still too shocked to think straight, it traveled past me and I stopped taking pictures to get a better look at it with my eyes.   It definitely had lights and looked like a very triangular plane of some sort.  It looked closest to the F117 shape if it was a plane.  It had two white lights and a flashing red light in the middle... again, like a plane  might have.  But it was much closer than a plane could have been, was traveling too slowly, and wasn't loud enough.   I changed the settings on my camera and, by that time, the object had passed by me (this is around 15-20 seconds since I stepped out of my car).  I started taking some pictures that actually turned out.  The lights kept the same spacing, more or less, despite the angle from which I was viewing it.  It was black and when the red light flashed, I could see a slight outline of the thing.  The two photos that came out best show it against a building.   It moved across only 15% of the viewing area between the two photos and my digital camera stamped the times five seconds apart.  That seems far too slow to be a plane.  The object seemed to be pulling over the highway when I noticed another set of lights to my left.  I watched those for a moment... but I realized that those were just a normal plane.  I turned back to watch the original object but it was nowhere to be seen.   I got in my car and tried to follow approximately where it seemed to be headed but I didn't see it again.   I have those photos and they mostly show the two white lights.  I drove to a hill where I saw a UFO zipping around in the distance around six years ago and I saw what might have been it quite a bit further out.  It was moving slowly, again, and it was moving in the opposite direction.  Over the course of two minutes it made its way across the whole horizon.  It might have been a standard plane... the camera was having a hard time snapping photos that showed any detail.  The only thing odd about it was the trajectory... it was moving in an arc instead of a straight line.  But it never came much closer.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,44.9198,-93.4832

I do this every night and watch the sky all the time just hoping something out of the ordinary will happen. This night, it did. As I was looking up at the sky I noticed a light in the corner of my glasses so I glanced over my shoulder to the east. What I saw, from POV can only be desribed as what looked to be a single red light, that split two more lights from itself. These light moved from the middle light to the sides; one to the left the other to the right. They went out a certain distance and held that possition for a brief moment then vanished. The shape of the object is unknown to me, but from my POV it looked like just a straight line, which could mean I was looking head-on to an number of flying crafts, which makes it hard to tell, but it seemed way to think to be a normal jet-plane. It actually looked thick enough from the lights to maybe have been a large rectangulare structure, but I only wander how something like that could fly. I wasn't sure what I had seen, but I knew it wasn't any form of plane I had seen before, seeing as how I live close to Davis Monthan AFB and Tucson International, I am always seeing planes and helicopters flying by at night.  I walked my dog for another few steps and stopped again to clear my head of what I had seen, but then as I was looking where I had seen these lights I saw the same form take shape again. The only difference was that they were in a different spot, but in the same general direction. At this point I knew that this was not just a radio tower or something of that nature that I may had over looked the previous 100 or more times that I had walked my at night.  The only reason I decided to post this is because I was looking to find more info on the same type of thing I saw just to see what it was so i could dismiss these thoughts like I usually do, but only one problem: I didn't find any documentation that fit my desription right. This wasn't a triangle, nor were they/it moving in any direction. Nothing was flashing, just a solid red light the split two more off of it in a smooth demeanor.

But on April 8, 2005, at around 10pm, a bright light in the sky was clearly visible and almost mesmurizing.  What at first looked like a very bright star or planet had captured my eye.  After watching for about a minute, I noticed blue, then red, then yellow lights which appeared to be circling the aircraft.  At times the spacecraft would zig then zag, and you could easily see it rising and lowering slightly. I knew this wasn't a plane or helicoptor, nor was it a star or a planet. I first called my husband who was travelling home through western Pennsylvania.  He and his coworker were travelling together, and as soon as I mentioned this weird light in the sky, he claimed that they too had seen it.He said they had even stopped to get a better look.  They agree that they saw blue, red, and yellow lights and it was moving in strange directions.  He also stated there was another one that looked identical off towards the east. (I could not see the 2nd one from my window) I made phone calls to various family and friends.  All but one, went outside and witnessed it on the phone with me. A relative in Steadman, NY spotted the 2nd one as I was on the phone with him.  He and his nephew watched with binoculars and could clearly see distinction between the red and blue lights. The light slowly started to fade away at time and then would reappear as bright as ever. I slowly headed off to west by about 11:30pm.  I could still see it out my window, but it was blending in more and more with the other stars and I had to struggle to see it.  At that time I decide to take a drive out into the country where I could get a better view.  But by the time I got onto the highway, the first light had complete gone out of sight and the second was following the same direction.  They were now much farther away then when first spotted.  You could not make out the color changing lights as well, but you could still watch it hovering on the horizon. By 1pm, it was completely out of sight. My cousin, in Steadman was measuring it's location by using the utility pole in his yard.  He could not believe how an object he had watched hovering for so long could move across the sky and out of sight so quickly. I was baffled and probably will continued to be.  It was extremely exciting to have witnessed it. I hope to see other stories of last night's sky show. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested more information.  We have requested that the witnesses look again on April 9, to see if they witness the lights again.  We suspect they may be looking at Sirius in the west, and Jupiter, which currently is visible in the eastern sky during the time indicated.

A few minutes pass and the light moved straight up and slowly started heading toward the hospital.  It was moving so slow that I asked ""Is is me, or is that light moving toward us?""   She agreed with me and and it took about 5 minutes for the light to move 3.5 miles. Its movement was a constant speed and the light didn't change its speed of pulsations.

I could only observe some black construction of an aircraft around the light. I also believe that what ever it was we saw had to be relitivly small.

But, what I saw yesterday was unreal. I stepped out on my deck because it was a very nice day, not a cloud in the sky. We have a large amount of air traffic in my area and I enjoy watching the various jets fly by.  Yesterday there was a jet that was lower than normal and it caught my attention. As I was watching this jet, I notice what I first thought were five birds swirling around. It didn't take me long to realize these were not birds. In fact, they were shinny dots. I thought, ""What the heck is that?""  These things were not moving across the sky, they were staying in one general area. Then they went from this swirling dance into a perfectly straight line. It was at this point that I knew for sure what I was seeing was not balloons or birds or planes or helicopters or anything I had ever seen before.  OK, now they have my attention. From the straight line one of the dots just vanished. The remaining four spread out across the sky and formed a perfect square and drew the square tighter until they were close to each other again. Then another one of the dots just vanished and the three remaining formed a straight line again. They then spread out across the sky again to form a perfect triangle.  I ran into my house to grab my video camera at this time. I think I was back outside in about 10 seconds. When I returned, they were doing the same thing they did with the square. Going from a large triangle down to a very small one at which time they broke it off and danced around each other again. Then two of the dots vanished. The remaining shiny dot just stayed in position for about 20 seconds, It darted back and forth for a few more seconds and then just took off into oblivion.  That's what I saw. It was real, it was there and I can't believe it. I have no explanation for what I saw, but I saw it. I don't know if I got anything good on video. They were VERY high up and very small.

On 04-09-2005 I saw what I believe to be a UFO in Comanche County Texas at 9:12 local time.  I offer some unique observations.  That evening, I was walking back to my motor home after wildboar hunting in an unpopulated area that I lease for hunting.  The sky was clear; wind calm and the sun had just set.  The sky was growing darker and darker blue straight above and stars were beginning to show.  The sky was becoming black in the east.  The setting sun was still keeping the western horizon illuminated and indirect lighting from the west made it possible to see my way without a flashlight.  I had my .243 Win. Remington 700 varmint rifle of which I am a quite an accomplished shooter.  It is considered a ""high-powered"" rifle.  I do quite a bit of bench rest competitive shooting with it as well as hunting.  The rifle is set up with a high-tech ""Leupold"" optical sight, (scope) which is extremely accurate and highly specialized for great light gathering ability and performs best in low light conditions.  It is not what is called a ""night vision"" sight.  The scope magnifies the target image with great sharpness and definition and the magnification is adjustable from 4.5 to 14 times that of the natural image. Upon my return to the motor home, I was tired after a long walk.  I had carried quite a bit of equipment with me.  I sat on a chair, took my eyeglasses off and toweled my face as it is already becoming hot in Texas.  While I rested, without my glasses on, I noticed three very ""unfocused"" lights to my south and these lights were moving toward me.  Immediately I put my glasses back on and saw what I believe was a UFO.   (SEE ATTACHED ANIMATIONS) (a)  Is the appearance of the vehicle without my glasses on and (b) is the view I had with my glasses on.)  (I drew the images on my pc)  The object approached from the south-southwest and while moving north-north east, passed almost directly overhead making no sound whatsoever.  I estimate its altitude to be somewhere about 800 feet and its airspeed speed approximately 30 mph.  It ""floated"" and did not fly as it obviously had insufficient airspeed to fly.  (I am a Physicist & an FAA Licensed Pilot)  While the sky was almost entirely black behind it, I could clearly see its underside as it was illuminated from the fading sunlight to the west.  I estimate that the machine was about 60 feet wide and 80 feet long and 10 feet thick at the rear.  Under its belly, there was a straight line going from its leading tip toward the center of the aft edge of the fuselage, which was perpendicular to its travel.  This straight edge clearly showed its shape to be three-dimensional.  The straight line showed that its belly was V-shaped, much like the hull of a speedboat.  It was similar to the space shuttle as when viewed from in front and below the shuttle.  This machine was directly over me and I was alone in the middle of nowhere, therefore, I felt quite ""uneasy.""  It made no threatening moves whatsoever, but I aimed my rifle at it and through the riflescope, which was set on 8.5 power, I could clearly see surface detail in explicit detail.  The machine’s surface detail appeared to be covered with well-fitted tiles, much like the ceramic tiles used on the United States Space Shuttle.  Then in the fading light, I noticed a distinct marking.  This marking was absolutely shocking, as I could actually read it!   It was white print outlined in black on a red arrow pointing toward a rectangle of sorts.  The arrow pointed at a something rectangular that I cannot define, but I clearly could read these three words, “EMERGENCY RELEASE and RESCUE.”  In the same place were other words that appeared too fuzzy to read.  I suspect that these words were “PULL FOR...”  Instantly I realized that this was a military machine and no “flying saucer.”  I felt much better as I knew that these were surface details that were intended to help rescue people access and then be able to remove the pilots on board in the event of a crash.  I kept the crosshairs on the center of the aircraft as it disappeared into the darkness but as I realized it was “one of ours” and it was not a threat to my own personal safety (I think) I put the rifle safety back on.  I can see however that others may have “defensively” shot at it --- and that may have resulted in a crash of the vehicle.  I am somewhat “pissed off” at the military as while this area is directly under the Ft. Hood, Texas MOPA and practice flights are flown daily, really - they should not be taking chances like this where someone on the ground could actually be shooting the damned things down!  I am sure that the military pilots (if it even had a crew…) were aware of my presence but they NEVER expected possible “offensive action” to be taken against them on this low level flight.  The last thing I would have ever have wanted would have taken a “defensive” shot and then find American military pilots onboard in the wreckage.

Planes are not multi directional and can hover in suspended motion. they are of a shape like a ball, and they are a bright reddish orange at night, and by day they are white, because extreme hot surfaces tend to have a white tint to it. And when I said it left at a high rate of speed, It left the earth at a high rate of speed. This is the fourth sighting of this particular UFO, and they all left the earth at extreme speeds. They come and go!... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))",2005-02-22T00:00:00,34.29281166666667,-118.25722833333333

I was laying on the trampoline in our backyard looking straight up when I noticed the stars being blotted out by something.  Conditions were clear directly above me, no moon, very dark sky. There was a light cloud layer to the north approx. 800 - 1000 feet high.  I focused on the craft and could see it was about 400 feet above me.  Completely dark with a very light grayish V along the botton.  It was going very, very slowly and there was no sound what so ever. There was also no masking noises in the area to block any sound it might have been making.  It was moving south to north very slowly.  It was extremely difficult to see and although it was very close, it was very, very dark.  It had no lights of any kind.  No wingtip markers, no strobes, no anti-collision lights.  There was significant commercial air traffic in the air and it was flying right under the landing path for BWI aircraft as it traveled north.  As it passed over I got off of the trampoline and walked to the hillside to get a rear view.  When it was between myself and the cloud layer it was almost completely triangular.  I would have thought it was an Stealth Fighter F-117 but the tail was not serated, and it was flying way, way too slowly and with out any marker lights.  I had a good low angle view to its rear and still saw no marker lights.  I thought I should report it.  A thousand of these could have flown over my house and I would never have seen them.  It was extremely difficult to see.  I have seen stealth aircraft at airshows, both in the air and on the ground, but this was totally silent and only going perhaps 30 or 40 mph.  It would have passed directly under BWI landing pattern traffic landing that night from the north, NW of Baltimore.",2005-02-22T00:00:00,39.437,-76.7818

They were very bright white lights, I don’t recall seeing any colored lights, and they were moving slowly westward.  I went to look for my binoculars in another room, when I got back into the living room the lights were traveling in my direction.  I went out to the front porch to get a better look and try to hear the aircraft, they were moving very slowly, not like an airplane or helicopter, I thought maybe a blimp but couldn’t hear any sounds coming from the lights.  The lights passed in front of my neighbor’s house which is north of my position, their house being approximately 300 feet away.  How far the lights were in front of their house I have no idea, but they appeared to be right in front of if from my point of view.  The distance between the lights was the size of two of my fists held at arms length, and black in the center, in other words I couldn’t see anything in between the two lights, which led me to think maybe a blimp but still no sound what so ever.  Maybe it was two aircrafts flying side by side, each with one light on them, whatever it was all I could see was the light, not a shape of a craft or anything to describe how it looked.  I lost them behind the trees on our property, they were traveling west/southwest at the time and I didn’t spot them again on the other side of the trees.  My neighbors who live in the house described above were gone at the time and the other neighbors I talked to didn’t see it. ((NUFORC N",2005-02-22T00:00:00,46.6271,-123.0092

I had just stepped out of Shaw's Market on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston and a bright object in the sky caught my attention. I looked up and saw a small disk glowing very bright green, just the color of a traffic light. It moved quickly across the sky in a westerly or slight southwesterly direction. As it moved away from me it appeared only as a white light. It streaked across the sky very quickly, being visible for only about a second, and then disappeared from sight.  I was left rather stunned and wondering what it was. I would rule out any commercial or private aircraft. I would estimate its altitude at somewhere less than 10,000 feet. An aircrat at this altitude would move much more slowly. In fact  several minutes later I saw a plane cross the same area, and it was tiny and moving very slowly. The object I saw was also completely silent. The lights it displayed did not resemble those of a typical aircraft. I have observed military aircraft over Boston. They were extremely loud. If this was a stealth bomber why would it display the bright green light?  I would also rule out a low or high orbit satellite as I have seen them before and they look completely different.

I didn't recall a building being there so it sparked my interest that much more.   Through binoculars it looked cigar shaped.  The middle of it was radiating with  very bright lights (white, blue, red, orange).  It was stationary for a couple of minutes but then started slowly moving north. The object disappeared behind a building that's about 300 yards from me and I never saw it appear on the other side.  It's initial location was about a mile or a little less directly north of E.D.S.

Around the 30th Street Exit (Kennydale) they saw a craft of some sort that seemed to be hovering over Lake Washington. My wife said that it seemed circular, and the lights were like nothing she had ever seen on an airplane. She had the very real feeling that she could possibly be seeing a UFO.  It was still dark so no details of the craft could be determined other than the ""odd lights"". Just tonight (1/27) my friend called and he wanted to tell me about something he saw in the sky. It turned out it was the same approximate time and place as my wife's sighting. Neither of them had known the other had seen something, let alone at the same time.  My friend said that it was definitely circular and hovering. The lights were around the whole craft and ""Revolving"". He knows what airplanes and helicopters look like, and this he said, was nothing like those. The revolving lights in a circular pattern was what really got - and kept - his attention. He said he kept his eye on it to the point that he almost hit the car in front of him. Approximate time of sighting lasted 2-3 minutes until he could no longer see it in his rear-view mirror.

A military Helicopter had just passed below it heading south, this is what brought my attention to look skyward. I was in my backyard. It looked like it went into the cloud, but it may have been above the cloud.  Straight direction, steadfast in its course.  It was traveling faster than the clouds. Seems to me that if it were a weather balloon it would be traveling the same speed and direction as the cloud.  In the time from when I snapped the  photo to when it went into the cloud I could not get another photo.  It was traveling every bit as fast as the helicopter.

The satellite was flying North to South at what appeared to be a normal speed compared to other satellites I had seen.

But then it stopped again, and then rapidly increased its speed, flying in zig-zag and circle patterns. It then appeared to dim and brighten every few seconds, i suspected that it was flying up and down, altering its altitude.

The objects moved back together again.  This separation and merging happened a number of times.  The lady went to her condo and returned with a pair of Bushnell binoculars.  This was then approximately 1:30 AM.  When looking through the lenses she was extremely ecstatic at what she was seeing and quickly passed the lenses to me. The ball of light had separated into 4 parts, 1 large, and three smaller parts.

Each ribbon like structure had unequalled clarity and brilliance composed of distinct red, green, yellow and white sections. At the time we were passing the lenses back and forth, the ribbons coalesced into a brilliant luminous sparkling white ball. The white ball then formed the shape of a oval gem with subtle opal like colors.  It was extremely beautiful. From the gem state, the ball turned brilliantly white and sparkling again and seemed to rotate.  There appeared on the left side of the white ball high speed circular colored rotations of light.  From this state the ball turned into a state that looked like the top of a round diamond with thousands of brilliant facets.  Awesome!!

UFO!!! There were three of us in the car who witnessed the ufo in the sky. I first noticed traffic slowing down on the 210 freeway East around 8:30 PM. Then we saw it in the sky. Not to mention hundreds of other people on the 210 East freeway traveling the same direction as us saw it as well I'm sure it was hard to miss. It looked like three balls of light stacked on top of each other. Like fireballs with rings of fire around them. As we watched the lights shoot up and down in the sky unlike anything I've ever seen. Very fast and precise. Then it moved to the right and stopped, disappeared and then returned to the same place it started at. It blinked on and off a few times and then red led type lights appeared to beam hundreds of feet off the sides of the craft. It then started to turn clockwise blinking the red lights up into the sky and down towards the ground. We pulled over and stopped in the center of the freeway derider lane to watch it. Other cars and trucks did the same. As we exited the car the lights went behind a hill. Came into site again and then shot off to the south east and disappeared. My girlfriend who never believed in Ufo's or Aliens is now 100% a believer. My girlfriends friend was crying from what we were seeing. I am still having a hard time believing what I saw and I have always believed in other life and ufo's. Please contact me for further details and as I'd like to see it anyone else reported what we witnessed. Thank you. Don't think I'm nuts but I also have a photo of another UFO I took over a year ago. Please take a look at the speck of what looks like dirt above my dads head in the picture zoom in on it tell me what you think it is. It was taken with a digital camera in Hollywood Ca, in the afternoon. I have the time and date written down somewhere.

Arrow Highway was heavy with traffic and we looked over at other cars to see if other people were witnessing the same event in the sky. My friend asked me to pull over; but with traffic so heavy we didn't get the chance to do so. In less than 2 minutes the object regressed in a westbound direction out of view. It was unbelivable to see yet frightening at the sametime...My friend mentioned he had served in the USAF and commented that the object could not have been an airplane, jet, helicopter, etc. because of the direction(s) of flight and the rate of speed of the object.

It had been a hot day, so I went out on my balcony to water the plants. There I saw coming from my left side - it's southeast - an orange light shining so bright, that it looked starshaped - like the kind of star you put on the top of a christmas-tree. The object was about 7 to 10 meters(30 feet)above me, who lives at the top floor of a five-floor building. That would make the altitude of the light about 25 meter (75-80 feet). That early in the morning my neighbourhood is totally quiet, so I am absolutely sure that the object was soundless. It flew slowly right above the middle of the street making the darkened roofs glow in the light. It was not a flare. There was no wind, and a flare would have a downwards glide. The thing flew silently keeping its altitude on a north-western course across the port of Copenhagen, and after a kilometer or so it turned westwards. I was so busy watching it, that I hadn,t noticed the other one, until it was right above my head. The second one was looking the same and took the exact course of the first one. My estimate is, that there was about 1000 to 1500 meters between them. The velocity was about 8 mph. It too turned westwards. I've reported it to the danish ufo reporting center, but so far no other observations have been made. I am quite stunned about this and was sure, when I watched them, that they were not man-made. One thing make me wonder though. President George W. Bush is visiting Denmark july 5. to thank the danes for participating in the Iraqi war. So every spot of Copenhagen is virtually vacuum-cleaned, and there is a swarm of american security-agents around. Maybe these 'ufo'es are new military reconnaissance aircrafts. If they are, the lack of sound is astonishing. But if they don't want to be seen, it's odd, that they shine so bright.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,,

I just had my binoculars focused when i noticed the object started to move. My heart started beating real fast as i watched it pass directly over my house.

It made no sound and, from my best quess was at an elevation   equal to or slightly higher than airliners at their maximun cruzing altitude. The object had no other lights blinking or otherwise that i could see, it was traveling at a very high speed. As soon as it passed over me i ran to the back door of my house and started to pound on it, my body tingling from my adrenaline rush, i had to get a second opinion or maybe just have someone else see it too.  The door opened and i pointed to the sky and said ""so, tell me what you think of that, I was wathing it through my binocs , i could of swore it was stationary, they all of the sudden it was moving!!

My friend I both saw the same thing. This sighting is our first and only. This happened only a few days after a young man (16y) drowned in mitchal pond/lake. I live in Lakehaven apartments and the lake is next door. This death was all over FOX news. I doubt a significants. I was showing him the candle light mural that was floating where the young man was found. There is a baseball park ajacent to the lake and a tree line dividing the two. As we walked I noticed a ball game in progress. I saw over the tree line on the horizon, an orange glow. I thought at first fireworks dieing out and blowing in the wind, but no. They kept moving, and there were six. Flying in formation, Three in front and three in rear. The front formation was a diagnal line of three. The rear was a triagle pointing to the front formation. It would have seemed a large single craft if they weren't oscelating freely. They moved slightly in an imperfect formation. This formation continued accross the sky, which was a clear dusk sky. The indivividual objects were a color that I can barely describe. Amber, blue, grey all put together. The light was not incandessant, nor hallogen. It was more irridessant, a glow. But a glow should not be able to be visable from the distance we saw them at. The distance is impossible to estimate because of the undetermined size of the craft. They appeared very high in the atmosphear, and were moving over the horizon very quickly, but soundless. There was no light bending or streaking, as a fast jet may cause if it flies fast enough and emmits a bright light it may streak to the observer. The only way to describe the apperance of the UFOs is they resembled a size magnified human egg. Round with an inner circumferance and an outer. I screamed ""What the **** is that?!"" repeated several times. There were several other people arround the lake, but when asked they calimed to not have seen anything. Only my friend and I saw it, that we know of. We did ask anyone and everyone we saw near the event only to our dismay, as we began to feel insane. As the Crafts continued across the dusk sky, we both observed them vanish one by one, front of the formation to the back. No sound, just dissapeared. I have no explaination as to how they dissapeared, other than they left the atmosphear or had some otherworldly technology. I'm not saying these definately were visitors of another world, but what we saw was not military in my oppinion. I highly doubt humans have a craft as we observed. If this were millitia I would assume it to be top secret and would not be flown over a residential area. I know what I saw. It was not normal. We were frightened. I do believe us to not be alone in this universe, as it would not make sense if we weren't. But why would someone come here? Discovery? Warnings of impending self desctuction? War? Please contact me at Guitardude823@aol.com. I am very curious as to what the hell we saw.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,41.91528169934641,-88.12873986928103

Dunno If this will help anyone but I am a 29 year old male with 1 child and this is the greatest thing Ive seen since the birth of my daughter. I beleve we are not alone in the universe.I just wish I had a video camera.,2005-07-05T00:00:00,,

I jumped out of my truck to see what she was pointing at. I saw an object that was rectangle in shape and was only around 50 feet above the light polls in the parking lot.  The object was around 2 feet wide 4 feet long and razor thin. It had a transparent texture with holes. In other words it looked like a rectangle frame covered in wax paper and the wax paper had all holes evenly spaced in it and only the outer rim of the hole would stand out. The centers of the holes were also transparent.  This object stayed in one spot rotating very slowly. As it rotated the sun would shine off its edges. This is what would keep you from loosing sight of it. The center did not reflect sunlight.  I was wondering why it wasn’t blowing around in the wind. The wind was around 10 miles and hour and gusty at times yet this object wasn’t affected by it.  Besides myself looking at this object, there was the lady who got my attention to look at it along with other people around her.

At about 20:24 she said in an excited voice that 'she saw it and oh my God it is so big,' etc.   I told her it was too early for the ISS, but she insisted and said it was no satellite or meteor. She said the oject was rectangular and had some appearance of depth leading her to believe it had the shape of a rectangular box.  It was bright yellow with no other lights.  She said it appeared to be on a course from N to S as if some intelligence were guiding it. It was not drifting aimlessly or shooting like a meteor. She said she did not notice any physical effects in her body, but I heard an uncharacteristic agitation in her voice.  The object came from the N at about 30 degrees when she first noticed it.  Mom held a 3"" by 5"" box in her hand and said that is how large it appeared in the sky with the luminescence as bright as the moon.  The highest elevation observed was approximately 75 degrees. She noted that there was a small plane in the sky and also a jet that seemed to be going in the same direction as the rectangular craft.  She kept saying ""that jet must see it.' When the craft disappeared from sight in the N facing window,she went to the southerly kitchen window to see it again and it vanished. She is sure it did not go behind a cloud.  She checked other directions, but it was gone.  Had the object retained the same speed, she should have picked in up again at another window. It was a clear night, so it either sped up or just disappeared. By then, I was out on my deck in Gloucester and could not see it.  If it had been there, I should have seen it.

About a 1/4 mile North of Argo road, I stopped in the middle of a conversation because something amberish color caught my eye about right at my 10'o clock or Southeast from us.  We started to really observe what the hell it was because we thought at first that maybe it was just a tower.  The light seemed to be about the same size one of those tower lights look like....height and everything, but it was flickering like it was burning.  It wasn't a red light like the towers have.  I mean it was orange like fire.   Then we realized that it wasn't a tower when we got passed the hills and trees and seen that it was clearly up in the sky a cosiderable height.  It wasn't a huge thing in the sky at all.  We keep heading South coming up to Pink Hill Road, then all of a sudden it got smaller and smaller.  This was very strange because it got so small it just looked like one of those tiny, tiny white-ish, blue-ish stars in the sky...just a speck.   Then it started to move West accross Blue Springs very slowly and as we got closer to I-70 we could see flashing red and white lights, just like our airplanes and helIcoptors have.   At this point we were really confused because we thought we just saw a plane catch on fire or something, then it goes out and it's flying like normal.  As we stop at the stop light at I-70.  The flashing lights were flashing one at a time next to each other in a linear motion but around the object.  And it had a larger light underneath.   It seemed like the lights were moving in an oval shape, but as we tried to follow it, it completely did things we have never seen before.  It looked like it completely shifted shape because of the way the lights were positioned before it started moving slowly away from us, but really far at the same time.  It's kind of hard to explain without speaking with someone directly.   After we were following it West it turned North, but in a matter of about 15 seconds it kept getting smaller and smaller, then it disappeared over the horizen.  The whole weird thing about is that it looked like it wasn't hardly moving and yet it was coasting along silently and then disappeared.   It seriously felt like when we started talking about what we were seeing and following it, it was like it knew and changed from a fireball and shapeshifted to a somewhat shoddy airplane look a like and then slowly drifted away into the horizen, but like I said over a 15 second period.  It had to been moving really fast.   We also thought that maybe it was something that came back into the atmosphere at a great rate of speed and then proceeded to fly over our airspace, hence the fire at first cutting throught the atmosphere.  I don't know, it is really strange.   I have never seen anything like this before and my girlfriend and I hope that we can talk to someone who may have watched the whole thing like we did.  I even called my buddy who was at dinner with me to check the sky and see if he could see what I was seeing, but he was already heading South on Lee's Summit Rd and it was too far North by then.  I checked my cell phone to see what time I called him and it was at 11:26PM.   For the most part we spent about 5 and half minutes driving from Argo Road to Winsteads parking lot trying to figure out what the hell it was, then spending another minute and half or so trying to follow it.  It was moving so strangly like it was on one constant linear path of energy or something and it was moving so freely, I really can't explain it.  It looked like slow motion, but it moved away from us fairly quickly obviously because it was gone within about 15 seconds after we tried to follow it.   We got to Woods Chapel Rd heading West on South Outer Rd so we could head North to follow it but it was out of sight after we passed the Saturn dealership and that's when I called my buddy.   Did anyone else see this??????????  Has anyone seen anything similiar before in another experience?   I know for a fact I'm not crazy and neither is my girlfriend and we are simply dumbfounded.   My whole perception just completely changed.  Either our government has some really cool things we don't know about or we have something going on up there that we either know about and don't want to tell the public or they simply don't know about it at all....and that bugs the hell out of me. ((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   Thank you for responding to my report and please, call me ((name deleted) .   I will do what you say and call my local authorities and media agencies to see if I can locate some more witnesses.  We couldn't have been the only ones.  I can see where if someone glanced at it, they probably just thought it was an airplane after it shape-shifted and thought nothing of it, but someone else just had to see the start of it.     I have always been a believer, but have never experienced anything like this and it has truly left me annoyed by not knowing what it was.  I am a very sincere and credible person with people who know me and this is one of those things that we haven't told no one else yet because they will probably think we are joking around with them.  They would think it's one of those ""true lies"", where a story is so unbelievably true that it has to be a lie.     We want to try and contact other people in Blue Springs first who saw it before we really go in depth talking about it.  I felt comfortable explaining everything to you of course since your website seems to be the prominent site that appears in search engines for reporting this kind of thing.  If you or anybody that contacts you about it want to call me, that's absolutely fine with me.  I will definitely keep you informed of my progress.   Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM)) I just wanted to know when my post will be available for others to see or if I could get a copy of it so if I do find other people who saw something, I can use it as a point of reference.

This cycle continued for 5 or more minutes, with no set pattern as to how they would appear.  However, the patterns that the object or objects made appeared to be equal and precise.

The twinkle of light pulsed again but this time it had significantly progressed towards the northeast.  I became very focused on it now and watched very close for it to happen again.  And it did do so five or six more times before it exited my horizon to the northeast. The pulse of light was consistently not very bright and looked more like a ""thin rod"" that I can best describe. It was hard for me to judge its altitude.  The initial pulse that I thought was a lightning bug seemed to be just above roof top level. But as I focused on the remainder of the occurrence I realized I could not accurately determine its altitude. The whole event took less than three or four seconds at which time it had gone from horizon to horizon.  It was a pretty clear night, a fairly bright moon in the western sky, to my back and city lights, (O’Fallon, IL) slightly illuminating the north/northeast horizon. I guess it could have been a meteor but none like I've ever seen. It appeared to be traveling at a ""level altitude"". It did not appear to ascend or descend. It was traveling to fast to be any known type of conventional aircraft that I'm aware of. ((NUFORC Note:  Pulsing lights in the night sky can be tumbling boosters in orbit.

I am an amateur astronomer, but I usually view the sky in the early evening to about midnight. The milky way is just to the west of my house at this time of the morning.  As soon as I stepped onto my upper deck I began to gaze at the sky.  A flash of light is what originally got my attention.  When I focused on the spot just to the west of me,  I noticed three star like lights with the magnitude of about 5 1/2.  They were moving in perfect formation like a large 100 degree triangle pointing in the north to about 5 degrees maybe to the east. They seemed to be following the milky ways direction or they were atleast in that portion of the sky. They did not twinkle or vary from their formation.  They continued in their direction, northwardly, until they were lost in the distance. It took about 1 to 2 minutes for them to pass from almost directly above me to the horizon. I am not usually up at this time, but I know this is a popular time to view satellites and I have never seen one to know the difference between ufos and normal celestial objects that would be moving that way.  Another thing.  I could see stars inside the triangle so it was not one solid object.  It was like watching a small constellation move across the sky.  There was no sound of jets, but I live along side a noisy highway so there was some highway noise.  What made this seem so special was the way they moved with such precision together across the sky.  I think there is a logical explination for this, but would like to know if what I saw was a ufo. I don't know why I saw a flash of light first, or if that has anything to do with the formation.  It could have been a shooting star, but what a coincidence.  I live about 60 miles north of Houston so there is alot of air traffic and they go in that direction the most.  I think I have included everything to the best of my knowledge.  I hope it is relevent.  I am a christian who believes that if God included everything about our universe, the Bible would never end.  He lets us figure some things out for ourselves.  I believe we are the only humans with the ability to have the holy spirit in our hearts, but nature is an awesome thing.

We were returning to our house in Alamo Heights, walking past the high school. - I commented on the beautiful sunset to our left, and we stopped our walk and both admired it. It was quite pretty, one of those really good, bright Texas sunsets. - My wife then pointed out a distinct ball that had appeared in the sunset clouds... - It was absolutely distinct, with a greyish edge outline... I looked (skeptically) to where ((wife's name deleted)) was indicating and saw the object very clearly. It was an ""Aw Sh-t..."" moment. - The object appeared like a distant but clearly round planet would appear out in space, distinctly round, very likely a globe, but with no surface features. It appeared to have a smooth surface. - Things began to get pretty weird, pretty fast. We saw more and more  distinct balls appearing throughout the cloud banks. then after there were several large globes / balls in view, some of them suddenly began having 3 - 4 smaller balls appear right next to them... I believe that all of these new spheres appeared to the objects' left, our right. Some of these new smaller globes / spheres then would move off...  I simply could not comprehend what I / we were seeing. - We estimated that in total there were at least a dozen large objects and many more smaller objects. - They were primarily in two sizes and round shapes, but there were some triangular ones as well. The triangular shapes had rounded corners. - The objects were as distinct and solid-appearing as marbles. - These were very distinct balls or globes, with definite firm outlines and consistent appearances. Some when they appeared were triangular, but they remained that way, and the round ones stayed round. They all remained quite distinct and clear through this episode. - Early on I saw one that was so distinct and bright that I mentioned to ((name deleted)) that it looked like a plane with its landing lights on... Monica told me she had not mentioned it because she was sure it was a plane. Although the light was red, I thought this airplane might somehow help explain what we were seeing. We both viewed this specific object for a while, and it wasn't an airplane. It moved to the right for a bit, then stopped and hung there.  It hung in the sky throughout the episode. - We spent the next 5 minutes or so excitingly pointing to other globe / ball or triangular objects that simply appeared, or others that were moving left or right relative to all the other balls. - This type of activity was going on throughout our field of vision and beyond so that we had to scan a bit of the sky to take in all the objects. I estimate around a 20 - 30 degree field of view was necessary to encompass all of this. We of course were primarily going from one specific focus to another, but I would occasionally widen my view to take in more of the big picture. - As time passed, to the left side of the scenario, we watched some smaller balls that had come out of a larger ball morph into what looked like small, fiery-red, still distinct objects against a very dark background. All of this developed quite quickly. The objects continued to morph into more and more complex shapes and more detail against the dark background. It appeared to me that they morph'd into some sort ofcuneiform, or hieroglyphics. The images were quite distinct and clear, if very small, but what they were specifically I could not tell. - ((name deleted)) later described this same activity as looking like ""moving braille-like characters"". - This particular display then morph'd into what looked exactly like a medium-sized city at night (black background, white glowing city lights) as seen from onboard an approaching aircraft. This scene first appeared to be a view from directly above a city, but then the view angled down to look exactly like the view one would have as they were landing into a city at night. - I kept telling ((name deleted)) that I wished I had brought our camera. Understatement of the century. - Then, very suddenly the whole show (writing characters, globes, other objects, etc.) began to quickly fade and merge back into (the effect appeared to us) the clouds behind them.  General Comments: - The entire incident was completely non-threatening with a calmness about it. - The whole effect was as though the visual ""show"" was generally unfolding toward us. It appeared that each new activity took place in front of, or at least came out of and to the side or below the previous objects. - We really did not have time to ask ourselves what they were because we were simply too busy pointing out one or another new item or activity to each other. - It seems certain that ((name deleted)) and I saw the same exact images because we repeatedly pointed out one or another object to each other, and we would then get immediate confirmation. It was unbelievable, except that ((name deleted)) and I clearly saw this. - There was a family in a house behind us with a motorcycle in their driveway behind a dark red Hummer. I have not yet contacted them to see if they saw anything like we did. - I called my mother to see if she had seen anything in the sunset, but she had not watched it tonight. - I called my friend to see if he or his wife had viewed the sunset, but they had not. I  spoke to my friend at length about this. - I called WOAI TV news hotline to see if any one else had seen and reported anything, they had not received any news like this, and neither had their weatherman.",2005-01-19T00:00:00,29.488865917141535,-98.4752404435546

I didn't think anything of it, figuring it might be a plane but it was too big and round. But the thing that made me gasp was that one minute it was there, and the next minute, it was as though someone slipped a black blanket over the light, cause it vanished. There was no movement, no speed of light. It was like a candle being snuffed out, because the ball of light vanished in the spot it was in. Maybe it wasn't a UFO I seen, but it sure was strange and I have never forgotten it. Nor have I told anyone in my town what I seen.

I had my seat back and was just looking up at the sky out the passenger window.  The sun was shining and there were a few clouds in the sky, a very nice day.  I was looking northeast from the car.  My husband stopped for a red light at Broadway and Transit Rd...and that's when I saw it.  I spotted an object, elongated like a cigar, which appeared to be metal, silver in color, the sun shining on it.  There was no sound at all that I could hear and I didn't see any windows or wings.  It traveled in an southeasterly direction.  I then spotted a plane traveling northwest and I thought they would collide, but the plane crossed in front of it.  I wondered if the pilot saw this thing.  The cigar shaped object traveled slowly and steadily......then suddenly stopped in midair for a second, then moved in the direction from which it came.....no turning or anything.  I couldn't take my eyes off it.  I had never seen anything like it in my life.  My husband continued north on Transit Road and I kept my eyes on the object.  By now I was babbling like a maniac.  Then it stopped again for a second, and moved again from where it came.......I kept my eyes on it as we traveled....and I saw it once again stop and start traveling again..but then we were so far I couldn't keep track of it.  Continuing on to Main Street, I noticed before and after the doctor appointment that there were quite a number of planes in the sky, with their white exhaust trailing after them.  I am thoroughly puzzled and amazed.  I don't know of anything that moves in the sky, stops in midair, then goes in the opposite direction, without turning.  My husband suggested it was a blimp, but even blimps have to make a turn to go in the opposite direction, don't they?  He didn't see it at all because he had his eyes on the road going north.  It most certainly was NOT a balloon, nor a blimp.  It had no wings.  I can't determine its altitude, but as I recall, the plane looked a bit larger and I could see the plane had wings.  That's about all I can remember about it, but I can't forget it.

The smooth silvery craft appeared to be at cloud base moving very slowly southeast.  It had no wings, no lights, but appeared to be a smooth circle--may have been bottom of a craft.  As it hit the edge of a cloud a big reflectiion from the sun shot out momentarily.  The craft then started to move slowly upwards (about 10-20') when strange dark straight lines appeared next to it.  I then realized it was approaching the bottom of another much larger craft--the lines were part of the larger ship.  The larger craft was completely invisible to the eye from where I was except for the lines.  The circular craft proceeded to enter a dark, cloud-edged opening and on into the ship and all disappeared. --ss ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-01-19T00:00:00,,

PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) You stated on your website that you requested more information from me but have recieved no Response. I did indeed send a response on the 20th! Here is a copy of my original response... in case the original was lost. I was sitting outdoors, at a small hamburger restaurant, with a friend. I initially saw what I thought was a small mylar ballon descending behind the sign at the mall we were at. A few moments later I saw the object rising again. At this point I still believed it to be a balloon and watched it as it rose somewhat rapidly to a few hundered feet. At this time I pointed it out to my friend who also saw it. It suddenly stopped very abruptly and just hovered for a few seconds. At this point I realized that it probably wasn't a ballon and was also much farther away then I had originally assumed. The objected seemed to be flickering or reflecting light in a manner that I realized, after a while, was in a regular cyclic pattern. It seemed to then slowly drift upward and to the West. It then shifted direction and started moving a little more rapidly towards the East until it went from our site. There was a (light colored) helicopter in the area a few minutes prior to the event. Having seen the helicopter a few minutes earlier made it quite clear, by comparison , that whatever we saw was not a conventional craft. The whole event seemed to last about 10-15 minutes in total. I'm very surprised that there aren't more reports about this as it is a very heavily populated area. On top of it all, I'm pretty much a sceptic about these sorts of things so I'm very baffled by the whole experience. I'm an artist by profession and feel that I've got a pretty good eye for discerning the qualities of different objects and can say with a fair amount of certainty that it was not like any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.

I’m not saying I know all my constellations, I’m just saying it didn’t fit. Now this star was directly Underneath the moon and I thought to myself is it moving or doe’s it just appear as so because I was moving.  So I stopped, and low and behold the ""star"" was still descending very rapidly. I called over a few co-workers, and the security guard on duty to take a look. Just for self-satisfaction that I wasn’t crazy.  We all continued to watch it descend, now when I say descend I don’t mean on an angle, it was dropping straight down. Not at a speed you would contribute to something falling from the sky, and then at a certain point it looked as though it stopped, and wavered a little then it continued its journey down.

It was seen for very little time, no more that 3 seconds.  It could also have NOT been a comet, as it was much too large and the light from the city would have blocked most stars and comets anyways.

Once the rain died down, we got to kissing and somewhat fooling around. That's when I noticed an unusual light above the treetops from a forest area that borders my property (approx. 50 ft above ground and approx 100 yards away).  I pointed it out to her, and she did not realize that a light coming from that area was strange, she thought it was like a reflection of our lanai (porch) lights reflection off something up there. I said, no...not possible.   We got out and walked closer, and proceeded to see this light change colors, from red to blue, to bright white.  We were blown away by what we saw, and watched it for about 3-5 minutes.   Then we went away from it for a little while, when we did, she saw it move back into her sight at an alarming speed (she freeked out), and she hollered at me to come see.   I could not see it where she said it took off to, but she said it didn't move that far, and only moved to continue to check us out.  So we went back to the side of the house that allowed the best view, and I watched for about 30 seconds the area behind the trees that she said it moved to, and sure enough, it re-appeared as a dim light.   Then, in the original spot that we first saw it, two other lights appeared.  It was very hard to judge shape or size, however it did appear that they were changing shape, and they definately were changing color.   As the other two appeared, ALL 3 got really bright simultaneously.  We were dumbfounded, as neither or us has encountered anything strange before and frankly were skeptical of this type of stuff.  The main light, the one that had moved, also appeared to have ""dancing"" white smaller lights around it.   All in all, they were ""around"" for about a half hour to 45 minutes.  I did not even think to grab my camera, as I was so overwhelmed by what I was witnessing.   It truly seemed to both of us that they were watching us, and somewhat using the treetops as cover, however when we went to the side of the house that they were near, the would like re-appear and even get brighter, changing from red to blue to white to bright white.   I would have heard aircraft, as it is really quiet where I live, and the fact that she saw it move super fast and then we saw three proves to me we saw something ""out of this world"".   The objects appeared to change shapes, and one of them even kinda burned like a flair for a short time (a minute or so), but would then change to blue and white.   They or it did seem to be checking us out, and maybe it could sense our body heat and/or the heat from the hot-tub.  ???",2005-05-24T00:00:00,19.6256,-155.9194

Merced is located about six miles, I believe south, from Castle Air Force Base, which at that time was a SAC base.   It was very dark, as there were no street lights yet erected, and very little housing along the road.   As I approached town I looked to my right, and out in the field there appeared to be a cone of light shining down from somewhere high in the sky.  My heart started pounding, so I pulled over to the side of the road, and rolled my window down to see if it was possibly a helicopter of some sort.  The cone of light was devoid of light in its center, which is a little hard to explain just how it appeared to me.  It was as if only the edges of the cone were lighted, and the interior was hollow.   It was static, never moved as far as I can remember, but every exact in its appearance.  I sat and watched it for several minutes, never hearing any sound at all.  I assumed any helicopter would have made a sound, but all was silence.   Merced at the time was a very small town, and there were no cars on the road, or foot traffic on the road that night.   I sat there entranced until all of a sudden the cone of light sucked up into itself ... just disappeared as if it had never happened.  With my heart still pounding, and shaking like a leaf, I started the car, drove to my parnets house, and woke my dad up from a sound sleep.  I insisted he call the air base to see if they'd spotted anything unusual on their radar, or if they'd received any more reports of a strange sighting.  I spoke with them myself then, and they assured me nothing unusual had been reported, or sighted ... I still, to this day, don't believe them, because I know what I saw, and didn't hear.   I can remember how eerily calm the night was, and how totally enchanting the sight was to see a hollow cone of light shining down from high in the sky onto nothing, only a few hundred feet from my car.  As a photographer I'm usually very observant, critical, and attuned to trusting my eye.  There was definetly something strange in the sky that night for me to remember it so vividly today.

This event took place 30 years ago.  The only part of the date I could be sure on was that it took place 1 to 2 days before a major holiday. I was very young then and the whole event seems like a story now, or more like something that I have watched on TV.  Its hard for me to believe that I really saw it.  And as time has passed it has become just a memory, but one of those memories that sticks out in your childhood.  It was late at night.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and go into my parents bedroom to crawl in bed with them or to hang out in their room so that I would not be alone in my room late at night. (I was a kid...what do you want)   On this night I was in their room and was just looking out the window.  The apartment complex we lived in had 4 units per building(2 story) and probably 10 separate buildings.  As I was looking out my parents upstairs window, slowly and silently a metalic saucer shape approximatley 30 feet across moved into my eyesight from over another apartment complex.   The pace of the object was that of someone walking.  It flew just over the tree tops and the building and thats why I guess it was 30 feet high.  It was about 25-30 feet infront of the window/building that I was in.  I have re-visited this place since to gage the height and size of the object.  I have drawn pictures of this object a couple of times in my life to better illustrate the object for a few freinds that I have shared the sighting with over the years.   The object looked like it was a rough polished metal. Light bronze/silver.  Flat on the bottom except for right in the center of the underside.  It had a 10 foot across inverted cone shaped area that went into the object.   As I watched, it continued to move over the building and over a small parking area (directly infront of me) and continued on in the same direction.  I watched it until it went our of sight.  I waited...it never came back.   As I was so young, the event at the time did not seem that remarkable.  I do not even remember sharing this event with any adult until later in life.  I did though in fact share the experience with my cousins at a holiday/family gathering the next day(or day after).  I remember telling them and them laughing at me.  They were all older than me.  I remember them distinctly asking me if it had lights and what color they were?  I told them it had no lights they continued laughing and asked how I saw it then?   That was the end of my credibility with them and they stopped listening.   It was true, it had no lights.  The moon light, street light or what ever light that was being emitted from the area just reflected off the object to reveal the detail of the metal.  It was so close I didn't need any other light.

They appeared to be the size of half-moons and they were about a half-finger length apart from each other (as we saw them) along a horizontal plane.  We immediately noted that numerous stars were visible in the sky and that that there were very few clouds.  We also noted that there were no mountains in our line of sight.  We concluded that these two lights were clearly in the sky and not, for example, car lights coming down a mountain in front of us.  About five seconds after these two lights appeared, a third similarly sized light appeared above the one on the left.  The three lights remained motionless for about five seconds, then all three disappeared at the same time.  We continued to watch the sky as we traveled.

They remained illumined for only about five seconds this time and then disappeared again.  The lights from two small planes were visible in the sky near the second sighting and the three unexplained lights seemingly dwarfed the lights from the planes.

I looked up and saw what looked to be a star, the sky was still bright and no other stars were out.  A plain at 34 thousand feet just passed overhead heading North leaving a trail behind it. The object was in back of the trail. I have Video. The UFO stayed in one spot.  What was odd is that when the plain passed by leaving it's ice jet trail, the trail broke where the UFO was however the rest of the trail was still there. Like I said I have Video to prove this.  The neighbors where out next door and also saw this. We used binoculars and a telescope to get a better look. It was a Bright different type of white light coming from this object. Then my neighbor spotted another one to the left of the first one we saw. I don't have video of that one because I was to busy looking through a telescope.  They were moving extremely slow heading West. Both UFO’s  stayed in formation until It ended up on the horizon and lost sight.  The UFO was right above us when we first saw it at 7:40PM, it took only 30 minutes for both UFO’s  to get to the horizon.  In 1977 I saw UFO’s and reported that also.  The only difference was the speed the UFO went. In 1977 the UFO's started off going as slow as this one seen tonight. however they took off at great speed then stopped and took off again at great speed.  The two we all saw tonight kept going slow west. If you were out and just looked up you could have easily thought they were stars. I new it wasn't a star because of the different brightness of light coming from it, the light was bright but not the same temperature as a star. A star is more of a yellow light, this was a pure white light.  Just keep looking up and you will also see one.

We didn't hear any sound correlating to the flash but it seemed close enough that we should have known what caused it.  So we got up to take a look in that direction. We didn't have to go very far, just to a clearing. There was a dark mass floating in the air. It's shape was indistinguishable. It was more or less flat and it seemed round but its entire mass did not move in unison. It sort of rippled but not in any coherent pattern (thus not really like a ripple but similar.)  On the bottom surface that we could see, there was a constant activity of blue flashes (though not very bright)freckled across the object. We all noticed the air felt very cold and moist and like static.  Finally some pieces fell off the object. They sprinkled off and shimmered as they fell to the ground. Then the object left slowly. It was hard to tell that it was moving. It got more more distant but the actual movement seemed imperceptable.

Two were parallel to each other, and the third was just a little below the two.  They were shaped similarly to vacation cruise ships, albeit much longer and more slender,  and   because of the perspective, must have in actuality been a lot larger, certainly much larger than the plane I was in.  Many other passengers were looking out the window, presumably at the objects, because on most flights I take, I don't see many people watching out the window during the landing.  No one commented on the objects.  At the time I thought I must have been seeing some weird reflection,  or some lit up building that was resting on a low mountain or hill but they really were too solid and distinct to have been some oddity of the light, and the Baltimore/D.C. area doesn't have mountains to say the least.  They were subtlely lit.  My mind totally tried to rationalize what I saw, because they weren't like any common aircraft at all.  When I first glanced at them I thought they were other planes coming in to land, but I soon realized that they were too long and far too large, only their distance made them seem momentarily comparable in size to our aircraft.  Only upon seeing an image of a reported UFO seen around 3am over Washington, D.C. on the Coast to Coast am site did I decide to make this report.  The objects I saw were very similar to that image, although I saw three of them and from further away.  So they looked more like huge, long cruise ships, and less like the lighted cigar-shaped object pictured on the main page of the website. www.coasttocoastam.com",2005-02-22T00:00:00,39.31307269413052,-76.61182201968647

They were driving south on Rt.126 in Bellingham, MA, ten minutes from the dancehall. They stopped at at T-intersection stop sign. No other cars were on the rural road nor people on the street at the time. My girlfriend was the passenger, so was able to get a better observation. She is a quite sane, college-educated professional person.  As they stopped at the T-intersection (to take a right turn on the two lane road) she saw a perfectly circular white light (which she said looked just like a full moon) come from the right, traveling along the road at a height of just three or four feet (eye level with the hood of the small car). There was a church directly in front of the stop sign on the other side of the road.  The object came directly in front of the car, traveling horizontally, no more than 100ft in front, then went straight up and over the church, where they lost sight of it.  She estimated the object was only about six feet in diameter. She said it was the size of dinner plate held at arms length. It made no sound. There were no flashing lights or changes in color from the original yellow-white. She also described it as one of the glow-in-the-dark frisbees turned on its side. It travelled fast, but not at blinding speed.  She said it move purposely. It did not stop in front of their car but kept moving. She did not know if it went up into the sky or just hopped over the church to the other side.   The driver made her right turn on to the cross road, the direction the object had come from. She said it travelled along the road from the right to the left, in front of the car, before going straight up over the church.  They thought about going back to see if they could see it again but decided not to.  The car was traveling south from Milford into Bellingham, then took the right, going west on to the cross road. They were heading back to Lincoln, Rhode Island. There were no electrical problems with their car or missing time or any other anomalies, she said. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to Bellingham, MA, of 02/12/05. This is an addendum to the sighting on this date: Later in the day after my girlfriend had called that morning to tell me of what they saw, I decided to call two police departments, Bellingham, and nearby Blackstone. Both dispachers told me that no one else had called about a UFO (I doubt they would have told me otherwise, anyway).  So, next, I called News Channel 10, WJAR, Providence. I spoke to news person, a young man, about what my girlfriend saw. He said, oh yeah, we had a few other reports from last night in that same area at about the same time. He went on to say that the previous night the same small circle of light had been seen in another town in Massachusetts, named Billerica.  When nothing appeared on the news on Channel 10 that night I called back the next day to WJAR and asked why nothing was reported. A young woman said she didn't know, but maybe the editor, ""Tim"" could tell me. She went to look for Tim but said he was not available and I'd have to call back.  I had the feeling he didn't want to discuss it or the reasons it was not ""newsworthy.""  Also, my girlfriend, upon further reflection of that night, said the object could well have been smaller than the six feet in diameter she originally thought it might be, but in no way any larger.  So, other witnesses called in to the news station of that same sighting and one for the previous night, but of course, nothing on the news.

I was driving my car and it was slightly off to the west of 83. The object moved from south to north in the same direction I was traveling. We sighted the light as we approached middle country road the lightlooked as though it was at an extremely low altitude it scame out of no where i thought it was a plane flying low and about to crash. I was truely frightened upon the site of it. It appeared to travel directly over the Suffolk County 6th precinct police department, and into the parking lot across middle country road in between Ruby Tuesdays and Wendys. We were so astonished by what we saw we decided to turn around about a quarter mile up 83 to inspect the parking lot where we thought this greenish-blue light had decended into. We found nothing out of the ordinary. This object traveled south to north at what appeared to be decending at a very low altitude. I would say around 100-200 ft in the sky and about 3-5 ft diameter. This only happened a short while ago and I still have goosebumps..The light actually vanished before it came near the ground but it seemed as though it would crash. I found no evidence of any impact in the parking lot where we thought it might have landed. We went back over the same route we traveled when we saw it to make sure what we saw was no glare or anything from a traffic light or something...even though we both saw the light decending clear as anything. We detterminded that we saw the light aproximatly 20 feet before the left turning lane for middle country road on route 83. The skies are unusaully clear. no clouds at all. When i arived at my house about 2miles from the sighting, i was freaked out and looking into the clear sky at all the stars hoping to see or not see another light of the same sort. I am a little freaked out still.",2005-02-22T00:00:00,,

But not dense enough to obscure vision. Before entering the house, I decided to look at the moon. I laid eyes with it for several minutes, it wasnt very cold outside, and I wasnt in a hurry to get back inside.  Then I noticed the most amazing thing, I have ever seen in my life.   A Ufo, Literally in the shape of a U. It was 90% invisible. All i saw was the distinct outline of the craft which had three opaque whitish spots at the rear(lights?), within this outline was sky. It traveled fairly slow and it approached the moon. The light of the moon revealed the entire craft. I was astonished.  There WERE clouds(dark purple hue), but,the craft was definatley lower than the clouds, there were large breaks in the clouds, showing clear night sky.  The outline, appeared Bigger than the full moon, which means it was fairly low in the sky.  The glow of the moon amplifed the image of the craft and actually revealed its outline further to about 80% visible. The U shaped crafts direction was SouthWest. From the moment I saw the craft, which was about 3 inches from the moon(my first visual). It took about 10 seconds for it to pass the moon, at which point I could no longer see it. After I lost visual of the silent U shaped craft, I proceeded toward the door to my house, before walking in, I clearly heard a FAST jet flying what sounded west. The jet sounded small, but DEFINATLEY a jet. I live over a major flight path intersection, I hear the differences in all aircraft engines.

My attention was suddenly drawn to an object up at a very high altitude and directly overhead emitting a brilliant solid white light beam in front of it. The light was in a reversed triangular pattern coming from the object. A commercial aircraft started to approach the area and immediately the brilliant solid white light went out and all I could see was a very faint white light moving quickly forward towards the approaching commercial aircraft. It actually passed the commercial aircraft but at a much higher altitude. I finally lost sight of the object as it was traveling away faster and in the opposite direction of the approaching commercial aircraft. I had a chance to compare object to the commercial aircraft as they passed and noted no flashing lights and no sound. I did hear the sound from the commercial aircraft and of course it had flashing lights.

I found there was no sound from them at all.  One flew directly over me and I saw it was a diamond shape and the red lights were on each tip.  They couldn't have been airplanes because they were flying so close together at times.  After the crafts would fly in seperate paths, they would all come together into a triangle formation then split back up again.  Some of the crafts would be flying at the same speed of the others, and then speed up very very fast.

It was hard to make out but the motion of the object was obvious- It was very slow moving and either very very low overhead- as an approaching plane- or it was absolutely enormous and flying at a normal altitude.  At first when I recognized the dark triangular shape, I thought perhaps it was a stealth bomber, but realized it wasnt possible as it was so low, moving so slowly, and did not make a sound.  Two guys my age (mid-20's) walked past me, and I asked them if they had seen ""that"" but neither had a clue to what I was referring.  Everything echos in my apt complex, so it must have been silent or the guys would have heard it.  It was a perfectly clear night with the stars shining. The moon was just rising as sunset was only about an hour prior to the event. (maybe to help the ship blend in they chose that time to be fly so low, since the background sky wouldnt be as bright from the then waning moon)  The object which was barely noticeable, except that it seemes the object had either very dim lights around its edges- roughly as bright as the dimmest stars you can see- or it distorted the background skyscape to conceal itself.   It moved due East and I watched it until it passed over the roof of the adjacent apartment building.  I actually followed it as best I could in my car since I was originally leaving my apartment to go to my destination which was also due East- but no luck- nearly got in an accident trying to look for it though!  Incidently, I have a BS in psychology, and am pretty even keeled, but when I saw this I was afraid I was having a psychotic break from reality brought about by stress, but I knew I had seen SOMETHING, even though I wasn't sure that it could be a UFO- the only other theory I came up with is that it was a hangglider- but there aren't any open fields around here to land- its pretty heavily developed.   I must say though, getting to read everyone else's claims, especially those that are similar to mine made me feel a little more credible- funny thing is I've always believed we were not alone, but I couldn't believe I had actually seen one.",2005-10-20T00:00:00,29.646086792452827,-82.38107610062893

My curiosity in the skies of this area has been piqued since the other day when I saw 3 black triangles in broad daylight immediately following a black helicopter acting very strange. I called my brother over to watch the satellite in case of the remote possibility it was more than that. It wasn't, and he wasn't impressed. I made a phone call, and maybe five minutes later, I saw another satellite coming from southwest, heading northeast to the same point that the first one was headed. I couldn't believe my luck --- I constantly watch the sky, constantly watch for satellites, and I'm lucky if I see one every couple of weeks or months. I decided to run to the baseball field across the street in order to get a better look at the satellite, somewhere where it wouldn't be obstructed by trees. I had to stop several times along the way so as not to lose my bearings on the satellite. When I finally got there, the satellite was fading out in the distance. Immediately thereafter, another satellite came from a more westerly direction, heading in the same direction as the other two. Three satellites in under 10 minutes? Again, I couldn't believe my luck. I called my fiancee, looking for another witness so I wouldn't think I was losing my mind again in one week. I watched this ""satellite"" for about a minute when it started to band to its right --- not subtly, drastically. Then it stopped --- just stopped dead for about 30 seconds. It then started up again at an even greater speed, travelling northeast again now. At one point, it appeared as though a little flash came off of it, perhaps blue/purple like a flash of lighting at night? though relegated to the area directly beside it.  That was two nights ago. Last night, I spent hours with my fiancee looking at a clear sky for satellites. I did see one, moving west to east, but it disappeared before it even passed over us. This seemed a lot more normal, but I am completely uneducated as far as satellite flight paths go.  On another note, my first time accessing this website was on Friday. I was more than shocked to learn of the alarming frequency at which people see black triangular ""craft"", especially in groups of three, especially with a haze around it. My first clue was actually seeing it in person. One particular liting from Chicago has the witness mentioning that it looked like a kite, which was my first instinct, but there is no possible way these are one kite, let alone 3 --- not at these altitudes, not at these speeds.  Do satellites act like this? What is up with these black triangles? I would love to know more from whomever can supply the knowledge.",2005-07-13T00:00:00,,

I bet that it was a planet, anmd the driver of the vehicle thought it was an airplane tower, we all were looking to see a pole and as we drove closer( by the way it was on a highway 285 in Marietta, south I believe) we noticed it had 3 lights i think 2 white ones on either side and on e red in the middle. I was amazed becuase I knew no US aircraft could remain stationary like that. it moved sowly and later as we were passing it we noticed a second next to it. the two were flying slowing near each other.  The Aircraft weren't close enough to really see a shape but I believe it must've been a saucer considering the position of the lights.  we kept driving and then I saw another one a few up the highway.  that was too akward for 3 planes to be that close to each other.  I kept staring at the objects and later disregarded them, but still thinking about why I would even mistake an aircraft for a star. I've never done that and seems highly unlikely. I didn't believe it to be a military aircraft, because that would be too blunt for the military to fly 3 aircraft in the same location for everyone to see. but I really am not sure,  I just hope someone else saw this besides my quartet and I to verify it.",2005-07-13T00:00:00,,

Off to the southeast  (about 40 degrees) I noticed  what appeared to be a plane with a strobe light taking the general flight path to Cleveland's lakefront airport. It was heading northeast.  The strobe became more impressive and it became readily apparent that it wasn't quite the same light as a normal aircraft would use partly because it suddenly grew quite bright.  The craft flew in a slightly erratic pattern slightly zig-zagging, then turned multi colored (red and blue) and disappeared.  Just like that.   Then  perhaps 20 seconds  later it reappeared  much further to the west  about 30 degrees behind my right shoulder  and  started to head east-southeast.

The object was much higher than most aircraft one would typically observe in the area, and appeared almost as a moving star. The object was not moving with particular quickness. The object appeared to wobble slightly from right to left as it moved on its course. We observed the object until we could no longer see the object due to its distance. We all saw it, and the entire event lasted at the very least 5 minutes, perhaps longer.  The interesting thing is that I - along with several of my friends - have witnessed these objects - these white balls of light - moving through the skies of Ocean County on numerous occasions. Often times, they go from dim to bright while moving and sometimes even blink out completely. Sometimes after they blink out you can swear you can still see a form moving thorugh the sky. Sometimes you dont necessarily have that feeling. Sometimes they blink out and then back on. It is very weird whatever it is. My friends and I have observed these objects moving not only south to north (the most typical route of travel) but also north to south, and in the east-west directions. We have seen even seen them several times in one night, and in multiple locations. Whatever these are, they definately are not airplanes. They can only be described as moving stars!

At 2:00 p.m. we heard and spotted a huge Coast Guard helicopter flying from the west into the east, as if it came from the Oregon coast line.  Right in front and above, at approx. 20,000 feet of the helicopter was a bright reflective saucer shaped object moving very, very slowly.  It was backdropped by a clear blue sky without a cloud behind it.  It seemed to be reflecting the sun in a type of pulsating, rythmic display of extremely bright light.  It may have just been pulsating with intense light.  It was moving very slowly and then stopped moving.   At approximately 2:12 the UFO did  a vertical ascent and disappeared.  The helicopter did a sharp turn right/south when the object stopped moving and did a 180 degree reverse path heading straight back west.  The helicopter turned south, running along what seemed to be the west side of the Cascade mountains.  We live on the east side of Springfield as you start up the pass to cross the Cascades. Within two minutes we saw a large white jet coming from the south (maybe Klamath Air Force Base) heading north.  It had radar unit on top of it.  It was headed north into the exact spot from where the UFO hovered and disappeared.  That jet was first noted at 2:35 p.m..  Another radar jet appeared, following the same south to north path that the first jet traveled.  At 3:14 a third jet appeared following the same path from south to north into the same space where the UFO disappeared.  At 3:17 and 3:19 the same type of jets appeared also, following the same path.   Using our digital camera we took several pictures of the UFO.  We now have them downloaded from our camera and burned to CD's for safe keeping.

When I realized it wasn't an airplane I thought maybe it was a shooting star. It was very bright and lit up the sky. But what was so strange is, it was coming down (it was very high in the sky) at a high rate of speed then suddenly slowed down and took a left turn and then became a very faint light and then disappeared.  I sat and thought about it for a while to be sure it wasn't a plane and realized that it couldn't have been. The way it turned and the way it was coming down, there is no way a plane can move like that. It was very strange and very surreal feeling to have witnessed something like that.  I was thinking maybe some government had something entering the earths atmosphere. Like a satellite or something.

I kept looking at it and as we got closer to it I could see it was flashing lights so I figured it was a plane. Then I thought it couldn’t be a plane either because it was moving to slow. I rolled the window down and looked up at it as it was flying over us. I saw 3 distinct lights in a row that were brighter than any other flashing lights I’ve seen. They were flashing from the right to the left one at a time but very fast. It reminded me of a police car lights on the top of the car.

The object to the west that the witness alludes to we suspect may have been the star, Sirius.

Everything was going great and there were tons of stars in the sky that were all visible because there were no clouds out at the time.  We were having a barbecue and while everyone was talking and relaxing I kept noticing and my eyes kept wondering off towards this particular star that seemed to stand out from the rest and it looked like it was moving. I ignored it at first thinking that it was just an illusion but as I looked closer it really was moving.  I turned around to tell my friends that there was something moving towards us way off in the sky amongst the stars and when I turned around to point it out to them it had moved much further to us. This thing must have been as far as hell away from us as possible since it looked as if it were sitting up in space with the stars and to move that much of a distance in about 5 seconds is incredible.  I don't even think any planes, fighter jets, or anyhting that has been made on this planet can travel that fast from that far away.  Everyone was excited at this point and we just watched as it got closer and closer to where we were. Now that I recall the whole time that this was happening there was no noise or anything and after it got to where we were at such mind blowing speeds it slowed to about a 10 mile an hour hover right above the trees that were about 20 feet away from us. These trees down at my house are all about 50 feet tall so we had an amazing view of this cigar shaped ship. It did have these 5 intensly bright lights on the bottom of it that were all white except the one in the middle was a less bright yellow color. At one point the craft just completely stopped while above the trees and the middle light yellow light became more intense than the white ones and flickered on and off twice   We do know for a fact though that it was a solid object because the lights on the bottom of it reflected the silver metallic surface that it was made out of. Also when it flew over us it covered up most of the stars in the sky so we knew that it was solid. it was atleast 65 feet long and from the bottom you could easily tell it was about 25 feet wide. We observed it hovering above the trees that were now lit up becuase of the intense lights on the bottom of the craft until the light in the center turned from yellow to light blue and it sped off at amazing speeds over the trees in my back yard to about 1,000 feet away.  this whole time there was no noise whatsoever and we were actually kind of spooked. Then off in the distance not to far away two other ships on the left and right sides of the cigar shaped craft rose up from the thick woods and then at that point all five of them sped away in formation within about 2 seconds.I know I will never see anything like this again in my life and it will stay with me forever. I know for a fact it wasn't a blimp, plane, jet, helicopter or anything and so do my friends. I am studying to be a doctor at Bowden college and I am not crazy. I know what I saw and I'm not lying.

A police helicopter orbited our complex then searched to the west to see if there was any trouble-there was not. At this point, more people came out claiming they too heard the loud explosion and about 12 mins., later a smaller one as well.  I didn't hear it. Out of pure curiosity I called a local TV station FOX 10 and they said they only knew of a apartment fire 10 miles to the north-east.

Sitting outside in a chair on my pateo, I was gazing up at the sky. I was on the tail end of a cloudy sky (above me and to the East were clouds, a clear sky coming in from the west).  Directly over my head, I saw a sphere moving under the clouds horizontal to the earth. The sphere was a translucent orange. I stood up immediately wondering what it was. My first thought was that some kid must have lost a balloon, but soon realized the object was traveling far too fast and in a strait line. I later determined with a compass it was traveling in the direction of 135 degrees SE. I watched it until it faded out of site on the far side of the horizon which took only a few seconds. I could see other planes in the sky at various altitudes. All were much slower than the sphere. It must have been traveling at a very high rate of speed.  I stood out there on the patio trying to figure out what I had just witnessed and continued gazing up in the sky (this time looking for orange'ish spheres). About 5 minutes after the first sphere, a 2nd sphere was spotted. This sphere was not directing overhead, but a distance to my East (maybe a mile). It also was traveling in the same direction as the first sphere and at the same apparent speed (same color). There was no sound at all.  I continued looking up in the sky for the next hour, but no other sphere was seen. This is the first time I've ever witnessed anything like this. Wouldn't believe it if I had not seen it for myself.  These sphere's were definately ""not"" man-made. They were almost like an orange plasma ball of some type, except they traveled at a high rate of speed as though they had a distination.  I'm still trying to figure out what they might have been. I have no clue.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,37.66861323741007,-120.99442244604317

The witnesses are reasonably safe from identification.  At approximately 00:50 hours on the morning of Saturday, June 18th 2005, I ((name deleted--witness, male #1)) of the village of Fair Oak, Eastleigh, Hampshire, and two colleagues, who I am only permitted to describe as ((name deleted--male #2)) and ((name deleted--female)) were standing outside of their home close to the village center of Fair Oak, and involved in sky watching while idly discussing the stars and the activities and modus operandi of UFOs, when after mentioning to them three minutes earlier that ""sometimes, if you ask to see an object ... they sometimes comply,"" such an object did in fact appear - or seemed to appear as if on request.  The object appeared in sky, almost overhead, but clearly several miles up.  I'm estimating three or more as it is difficult to estimate as the sky was very dark and no point of reference other than the sky was available.  It came in from the south-southwest, initially appearing as a brilliant and fast moving light source, I estimate as being about two milimeters in diameter as if judged by reaching out and pointing to it with my outstretched hand and finger (I am five feet, three inches tall for the record).  It should be noted that we are familiar with astronomical, atmospheric and satelite activity here, and that particular night the sky was exceptionally clear and dotted with stars.  Within a second or two of making its appearance, the object suddenly bloomed brilliantly into a white point of light five times the brilliance of the brightest star (and to an estimated size of around four milimeters) and then after approximately half a second (having apparently gotten our attention) it dulled down considerably but remained in motion, on the same course and at the same speed. At no time did it display any evidence of being an aircraft either in motion, speed or lights.  It then seemed to dull out completely and stop and take up position in the sky close to Orion's second star in the Belt of Orion where it seems to have remained for the remainder of the fifteen minute observation of the witnesses. The incident was terminated when we went inside. In the actual event, if the object, if indeed it was a UFO, was in sight for a grand total of between three to seven seconds before becoming lost in the starfield overhead.  Both witnesses, who have a casual interest in the UFO phenomenon, but no serious technical background in it were wildly impressed by the sighting and announced to me that they had never seen an aircraft perform like that. They were also impressed by the fact that following the incident, we saw not only a passing satellite - clearly cutting across the heavens - and a meteorite entering the atmosphere and burning up. Both objects performed as you would expect, and did not reflect any aspect of the fast moving light source which we witnesses. This drove home the unearthly quality of the sighting to the ""newbies"" who were my additional witnesses.  I was highly impressed, it was almost as if my comments about ""asking to see something,"" were being acted upon, although this should be considered merely speculation.

I only took one picture at that time and didn't see anything unusual flying in the sky. It took me a few days to even review the pic on my camera before I noticed something odd. It took me a couple of more days to get my camera's photo software installed on my computer, download the picture, and import it into Paint Shop Pro. The orginal picture shows two unusual lights in the sky, one dim one in the upper left and the obvious one in the upper right. All I've done in Paint Shop Pro is to brighten the image, do a couple of zooms on the lights, and create a negative image of the light on the right side. The zoomed light on the right appears to me to have a energetic field around it, and the negative of it makes this look even more apparent. If these are actual objects, they would have to have been shooting upward into the dark storm clouds so fast that I never saw them. I've seen my share of air traffic in the area, but with that storm rolling in, there wasn't a plane in the sky.

It appeared for approximately 5 seconds, as I first glimpsed it out of the corner of my eye. It seemed to change direction and head toward the ground.

I would like to add that at least one of the lights had a pasty light green tint.  There position did not change much, only what appeared to be very slight movement, changes in tint and intensity.  When the lights faded, it was as if they were turned out via a dimmer switch.  It seems that the sky between the lights was darker, thus indicating a large triangular vehicle.  It appeared that if it were a single vehicle, it would be quite large, about 400 meters across. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the U. S.

I was returning a friend to her apartment. It was about 8:00 p.m., and as we made a turn around a corner I saw an object in the sky.  I looked at the object a few seconds expecting it to turn out to be a helicopter but it looked like it was tumbling and spinning at the same time as this motion was going on it seemed like it was changing shape.  I'm guessing the shape shifting effect was due to the tumbling motion or maybe the shape shifting was causing it to look like it was tumbling.  I looked at my friend and asked her if she saw what I saw and she told me she did then asked me what it was.  The object was close enough that I could make out some detail as it turned, but none of the shapes made sense.  Sometimes I could make out what looked like an aircraft rudder then a second later it looked like it had an oval like sphere on the one end there were not lights on the object that I could see.  Overall the object had an elongated shape that as I said seemed to be out of control and tumbling and flipping.   I am an ex Air Force aircraft mechanic and the person I was with is a paralegal.  I have seen many planes and helicopters and I have never seen anything that moved like this object.  It was black and did not reflect light, despite the fact that the sun was shining directly on it.  I could also see a perfect translucent circle around the object as it tumbled in the sky.  I could see the circle because the part of the sky that was visible inside the circle was a different shade.  Also, the object never made a sound that we could hear. The object seemed to be stationary at first then seemed to move away from us and up.  Shortly after it moved a passenger jet flew over the apartment complex and as the jet liner passed over I could still see the object above and further away than the jet and I would say the object was a third to half the size of the jet from my perspective.  I watched the object for about thirty to forty-five minutes and the longer I watched it the further up it went.  Fortunately there was not a cloud in the sky and I saw the object climb until it was only a black speck and then it disappeared.

There were low clouds, a friend and I were walking in a field when we noticed a bright light to our right.  We turned and the light seemed to punch through the clouds.  It was stunningly bright--it lit up the surrounding woods like a slow, gigantic camera flash.  Green tail with orange sparks trailing behind it.  It seemed to come straight down (no visible arc), and seemed to disappear just before touching the ground.  We could see the shadow of trees behind it, so we know the object made it into the adjacent valley, but it seemed to go dark before it would have made impact.  I believe it was a meteor, but it was the closest encounter I've ever had with one!  I expect the object was somewhere between .25 to .75 miles away.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.

These objects was seen by two persons and I, the sky was clear with abright sun.  First object that I saw was round and bright white. It almost look like staror planet but this seemed strange, a star or planet doesn't shine that bright after 6PM with a sunny sky. The object moved from west to east (and from east to west) slowly and sometimes I could not tell if it was moving because it moved so slowly.When it moved back and forth the object faintedto the point it was hard to relocate it.  Usually it fainted when it got closer to the sun but when it got further from the sun it begun to shine more.   After observing it for more than ten minutes this thing got my real attention and my jaw dropped. It emitted an object smaller than itself. The smaller object traveled northeast slowly but faster than the bigger object.  After that I did not know what happened to the two objects because I got distracted by a soccer game that my father was in.  When I look up again to the sky I could not relocate them. However after ten minutes I saw another object that looked the same at the same location of the sky. It's behavior moved the same (west to east and east to west slowly). A few minutes later it traveled only west not going back to east.(note:as it traveled west to the sun it kept its white color it didn't look like it reflected any orange,yellow colors caused by the sun)  As it traveled west it fainted and then another object heading toward it appeared about the same size but brighter coming from the northwest and traveling southeast. As I focus my eyes on this brighter object I could describe it had a faint red color, I could bearly tell it had a red color,if I didn't focus on it the color would be a bright white.  The objects looked like they were at the same altitude and almost made contact to each other as they got closer to each other . The object going west fainted and I observed it until my eyes couldn't see it.  The other object fainted as it traveled slowly southeast and kept my eyes on it until I couldn't see it.  About twenty minutes later the sky was a little dark but still bright, it was between 7:30 PM and 8:00 PM, I looked up to see any more sightings of more objects and just as I looked up a saw one. This object was bigger and I could distinguish another shape. At first it looked between a bent cigar and a small moon crescent then looked like a straight small cigar. It's color was a bright white,it's altitude looked the same as the other objects that I saw before and moved west slowly, its location was further northwest from the other objects that I saw. My father saw it as I told him about it and the other objects. There was another person that I told them about the first object that I saw and they also saw it.  The objects could not be ballons because at the altitude to which they looked they were at had to burst by the sun rays. A  high-altitude airliner, those planes that are way up high in the sky and leave a smog white trail, was able to travel under one of the objects and I was able to campare that the unknown object was about twice as high in the sky than the airliner's altitude.(The aircraft passed under the third object that I saw).

Above/beyond the birds I noticed an object slowly moving northward.  It immediately gave me chills because it didn't look like any flying vehicle I'd ever seen (and since I grew up in Wichita KS I've seem them all).  For a moment I thought it might be a stealth fighter, since the nation was gearing up for the first Iraq war at the time, but the object had no wings or rotors or wheels, just a smooth oval (almond or maybe flattened egg) shape, slightly narrower in front, with a small oval bump on top.  I couldn't determine surface details since the sun was down and I could only see a black silhouette against the sky.  It made no noise, there were no lights.  When I first saw it, it was about 45 degrees up, to the west.  I estimate it was 20-30 feet wide, flying at approximately 1500' altitude moving north around 100mph (similar to a small private plane in size and speed).  I thought 'hey, I see YOU' and looked around at other people in the parking lot, no one else was watching it.  I observed it for a couple minutes until it disappeard over the horizon.  After getting home I phoned the local airport and asked if they had any strange radar images or if anyone else had reported a UFO. They acted like I was crazy so I didn't bother to notify the police. I considered the posibility that it might have been some type of balloon but it was moving much faster than the wind that night.

Given the anonymous nature of your reporting requirements, and the fact I just found your site, I figured what the heck because I have dwelled on the issue for some time and just need to get it out. Plus I'm at work wasting time reading your case files, and I do have one to tell. Myself and my friend were 21 at the time, in his Ford Escort parked just outside the city of Idaho Falls, ID, near the High-C waterpark about a quarter mile from a railroad bridge.  It is called Zombie Bridge by the locals. It is fairly isolated, with only a few homes dispersed over about two square miles.  The car was parked facing approx. northwest along the road, steep hillside to the left, creek to the right.  Not sure if road is paved now, but in those days it was graded gravel only.  If you head the opposite direction from the car's orientation, there is a sharp right turn about fifty meters behind where we were parked.  We were being naughty at the time, in that we were ((alleged minor infraction deleted)) (hence my reticence about disclosing the incident), just sitting there in his car in the dark, ((deleted)). Only other sound were the multitudes of crickets out and about. We decided to leave as we both had to work in the morning. I get out to relieve myself in the bushes by the creek and when returning to the car, saw an erratic light.  Best way to describe it was akin to when someone flicks a still-lit cigarette butt in the dark.  Erratic in movement, orange, and very dim in apparent magnitude.   It came from the direction in front of the car, over the car, decended just like if it was falling, and then it looked like it ""bounced"" on the ground about forty meters behind the car.  Never made a sound. I thought someone was nearby and had actually flicked a cigarette butt at first, and looked around. Realized it would take some pretty impressive cigarette butt flicking to launch one forty meters or so, and no one was around, so I got in the car somewhat perplexed at what I'd seen.  My friend had seen it too, and queried me what it was, and I replied that I didn't know.  He also noted the crickets had stopped chirping, and I noticed that as well when he said it, which was eerie.  We both looked in the rearview mirrors, and noticed the ""cigarette butt,"" or at least its glow, was shining on the road behind us although the source was obscured by the intervening hill beyond the right turn.  The source must have been on the hill itself, and not airborne judging by the angle the glow was hitting the road. By the size of the glow on the road (about ten meters visible diameter), we realized it wasn't a cigarette butt either, and we both got a little bit of a shiver. I tell my friend it might be a good idea to go, and he heartily agrees, we both are a little scared at this point.  He fires up the Escort, and we promptly flip out.  See, the car started fine, but every electronic device in his car that can make noise, his radar detector, his pager, and his stereo, all are making a pulsed high pitched and very loud noise.  Sounded almost like when a CD player malfunctions in your stereo, like a pulsed digital noise.   We turn the volume down on the stereo, nothing happens. We turn the stereo off, nothing happens...unplugged the cig lighter power to the radar detector, nothing happens.  Speakers in these devices seemed to be working off of pure inductance in their voice coils without any amplification from their supporting electronics.   I swear we both we're going to fill our pants we took off out of there so fast.   After about ten seconds of frenzied driving, the EM effects ceased, and his equipment began behaving normally.  Never bothered to see if the glow we had seen was behind us or what, too scared while speeding away. Never reported it to the cops or other authorities, would have just gotten a ticket for smoking dope.  Have reflected on this numerous times with my friend, don't believe it was anything ""E.T.ish"" or whatever.  Sometimes I wonder if we got hit with a beam from a JointSTARS or some other military aircraft in the region.  That could potentially explain the inductance in the speakers, which have a much lower threshold of resistance to outside EM effects then say the car's ignition system.  But I have no clue what that oversized mystery cigarette butt was.  Just totally weird night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We do not know what a JOINTSTARS aircraft is, but it seems to us that the metal body of the car would have served as a Faraday Cage, and therefore would have shielded all, or most, of the electronic equipment in the car, particularly the radio, which probably was shielded by the metal in the dashboard, and the metal of the hood and the firewall.

Coming over a small mountain, I saw a couple of white lights and a red blinking light.  I thought, there is a plane.  See them all the time and it looked just like that. I then noticed, ""Hey, isn't that plane awfully low?""  Oh my gosh, it is going to crash, it looked like it was getting lower.  My friend said, ""What is that?""   Just so happened he had glass tops in his corvette and I was on the passenger side.  As it came over the top of us, I watched it.  It wasn't moving as fast as we were so it had to be less that 60 miles an hour.  It sort of stopped, suspended in air over the highway for a couple seconds.  I could see the dark shape but couldn't tell if it was quite triangular or not.  The most amazing thing was the lights.  I saw a red blinking one underneath.  There were 4 white lights, 2 on the front and 2 on the rear.  Now, what was odd about these lights was the fact that they were all shining backwards.  You could see the beams off into the night sky.  Kind of like shining a flashlight and kicking up a bunch of dust - you see the beam.  Well, when it stopped, all 4 beams slowly turned clockwise, sweeping down across the road and then turned up to shine forward.  When they did this, it started moving again and quickly flew north.  It was moving from the south.  The mountains there are about 1000-1200 feet high, so it could have only been 1300-1500 in the air.

We first noticed a loud noise, similar to a helicopter but much louder. It was definitely an engine noise. We went outside to see what it was, and saw a formation of lights hovering some distance away. The lights were not in any pattern that we had seen on an aircraft before. There were three visible lights: reddish-orange, blue, and strobing bright white. The white light appeared to be ""towed"" by the other lights. It was hard to make out any shape of the body of the thing. It hovered for a few minutes and then moved very rapidly southeast. The noise continued to get louder as it came overhead, then got quieter as it moved away. The object stopped suddenly and hovered again for a short amount of time. It then shot off southeast again. Each time it moved it moved extremely smoothly and quickly. When it hovered, it seemed to stay perfectly still. The weather was cloudy with very little wind. ((ADDENDUM FROM MR. TOM BOWDEN, STATE DIRECTOR OF MUFON/OREGON)) Probably helicopter or ultralight aircraft This is a follow-up of a report previously submitted. Based on the information given in the report, it is probable that the witnesses saw and heard some sort of helicopter, ultra-light aircraft, or experimental aircraft.  The presence of a loud engine noise similar to a helicopter motor strongly suggests this explanation. I would be glad to investigate further if the witnesses have more information to add to the initial report, or if they feel strongly that this explanation does not fit the profile of the incident.

As I was walking out heading southeast in the yard, I noticed in the direct southeast what looked like at first sight to be a star falling 90° down to the earth. It fell in one to three seconds. It was antifreeze green maybe blue green. I distinctly noticed and mentally noted at that moment that there was no trail. I have seen large meteors and small ones; they had trails. I always look up because I am an amateur astronomer and photographer.  This object was about the size of a -1 magnitude star; about the size of Venus on a good night, but it was blue green. The other thing I noticed that was interesting was that the moon was nearly full and the sky was cloudless. The night sky was very bright because the moon was high in the sky. This object that I observed was about 40° high in the sky when I first noticed it. I am in southern Ohio and it would put this object over Africa or maybe the Indian Ocean or somewhere abouts in this region based on what I know about where the moon is when it rises in the east. It can be directly over Africa and be hanging in the lower eastern sky in Ohio.  The moon was about 60° high to the east of this object in the east. I also remembered hearing on the a.m. radio of an asteroid scheduled to hit the earth but later discovered it was for the year 2029. I also heard something about this asteroid being so large that if it hit the ocean, it would cause a tsunami. So, I thought, if I hear of a tsunami on Christmas Day then it was an asteroid perhaps.

It was making a loud engine noise.  It was not going very fast, kind of cruising.  I thought it looked strange, but not so strange that it was beyond human technology.  It was my impression that it was some sort of plane created by man.  Another person was walking toward me, and he had seen it too, and joked to me that it must have been a stealth plane.  If I held a baseball at arm's length, that is about the size of what I saw.  Even though I thought it was strange, I wouldn't assume it was a UFO.  But then I heard this object mentioned on the Jeff Rense show, and Peter Davenport and Jeff requested witnesses to describe it, so I have done so.

However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.   Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o'clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I've ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.

The sky was typical gray-blue, as commonly seen here in the winter. I think this is why I noticed this shape, it was just up there in the sky to my right. It was white in color, rectangle in shape with a glow around it. Traffic was light to moderate at the time so I was able to look around in the sky and to my left, about North, I saw two contrails. So now I am watching this shape to my right and the contrails which are closing in on the shape on my left. I kept comparing the two situations and the two contrails were headed right for the shape. As the contrails got close to the shape they seem to split into seperate directions around the shape. The shape never seemed to move, change in appearance, it just floated there.

As we were approaching the intersection, I notice 4 very bright lights - in a pair above the treeline in the west.   I didn't know what they were and my boyfriend thought they must be tower lights of somekind.  I was not aware of any toweres being built there, but thought it might be a reasonable conclusion.   As time went on, I thought they were moving to the east and toward us and the town.  At that point, we thought they might be military planes as there is a strip in the area somewhere.  But, I felt these craft were too big to be military planes.  However, it was dark and so one couldn't see much but the lights.   As we passed through the interestion, I continued to watch and noticed the lights on the craft.  I felt they were not the usual lighting of commercial planes.  I am not that familiar with military planes, but the back lights did not seem to reflect that of tail lights - but a circular set of green lights (maybe 5).  There was at least one red blinking light.  We turned around to get a better look while the crafts were flying over the Hwy.  We thought we would be able to get a good look because they seemed to move slowly.  But, as we turned around, we were not able to see much else at a close range.  They were at a low altitude like military planes, but we did not hear any loud engine sounds like I have heard in the past.  I guess I didn't think that much about it because we were in a car and may not have been able to hear a noise like that.   I think the biggest thing that stands out is that the ""wing span"" of the bright 2 lights (left and right) seemed way too wide for a plane and most of all, I have not seen green lights like that before on a plane.  I have seen lots of military planes in the area and this did not seem to be like what I had seen before.

The object was gliding quickly West just below the clouds when I noticed it, and I could see only its lights, but not yet its shape. After a few minutes, it went into the clouds and lit up the mist enough to see the droplets in the air, and its disk shape was at least three times the size of a commercial aircraft. It hovered for a good solid 10 minutes. It faded into a tiny point, then returned to it's original size!  It changed position from being horizontal to vertical to the ground, but mostly remained vertical. It had three lights. The bottom light was a very bright, brilliant white, and very large. It was flashing extremely fast, and somewhat erratically. It appeared to be made of overlapping light rays. It had an almost a solid dome shape, but looked like a flower, or a thousand-petalled lotus like the traditional image of the crown chakra. The middle light was a dimmer, flat, solid circle, slightly off-center to the left of the bottom light. It was closer to the bottom light than the top, and was not flashing. The top light was a dark red colour, also a flat solid circle, and was flashing slowly and steadily. The top light was lined up with the bottom one.  My friend and I both experienced strong tingling sensations around our chest and crown. I got rushes throughout my body.  The object began to move again. It then faded out of view for a few minutes, flashed the red light once more, and was gone.

It was very low in the sky and drifting slowly down over Lake Ontario, in a vertical position to the ground. The intersection we were at was stuck on stop in all directions, except for one pedestrian light on the left side in front of us, that was stuck on go, for about five minutes. The radio faded out for as long as the intersection lights were stuck. Again, my friend and I felt tingling at our crown and chest, once again I got rushes, and the air generally felt alive.

My sister was driving south on Highway 61 in Hastings, MN en route to Winona when she spotted a bright, oval shaped white light southeast of her position.  There were scattered clouds and the moon was fully visible.  This object appeared at approximately the 3-4 o'clock position relative to the moon and my sister assumed that it was the light of an oncoming plane that she was seeing until it began to perfom some very remarkable movements.  From its stationary position it rapidly decended vertically to near the horizon level and hovered.  It seemed either to be wobbling or to be flashing lights, the clouds made it difficult to tell.  The object then reversed direction to head directly upwards approximately 1/3 the distance it had initially decended then stopped again.  After a second or two the object shot off with incredible speed to the northeast before disappearing.  She had managed to reach me by cell phone during the sighting and was obviously excited and seemed certain that she had seen no ordinary aircraft.  Unfortunately the object left the area before she was able to take pictures.  Also of note is the fact that she saw a vehicle pulled over to the side of the road with a man and his child watching the object through binoculars.

We determined this by the objects proximity to a mountain in the same area. We noticed the light because it was moving all around but not going anywhere. It also caught our attention because there is normally very little aircraft activity in the area, due to its remote location. The light would also change colors every few minutes, from white to green and back. After observing for a few minutes, we noticed another object to our west at about the same distance, behaving in the same manner. We looked in all directions and noticed two more. One to the east and one to the south. These appeared a bit more distant. As for altitude, my guess is from 2,000 ft. for the closest two to ??? for the distant lights. Again, all were just hovering, then moving up and down, left and right. Very erratic. Finally, the lights just went out. I returned to my dorm and found my roomate was listening to his police scanner, as he was a part time ambulance driver. When I walked in, he asked if I had noticed any lights in the sky because the scanner chatter was all about mysterious lights between Alpine and Fort Davis.

When I saw the object it was a stationary bright white light at an extremely high altitude.  My first words were ""thats a star"", but after about 15 or 20 seconds of remaining absolutely still the object shot straight back into space at such an incredible rate of speed that it just got smaller and smaller until it was totally out of site.

This was at dusk. I was inside informing her when reception was clear. She came down off the roof, walked in the back door and told me she just saw a huge UFO. She described the incident to me and to be honest, I dismissed her story as a ""mis-identification"" of a known aircraft. I've always regretted that. Her depiction of the event is as follows: While adjusting the antenna, she looked up and saw a huge kite (diamond?) shaped aircraft, hovering silently, just a few blocks north of our house, near North Star Mall. She said it was about the size of two football fields, the structure appeared black in color and the bottom had numerous white colored lights. It hovered for a few seconds about 600 ft. off the gound then very quickly, shot off to the west and out of site. From her description, the object was very, very large and I couldn't understand why we never heard any reports about the event. She can recount this even, in detail, anytime. Let me add that a couple of years later, while driving in San Antonio one evening, we both saw a mysterious craft, traveling slowly, a low altitude, near the intersection of I10 and Loop 410. My wife said, ""there it is!"" Just like the other one I saw. My reaction again, was sort of like ""well, whatever!"" I think what we saw was just so bizzare, we had trouble accepting it. Now, years later, I do accept it and would like to know if others witnessed these events, the same time we did.  Note: I filed another report a few minutes ago of an incident that I experienced in Alpine, TX. In error, I listed another witnesses name(Russ Davis), rather than mine.

I was facing southwest as I looked up and to my left at the tea cup part of the Sagitarius constelation which was about 35 degrees high in the sky. I looked down at the dog and then looked up again. This time I looked up near zenith facing southwest. I did not see a craft. I saw some type of strange light effect. I will be able to describe it very clearly but it will take a lot of words. Imagine how this would look in the sky: If you had a plastic zip-loc sandwich bag and you were looking down on the opening as the bag hung vertically, you would only see a thin line of transparent plastic. This is what I saw in the sky. If I held up my hand at arms length and spread my thumb and little finger as far appart as possible it would seem to be about that width. It was translucent white. I could see stars through it. I saw this thing apear while looking up at the sky. It was a straight line then the thing got wider in the middle, the same way a plastic bag would look if you started opening it from the middle. Inside of the widening thing it still had a whiteness to it but it was easier to see through the middle than the edges. Inside it there was a line from end to end but it wasn't straight. It curved a little toward the top line of the light. The line was as thick as the other edges. If I were looking southwest and then tilted my head up this light in the sky was side to side. Here is what happened and it happened faster than you can read this. I looked up, the long horizontal light then started appearing like someone at a TV station sliding in an effect. It got wider in the middle, reached its maximum brightness (a little brighter than a cloud passing over a city at night) then started fading away to nothing as it started closing and it was gone. I guess I should mention how wide it seemed to open. Looking at the overall length and then comparing the opening to the length of the whole thing I would say it got about one tenth as wide as the whole length. This thing was see-through the whole time. After watching it I remembered to look at my watch and also the position of the stars. At first it seemed to show up almost diagonally in what reminded me of the great square of Pegasus. Five minutes later I looked up again and I couldn't find that group of stars. I found this very odd that I couldn't locate that pattern again. Did the sky change on me? It is the weirdest thing. Perhaps something is up in the sky creating some type of camoflage that resembles stars, just the wrong pattern. That would change the pattern in the sky. I don't have a star chart to do a check.

I observed what I thought was a firefly going directly back and forth, back and forth and then bouncing up and down.

It looked a little like the ""follow the bouncing ball"" thing from old cartoons, but with the light of an arc welder.  It's distance was impossible to really guage, but it was directly between us and the lights of comberland MD. which was approx. 25 miles away. It increased altitude and decreased altitude a number of times during this kind of random set of movements.  It was the lowest observable light in the sky, because of a ridge that was between me and the Comberland skyline.  I got out of the tent, watched it for about 10 minutes, then I went back in and woke up my 8 hr old son and forced him to be a witness for about another 10 minutes.  I kept waiting for it to zip away at some enourmous speed, but it suddenly just faded away in uder a 2nd.

It was no larger than a good sized star, but its movements were reallky significant.  It was covering what would have been about 6 inches of sky between my outstreched hands.

I was in my backyard with my telescope (41x mag, 60mm refractor, f/15) and a pair of 10x50mm binoculars to look for this very object(s) as seen last 4th of July at the same time in the same general area of the sky.  I first spotted it a 9:03pm (Sprint time on my cell phone) at approximately 123-degrees magnetic bearing from my location at approx. 7-degrees elevation.  It was a bright, steady red light, comparable in brightness to that of the red navigation light on a small general aviation aircraft, of which there were two or three in the south pattern at Gillespie Field Airport at the time.  The color of red seemed slightly deeper than standard navigation light red.  The object was moving very slowly but steadily from south to north and ascending slightly.  After about 5 minutes, it began to flicker a bit.  The flickering progressed with time to where at 9:15pm it was flickering as if a flame being blown by wind.  No regularity to the flickering.  At 9:17pm, the light flickered out as if it was a flame source that ran out of fuel.  I watched it through the telescope as the last glimmer of its light flickered out...and it was gone.  Last bearing, approx. 107-deg magnetic, 12-deg elevation.  (Based on alignment with Polaris(north star) and subtracting local magnetic variation of about 13-deg.)  Its appearance through the telescope gave no more details than looking at a bright star through the telescope.  There was no smoke trail visible as I might expect from a burning flare.  flares can leave a smoke trail in the air that their own light will illuminate.  There was no parachute or balloon visible that might have been illuminated by the light of a flare.  No falling sparks visible.

It may have been launched from the vicinity of Grossmont College and carried to the east by light winds to over El Cajon where it extinguished.

My neighbor later told me that a couple hours later he saw the dot while driving in Atwater Village.   The strangest thing is the pictures.  Upon development, the pictures show now only the dot, but other streaks of light, maybe something moving fast or something being projected (?).   And most striking, a handful of darker dots all around the pictures and the object.  The look like dark spots, but a couple of the pictures show a red spot in the middle of the dot.

It was a clear blue sky.   Our home was in the town of Teaneck in northern New Jersey which is just 3 or 4 miles west of Manhattan.   The cylinder was traveling in the direction of its long axis.    It was blunt or squared off on both ends.   It gave the impression of being at the altitude of a jetliner (Boeing 707's were just beginning to fly around 1957).     But of particular interest was that the cylinder was followed by a gold colored circular object that was about one length of the cylinder to the rear.   Both objects traveled in tandem.    The circular object was no wider than the width of the cylinder.   At first I thought it might be Sputnick and the booster that put it in orbit.     Besides the fact that the round object was following the cylinder, I also knew that Sputnick was too small to be seen by the naked eye.   I knew it wasn't an aircraft since it was not tapered in the front and rear and in addition there were no wings visible.    Years later I read that cylindrical shaped UFO's had often been observed with disc shaped UFO's that were sometimes seen entering or leaving the cylinder UFO.   I'd guess this was one of those cylinder ""carrier"" UFO's with an accompanying disc.  It would be very interesting if others also observed this cylinder UFO in the greater NYC area in the fall of 1957.    I come from a family of scientists and engineers (my dad was a MIT grad) and I love science myself so I believe I am a reasonably objective observer. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was driving east toward Boone, NC, along US Hwy 421, which is in the NE corner of the state, at approximately 10 - 10:30 PM, about the middle of December, of 1982.  It was a cold & crisp evening with no clouds, and was a beautiful starry night.  I was looking out my side window toward the nearby mountains which the road paralleled, when something above caught my eye.  There was not any other traffic on the road at this time.  Slowing down somewhat to try & get a better look at what I had thought I had seen, I rolled the window down & looked out & up.  At this time I saw a bunch of pale blue lights in formation overhead moving slowly toward the northeast.  I pulled off the side of the road & got out of my vehicle.  Overhead, at what I guessed to be maybe 1000 - 1200 feet above, I could just barely make out the shape of a large dark boomerang and the pale blue lights were evenly spaced along the leading edge.  The lights did not waver and were constant.  I could easily see the stars behind the object blotted out as the shape passed in front of them.  Shortly after pulling over, another vehicle came along heading in the same direction as I had been.  My lights were still on, & I assume they must have thought I had a vehicle problem, as they slowed down & pulled over a short distance behind me.  They saw me standing by the side of the road peeering up, & they also got out to see what I was looking at.  There were 2 or 3 people in the other car.  I never did get their names, but pointed out to them what I was seeing.  They saw it as well.  The shape seemed to be moving quite slowly across the sky.  There was no sound at all.  I assumed the altitude of the shape above, as I had nothing to gauge the distance by, it being dark.  But looking at the object & holding my arms extended upward & pointing to either side of the boomerang itself, my hands were approximately 3 1/2 feet apart.  This is the only way I can judge how big the shape was, other than that the shape was about the same size as the B-52 bombers, which used to do fly overs on a regular basis over the area during the early days of the Vietnam War, in training missions.  These bombers used to fly at about 1000 - 1200 feet, close enough to the ground that you could see the windows along the side, & could easily make out the markings on the wings.  I watched this object as it slowly passed overhead, until I could see it no longer.  I don't think it was any kind or type of conventional aircraft, due to the fact that it made no sound whatsoever, & it seemed to be moving too slowly for its size.  I have never seen anything like this before or after this one night, but I will certainly never forget what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I don't normally write things like this, but I happened upon this site and it sounds like a serious place and I've kept this inside me for years. this is what I saw....  Westwood California.  In Summer 1983 the Movie ""The Terminator"" was just beginning to appear in movie theatres. I was going to the midnight showing.  Standing on the corner across the street from the theatre my friends had already crossed the street. As I was standing there waiting for the light to change, an older black man quickly approached me and said: ""You see it"" with his finger pointing just above the lower buildings surrounding the theatre. I didn't see him initially so he startled me a bit. I looked at him first and noticed that he had a nail hammer in his hand. I thought... WTF is this guy doing with a hammer in his hand at 11pm (that question was never answered after the siting). I took a few steps away and he was still pointing with this strange little grin on his face.  For whatever reason I concluded that he was not a threat and took a glance. Following his finger movement against a black sky with stars visible, I began to focus and noticed the stars in the distance disappearing from view and then reappearing in a right to left horizontal movement. As my eyes finally solved the problem I realized that what was screening them out was only about 400 yards in front and maybe 300 feet altitude. As I focused further I noticed this perfectly square shape was moving slowly, silently across the sky. So Black was it that only the stars and some high clouds in the background were the only thing that gave away it's silouette initially. But it was close, I could see it was solid and fairly large and absolutely square. As it moved away, I followed it like a hawk and noticed that it had no depth to it!??, like a huge piece of paper, or a giant Window, Mirror?? Whatever, it looked like something that was never meant to be seen and my feeling is that it would never have been seen unless there was some malfunction causing it to get out of position.  I had completely forgotten about the old black dude standing there next to me. When it disappeared behind the buildings, the look we gave to each other was one of confirmation that we both just wittnessed something completely real.  So sure of what I saw, I laughed to myself for days, knowing it would be silly to even try to tell anyone about it.  It was so intelligent and indescribable that it would be just pointless and I'm sure that's just how they want it.  ((name deleted))...Los angeles ,CA ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am getting back pieces of my memory as the years go on. Coming home from my job at Pizza H** in Monroe, I was approching Marshville city limits when I saw an object over the trees. People I am almost 35 years old and of sound mind! This object was moving at about a 1/2 mile per hour. I was wandering why the whole town was not at a stand-still. If anyone else noticed it, they sure didnt show interest. I was compelled to check this thing out. I didnt know all of the road names, but I knew how to get around town, so I moved closer, took a right and there it was coming over the trees to my left, directly above at (11:00 sight). Maybe 4 stories above the ground, no sound. O.K. this thing was an egg shape on its side, covered in various colored lights. The lights were like the jumbo christmas lights not the small ones. I found myself 3 streets down the road, about a 1/4 mile out of the town light, still in my car. I looked out my window to find the object and it was high above me to the left and shot out faster than anything my mind could comprehend. Now for the strange part... I put my car in drive(it was still running)recognized the street I was on and made my way home, thinking less and less of what happened. Everyone in my home was asleep so I did not wake them, so I went to bed. Woke up a little while later sitting up turned around with my face looking down at my pillow-blood pouring and I mean pouring out of my nose. My mother came in to help me and I mentioned none of this to her, Fear that she would think I was using drugs, at that time in my life I did smoke mary jane. Now the more time went on the less I would think about this, until about 5 years later when I would connect the dots. I hate Alien abduction stories, people that are made pregnant by Aliens or what have you, but this was real! I live a somewhat normal life, but I know What happened in Marshville N.C. that night, I am a firm believer in the fact that something happened to me, and my memory was tampered with.  Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-02-24T00:00:00,35.0051,-80.3544

I thought it was a piece of trash in the air at first, but it had a very bright, metallic glint to it and it was holding altitude and moving along toward the south-southeast, dipping and climbing a little in a very odd manner.   I stopped and watched it;  the flashing continued in an irregular, fluttery fashion, and it continued its southerly motion at a deliberate pace that seemed very much at odds with the wind at the time, which was calm at the surface.  After perhaps two minutes of observation, the object was due south of me;  it suddenly rose very rapidly to a position probably 70 degrees above the horizon and stood motionless.   It continued to flash and I could see a black phase alternating between the bright ones.   There was no discernable shape and the size was just sufficient to give me the impression of angularity.  If you imagine a rectangular mirror of a few square feet of area, perhaps half a mile away, tumbling and twisting randomly, but hanging still in the air, that's what this thing reminded me of.  It seemed to be relatively close,  I would guess between a quarter and a half a mile, but probably not over a mile.  As it hung in the sky, flashing, I could occasionally see hints of color and there was occasionally a sense of a sort of fuzzy distortion immediately around the light.  It continued to hold in position for approximately a minute and then it suddenly dived down at a very rapid rate and then shot off horizontally just above the southeastern horizon, traveling roughly east-southeast.   It vanished behind some buildings and trees.   Surface winds were light and variable, with a breeze of perhaps one or two miles per hour.  Temperature was in the eighties, the time was a few minutes before one in the afternoon.  The sky was perfectly clear and visibility was on the order of eighty miles or better.  The only thing I can think of that might have behaved like this would be a small piece of aluminized mylar caught in a thermal.  But this object was moving a relatively high rate of speed for most of the time I was observing it;  the winds present at the time cannot account for this motion.   The zoom to high altitude might have been caused by a thermal,   but the hover and very rapid descent to low altitude (around 100 feet) followed by a rapid translational motion is beyond anything I know that thermals are likely to do.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

On this night I have been enjoying the crisp, clear star lit night in my backyard hottub, relaxing aftera long workday.  I had been observing the starry night for about 20 minutes prior to the occurrence.  The air termperature was about 25 degrees with a moderate wind from out of the northwest at about 10 to 15 kts. I had been observing several of the star formations in the northern sky when a movement in the sky caught my attention. I had been observing several commercial airline departures from the Kansas City International Airport, KCI, located about 45 nautical miles northwest of my location prior to the occurrence.  When my attention was drawn to the subject craft, I thought that it was the only one. I was surprized to see another one following the first in a left echelon flight formation about 5 seconds later. Both craft were blacked out, ie, no visible lighting as required by FAA flight regulations. Ambient light from the surface delineated the crafts surface being that of a flat black and distinguishable from that of the night sky. The structure was solid as it blocked out the stars as they passed just west of my location. A calculated lat/long was made, being @lat 39deg,00'-17"", long:94deg,17'-02"".  I thought to myself, a veteran pilot with over 10,000 flight hours in numerous aircraft and helicopters, what the heck are those carft flying without any markings (lights) in controlled airspace. Then it occurred to me that maybe these were stealth bombers on maneuvers and the Federal Aviation Admin (FAA) would know about it. It should be noted that even the military are required to have permission to cross active airspace utilizing discrete transponder codes as to avoid other air traffic operating in the controlled space.  The two craft were observed to be flying on a north to south heading, at an altitude of below 10,000 feet agl and at a speed of between 200 and 250 knots. This speed I estimated based upon how long my observation was for the distance traveled. As a veteran pilot, and as a former aircraft accident investigator, I was concerned with the safety of other aircraft in the area, as these two craft could not be seen by commercial or other air traffic operating in the same area. I observed a commercial jet pass through at the same estimated altitude less than a minute behind the two craft, on a southeast heading of about 120 degrees. I estimated the two craft to be about 3 times the size of the commercial airliner with a shape of a horseshoe front fuselage, rounded underneath and with a smooth underside. An area of distortion just aft of this viewable side was present, precluding me from viewing the complete structure of the craft.  As a veteran pilot, I did not jump to any conclusions as to what the craft were, but was more concerned that they were operating in controlled airspace and I wanted to know more about their mission.  On Tuesday AM, I contacted a friend of mine wht the FAA ARTCC facility in Olathe, KS to ascertain if he could help me identify who or what these craft were and if they had any radar signatures or transponder data. An FAA approach control facility supervisor responded to my call on Wednesday AM and I relayed my observations.  He indicated that he would attempt to reconstruct the occurrence based upon my observations and let me know if they could identify the subject craft.  To this date, I've had no response from the FAA.  Maybe a FOIA request is necessary to ascertain the nature of this event.  One further note, during the observation of the two craft, I did not hear any noise eminating from them, but them moved silently on their flight. On the other hand, the commercial jet aircraft I observed crossing their track behind them made it's distinctive noise signature from the engines as I heard it approaching from the northwest and as it flew over my location.

There were no lights anywhere on it, at least as seen from my angle of view on the ground.  It made no sound, despite its large size.  I waited for several minutes after it was out of sight for a delayed sound, but I never heard anything from it.  Its altitude is difficult to determine; however, it appeared to be at least several thousand feet high.  Its size was about 6 times as large as what a 747 looks like when it is at 30,000 feet.

Both of the craft were completely blacked out, that is running without standard FAA lighting required on all aircraft flown with regulated airspace of the contiguous United States, at an approximated altitude of below 10,000 feet. The observed craft were of a flat black surface color, with a solid structure(as they blocked out the stars) as they passed just to the west of my location. I thought to myself, (a veteran pilot with over 10,000 flight hours, in commercial multi-engine fixed wing and rotor wing aircraft with instrument ratings). What the heck are those craft flying with any markings or light designations in regulated airspace!

As the two craft passed from my view of them and within about one minute of their passing, I observed a commercial jet aircraft displaying the standard FAA required lighting, having departed the Kansas City Intl airport coming from the northwest, climbing on a southeasterly heading. The commercial jet passed through the track of the two craft at approximately the same altitude I had observed them flying, on their nearly due south track.  The two craft were approximately 3 times the size of the commercial airliner with a slight V or rounded front fuselage and a flat bottom solid structure.  As a veteran pilot, I did not jump to any conclusions as to what the craft were, but was more concerned that they were operating in controlled airspace and I wanted to know more about their mission.

So I got out of the bar area in his garage and everyone at the party in the backyard was looking up at the sky and trying to figure out what these 2 very bright dots were. They mentioned one was moving pretty fast and then just stopped.  When I went outside the 2 bright dots in the sky were just hovering in the same place.  I couldn't hear any sound from them.  They looked like a Roman Candle (firework that shots red fireballs) but very hi in the sky and were not moving.  Some of the girls at the party started to get freaked out because no one could make out what the bright lights were.  I first thought they could have been a helicopter but they seemed to be 5 times higher then any helicopter I have ever seen.  One of the lights seemed to blink a little but then stopped. I am very skeptical about UFO's and I started making a few jokes like, ""HOLY SH!T, its like Independence Day (Movie) and the aliens are going to blow us up!""  After a couple minute, I actually started to get kind of weird about the situation because I couldn't think what the lights could have been.  About 1 minute before midnight, one of the lights slowly faded out and all of a sudden was gone.  Right at midnight the 2nd light disappeared.  It was very strange. This morning I woke up and went to www.signonsadiego.com to see if there might have been a story about it.  I typed in the search '2 red lights in the sky' and nothing came up.  So I did the same on yahoo.com and came across a news story from 2002 that started freaking me out a bit because it sounded kind of like our experience.  They had a link to this website and I noticed it had a 'report sighting' so I thought I would add my comments.  I would have never known how to report this weird event to anyone except word of mouth to my friends.  Is there any way you could somehow look into this event?  I would love to see what it could have been.  I could round up most of the people at the party if needed.  I tried to take a photo from my cell phone but you can barely make out the 2 dots in the photo.  I am not sure if anyone else took a photo.",2005-01-19T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

After arriving at their house I exited my car in their driveway to stretch my legs while my son gathered some belongings from the car.  I looked up to check the stars, which were brighter at that particular time and location (3 a.m., small subdivision basically in open treeless grassland/scrub brush terrain approx 1/2 mi E of I-25 at Johnstown exit).   We watched the sky and talked for a few moments when I noticed 2 faint starlike objects traveling from N to S/SE.  They were roughly an inch apart if a ruler was held at arms length.  One was not in front of the other, rather offset and slightly to the left(NE).   I checked my watch which said 3:00 a.m. exactly as they were directly overhead.  Speed was close to that of a jetliner although the impression was much faster since the faintness made them appear to be well up near the edge of the atmosphere.  No noise was noted.  As they travelled to the south the first one became dim and the second became much brighter, approximately half as bright as Venus.  They then both faded slowly from view.     We scanned the sky for any other movement but after a few minutes saw none, so my son went inside and after another sky check I re-entered my vehicle and drove home. ((NUFORC Note:  The manner in which the two objects faded from view is characteristic of how satellites fade from view during the evening hours, as they move away from the setting sun, and into the Earth's shadow.  However, we do not know if satellites would be directly illuminated by the Sun at the hour indicated.  Moreover, as they orbit to the southeast, they would be approaching the rising sun in the east, so they should not fade from sight of a witness on the ground.  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD))",2005-05-28T00:00:00,40.3369,-104.9122

It slowly traveled to the North for about 1 minute or so, then made a  wide, circular curve - clockwise until it headed ESE.  My view was obstructed for about 15 seconds by trees.  Once I was able to view it again, it was heading ESE towards my area.  As it approached, I began to see color and shape. It passed directly overhead in a more Easterly direction and continued until it could no longer be seen.  The object appeared to be traveling slowly, but if it was farther off than I percieved it may have been moving much faster. It was glowing an Orange-Yellow color, and the lights on the bottom of it appeared to be segmented into three rectangular shapes, nearly the same in shape and size.  There was a halo of light surrounding it that was more yellow in color and appeared misty.  That is how the teardrop type shape was seen. The object was rotating counter-clockwise on what appeared to be an asymmetrical axis at about 1 revolution every 3 or 4 seconds.  The revolutions and latteral speed were constant.  Though the defining lines of the object could not be seen clearly, I got a distinct view of the underside as I described it. I called my step-daughter out to see it but the only view of it that she briefly saw was a rotation seen in the distance as it left our field of vision.  Not nearly as clear as my view had been during the duration that I experienced. I wish I had my camera.  This would have made an incredible video- the likes of which I have never seen.

I, too, have been startled, momentarily, when first witnessing birds flying rapidly through the night sky.  The lighter colored feathers reflect illumination from the ground, giving an observer on the ground the impression that a peculiar object is streaking across the sky, when in fact, the birds may be much closer than the witness perceives to be the case.

I thought it may be a aircraft due to the intensity of the light.I arrived at my parents house and remained visiting for approx a half hour, when I was going to leave I noticed the light was in the exact location as when I arrived. I knew it could not be a aircraft as it had remained stationary in the sky. I asked both my father and mother to take a look at the light to see if they had any idea as to what it may be. It was then that I remembered that in early August of 2003 we had a observed a similiar light in teh sky in the exact location and had reported it to our local sheriff department becasue through the binoculars it seemed to be a spining object with red, blue & green lights that remained in the same spot before abruptly disappearing. My father and I observed the object through 10x binoculars, at this time we observed an object that seemed to spin (as if a conical shape - imaging a short, fat ice cream cone on it's side) with every color of teh rainbow being emmitted from the circular end. With your naked eye you could continue to observe colors changing, but only in hues of red to blue to green. We then called a friend who lives on the outskirts of Green Lake, he also saw it to teh southeast, slighlty abov ethe horizon and observed teh similar movement and colors that we did through his spotting scope. I then departed my parents home and proceded to a my boyfriends home between Green Lake and Markesan, WI. I watched the object remain stationary in the sky the entire drive and it continued to change colors. At this time, my boyfriend and his nephew and I sat on a hill and continued to view it through binoculars at 10x. The object continued to spin and emit colors from the circular side. At this time we also noticed 4 planes flying from west to east (at a very fast speed) within very close proximity to each other. They seemed to fly right in front of the object, though the object seemed to be quite further into the atmosphere. At about 9:30 we stopped watching the object.

I live in Havre de Grace and everyone in Harford County is familiar with Aberdeen Proving Ground, and we are even more familiar with their aircraft and flight plans.

The object then seemed to change direction, I thought it was going to go due east, but as I watched, I realized it was changing its altitude as well as it's direction.  It climbed fast and high, and dimmed quickly. I was able to see it for about 4 seconds before it was too high to see anymore. There was absolutely no sound, and it was definitely close enough that I should have been able to hear something. I have been interested in the night sky since I was young, I go out to find constellations and planets, and like to view meteor showers and comets.

As the object fell, it disappeared behind a cloud, and did not reappear below the cloud, as it should have done, if it was in a free fall.  The object was not an aircraft, but something round and under intelligent control. I've held a commercial pilot's license for 36 years, & I say it was not of this world.  Another encounter of mine: In August 4-6, 1991, I was standing in the snow at the 7000' level of Mt Hood. I saw a round shinny object moving slowly at 090 degrees, at 12,500', then the object came to a stop directly over Mt Hood. The oject glowed, then moved 8 miles south (160 degrees)& stopped, then moved 16 miles north (360 degrees)and stopped, then it moved directly back over Mt. Hood again, then sped out of sight (2 seconds) heading 090 degrees again. All this took place in a matter of seconds. I reported this to the park ranger, who said she gets UFO reports daily!?! So she was not concerned. The object was identical to the objects that was seen flying or hovering over Mexico City in 1990 or 91.

The subway and the Amtrak share a stretch of rail through this part of Boston that heads to NYC and I often see helicopters flying along this path and figured it was just a TV traffic copter or some other helicopter flying towards us. I noticed it was particularly low (maybe the height of a ten story building) and I couldn't hear it like I typically do when a helicopter passes over. As it flew past us on our left (driver's side) we could see that the copter had no discernible markings on it and was a dull, slate grey/black color and had a enclosed rotor in the tail - very modern looking. It slowed to a hover and looked as though it was looking for something or someone (if I had to guess on the way it was traveling - most of the other's just zoom along towards Logan or the hospitals). Even very near to us it was quiet. The whole thing struck me as odd and figured I would report it since ""black helicopters"" seem to be common around a UFO incident. About five minutes later another copter passed along a similar flight path and was much higher up and garnered no additional attention.

My sister said ""look at that light in the sky, it's white, blue, and red."" I was driving so I could not pay very much attention, but I glanced up and noticed it. My sister then said ""look, it's moving."" At that point my sister-in-law in the back seat said ""that is not a helicopter, it's moving too fast."" I wanted to check it out because they seemed to be alarmed about it. As I was turning the corner I looked up in the sky and I saw it move very fast back in the directon that it was coming from, so I immediately pulled over into a driveway and parked. We continued to watch for about 3 minutes when we noticed that there were more lights blinking and moving in the sky. They began to move back and forth and up and down way too fast to be anything other than ufo's. We noticed that they seemed to be responding to each other by blinking their lights in patterns and after they would do this we noticed the others moving towards each other. At this point we were outside the car screaming to each other in disbelief of what we were seeing. Then we noticed that one of them began to come closer in our atmosphere and moving in our direction. At that point I called my husband, hysterically trying to explain what we were seeing. In this time that I was on the phone the object came closer and moved over our heads at about as high as a helicopter would fly, and that is when we knew these objects were not stars or planes, etc. We could actually see the lights rotating in a clockwise motion around   the middle of the circular craft. That object continued past us, and headed towards town.I then hung up with my husband who thought I must have gone insane. We then focused on the 6-7 other lights in the sky that were moving quickly and flashing lights that were a reddish color. The lights were then scattered throughout the sky and we saw some that they were moving in the direction of our apartments so we hurried home. As I was coming in the apartment complex we noticed that one of the lights looked like it was coming down toward the ground so we drove to the back of apartments to continue watching it. It then started moving behind the trees so we could not see it. Then all of a sudden it came back up into the sky above the trees and then we noticed the other lights coming over from up the street. By this time we are terrifird because there are so many at one time we were afraid that we were being invaded at that moment, so we called the local sheriff's office and began reporting what we saw, and asked if there were other report's yet. As my siser was talking to the person on the phone I noticed a bigger light coming from the ground up over the trees. The best way to describe it would be the way a light turns on a lighthouse, except we don't actually see the light, just the flashing rotation. Just as that light was turning I saw a beam of black light shoot up into the sky where the objects were. I would have expected a laser light to be white but this was not, it looked like a shadow of a laser being shot in the sky. At that point I was really thinking I was insane , and I said to the girls ""did you see that black laser beam shoot into the sky"", just as I said that another black beam extended to the sky and we all saw it that time. It was unlike anything I've ever seen, as it happened we were all screaming into the phone to the sheriff's office what had just happened with the beam and that was enough to get him off the phone and out to where this was happening. He informed us that he was leaving the station to see what we were reporting. We did not tell him our exact location or names in fear of us being labeled as insane. We then noticed that after that beam of dark light the colored flashing lights seemed to just flicker out into space as if they were never there. We then rushed home to tell my brother and he confided in us that he's seen them ever so often in the same vicinity where we saw them. I did call the sheriff's office back to see what the officer had witnessed and we were told that the sargeant was the one who left and he had'nt returned yet. I know this sounds crazy but I am a 25 yr. old mother who works in the medical field and the last time I checked I was completely sane. After seeing that black laser beam of light shoot into the sky I know that what we witnessed was not ordinary. I have always been interested in ufo's even as a child but I had never seen one. I forgot to mention that after seeing the first light I said to my sister ""I always look and wish to see one"" and that is when they just seemed to come from everywhere. It was like they were saying ""you wanted to see us here we are, take a good look.""  This experience has changed my life, I came home and described it to my husband and began to cry because everything changes when you actually see one up close and personal. When I'm reading or watching tv shows about them I can put it off as someone's imagination. Now it is clear to me that we are not alone.

I travel HWY 84 every day to work and back and am very familiar with our night sky.  We have very few light sources and can see quite well on any given clear night.  A typical night's lights usually consist of lots of airplanes, cell and other various towers and scattered utility lights.  We also have some helicopter traffic from Ft. Knox.  They do maneuvers in the valley where my house is located.  They hover and will seemingly shoot straight up into the air.  The sound is sometimes ear shattering if they fly too low.  On the night of Feb. 15 I was returning from Louisville.  The night sky was relatively clear, but very black as it can get down this way.  I noticed a large bright light just over the canopy of the trees.  At first I thought it was a very bright star, again not unusual down this way.  The light became larger the closer I drove.  It was not distant like a star or the moon.  I came to the point of emission just past Union Band Church.  The light was bright white, a lozenge shape, and fixed, seemingly about a 1/4 mile in the air.  There was no noise, the wind was blowing, I felt my large vehile move.  The light had various spots of yellow and red on the outside edge.  I continued travelling and the light receeded out of my vision and became obstructed by the canopy of trees as I descended into the valley.  This may very well be a helicopter, of some sort.  I have never experienced one able to maneuver quite like this.  When a helicopter flies at night with a light that bright the viewer usually sees a beam the light creates.  This light was not a beam.  It seemed to have movement within the light.  Not pulses but movement like the way light moves within a static globe.

I went outside to look at the stars. The winds had picked up to substantially. It was difficult to stand, news reports gust of 60mph+ I was looking up not thinking much of the insane wind. When what appeared to be a very large almost rectangular craft.(only slightly more narrow in the front.) It was extremely large. But its difficult to say how big because it seemed that it may have been really big but at 5000ft. (maybe the size of half a football field.) or maybe smaller at a lower altitude. I can say from my perspective if I put a small pizza box (6""x6"") at arms length it wouldnt have covered the entire craft. It had 4 circular dim amberish/yellow lights on each corner of the craft that appeared to emit some sort of haze. That had an amber color. It moved very slowly. Taking several seconds to come into complete view as it pass directly over my house. One look at it and I knew it wasnt normal. No wings no blinking aircraft lights of anykind. And absolutely quiet. I ran inside and got my girlfriend  She ran out and got really frightened nearly in tears saying ""oh my god oh my god, What is that thing!?!?"" The winds were very intense. The craft continued on its easterly course.  It was visible until it passed over the horizon. We got a fairly good view of the bottom of the craft, being able to see that the bottom wasnt completely flat. but had several ridges running from front to back. Once the craft was out of sight we went inside because the winds were blowing fiercly. Perplexed by what happened we discussed it for a moment I then said ""I gotta see another one"" We went outside again and looked skyward. about 5 minutes after the craft had flown over. To the northeast a VERY large dome shaped deep blue flash went off. The flash was very odd. It appeared to explode then implode. It appeared to be behind some hills and a distance away. The explosion expanded in a dome fashion and took up approximately 1/20 of the sky.  We both got very scared at that time. The light was bright enough to light up the entire sky. About 20 minutes later the wind was back to being ABSOLUTELY DEAD CALM. I dont know what to think about it. One thing we did notice was many airplanes were in the area after this happened. up to 10-15 (not that it means much we arent to far from sacramento international and beale AFB) It appears others in my community saw the same thing. As we saw many people with pointing spot lights in the sky after the display.  Today. I looked in the paper and the cause of the power outage was still unknown. Since then they have released an update saying that 2 - 60kv wires hit each other causing the blackout. I wonder if the 2 lines hitting, is the explosion we saw. Which occured 1 hour after the power went out(it wasnt windy when the power first went out. Not even a breeze). Or obviously the powerfailure and wind can be completely unrelated to the ufo. I know what I saw that is for sure and it wasnt an airplane, helicopter or a blimp. Although my skeptical side reminds me that I do live only a few miles from Beale AFB. This might have been some sort of US craft. I am a helicopter pilot, fixed wing airplane pilot and I star gaze regularly. I have never seen anything like this before in my life.

They are easy to spot during clear skies. Not sure if there was any moon light that night, but the skies were extremely clear, I do remember.

About a week before this sighting occurred, I had witnessed a very bright shooting star which later I found out was the re-entry of part of a Russian spacecraft that was visible to most North Americans and had been witnessed by many. For this reason, I was paying more attention to the night sky than I usually did.  I was walking toward my house at the top of a hill. On the sidewalk, I was facing up the hill. There is a large bridge that crosses the river to my left and a graveyard on my right. I had just cleared the bridge when in my peripheral vision I thought I saw something in the sky. I turned my head and expected there to be nothing there, but I was surprised to see that there was something.  It was an unlit, noiseless hovering object that was floating slowly toward me. There were no lights and no markings to speak of. The only way I even detected it was the light reflecting off of the bottom of the object from the bridge's street lights. The object was at the height of a 3 to 5 story building, it was hard to tell. It was size of a large vehicle or bigger. Since it was difficult to judge the distance it was also difficult to judge the size. As it got closer to me I thought I could make out some detail - maybe a corner or a surface feature on the bottom. It could have been triangular, square or pentagonal - really no way to tell.  Once it was nearly above me, I panicked and picked up the grocery bag - which I had dropped moments before - and ran up the hill about 15 or 20 meters. I stopped and turned to see if I was being followed but the object was still moving down the hill and had altered course slightly to the east and was moving toward the centre of town. I had passed underneath a lit pedestrian crossing sign and in 30 seconds or so, the lights from the sign obscured my view of the object as it got further away.  I got home and recruited my two cousins to get a flashlight and help me see if I could find the thing. We found nothing. I regret not following it in the first place, but I was scared.

It was a shiney metallic object that appeared to have geometrical facets on top area of it.  Furthermore, we noticed that the area around the object appeared to have a ""halo"" due to the fact that it was a darker blue color than compared to the clear blue sky behind it. This ""halo"" appeared fuzzy and did not seem to have definite edges.   Due to the traffic barely moving along we were able to observe the object for around 10 mins as we slowly moved north towards downtown Seattle.  Also, since we weren't moving we were able to compare its size to the half moon that was also in that hemisphere of the sky.  Its size relative to the half moon was about 1/5 - 1/7 of the moon.  In relation to the moon it was north of it and higher towards the sky zenith.  When we compared it to fixed objects in our field of view it became obvious that it wasn't moving in relation to us. We lost sight of it when we entered the tunnels and express lanes of downtown Seattle. We saw it again when we were north of the Northgate Mall and just south of the King county line. It seemed to be in the same location in the sky relative to the horizon and moon as before. This time we only observed it for a couple of seconds before it seemed to ""vanish"" from the sky.  In the car we had 3 people (including the driver) of which two of us saw the object. All of us in the car have aerospace engineering backgrounds and have significant experience in identifying flying vehicles and their systems.   The two of us who observed the object concluded that we had never observed such an object before. We were quite surprised at how it was able to hold station so precisely and the fact that it appeared to have no aerodynamic lifting surfaces to it.

At around 12:15 I noticed a ''star'' I thought was different. At first glance I thought there was a good chance it was Venus. I have no idea what planets are visible right now. I began looking at other stars, but I always came back to check on the ""planet-star"". Until about 12:20, after looking around the sky, I turned my head back to check on the ""planet star"" and no more than 2 seconds after I got it back in my sight, it shot off in a direct angle downward, and disappeared.  This immediately made me jump up, and lose my raft. After looking around in desperation to find where it had gone, and also to make sure I was just seeing things, I saw a light in a spot in the sky where I hadn't remembered seeing one. It was the exact same size and brightness, and color (white light gleaming with a slight green). When I got out of the pool to look at it, it was gone and I could not see it at all in the sky.

Star gazing and enjoying the cool breeze from the lake this evening, I was on my patio with my dog getting some fresh air.  I saw something move across the sky above me, from east to west just over my head. Blinked my eyes to have a better look.   When I refocused I saw an unusual object / objects. It was hard to determine if just one object or more then one because of the glow of lights on it/them.  I can't give you a size because I""m not sure if it was more then one object or just one. There were three lights, in the shape of a triangle/chevron two bottom lights then one top light..in the direction of travel. The shape didn't appear to be all straight lines, it appeared shadowed in and curved a little on the inside like a chevron. It was a fuzzy outline and it's overcast tonight so I really couldn't make out if this was one object or not.  The lights were not blinking like aircraft lights do just illuminated, it wasn't a search light, spot light or other regular type lighting,there was NO engine/motor sound, no propeller sound, no NOTHING!  At first while I was watching it seemed to be moving at a fast pace like a streak above me which caught my eye...I thought at first it was a shooting star. This craft/crafts, then slowed down almost to a crawl but still moving (slower then the speed you would see a satellite move in the night sky) Then it stopped but not abruptly, very gently and went the left (south towards the lake) then back to where it started from in the same line (east to west), then to the right (north)  It came back to the original spot and began again travelling westward, towards the downtown or main core of Toronto.  As I watched it, I noticed the speed was not consistent, very irradic like fast then slow but never jerky, very smooth but odd speeds. The speed seemed to move steadily after it did that little left right (north south) thing and began it's way west again.  Eventually it was out of my sight.  I remained outside for awhile looking again and I know I will go back out again and look more.  There was a small engine aircraft and a jet around the same time and area, one travelling east the other south west (Towards Toronto Island Airport)  I've seen something almost identical to this with my father , in this same yard on this same patio and same time of year..roughly 22 years ago..I was just a young girl then.  THE ONLY difference, it was travelling from west to east and a bit lower in the sky. At that time there were (3) of them. I remember they were glowing and as I recall they looked perhaps with a green glow but not a dark or deep green rather a pale green , soft green.  As for the other things, the chevron shaped crafts...they look like the formation of how birds fly in a V but upside down..the point is the direction it travels.  I Just found this website and I""m just so very excited to provide this information and see what others have seen and read their stories.  I don't want to over run you with information but I have an additional situation which happened to me in this very house around 1am in the morning, winter time about 5 yrs ago. A beam of light entered my front room window where I was watching tv and relaxing with my mother. We both saw it. It filled our room with the brightest yet softest light that didnt' hurt or harm our eyes. I could see the light originated from the sky but it ONLY focused on our front room. The light did NOT cascade to the other rooms in the house nor did it cascade around the lawn/trees/shrubs or even the driveway or road. It was localized in this house.  I got up to look at it and stared out the window to the direction of which it came. The only thing I could see was this soft but bright glowing light in the sky hovering low, just above the treeline and across the street from us, over a park.  I continued to watch, opened the window all the way then went and stood by the front door opening it to hear if there was any noise NO NOISE no engine no propeller no nothing DEAD SILENT.  It was eerie but it didn't scare me.  I wondered what it wanted why just us just our home just here?  After a short while the light immediately faded and the craft streaked across the sky heading in a north east direction. I saw a streak, like a glowing streak behind it for a few seconds then that vanished and it was gone. That was one of the most amazing things I'd ever been witness to.  If it makes any difference, since that time I'd become quite ill. I always thought that that light and craft had something to do with it....but then again it could just be coincidental.  I am very interested in knowing if there are any other reports and being an avid sky watcher and having seen things like this before I KNOW they are real!!  I am very interested especially because it was the same flight pattern directly above my patio as it was when I was  a child.",2005-07-15T00:00:00,43.77102833099579,-79.24512173913044

The property behind my house is private, and gated so that no cars can enter.  Further, I am sure that no one should be there at all.   I was concerned why it was there and that if it was a fire I should call for help.  After watching for about 5 minutes I realized that it had not grown larger and appeared to have both red and white lights that seemed to be flickering.   I woke my husband still thinking maybe it was a large electrical item of some sort.  He said he thought it was too large and also saw that it had both red and white lights.  After watching this light for about 30minutes, I got pretty scared and decided to turn off all of our house lights and check our doors.   After going downstairs, I realized that I could still see it from my downstairs windows and realized it was too large to be a gadget of a camper or homeless person.    At this point my two sons and a house guest tried to get a better look from my deck.  We went outside and used binoculars.  Speaking for myself I can say that what I saw seemed to have a pattern of lights.  Three very faint white lights on top, one large bright one in the center and a number of white and red ones below that that seemed to be moving and alternating colors.  The exact shape of the thing I can not say.  I could only see the lights.   My husband whistled out very loudly and nothing changed at all.   My house guest taped the lights with his video camera.   Eventually, too frustrated and tired I decided to go to bed.  I went to bed at 2am.  I woke at 6am and as usual there were deer grazing in the meadow and I could see no evidence of anything out of the ordinary.   Today, my husband and I decided to go back there to see if we could find evidence of a camper or some other explanation.   What we found was no reasonable way to explain it.  I had originally speculated that the only thing I could think of with that pattern of lights would be a tractor.   The area is very wet, as it is a recently drained pond and there was not only no way for a tractor to get into the area but no tracks as well.  What we did find was a large round indentation with deeper indentations within it about every foot or so and one indentation in the center.  Some of the weeds were dried and brittle (dead) and bent to one side behind where the object had been.   I am also certain now too that it was too large to be something someone could have walked into the area with.   There was no sound at all as we witnessed the lights and the bugs, frogs and whatnots were all as usual.  I can say for sure that I will be watching tonight.   I do not wish to be interviewed or my name identified but would like to know if anything like this has been reported previously. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed quite sincere and credible to us.  We have urged her to obtain photos of the indentation, and to have the other two witnesses submit reports, too.  We hope to obtain a copy of the video.

Observed black cylindrical object hovering motionless in a vertical attitude towards the south at approx 15:30 while kids were playing in zero G room. Pointed object out to other family members but they showed little interest. Found this reaction a little bit puzzling since the object was clearly unusual. Attempted to take a picture of it with my digital camera but even at full zoom it only took up one or two horizontal pixels and perhaps four vertical pixels. So I would guess the object was no larger than a mini minor approx 1 mile away and several hundred feet in altitude. Observed object for a good 15 minutes while walking back to the car. It may as well have been a fixed hole in reality because it didn't move even slightly. Before we got back to the car I decided to drive towards the object on the way home in the hope of making an identifiction but for some reason once I started driving I forgot all about it.

Then the sunlight reflected off of it, giving the object a bright gleem.  After that it was too far for my eyes to see. My friend and I were conversating at the time.

The field in which the sighting occured is next to a heavily wooded area, known as the Savannah Preserves.  There isn't anything out there but, wild life.

My five friends, three of there small children and myself went to my friends cabin about 4 miles south of Deckers in the mountains.  At around 11 pm the adults were sitting outside the cabin enjoying a beutiful summer night, the sky was clear (on which we were making comments about how crystal and big the stars were) when we noticed a bright light literally on top of a small mountain direclty across from our mountain, about a 1/4 of a mile away, we were basically at the same height and the light was in direct line of sight.  We started speculating as to what it was, our best guess was a flood light on a cabin? only there were no cabins on that mountain.  After 10 minutes or so of discussing it, we lost interest and went on to other subjects when suddenly the light went out.  About fifteen minutes later, the light reappeared only this time it was about 100 feet above the same location, and more intense.  It was about the size of a quarter when my arm was outreached, it was a yellowish/orange color and had no sound.  We were all speculating as to what it could be but nothing conventional fit, we watched it for 10-15 minutes when I noticed it was very slowly rising (there was a big pine tree right underneath it and based on the trees upmost tip is how I first noticed that it rising).  After it was about an additional 100 feet in the air (about 1/2 an hour after it first appeared in the sky) three small, very intenensly bright white lights, they reminded me of a diamonds sparkle, appeared around the first light.  After a few minutes all three of the smaller lights darted, in a zig-zag manner to the south at a very high speed, we lost sight of them behind a mountain.  At this point the first, large light started slowly dimming out until it wasnt visible, then it would slowly dim on to its original brightness, the cycle would take about 5 minutes from bright to dim to bright agian.  At the same it was acsending a little faster than earlier but still very slowly. We watched it ascend until it was out of sight, about an hour after the little lights had darted off.  This wasnt a specutlar sighting from what I've read since, but it really raised my curiosity on this issue.  One peculiar fact I'll like to point out, before the incident, I had noticed airplanes on a north-western path above us, one about every 20 minutes or so (the red blinking lights stood out in that crystal clear sky), during the sighting, no planes flew over.",2005-02-24T00:00:00,,

Driving home from family/friend's place, headed north on Grimes-Arbuckle road - the object was off in the east (just as my husband and buddy described) red lights oscillating at random, blinked in the sky.  The arrangement of the lights indicated that there may have been a disk or saucer like shape to the actual object.  After driving down the road about .5 to .75 miles, we turned and headed back toward Arbuckle.  It was still visible as we hit the town and cruised about a mile through it, north bound, as well as about an additional 2 miles north of town as we headed to turn east onto Hahn Rd.  All the while, it continued to flash a great distance out, as it stayed pretty much just a little north of our vision - indicating a great distance between us and the object or that it was moving with us, more than likely it is the former explanation.  After about 2 miles down Hahn, we headed south on Grimes-Arbuckle Rd. again, at this point we all acknowledged seeing some new unexplainable bluish-green lights along the 2047 drain (a run-off of the Sacramento River).  This was the area at which my hubby and friend saw the red flashing lights earlier (see other report).  This area is about 1 mile from where we were, at that point.  We then headed back to Arbuckle after having scaled about 6 miles of road around a big square of fields and orchards.  Both my husband and friend have seen objects/lights in our area and elsewhere.  I have unfortunately seen many objects/lights and the like through out my life, within the central and northern areas of California.  There is also a somewhat extensive encounter record for my family.  All three of us are college educated and were of sound state of mind at the times of the sightings.  No one was intoxicated nor on any type of drug (save for the pack of smokes we in turn smoked as a result of shock/fear/yadayada!!!).",2005-01-19T00:00:00,,

I noticed two planes in the sky at the time.  One possibly private, coming from the east and closer to us, and one possibly commercial, coming up from the south west onto the scene slightly later, as the object was descending. We first noticed the object coming from south to north for several minutes.  It was moving very slowly. It made no noise, had no aura or beams projecting from it, and left no trail.  It looked the shape of a round bowl covered with a top that had a small ""cabin"" area in the middle center of it. It was very large, appearing to be maybe the size of a large house.  It was uniformly and completely lumninous, as bright as the moon, but much whiter. (The moon came up over the trees about 15 minutes later, from the east, and was yellow.)  The object then hovered for a couple of minutes, them ""wobbled"" a little,  giving the impression that it was turning.

I recognized red, blue, and green.  I went to grab my friend, when we returned there was a bright firey light adjacent to the object. The light was shaped like a torn seem, the light was seemingly almost as bright as the sun. The light was a mix of white and orange.  A jet from the local airforce bace approached from the west traveling east directly for the triangular object and adjacent light.  We knew it was a jet because of airfoce experience, it was unmistakeable.  As the jet approached the source the seem of light moved inward and closed as if it pixilated from mass to miniscule. The Triangular shape turned in a direction that faced upward and north by northwest.  At this point we no longer saw three colors of light.  We saw three red circles instead and they grew rapidly smaller with the Triangles departure.  As it moved north by northwest it broke due east and appeared to be a weather helicopter or civilian chopper of some sort.  Another event in seemingly the same location happened tonight, coincidentally while I was on the phone outside.  This time the triangular shape was difficult to see.  The adjacent light was much brighter and appeared to move south towards my self.  As this happened the Triangular shape became more and more difficult to see.  Then impossible to see.  The light moved inward and closed what seemed to be a tear or gap or seem.  There was no triangular object after the light closed. Airforce jets responded this time as well from the same direction. They didnt get nearly as close before the firey light as ceased.

The streak of light started narrow, got slightly wider and brighter in the middle and then narrowed again. It was symetric both vertically and horizontally. The light was a whitish/greening/blueish color, akin to some northern lights displays I have seen.  However, it did not shimmer / wave as northern lights do.  It did however slowly fade and brighten repeatedly.  We both watched it for about 15 minutes before going back to sleep.  The sky had a fairly uniform cloud cover.  Dark spots moved accross the sky slowly, but it was not clear if these were darker clouds, or openings in the clouds exposing dark night (I suspect the latter).  Regardless, the spots passed behind the light causing no change in relative brightness.  We could not judge the distance of the light.  We live in Minneapolis on Seabury Ave., which is directly on the Mississippi River.  The light was about 5 degrees SE of the Prospect Park ""witches hat"" watertower:   (http://www.pperr.org/history/thetower.html).  Checking a map to confirm the vector, I judge the light to have been somewhere along the line running through the intersection of University Ave. / Emerald St. and the centerpoint of the University of Minnesota's School of Agriculture.

I was taking my daily evening walk  in a slight Northeastward direction in the student parking lot of the Southwest campus College  at which I am a professor of ((subject deleted)). It was a clear evening with a nice blue sky. There was a breeze that was blowing out of the west. The only clouds noted where behind me a little above the south-west horizon. The sun was to the rear left of me at about approximately 7:00 of due south at an elevation of approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The northwest and northeast sky in front of and above me was totally devoid of any clouds except for, I noticed one solid white slight puffish at the top and whispy on the bottom appearing as lopsided square shaped STATIONERY white cloud approximately the size of a piece of paper 8x11 held at arms length. It was at approximately 1:00 of due north and approimately 45 to 60 degrees overhead above the horizon. I thought this was very strange the cloud being the only cloud in this sector of the sky and stationery. It did not touch the ground. There were some students walking about the parking lot at that busied going to and leaving classes. None seeming to notice the phenomena and I didn't bother about asking them to note the cloud. I kept watching the cloud for about 5 to 6 minutes and suddenly to my astonishment the cloud began to fade going from a white to a smoky looking brown then total disapperance in less than a minute. It expanded some what in size before disapearing. A few minutes later slightly to the bottom left at slight a distance from where the cloud was a slight glimmer from what looked like a silver BB.  About 30 minutes later a manila colored helicopter with a long rounded fuselage with red and blue stripes maybe on the crew cab, appeared from the east and flew near where the cloud was but lower, then it flew west, then south, then north,  then, east in a circle several times and then flew off southward. First I thought it was a medivac copter that sometimes lands at the hospital located east of campus. Strangely a copter did land there later but it was green and had a shorter fuselage. At approximately  17:50 upon the second circumvention of my walk I noticed further north beyond where the cloud and where the silver shiny looking BB were, against the blue sky, an object appearing as a  silver slim roundish fountain pen held at double arms length was hovering about 45 degrees it apeared above the horizon. This could have been an airliner. There is an airport in that vacinity. Coincidently, in reference to the cloud I observed it seemed to have hovered over where I had read in an earlier report about an observer who said he had seen an object in a field about the size of three football field somewhere around the Palatka Road area here in Louisville. The most outstanding, astonishing and startling obsevation regarding this report though is the sudden diappearance of the cloud completely within a minute. My questions are: has anyone else ever seen an ocurrence such as this and/or is there an explanation for this strange phenmomena that I saw. Then too, every cloud we see may not be JUST an ordinary cloud. Perhaps some type of camouflaging agent for an object or objects???

Please read below.  PD)) Longitude: 116.7 W, Latitude: 36.9 N I'm a commercial pilot for United Airways, Flight 17. I took off from Las Vegas International towards Los Angeles International. I called control, asked clearance for ""sierra-tango-one-seven"" and got a ""runway clearance"" over the radio. Now, because of the Earth's rotational pattern, we move NW then SW towards LA. If we go directly SEE, we'll end up chasing Los Angeles around the globe. So I was heading that way when suddenly I saw 7 arrowheard shaped crafts darting away in aerospace above me. Now, I was a bit interested so I guess I became careless. I diverted off course towards the north, chasing the aircraft. I was able to maintain a speed pretty close to the aircrafts. I was heading when control started radioing, ""United 17, you are diverting off course. Return to navigational trajectory or we will take defensive action."" I didn't respond. What would I have said? Would I say, ""Hold on control. I'm chasing some UFOs""? No. So after control repeated the phrase, I turned off the radio. Now, they said they were going to take defensive action so I'm looking around. I see a base on the ground. I look on the map, and it's Nellis AFB. I see a gleam on the runway and next thing I know, an interceptors flying right in front of me. Now after 9/11, NORAD did some reforms. All commercial pilots were told that if an interceptor drops flares in front of you, it means NORAD ordered it to destroy you unless you contact control within one minute and tell them what you're doing. Now, this interceptor starts dropping flares all over the place. I contacted local Air Traffic Control over the frequencies, 121.5 and 243.0. I said, ""I have an F-16 in front of me. Its side reads india-one-oh-seven. It's trying to take me down. I have visual confirmation of seven UFOs."" Air traffic controller comes back on line and says, ""I copy that, sierra-tango-one-seven. Keep in visual range of UFOs until NORAD can send interceptors. I repeat, stay in visual range. For now, follow the ICAO signals from the interceptor. We will advise interceptor to not attack."" I reply, ""Thank you control."" I'm following and three jets appear. They shoot out after the plane. I go back on the course trajectory. I landed at LAX at 0853. I had an interrogation with generous hosts from FAA. They made sure I'm not a ""spy working for terrorist causes"". Now, I submit this form. Remember that I am a highly trained commercial pilot and I know what I'm writing about. The other witness was my co-pilot. ((NUFORC Note:  We doubt that this is a serious report.

It was of a short length and the object emitting the contrail could not be seen. What made it unusual was that the entire contrail appeared to be moving slowly across the sky and not being left behind and dissapating. I pointed this out to my wife and children and collectively we noticed another 4 contrails of what appeared to be identical lengths spaced out into the distance. The sun was setting in the west at the time but the day was clear and would definitely be considered a daytime event. The closest contrail appeared to totally disappear at least twice but reappeared seconds later. There were some wires crossing the road at the traffic signal and I moved my head up and down to make sure that the ""disappearance"" was not caused by the visual obstruction of the wires. It was not, the contrail totally disappeared and reappeared at least twice though the heading and travelling distance appeared to remain approximately consistent during the disappearance/ reappearance. In general the contrails appeared to be moving in a generally counterclockwise direction to where Kennedy and LaGuardia airport would lie about 50 miles to the west. Three were heading towards us and two were moving toward the north or right of us. I am not qualified to judge the actual distances but the closest contrail was certainly close enough to us that a plane at the front of the contrail should have been easy to see. Yet as hard as we tried we could not see one.

Westbound passenger jets are visible daily, weather permitting, from the Tysons Corner area of Northern Virginia.  This time, while waiting on a street corner (Old Courthouse at Lord Fairfax) for a bus, I observed a jet flying towards the southwest, at an altitude of perhaps 30 degrees above the horizon, being trailed by two apparently spherical objects, one larger than the other, giving what appeared to be a metallic or specular reflection.  The objects maintained a roughly constant distance from the aircraft of a mile or less, following consistently on the port side of the jet (clearly away from the contrail left by the jet).  The jet (and others like it) were leaving contrails, but the spherical objects did not.  As the airplane and the objects passed into the distance, the smaller of the two spheres became less visible, being obscured in the general haze at times, and eventually all three were lost to view.  Other than the haze, the sky was cloudless.  The jet appeared dark in silhouette against the sky, unlike the objects--i.e., the reflection patterns of sunlight were entirely different for the objects from those of the aircraft.  The observation location was -77.22943 long, 38.91296 lat.  While riding the bus home from that point a few weeks later, at nearly the same time of day (about 1615 EST--note that the first observation was in daylight time, though), I again observed the same phenomenon, this time with only one spherical metallic object in view, with the plane and object nearly overhead, rather than lower in the sky and well to the southwest of the location.  The sky had a lot of high broken clouds, and the plane and object disappeared and re-appeared among the clouds more than once.  Because of the angle of observation through the bus window, the phenomenon could be observed for only a couple of minutes this time.  Weather permitting, I have continued to observe west- and southwest-bound jets at this time of day since, but have not seen the phenomenon again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Each of the bright spheres emerged, i.e. faded in, one at a time until all three were easily visible. They appeared to be very different from normal aircraft lights. We know that there are several airfields in the area, but these were not wing or tail lights from any aircraft I know. I can usually recognize those types of lights, since I used to be in the Air Force and had worked in the aerospace defense industry. Shortly after they emerged, they began to fade out in the order they appeared. When they were visible, they seemed to have lined up in a straight line but were not evenly spaced apart. Along with these large bright lights we noticed what seemed to be dozens of smaller white lights flying around in no particular pattern that we could distingush. These lights were much smaller than the three big ones mentioned above but were even more intriguing to us. We noticed that these lights would streak across the sky from east to northwest, south to north, and west to east, some in a straight and level flight pattern, some in a random pattern. We saw some of these fly level and then suddenly shoot upward or downward vertically. I have never seen an aircraft move in this fashion. I know that the g-forces alone from such maneuvers would make it highly unlikely that these aircraft were ours. I could actually see what appeared to be contrails behind some of them at times.

I wasn't scared because I thought that it was too far away.  It blended right in with the sky.  It turned at rather odd and amazing angles.  Then more of these flashing objects moved in.  They looked exactly the same and then I started thinking that this was out of this world.  They started doing manouevers that looked well planned possibly they were all from the same mothership.  Then they left as quickly as they had come towards the moon.

My friend and I had just got coffee and were walking downtown. We had to wait at the busy streetlights to cross, and while we stood around for the light to change, I looked up in the sky and there was a bright, kind of pill shaped object rising out of the horizon to the north (or so?) and it was getting what seemed very close very quickly. I know very well what a regular plane looks like flying at night, and it wasn't like that. There were no individual lights or colours; it seemed more like an ambient orange-red-yell-white strip of colour. At first, I thought it was an illuminated blimp, but it was moving what seemed very quickly and I don't think one could have gone so fast. I yelled to my friend, who also saw and was shocked. For a moment I felt extremely afraid, because I thought it might be a burning aircraft or meteor headed our way. It got to be about the size of an eraser on the end of a pencil, before it stopped and seemed to not move at all for about 10 or 20 seconds. Then, it started moving south (we were facing the east, towards the harbour), much slower than before. It kept moving until it was south and lower in the sky than the moon, about the four o'clock position of the moon. We thought it was immobile again, until we realized that it had moved up a tiny bit, but now was getting very slowly smaller and smaller. My friend yelled something, and I turned to see another one come zooming up exactly where the other had been. It seemed brighter and bigger than the first one, but travelled the exact same path as the former, albeit a bit faster. The colours were also a little more distinguishable - mostly what looked like overlapping orange and yellow white, with bits of red. it moved accross the sky until it was about a thumb's length away from the first one, which now could be mistaken for another star in the sky, were it not for its bright red (almost Mars-like) colour and the fact it was still fading away. Then the second flying thing also began to move up a little, and fade out of site. Soon, the first one had completely vanished, and about two minutes later (we stood and watched the entire thing) the last one too became smaller and smaller and more and more red-coloured, and it also went out like a tiny red star. Really weird. There were plenty of other people downtown that night, so maybe other people saw it too. I have seen lots of different things in the sky but nothing like that - nothing so bright or large.

I was driving home at about 9:30 PM on 22 February 2005, and I was only a minute or two away from being home. I saw in the medium distance, maybe a mile away at most, what looked like two streetlights in the northeast, only higher up in the air. Two amber-ish/off white colored lights. They didn't seem to be moving very fast, and I was trying to keep my eye on them off and on while I was driving. I didn't think much of it, because they could be helicopters or some kind of normal aircraft, so I was just mildly curious. I drove into my driveway and got out of the car and waited to see if I could see the lights again. At this point they were obscured by some taller trees in our neighborhood. Eventually one came over our neighborhood- not directly overhead but nearly- and I got a pretty decent look at it. Let me say first that there was not anything other-worldly about this, it followed the ""rules"" and physics a normal kind of aircraft would, but at the same time it didn't match up with anything I've seen or heard before. It flew at the approximate altitude and speed I would expect a helicopter to fly at, not very fast, but not unusually slow either. In any case, it was not at the altitude of a commercial airliner. The prominent, constant bright light on the craft obscured my vision of the actual shape/texture of the craft, being that it was night. If it had wings, there were no lights on them. On what I interpreted to be the side of the craft, there were small lights with a repeating pattern, very similar to what I've seen before on registered aircraft. I believe one was red, the others might have been white or blue. I don't remember how many of these smaller lights there were. No more than three. I believe the pattern was two-step in that one pattern flashed followed by a slightly different pattern, and then the entire sequence repeated. The entire sequence didn't take longer than two seconds to complete. Again, it was much like the patterns I've seen before.  Now, the only thing that did not cause me to dismiss this as a helicopter was the sound. There was no loud, rotary sound. It sounded very much like the sound of a distant commercial airliner, the kind of low-frequency-air-jet kind of sound, only very subdued. It wasn't nearly as loud as I would expect for an aircraft flying at the altitude of this craft. Hearing this kind of sound with a low-flying, slow-flying craft did not make any sense in my mind. Again, the sound itself was not particularly unusual, but in the context of what I was seeing, it seemed very unusual. The craft progressed toward the southwest, toward our downtown. And the second craft followed in a similar direction about 20-30 seconds later. As far as I could tell, the craft were identical, and they flew at the same altitude and speed. The entire sighting from the time I first saw the two lights in the medium distance to the time they were out of my sight was probably no more than four minutes. Possibly a little less.  To follow-up the sighting I called one of our local TV stations about an hour later, and they had received no calls about odd aircraft. The next day, Wednesday, I called the air traffic controller tower at the Eugene Airport, and the representative there said she was not aware of any government or military aircraft flying over Eugene the night before. My best guess is that these were military craft, but they resembled nothing I have seen in the past.",2005-02-24T00:00:00,44.039544983277594,-123.12515735785954

So, I am reporting this in the hope that someone can give me an explanation for what I saw.  The sky was clear and dark.  I was looking for a comet when I saw three orange lights (approx magnitude 4) traveling at an apparent high rate of speed from north to south, passing about 3 degrees west of the Pleiades.  I believe that their altitude was greater than that of an aircraft on approach to LAX or Burbank.  Even though the sky was dark and clear, the lights did not appear to be true points of light, as the stars did.  I had the impression that they had ?dimension?.  It was as though I was viewing them through a light cloud, but there were no clouds.  One light was distinctly ahead of the other two by at least 2 degrees.  The trailing two appeared to be side-by-side with approximately a ¼ to ½ degree separation.  One of the trailing two then appeared to overtake the other and their separation decreased to near zero.  The one that appeared to overtake the other then went slightly ahead.  They all vanished about 45 degrees above the southern horizon.  There was no sound or trail.  The behavior is consistent with a typical satellite, except that there were three at once and the apparent passing of one by another.

Friend reports seeing a bright object streak across the sky so fast that he initially thought it was a meteor. Then the object suddenly stopped and turned towards his position and moved very slowly. He says the altitude was so low that he could have shot it if he was so inclined. Among the things he noticed are the following: 1. Absolutely no sound. He could hear nothing, but it was definitely close enough where he SHOULD have heard something. 2. It had wing-type structures and a tail. This was not a ""Saucer"" or anything like that, however it seemed to be flying too slow for a fixed-wing plane. 3. There were more lights on this craft than are on commercial/civil aircraft. He reports small lights in a rectangular pattern on the bottom, additional colored lights, and a band of light similar to a fluorescent tube along the side/bottom. 4. His gut feeling was that this was definitely something man made. It had an ""of this Earth"" look to it.  It disappeared behind trees and that was the end of his report.

I arrived home at 18:05 and noticed an unusual amount of air traffic in the night sky. There were five objects moving in different directions.  Three of the objects were clearly aircraft, with each having multiple red and white lights (one or two blinking on each object).  However, a fourth object - a single white, non-blinking light, which appeared twice as bright as the aircraft lights, and was at a higher altitude - moved from west to east in a straight line. (From time to time, it seemed to zig-zag slightly, and this may have been an atmospheric effect, but I did not see this effect when watching the other four objects.)  As the west/east light entered the eastern part of the sky, a fifth object - a smaller, non-blinking white light - moved south to north through the eastern sky in a straight line, on a path and at a speed where it would meet the west/east light. Before this could happen, however, this fifth, south/north light grew very bright (about ten times brighter) and then quickly faded out. The west/east light, after crossing the point where it would have met the south/north light, also faded out. I thought clouds could account for these disappearances, but I immediately checked local and regional radar at Wunderground.com, and the skies were what they appeared to be: ""Clouds: clear. Visibility: 10 miles.""  I also thought that the steady brightness of the west/east and south/north lights could be fuselage reflections of the sun - but sunset was one hour and thirteen minutes earlier, at 16:42.

I have never reported anything like this before.  At 23:30 on 5/27/05 while taking my nightly walk, I observed a triangular craft (craft) traversing the sky from north to south at about 20K feet.  The sky is very clear this night with several miles of clear visibility.  The craft's speed was about 500 knots.  The craft was perfectly silent and moving rapidly.  Several miles behind the craft was what appeared to be a fighter jet moving very rapidly, 600 to 700 knots.   As the jet was chasing the craft they both where flying toward my position.   I could begin to hear the engines of the jet at that time.  It appeared as thought the triangular craft was toying with the jet in that as the jet got closer to the craft, the craft would speed up somewhat and leave the jet behind.   As the craft and jet got nearly directly over my location, the triangular craft made a sharp right hand turn the the west.  The jet was unable to make the turn at the same angle as the craft.  The jet's turn was much more pronounced and made a much wider loop.  Due to that, the jet lost quite a bit of ground on the craft during the turn, yet again as both craft began traverseing in a straight line toward the west-nortwest the craft again appeared to toy with the pursuing jet in the same manner aforementioned.  After a few seconds it appeared that the craft accelerated dramaticaly and left the jet behind.  I observed the jet make one tight loop several miles from my position and then turn off to the north-northeast and flew out of my line of sight.  One thing that was odd about the triangular craft was the three lights making up the trianglar pattern were not equal in distance.  Referencing the wingspan of the jet, two of the lights on the craft were about 50 to 75 feet apart and the third light was approximately 100 to 150 feet from the other two lights.  Additionally, the two lights closer together were at the front and the other further away light was at the rear facing the pursuing jet.  This made the craft to appear to be moving in reverse.  It should be noted, that the color of the triangular craft lights were an unusual milky white color, nothing like that of the very bright red, green and white lights obsereved on the jet.  Tinker Air Force Base, which does have fighters, is located about 25 miles east of my house.   I assure you that this is a true account of what I observed on the stated date and time.

Also, he will contact the FAA ARTCC in Oklahoma City, to inquire whether the controllers on duty Friday night, May 27, might know what the cause of the incident was.  We have to allow for the possibility that the object apparently being pursued by what may have been a military fighter jet may have been an F-22 ""Raptor"" fighter on a test flight, but even that aircraft would have to have displayed conventional red and green marker lights on its wing tips.   The witness will submit an illustration of what the lights on the object looked like to him, as he viewed it from the ground.

It would move then stop then move and stop again then it just disappeared. We looked around in the sky searching for it when we saw another one in more towards the north-eastern sky. It was just like the one before and a plane passes by their (planes going to LAX) and the object stops. Moves around a little and change colors to bright yellow to red to orange.

I don't know how significant this is, but I thought it was worth reporting nonetheless.  I should say that I'm a college student who has studied Astronomy throughout high school and college, so I feel I'm a pretty observant person.  Last Saturday, February 19th, at around 2:35 PM, I was sitting at a traffic light when I just decided to look up at the sky since it was such a gorgeous day, not a cloud in sight whatsoever.  I looked over to my left, which would be looking north, when I noticed an object in the sky at about 45 degrees elevation to my line of sight.  It was greyish in color and cigar-shaped, and was traveling at quite a brisk pace; if I had to estimate the speed in relation to a car on the ground, I would say about 30 miles per hour.  If I had to estimate the size of the object, I would say it was about the diameter of a quarter if held at arm's length.  I would estimate the elevation to be 500 feet above the ground at the most.  If memory serves me right, this would make this a right isosceles triangle, meaning that the distance on the ground between myself and the object was about 500 feet.  I feel this is about right.  The object also seemed to be ""hazy"" - it would best be related to heat fog that one sees when looking down a tarmac road on a hot day.  When I first noticed the object, it was traveling west, parallel to the direction my car was facing at the traffic light.  I was looking out to the north, and my car was facing the east.  I was intrigued by it because it was definitely not a helicopter, because it was flat, and did not have any rotar blades.  I see a lot of helicopters in this area, and even if they are as far away from me as this one was, I can hear noise, but this made no sound.  I got the impression that it was not way far away in the distance, but was close.  After watching it for several seconds, I looked ahead to see if the traffic light had changed, and upon seeing that it was still red, I looked back to where the object was traveling, where it should have been had it continued along the same path, only to find that it was gone.  Just gone.  Surprised, I looked around the sky intently, thinking that it might have changed direction.  I still could not find it, and I never saw it again.  The object was traveling in the middle of the sky when I noticed it, and I only took my gaze away from it for 2 seconds, so I have no idea where it could have gone in that time if it really was just a plane or helicopter.  I spent the next 15 seconds before the traffic light changed looking all over the sky, just in case it had disappeared due to the sun's reflection, but I still could not find it.  I would argue this was possibly a conventional airplane, except I cannot get over the fact of how a conventional aircraft could disappear that fast.  There were no trees it could have disappeared behind, nor any cloud cover.",2005-02-22T00:00:00,39.07793837209302,-77.14956651162791

This evening, six days after my first sighting of some unknown lighted object, I was again out in my porch to see-off some visiting friend. While returning inside I looked up most unsuspectingly just to have a glimpse of the shiny half moon. In front of the moon, the twin stars of Constellation Gemini – Castor and Pollux were shining while a brighter Saturn was beside the pair. At the last moment of my glance, I suddenly viewed something very unusual. I could very, very clearly watch a tiny star-like reddish-brown dot resembling the reddish-orange star ""Pollux."" The dot flew past Saturn and Constellation Gemini that contained ""Pollux"" itself. Now I put a most careful attention towards the particular point of the sky. The tiny dot of reddish light slightly diverted its path and continued moving smoothly, faster than a plane but much slower than any shooting star. The ‘red dot’ reached a nearby region possibly that of Constellation Cancer and apparently vanished. Please note that the red dotted light did not blink or quiver but was a fixed dot of light. Could it be a satellite or some kind of space junk ? Or was it some real UFO ?

I had just come home from work and was unloading my car, making several trips into the house.  I noticed an orange point of light in the North sky close to the horizon.  It was the approximate brightness of aircraft headlights.  At first I didn't pay much attention to it, but as I noticed the light gradually moving in my general direction, the orangeness of the light struck me as being odd, as aircraft have white headlights, red strobe lights, red and green wingtip lights, and white wingtip strobes.  This had none of those lights required by the FAA.  I also started to notice that although this light was moving a bit slower than a satellite, it's speed kept changing.  Just enough to notice.  It would speed up and slow down as it moved from North to South.  As it got closer I kept listening, but never heard any engines or any noise at all.  I also noticed that it began swerving slightly and it's overall direction changed to a Southeasterly direction.  The intensity of the light remained constant.  It got to a point where it was as close to me as it was going to get and was now moving left to right.  It was a mostly clear night, with a few patchy areas of stratus clouds.  A couple of times this object passed behind a cloud and could still see some light through it.  It's altitude was hard to guess, but high enough to be above the low clouds.  At it's closest point, it was about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon.  By this time I had run into to house to retrieve a pair of binoculars to get a better look at this.  I focused in on it, and it was a solid orange point of light.  It left no vapor or smoke trail.  As it moved southeast I suddenly saw a smaller ""piece"" of the orange light fall or get ejected downward from the object.  The odd thing is, the ""piece"" kept the same forward velocity as the parent object as it fell rapidly downward, so it did not lag behind or trail as it fell.  Once it fell, it quickly twinkled out.  Then I saw another piece drop, and then another, in the same exact fashion.  Then the parent object quickly faded out into the blackness of the night sky.  Nothing further was seen. Had this been a satellite or space junk burning up in the atmosphere, any pieces breaking off would stay together and slowly drift apart.  The ""piece"" was moving downward at about the same speed as it was moving forward.  Not sure what to make of this.",2005-02-08T00:00:00,38.46812121212121,-122.19507146464646

Being very familiar with astronomy and also seeing the heavy cloud cover, horizen to horizen, I knew this was interesting. As I watched it more closely I realized that it was wobbling up and down, side to side in small but definate movements. Also noticed it wasnt moving in a direction. It was stationary aside from the wobbling movements. This event lasted for at least two cigarettes, and I smoke 100's, and a few mins longer than that. I estimate 20 mins. or so.

I got up out of bed about 1 a.m. PST and turned on the television in the main room.

I turned to look at the lights.  At first, I thought it was a planet, however the object got bigger.    Then I noticed a reflection like a cross on it with trails of white light.  Then the colors began to change-- Green, red, then a yellowish white.  The shape of the object appeared triangular without the bottom of a triangle.  Like a stealth shape or a boomerang.  The point was up.  Dead silence.  I thought I saw like a smaller red flashing thing move towards the larger object from the south heading north.  The lights flashed for but a few moments.  The object was near due west in the sky.  It seemed to me that it was over Lake Pardee area.  It stayed there for about 20 minutes.  A few counter clockwise moves then it moved several miles farther west.  Same thing again, the object just sat or hanged in one area.  Then I woke my husband up.  It was about 3 a.m. PST.  By the time my husband came out onto the deck the object moved farther west again, repeating the same thing as before - staying over a certain area a few times doing a counter clockwise movement.

Driving home from work, an object was initially sighted approximately 1 mile south of the Surf City stoplight. Since we are in a MOA, I initially dismissed it as a military craft, and thought it might be an osprey  ((Note:  A type of VTOL aircraft.  PD)) since the lighting was unfamiliar and quite peculiar. I stopped along the road and noted that it was silent and in my estimation within 300 feet of the ground. Assuming military origin (however quite puzzeled at the lack of sound and the unfamiliar flashing light pattern), I proceeded home a couple miles southward and as I was unloading groceries noted with suprise that it had appeared over the ocean in front of our home. I immediately retrieved my 4.0 megapixel ditigal camera and took a number of pictures as it moved away. Visually, I noted pulsing very bright red, white, yellow, (green?) and occasionally blue lights. I was unable to discern a readily discernable pattern but got a sense that there was some sort of regularity to the pulsations. It was moving to the northwest at what I would estimate to be approximately 30 to 40 knots. I judged it to be one to two hundred feet across. The vertical dimension was unclear except that it appeared less thatn the horizontal. Within a minute or two, it disappeared behind (below) the island's northern horizon of trees and houses (estimating) approximately 0.5 to 1 mile distant. The most interesting aspect of this sighting was that the recorded images had a characteristic luminous multi-directional, sinous, plasma-like blurred trail which we did not visualize. Also, blue objects appeared and disappeared in what seemed to be random intervals in proximity to the object, at variable distance and position. Low clouds were present and no outline could be discerned. The images speak for themselves.",2005-01-27T00:00:00,,

Within a minute or so, I noticed a flashing ‘star’ above the tree line of North Hill Puyallup.  As I watched it, it flashed red, blue and white, maybe green once in awhile.  It resembled a star except that it was very low in the sky, much lower than airplanes (Sea-Tac International Airport and Auburn Airport are near the vicinity).  I wasn’t sure if it was moving so I braced myself against the side of the window.  It slowly began to move to the right.  I could tell it was by counting the tree tops, after it moved over the 5th tree, it either lowered or else it was moving further away than I thought and began flashing mainly red and white and the white was extremely bright.  I lowered the binoculars and noticed that I could not see it without them.  I decided to scan the skies above the light and seen two airplanes or else they were two of the ’helicopters' or some type of aircraft we’ve been seeing a lot of for a few months.  These usually flash red and green with a white light -like a headlight in the center and the colored lights are one at either side as if on wings, (these crafts are seen every night in this area and they do not make any noise that I can think of - they fly very low at times but one cannot make out a shape. One night two of them were so low that I thought for an instant that they were street lights and when one of them left the area, it was flying below the roof tops of the businesses across the street from my house!) Anyway, the two airplanes were high above the flashing star and seemed to criss-cross, they were both in the flight path (going opposite directions).  This is when I noticed another very bright flashing light closer to me which was just below the flight path and flashing mainly red and white.  It began jerking back and forth quickly for about 4 seconds and then quickly began to move off to the right, past the cell tower across the street from my house heading for Auburn.

I was walking down the street in an Easterly direction looking up at the stars when I saw a white light traverse the sky, approximately  from south to north.  There was no object visible just light, illuminating the cloud cover from behind.  The light moved very fast, in a straight line across the sky in about one second.  If I had not been looking up I would never have seen it.  At first I thought it might have been from a search-light, like auto dealers sometimes use, but the movement was too fast crossing, the sky in one direction only and with no visible beam projected from the ground.  I continued watching the area, and within less than a minute the light appeared again, from the same approximate point in the South following a streight course to the North.

It was just getting dark and the stars were starting to show up, (the brightest ones first of course), were all I could see at this time.  So, right by the star Capella, I believe, in the constellation of Auriga, there was a rather bright light appearing to be the same size and brightness of that star (Capella) traveling in a East, Southest direction, at a fairly slow speed.  At first my thoughts were that it was a Satellite~ and it could have been I guess, however it didn't seem to act like any satellite I've seen before.  First of all, it was for sure not a plane! There were no blinking lights on this object,just a white light, like a star.  Usually satellites disappear quite quickly and sometimes even flash as if in rotation and reflecting light as they rotate, but this light stayed the same intensity the whole time I observed it.  I actually ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars and ran back out and still found it moving in the same general direction without the binocs!  So I followed it with the binoculars for a couple more minutes until it faded and finally disappeared, which was fairly close to the horizon /Cascade Mountains.  It also did seem to speed up and change direction of its course although this was not real apparent, not like rapid changing or sharp angled turns. Just a sort of veering into a more southerly direction and speeding up slightly.  It also didn't seem to be as high as a satellite usually travels.  That is about it, nothing overly exciting but I thought it was worth writing in about.  I'm wondering if anyone else saw it and might of reported it also.  I'd be interested to know if you think it was a satellite. Thanks, DC",2005-01-11T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

At a little after 8 p.m. we were on Route 60 between Lake Wales and Vero Beach, Florida.  We were getting close to a Camp Retreat known as River Ranch. My wife called my attention to a huge lighted object in the sky to her right.  I looked and saw what appeared to be a large formation of equal size light. The lights were steady and not blinking.  It looked like the top of a very wide oil refinary tank with lights mounted around the top edge of the tank. In fact, I thought it might be a very large tower of some sorts, but I ruled that out when I could not see any indication of anything stretching from the formation of lights to the ground, that it was actually a huge object in the night sky.  About that time a brilliant flare-like light burst in the sky closer to us and between us and the lighted object. A second burst or explosion of bright light came out from that first burst. The light bursts resembled huge Roman Candle balls, but were as bright as flares and had no trail of lights or sparks, indicating they had come up from the ground. I drove on watching the formation of lights and finally pulled over to get my binoculars out of the trunk. The huge object was still in the sky and I saw the lights on it through my binoculars and the naked eye, but could not get the binoculars focused into one image.  I never did see any kind of craft, but only the formation of lights which seemed to curve around the edge of something.  It was so huge that it looked to me like about a 10 to 15-story building, with one light cut on on each floor, lying on its side up in the sky.  While I fiddled with the binoculars, the lighted object moved rapidly away from me towards the west or southwest and disappeared over the horizon.  When I stopped to get my binoculars out of the trunk, my wife saw more of the bursts of light -flare-type lights we had seen when we first spotted it. When my wife first called my attention to the big lighted object, there also seemed to be scores of smaller independant lights jumping around the sky in the vicinity of the big object.  A few of these smaller lights had blinking lights and were probably aircraft, but the ""jumping"" smaller lights were puzzling.  There was a full moon out.  I wanted to think this was a lineup of small planes, or helicopters, but there were no blinking lights and the perfect formation of the lights on the big object, that all moved as one, prevented it from being any of these. My wife will separately enter her version of what she saw.

Multiple types of objects in night sky of central Florida witnessed for over 3 hours.,Ocala,FL,2005-01-15T19:30:00,triangle,3.5 hours,"Occurred : 1/15/2005 19:30  (Entered as : 01/15/2005 19:30) Reported: 1/17/2005 8:41:00 PM 20:41 Posted: 1/19/2005 Location: Ocala (N and S of), FL Shape: Triangle Duration:3.5 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41555.html,"Multiple types of objects in night sky of central Florida witnessed for over 3 hours. This could take a while...my sighting started at 7:30pm 1/15/05 and lasted until 11pm as I drove south on hwy. 301 from Jacksonville, FL.  As I drove S on 301 I eventually noticed an object in the sky SW of me far away and hovering.  One small red light on each side - distance was impossible to guess due to darkness and the small size of the lights, but they were maybe 2 finger-widths apart from each other at that time.  In the direct center of them at about 1 second intervals a white light blinked.  Alternately, above each red light (solidly lit at all times) a very small and fast white light would flash after the center white light would flash.  As I drove towards Ocala, FL on 301 this ""hovering"" object neither deviated in altitude nor moved from side to side...also, it never became smaller or dimmer indicating that it was moving farther from me as I drove and I was unable to catch up to it...basically, it became very conspicuous to me due to this because that meant to me that it was going the same speed as me and never varied.  Twice I stopped at gas stations on 301 to get a drink or hit the bathroom.  Each time I basically forgot about the object until I got back into my truck and back onto the highway.  Both times this object was still in the exact location of the sky and neither looking closer or further away from me, yet as I again would drive towards it at 70mph it still seemed to stay exactly the same distance from me no matter what.  By now I'm very much unsure that this could be a plane, helicopter or blimp...the lights just weren't right, plus it's odd way of staying in the same place all that time whether I was moving or not just seemed impossible and very improbable for a typical aircraft.  Then a second one appeared in the sky just down and to the W of the first one...hovering in the same way.  I say appeared because it didn't fly to that position but just appeared or turned it's lights on...same configuration of two solid reds, center white blinker and two blinking whites above the reds.  These two objects stayed this way until I turned W on I think hwy 40 north of Ocala to head to I-75.  then instead of viewing them high up out of my windshield I had to look out my side window and up.  Not long after turning W the object that had appeared second very noticeably began to move W away from the first object, still hovering.  It seemed to be heading SW as it was definitely get smaller in size and much dimmer after a while, but the rate of it's movement was very slow and deliberate in a straight direction and I was able to view it for a very long time even when it was apparent that it was many many miles S of me.  At the I-75 intersection I again stopped at a gas station.  When I came back out 5 minutes later the first object was still hovering and the second though still visible was definitely much farther to the SW but I could still see it's red lights and blinking whites.  As I turned S on I-75 still watching these two objects I finally decided that I needed to tell someone about this because I just didn't believe now that these were typical aircraft.  So I called my girlfriend and described to her everything I'd seen and thought up to that point asking her not to think I was crazy.  I could still easily see the stationary object blinking away, and I could still see the one that had flown SW away from me.  At this point things went absolutely crazy and unbelievable and I kept my girlfriend on the phone as I described every event to her and I was completely shocked to be seeing what I was seeing...the next events happened almost directly over I-75 and also over the fields to either side E and W and all over the sky S of me as I drove S on I-75...and they happened for over an hour straight:  A very large, bright white object appeared in the sky to the SE of me on the E side of I-75...kind of far from the original object...however that object now began to move W and fly directly over I-75 out over the fields...still in some way looking the same size and brightness even though I was traveling at 65 mph towards it the whole time...very wierd.  At first I was thinking the new object was a planet or star...very large and bright white and not moving at all even though I was heading for it, which is was what made it seem like a star.  As I described to my girlfriend the red lighted object flying left to right in front of me, directly over the highway in the darkness straight to my S a very small white object blinked...then blinked again but easily 2 hand widths to the right...not being sure if it was the same object or a second blinking object at that time all of a sudden multiple white blinking objects  (I think maybe from 3 to 6 or so) began blinking all over in a group form right over I-75.  They weren't bright...small star type brightness and flashing very fast then maybe off for a second or so...but there were definitely more than 2 since I could see a group of them moving around flashing and then I guess appearing in other locations in the general area of the sky, so either very fast moving and in quick turns of direction or several of them...it was just hard to tell also due to oncoming headlights and also the intervals of very tall street lights messing w/ my eyes...plus it wasn't easy keeping my eyes on all this as well as the large semi-trucks and other vehicles that I was trying not to swerve into...I was pretty excited at this point and describing it all to my g/f at the same time.  It appeared after a couple minutes that I did travel underneath the location of the fast blinkers and I couldn't see them anymore...during all of this I could now still see the constant hovering large white light plus now three of the red lighted objects moving back and forth to the S and SE and SW of me...moving in different directions very slowly and deliberately and not making any turns.  One of these flew towards the large white light, and around this point my g/f said that I should just pull over but I didn't want to...about 1 minute later I passed a pick up on the shoulder of the hwy. and the driver was standing next to his truck staring up at the sky...it definitely looked like he was witnessing what I was...I just don't see how anyone could have missed the red objects, but the fast blinkers were very elusive unless you were paying attention as I had been.  At this time the large white object began to move from E to W over I-75 (this was after the one red lighted object flew over near it's vicinity).  This really got me excited because now I knew it wasn't a star...it moved slowly and deliberately from left to right over the hwy to over the farm field area that borders the hwy.  At this point that white object most obviously turned due N to parallel the hwy. though off to my W. It then also decreased altitude so rapidly and sped so quickly towards me that the diameter of the light easily doubled in size and intesity...it actually shocked the shit out of me and I started yelling into the phone, I mean it almost looked like it rocketed down and towards me...it was amazing.  At that point I said screw it and hit the shoulder of the hwy and slammed on the breaks.  Unfortunately I stopped next to a small grove of pine trees blocking the view....but...and this is where I began to believe I wasn't seeing normal aircraft...This bright object had slowed down very slowly again...the very bright half moon that was out last night was above the object...the bright white light then dimmed almost off and at that time I could then see three tiny green lights in a slim triangular shape as if I was seeing the bottom of the craft at just a slight angle as if it wasn't quite perfectly horizontal and maybe angeling away from my point of view just enough to see underneath it.  Even better...due to the large bright white light going so dim and the slight illumination of the three green lights at the points of the triangle, I could easily make out the edges of the object connecting the green lights as a triangle...I saw this shape for about 1 second before the white light in the center turned on super bright like a beaming spot light towards me so that all I could see was a large white ball again and it was descending to the ground going behind the tree line I was parked at.  Or else it turned more W away from me making it look as if descending, but it was going lower in the sky either way and through the trees I could see it's bright light very easily.  I'm conviced this was a triangular shaped object just as I've always heard described on TV...I couldn't believe my eyes and was still describing this to my disbelief over the phone.  The wind was hard that night and temps were probably 40 or less, so after this 5 or so minutes of exposure I had to jump back in my truck.  All this time there were still 2 or three red lighted objects either hovering or flying randomly in the sky to the S still.  I saw one tilt itself to a 45 degree angle as it hovered also and then go back horizontally.  I finally got back on the hwy still watching the red objects and about 200 yards down the road the trees ended and everything openned up to a vast farm field...I could still see many objects out there so I pulled over again.  And again the sky went nuts with activity.  At one point I could easily count up to 6 red light objects flying in different directions from N to S and E to W and back again as I looked to the W towards the field.  Some flew at angles directly over me but it was impossible to tell their altitude or size...my hunch though was that they didn't seem much larger than a commuter plane...Cesna sized or something.  The triangle object was somewhat easier to tell it's distance from me at that point when the bright light dimmed allowing me to make out it's edges, and I bet it was not much farther than 1 or 1.5 miles...and since the lights seemed fairly close together I'd guess each side was maybe 40/50 feet or so???  Maybe something like that.  Anyway, back to the field action...  Along w/ all the red light objects directly to the W of me I saw so many fast blinking white lights zooming all over the place in a group...again it was just a crazy show.  They reminded me of when you can see a satellite fly over...that general size of light, like small star sized and the same whitish-blue color.  Only they flashed very quickly and then seemed to re-appear very quickly in another location...hard to guess how many due to their speed and randomness, but they were definitely out there blinking all over.  While all that was going on almost directly above me a red-lighted object appeared right up above me...very bright in color, so it seemed kinda low and larger since the red lights were definitely farther apart on this object...maybe not even a mile up, but I couldn't tell of it's shape like I could the triangle.  I don't know if it just materialized in that location or if it's lights were out and then just turned on, but it just appeared and then started to fly in a straight line to the SE of me...these things were everywhere and some would fly away to the S but then some would fly in from the N and they would criss-cross the hwy.  I can't believe people weren't seeing this, but I just don't know if they would notice it as odd like I did since I'd been watching them for so long by this point.  I think this second stop on the hwy lasted about 20 minutes watching all kinds of activity...I was freezing and shivering almost uncontrolably by then, but refused to get back in my truck for risk of missing even more activity or something more spectacular.  But the fast blinkers seemd to disappear eventually, and the red-light objects decreased down to like 2 and were again hovering to the S of me.  So I got back in my truck and started S again.  I'll tell you that by this point as exciting as it had been it started to get a little boring and even my g/f was ready to get off the phone with me and my descriptions...she just didn't want me to wreck my truck (I almost did several times though).  So I hung up with her.  I eventually didn't see anymore objects in the sky and was getting to around 40 miles or so from Tampa on I-75.  I was still in somewhat of shock or disbelief over all of this and decided to call one of my best friends to tell him all about it...I knew he wouldn't think I was lying or crazy.  As I neared finishing my story of everything that happened one of the red-light objects appeared again very low and just to the SW of me on the freeway...just out of no where and bam there it was, and this was while my friend was still on the phone.  You could tell it was moving slightly to the W and then it began to roll into a 45 degree angle to the right and then it rolled back to horizontal and then to about 45 degrees angle to the left as it slowly flew W away from me.  I was able to watch it fly very low to the W until it disappeared from view.  These things just weren't planes or helicopters...I was able to view them for such a long time that I'm convinced they weren't airplanes, blimps or helicopters.  My main confusion is just that if these were secret government craft then why the hell fly them over a freeway with lights flashing and not in the desert of Nevada.  And if these were alien craft why the hell have all those lights on and be seen???  And also is there anyway to find out if they showed up on radar???  I didn't see any news of this today on the net or TV or radio, so I don't know what to think.  I was even kinda ready to not think they were UFO's up until that freakin' white ball zoomed like it did and then showed itself as a triangle for that second or so...that blew my mind to see a triangle after hearing about them on TV all these years...this was the most bizarre thing I've ever witnessed, and as I searched tonight I found this link and decided to try and write it all down to you.  That's the whole story though...even though so much of it is like burned into my mind and I can still visualize what I saw and the sequence of events I still think I left some out because there was just so much activity going on at once for such a long time.  Sure wish I'd had a video or something.  That's it though.  I'm going to copy what I've written to you and post it on other sites if I find any worthy ones.  Maybe someone else who saw those things last night will stumble across my story and corroborate it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  thank you.
