As I was standing on the porch looking towards the south at the grain elevator across the street, I looked in the sky and seen what I thought was a plane as it moved towards the southeast I lost site or of it, so I walked down the driveway to get a better look.  As I got closer, I knew it couldn't have been a plane of any kind.  It was a ball of light vary bright moving slower than a normal plane would. Very weird, I thought, so I ran in to the house and got the first person I seen which was my sister in law.  I told her what I thought I seen in the sky.  She came out with me and I went to show her the object but it was to late it was gone.  As I looked for it, she spotted it over South above the elevator.  I told her that it couldn't of been the same one I saw at first. It had moved to far to be the same one.  We stood watching the object move slow slowly across the sky.  As we followed it moving Southwest it was gaining elevation until it finally disappeared. She went in the house and got her husband and my wife so they could witness these objects in the sky.  After it was gone we seen 3 more one moving to the east and the other 2 moving southwest in different locations.  They would gain elevation and disappear and reappear in different locations.  The one moving towards the east was flying low and was Just as bright as the others until the brightness went away and turned a red orange color for less than a minute then went back before it disappear also.  It was amazing and weird, at the same time.Â  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness did not indicate a time for the sighting.  PD))",2014-09-05T00:00:00,,

On August 19th of 2014, I was vacationing with three friends in Yellowstone National park.  We decided to hike to Grebe Lake, which was about 3.2 miles from the road.  We took off around sun up (6:00 AM) and drove from Fishing Bridge campground to the trail head at Grebe Lake. We hiked into the lake and arrived around 7:40 AM.  There was fog on the lake and we waited for it to clear and set up our fly rods and equipment.  I took three pictures of the lakes and my friends and we moved into position just to the right of where the trail enters the lake.  I was standing ankle deep in the lake and my friend was standing right next to me.  Our other friends stood together on the other side of the trail entrance, about 100 feet away. I heard a sound that made me think it was an aircraft in the distance coming directly towards me from the direction of the trail.  I turned and looked directly over my head and directly behind me.  The sound increased and passed directly over my head and moved towards the lake center.  I saw two objects moving over my right shoulder and directly across the lake from me.  They moved in a tight formation of one slightly ahead and right of the slower one. They looked identical in shape, size and color.  They moved at the same speed.  They seemed to be the source of the sound I had heard, as the sound changed direction with their passing and the sound diminished and stopped as they disappeared.  The movement was faster than any thing I have ever seen.  They did not change aspect as they moved and seemed to be the same shape and color as they went over. The sound was not an engine sound.  It was not a jet sound.  It reminded me of something large passing through the air, more of a pulsating sound.  It was loud, but nothing like a rocket or jet engine sound. The two objects looked round with a somewhat pointed nose.  There was no contrail, smoke or vapor trail.  The angle in relation to the ground appeared to include an impact with the hills directly behind the lake.  There was no impact sound or bang of any type.  It was very quiet when they disappeared.  There was no ambient noise on this desolate lake.  There was no flash or smoke associated with their disapperance. I began yelling to my three friends and asking if they had seen the objects.  They said they did not see it but did hear it pass over us.  One friend said it sounded like ""incoming artillery fire"" when he was in the military.  As we spoke about it we heard the sound again.  This time not as loud and not directly over our heads.  It seemed to be off to the right of the trail head as you approached the lake. There were at least two separate groups of campers on the lake.  We approached each group as we fished and walked around the lake.  The first group we met was a male and female, couple.  I asked if they had hear anything this morning right after the fog cleared and they said they only heard me yelling.  They asked if I caught a large fish. The second group had approximately four young adults.  When I asked if they heard anything odd, they said ""No, why""?  When I said I saw something strange, the one young man said was there a flash of light and a song?  I didn't respond. A few days before we watched an F-22 conducting a close ground practice for an air show or something in Davenport, Iowa.  These things were much faster moving and made very little sound when compared to the jet. I have been in many small and medium aircraft and helicopters.  I've sky dived from 14,000 feet.  I attended and video taped the Paris Air Show in the early 80's and sold the video's through the magazine ""Aviation News and Space Technology.""  I was a police officer for 32 years before retiring in 2006.  I have never seen anything like this before. Sent from my iPad",2014-09-05T00:00:00,,

On August 20, 2014, at approximately 10:05 PM, in Duxbury MA, I, as well as several others witnessed a strange object glowing a brilliant orange in the sky just above the tree line.  Immediately we thought it to be a planet but after concluding that it was far too bright to be a planet we continued to observe it. After about 30 seconds, remaining in the same location, the light began to dim gradually while retaining its initial color until it was no longer visible, after which it began to immediately glow again, far less bright than before and began to steadily move to the right.  As it moved, the object began to change colors from orange to red and back at about a 1 second interval. It was not the light pattern of a plane as the colors and interval were both incorrect.  The object followed its course until the tree line obscured it from view. After believing the object to be gone, we left the area. After calling the closest airforce base, only to find out it was closed, we returned to the same spot about 30 minutes later.  To our surprise a faint orange light, in the same position as the earlier one, began to glow brighter and followed the initial pattern, this time moving to the left however until it disappeared behind the treeline.  After this, another appeared more to the right, rising very slowly and then began to follow the original pattern to the right until it seemed to dissappear from view.  After this, another appeared in the orginal spot and the pattern was repeated by at least two others.  These lights appeared to hover for a longer duration than earlier.  During this time, I recorded two videos of the events. Another object appeared far to the right and appeared to move towards our location.  After witnessing this, we left. About 15 minutes later, we returned and began to watch the objects from a new location approximately 400 feet from the initial location.  There we witnessed two dim orange lights above the treeline.  One disappeared from view while the other began to glow suddenly, much to our surprise.   Around this time, a police helicopter flew toward the area of the lights.  The objects and the helicopter did not appear to make contact.  After watching the strange lights for about 15 minutes, one began to hover overhead and it appeared to have a cigar shape or at least what appeared to be a tail, although I am not certain of this.  This was odd as the videos recorded earlier revealed that the objects were in the shape of a circle flashing orange and white at a short interval.   The object now flying near us emitted a strange humming sound, too quiet to be a helicopter as we heard a helicopter only a few minutes earlier.  After this we left the area and I did not see the objects again.  The humming sound however occurred throughout the night and was heard by several people throughout different locations in the forest.   Our group split up and I was told by some of the people that were present during the initial encounter that one of the objects later dipped to avoid a plane.  However I am not sure that this happened and do not know the details as I was not present.  This happened at least an hour later.  At least 9 objects were observed that night by at least 7 people.  The majority of these objects appeared in the same location.",2014-09-05T00:00:00,42.049490140845066,-70.69308169014084

So, I am driving in the city of Mesa, Az, on 9:50 am Tuesday, 08/26/2014, it was the first cloudless day we had in last week, being that we are in monsoon season and have had a particularly rainy season this year. I see what at first appears to be a plane at a glance especially being that the area is a fly zone over falcon field and sky harbor.  Then I realize I have never seen anything flying the opposite way ofÂ falcon fields mandated flight path allows.  Another detail that had me for a split second assume it was a commercial or private plane was it looked white, and almost textured, but at this time I was looking up at it and may have been looking at the bottom.  Then I noticed it was barely swerving slightly back and forth.  So slightly that unless you stared at like I did it could appear to be going straight.  This is when I was positive it was worth taking a picture at least. If my phone wasn't on verge of dying, I would have taken a video.  As I got my phone ready to take the picture the object was getting further away quickly even though we were traveling same direction.  When I took the picture I wasn't sure if I would be able to see anything.  And when you look at the picture you almost can't see anything until you zoom in then you can see it quite clearly.  So the time I observed it was about 2 min. approximately, OR the time it takes to travel 2 miles at 40 MPH might be a more accurate way to describe it. I snapped the picture, passed two palm trees, looked back up and the object in sky was gone.  Then I saw a commercial airliner fly by and noticed distinct blinking light on the belly and obvious wing shapes which the object I saw was lacking.   I turned east and by the time I got to my destination 2 miles up the road I observed 2 air force jets both flying straight up with the afterburners on and I remember thinking that they were going much slower than the object they were chasing.   The shape of the craft appeared to be somewhat cigar shape and with the white I was seeing is why it looked at a glance like a jetliner but it quickly looked different in shape but I think this is because of the angle not that it changed in shape and became very obvious to me it was wingless.  Half round in shape.  The best thing I can think of to compare with is a bike helmet which is kind of funny to me because I imagine both the helmet and the ship were built with aerodynamics in mind.",2014-09-05T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

I got up and went into my front yard and continued to watch this light change color and make what looked to be impossible movements in the sky, but traveling now to the east/southeast. The craft appeared to lower up and down a few times, and then go back to the south.  It changed from blue/green to white and then to red before it traveled out of my vision behind a row of trees. I can't be sure if the light or craft changed shape, but it looked as if it did for a second...but overall it seemed to maintain a triangle or teardrop shape throughout the sighting.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

On First November 2014, I was on call duty. I received an emergency call from the Hospital.  My father drove me on bike from home to the Hospital.  After attending the patient, we headed home.  My father was driving the bike and I was sitting behind.  Distance from Hospital to my home is about 8 km.  About 3 km from the Hospital on West of cord road I Observed an unusual sighting. On the cord road, we were driving on the left side, on the right side there was a temple. At about 10.45 pm, I observed a sighting around here.  There were three intense bright golden/amber coloured  lights in the sky.  They were in a triangular formation. They were moving very slowly in a Horizontal plane.  They were very intense oval shaped lights.  I have not seen such light before.  The lights seemed to waiver. My father continued to drive. I told him to stop the vehicle. We stopped before entering the Toll gate Underpass. Underpass is constructed below a major intersection. It connects cord road to Vijayanagar. Underpass is about 250 meters. We stopped before entering the underpass. I took out my phone and started taking pictures. I was still seated on the bike when I recorded. I noticed that the three lights in triangular formation were moving very slowly in a horizontal plane. Suddenly and very rapidly one of the lights shot up into the sky and disappeared. Seconds later the other two lights  also shot up and disappeared one after the other. I have taken pictures of the three lights in triangular formation. Subsequently another light of the same nature appeared. I have taken video of this. A passing by car ,seeing us recording stopped briefly and proceeded again. Another light appeared behind the first Light in the sky. They were also moving slowly in a horizontal plane. Me and my father started driving again. We entered and exited the underpass. After exiting, I noticed that Of the two lights, the first light disappeared. In its position but much nearer, I observed an object. The object was somewhat triangular in shape with blunt edges. It had a dark/black surface. The surface seemed to be uneven/wrinkled. Second light was still visible and had not disappeared. I reached home and narrated the events to my husband. We circulated the images and videos to   some known people on Whatsapp. Nobody has replied. Probably they think its a prank or a hoax or a joke or fire crackers. It cannot be a firecracker as there was no sound or blast noise associated. It was initially moving Horizontally and later abruptly shot up. Fire crackers cant do that. It could not be a plane or a helicopter as it was quite close and no sound was heard. My Husband is a UFO enthusiast. I am a Sceptic. I did not believe in such things. This incident has made me to think in terms of UFO's being a possibility. Also, it has made me realise that others do not believe you when you have witnessed a genuine sighting, much the same way I would disregard UFO videos on you tube which my husband watches. When I first saw the lights, I knew it was unusual. It was intense. I Thought of calling my husband but didn't have time to do the same. I didn't know how to use my phone to capture the photo and video. I had been using a small non Android phone for 10 years till 2-3 days earlier. MY husband bought a smartphone which I have started using since 2-3 days. Somehow I managed to take pictures. I wanted to zoom in and record, but I didn't know how.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,,

Time: dusk in autumn, mid-September, between 8 and 8:30 PM. Location:  Eagan, MN (suburb of Minneapolis/St. Paul) Weather conditions: Cool, around 65 degress F, slight breeze, cloudless sky.  Stars were beginning to appear in the eastern part of the sky. Description of sighting:  Orange in center, darker and hazier near edges, steadily bright but with edges slightly flickering. Would compare the appearance to a candle's flame in the darkness. The light was much, much larger than the lights on the side of a plane as seen from the ground. I am a woman in my late 20s. I regularly walk my dog four times a day, and have lived in this area just over a year, so I am familar with the area and the changes the neighborhood undergoes at various times of day.  A large airport is situated in a nearby city, and I have seen many airplanes, but the object in sky did not resemble an airplane.  I saw it as I walked around the back of my building, which is located next to a small park.  As soon as I saw it, I watched it as I walked for about a minute, and because it was so strange, I ascended a hill in the park to get above the treeline and watched it slowly move southwest for an additional two minutes. My dog was perfectly calm and didn't seem to notice anything different. I had no physical reaction to its presence, other than being a bit surprised, confused, and a little unnerved. At that moment, I could see no planes in the sky and I heard no sounds other than those of nature and the cars driving by. No other people were by me on the path. I was unable to ascertain the actual shape of the craft, seeing only the orange light as a flat circle, so I cannot say if it was spherical or otherwise. I squinted and thought I saw a dim triangular outline around the orange, but when I looked again, it didn't seem to be there. It seemed to be moving slowly directly away from me, only growing slightly smaller in the sky. At this point, I saw the lights of a plane heading toward the airport, and heard the usual airplane noise.  I started down the hill toward home, and had my back to the object for one minute. I turned to see if my lower vantage point blocked it from view, and the craft was now moving in the opposite direction, toward the northeast, and it seemed be moving more quickly. At that point I reached my home and headed inside, so I cannot say what happened after that.  I have looked up pictures of lanterns and hot air balloons at night, and it looks like it could have been either of those. I doubt hot-air balloons would fly so closely to the airport, though.

Alarm was set for 7am but thought Iâd get up and check the weather outside.  It was still dark and the sky was extremely clear, no clouds, and the stars were quite visible.  I decided to go get my camera and take some pictures of the stars since there were so many and visibility was excellent.  I looked up at a group of stars and noticed one of them was moving.  It was a ball of light, silent, and travelling fairly quickly. I thought to myself this is no star or meteorite because of the speed of the object.  Iâve seen meteorites and they fade out pretty fast and travel like a bullet and are gone.  I grabbed my camera and tried to film it with no success. It was pretty high up, maybe 3-5000 feet up.  I watched it for about 90 seconds until it was no longer in sight. Then lo and behold another appeared travelling high up and went by one of those stars that twinkle and appear to change color.  It was also high up (ball of light) and I couldnât focus for a good picture.  At the same moment in a different area in the sky there was an airplane flying with the typical blinking navigational lights and jet engine sound.  The two were completely different. Then my attention was drawn to this apparent star that was very bright and changing color. Even to the naked eye I could see it change color. I had my camera on a tripod and started to shoot video and a few pictures. This object whatever it was bluish in color and went from a ball of light to a hexagon with a slight dark spot in the middle. Do stars change colors and shapes?? I donât know. I thought maybe it was the Earthâs atmosphere and itâs distance from Earth that caused these variations in shape and color. Whatever it was it was fascinating to watch and I videotaped it for about 16 minutes. Unfortunately the balls of light just wouldnât cooperate with my camera. Hereâs an interesting tidbit. I was going through the reports on your site and noticed someone in Surfside Beach, SC reported a red ball of light in the sky on 9/19/14. They said when they zoomed in, it looked like a human brain with shades of gray. Although I couldnât capture this with my camera, when I used my! binoculars to look at this apparent star, it too looked like a brain in the sky. It was really cool looking and when I went out of focus with the binoculars is when it looked like a wired brain in the sky. I thought maybe I was seeing things. Now I know someone else saw a ball of light when zooming in taking on the appearance of a brain. I think I will coin the term UFB,meaning ""unidentified flying brainâ.

I was surprised to see a very bright object below and to the right of the moon, more towards the SSW.  I watched it for several minutes and it appeared completely stationary.  While it did not appear to be a bright star or planet I went back inside and checked the 'Heaven's Above' site and there was nothing seen near the moon.  I went back outside and watched the object again, and over a dozen or more employees and visitors saw the object too.  During this time the object, which had appeared to be stationary, began to move very slowly to the east.  It was still in the sky around 0810 when I went out with two employees to see if we could still see it, which we could, though it was now in the southeast and still visible despite the sun being up.  I took 8 photos with my I-phone and when enlarged on my computer do not show any detail.  The consensus of the people who saw the object was that it was a high altitude balloon. I thought it might be a large balloon, and if so would likely be known to the FAA and tracked by their radar. I called the Eagle County airport and was told that they knew nothing about large balloons in the area, and suggested I call the FAA.  Eventually I talked with a supervisor in the FAA Denver office who said they had no information on any large balloons over Vail at the time.  They suggested I contact your site. There I read about the sightings that occurred around Albuquerque/Santa Fe area on the 13th, and thought it might be the same thing.  I also read the article on the X-Calibur balloon which was interesting and if the balloon operates at 120,000 feet then it would not be a worry for the FAA.  It would be nice to know more about this balloon and if it had been launched as planned, and where it traveled to so far.  Also knowing wind directions over this time.  Fort Sumner is about 140 miles southeast of Albuquerque and the winds often come out of the southwest this time of the year, but then there might not be wind at 120,000 feet. I am a MUFON field investigator, currently inactive, who have had numerous sightings out here, so when I saw this object I thought it might be a UFO.  Eagle County is a very active area and was among the top 100 counties in the U.S. in reported UFO sightings, I think about 95th on the list.  As a MUFON investigator I have done about three dozen investigations in the area, and also have talked with dozens of people who have had good UFO sightings out here that were never officially reported.  We have had some cattle mutilations and reports of orbs over the years.  I have had several dozen good sightings myself, including three where the UFO was within a few hundred feet of me. It's amazing what you might see when you look up a lot.  I have had two good LITS sightings in the last two months, one on 8/14 and the other on 9/2, and will do reports at your sight in a day or two.  Also I will call to see if you have any more info on this X-Calibur balloon.",2014-09-25T00:00:00,39.6411129032258,-106.3277741935484

The light stopped within the view of my window and stopped moving. I would estimate the light to be over the Colfax/Wadsworth area, but it was hard to tell as the I had a very limited frame of reference. In my sleep addled state I thought at first that it was a plane, but then I realIzed how fast it moved into my field of view and that it had stopped.

I then began to think it was a star, but again no other stars were visible due to the light pollution of Denver and it had literally flown into my field of view earlier. I drifted off to sleep at this time for about 10 minutes by my brdside clock and when I looked again the object was still in its same place and not moving. The light looked white and ""flickery"" like a star looks but it's position never moved against any reference points in my window. It never grew larger or smaller either, so I surmise it was hovering. It also had no noise I could discern, nor did it project any light (like a searchlight) it just looked like a star.

Got out of bed and went to the window to see if there was any machinery on the street.  You could describe the sound as being like the idle of an engine but only in terms of rhythm.  This frequency was much lower than any engine.  I could almost feel this hum throughout my body. When I looked out onto the street, there was no activity.  However, there was what appeared to be several aircraft each with multiple lights in the sky.   After watching for a couple of minutes the configuration of the lights changed with the direction of the movement.  So you could assume the multiple white lights were at the front and multiple red lights at the rear.  The rear red lights were in two rows on top of each other which gave the appearance of a straight flat surface at the back of the craft.  The lights themselves looked like running lights (small, singular, but bright).  When the craft appeared sideways you could see much less white at the front and similarly red at the back with large dark gap (lack of any lights) at the sides.   Since it was night and the sky was clear yet dark, I could not discern any solid shape other than what you might think is shape determined by the configuration of the lights.  My window points south towards the lake whose shoreline is only 1 mile away.  Two craft were just west of my position (right) and were off shore heading inland (toward but just west of my house).  They were low on the horizon.  As they passed, I could not see an underside of the craft.   They were moving very slowly, (much slower than any small plane) and made no noise.  The third craft was some distance away to the far south east and much less visible but appeared to be just hovering (stationary).  Feeling awkward about what I had seen, I tried to go back asleep.  But the hum continued.   I could not fall back asleep and the hum seem to grow louder again.  So I got up and went to the window again.  This time, the aircraft were south and east of my house.  Their movement appeared to be along the shoreline, heading north, then south in a zig zag pattern heading from west to east. The distant craft was still stationary off to the south east. When I went to the back window I expected to see the craft continue further inland (north) and west (left) from my position. But I could see nothing.  Seems as though their flight pattern would zag, about where my house was as a distance from the lake, and they would head back south again. I went and got a pair of binoculars.  The configuration of the lights were clearer but I could still not determine the shape of the object.   Again, I felt a little silly with my wife sleeping beside me while I walk about the bedroom peering out of the windows, so I tried to go back asleep again.   The hum continued (never abated), and again got more intense, so I got out of bed again to have a look.  This continued for over 40 minutes.  I know because the hockey game was on (was falling asleep to it) and 2 periods had passed while this was happening.  Also, at one point the tv signal got scrambled for a brief moment which I thought was odd (not unlike everything else that was going on).   The objects continued eastward zigzagging north then south.  As they got more distant, I went back to bed and eventually fell asleep. The closes proximity I would say was practically over my house just to the east at a fairly low altitude 1500â2000 feet, but I could still not see any underside (nor lights).   The size would be that of a single engine 4 seat plane.  They made no noise.",2015-01-16T00:00:00,43.46031845574388,-79.71625894538606

It was moving slowly- appearing to be one big country block off to the northeast of me.  It was low, and that's what caught my attention, and moved very slowly.  Thought it could not be a plane.  Originally thought maybe a heli-copter & either an emergent situation or the sheriff's dept looking for something. ?  It seemed to be staying right in that area (and did for at least two hours) sometimes higher above but often appearing not far above the wooded area.  When it seemed lower, the dogs (many) one big country block over would bark like crazy.  At one point it seemed to be closer or something and moving away from me- and I saw blue lights moving horizontally left to right and back again.  But not like just lit. More like someone skilled at piano, playing one note quickly at a time one aft! er another.  I was in and out, as it was so cold out. Intermittently, would get online searching for anyone that was also seeing something.  I saw object one on and off for 2 hours. Near the end, I went back out and did not initially see it.  When I turned toward straight east I saw a bright ""star"" seeming almost straight east, seeming higher up but pretty much positioned above the State route & moving slightly.  So initially, thought it had moved quite a bit while I was in.   Got my tablet and tried to take video and pic, but was just appearing as a star would.  Was messing with my tablet when I spotted the original one over where I head watched.  Then realizing, there were now two. Then the one I originally saw seemed to be shining a white light in the thick cloudlike atmosphere toward the other and then started moving to the west (quicker but still not fast)and the other moved over and started heading west (trailing slightly behind and more south) and they passed on my! north side- heading west. I no longer could see because of ho! w the ho use is, so ran in and looked out west side. Object 1 headed straight west toward Martel, Caledonia, etc. Object 2 seemed to head more southwest (more west than south but more at an angle)  As they passed and after I no longer saw the white spot light type light or the blue lights I saw when it wasn't nearly as dark, but was as if I saw red lights (not moving or flashing) as they went.   Did anyone else see anything????  I wondered drones or weather balloons, but whatever they were, they were more the size of small aircraft.  They could not have been planes.  & I doubt that two helicopters could hover so very long, or move that smoothly.  I have NEVER believed in the ""alien type"" ufos- but I have no explanation.  Seems like had to be drone type or large technology that I am just not aware of.  It is very rural here. There are residents but very small population.  A lot of wildlife.  Deer, turkeys. etc.  ???

In fact, there were no sounds at all - not even of other vehicles or animals - only silence and us quietly discussing what we thought it was we were seeing.

We took two photographs, one directly after the other (both logged at 10:14 p.m.); the changing shape of the object is evident in them.  It was bright orange in color, yet had a fog like haze around its perimeter.

I was outside at 5:30am MST on January 26th about 50 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ, walking back to my house after closing the ranch gate for my wife after she left for work. I saw a meteor in the sky and as I followed its motion, I noticed a bright flashing object in the north-northwest sky about where the meteor trail ended. The object was about 30 degrees above the horizon, brighter than Jupiter which was high in the night sky at the time.  The object was flashing quite rapidly but inconsistently, in several different colors, which caught my attention. I am quite familiar with the night sky here, as the rural area and terrain provide for great viewing that enables views of the Milky Way on clear moonless nights.  I also follow the planets, and this was not a planet, as it was too far to the north and not on the ecliptic. I assumed that the object was an aircraft or a star, but it did not move like an aircraft, and it was too bright to be a starâ¦ So I watched it for a few minutes. At first, it seemed to be stationary, but soon it moved quite rapidly to my right (further to the north) and then back to where it started.  Then it moved up and down and returned what seemed to be close to its original location.  Between motions, it would return to its original spot and remain motionless for several seconds. Obviously, I was intrigued. I lined up the view of the object with a tree in my line of sight so that I had a fixed reference point, as I know that sometimes a sky object can only appear to move.  I also looked at the pattern formed by several nearby stars.  At this point I confirmed that the object was indeed moving, and moving very fast.  It made several circles and figure 8 patterns, and a couple of dramatic zig zags that were very rapid.  None of the motions appeared to move the object any closer to my location. After a total of about 15 minutes, I got a pair of 10 power binoculars, but I couldnât see any additional details to the shape of the object, but the colors were easier to make out.

I was traveling East to West on Forest Hill Rd between Holden Blvd & Jasper St. Staten Island NY 10314 area.   Out of the driver's left side window, the light caught my eye, as it streaked past my vehicle and I watched it either disappear or burn out while looking through the front windshield, it was also traveling East to West Just over the tree tops.  I was completely sober lol, as I said just driving home from work.   It reminded me of a ""shooting star"" I've seen many meteor showers in August near Lake George growing up.  But this was different it was much closer to the ground fire works height.  But I've never seen this color in fire works.  The tip of it appeared very dark black the body was an extremely bright cobalt blue with a long bright white tail that widened and sprayed out as it streaked across the sky.  No one else was driving on the road at this time.  The night sky was very overcast I could not see any other lights no stars, no moon either.  It happened so fast there was not enough time to take a picture with my phone.   I was listening to ""Coast to Coast"" on the radio and my window was rolled up, so I never heard a thing.   I'm leaning more towards something celestial not ET, but I've never seen those vivid bright colors in the sky before.  I would love to know what I saw.

After hearing all the reports I finally saw it for myself, the much talked about group of red orbs flying across the night sky. At approximately 10:25 pm PST on Saturday, September 27, 2014, I was looking south out the window of my apartment, located in Sherman Oaks, CA, as I usually do listening to late night radio.  My window faces the Hollywood Hills.  I am on the second floor and I can look over the rooftops of the building next to me with an unobstructed view of the night sky. Looking out at the night lights and aerial comings and goings I noticed three red lights pop on in the night sky.  They didnât enter in from one side of the window but rather popped on as if they either just showed up in that location or decided to turn on their lights.  If one was to try to pinpoint the location I would say the lights came on over the San Fernando Valley between Laurel Canyon and Van Nuys Blvd. The lights moved from east to west. The lights were a milky red color glowing color.  Red balls of light as Iâve heard many see through out the United States.  They stayed in a V formation and kept pace with each other with none of them pulling away from or falling behind the others and they all kept the same altitude.  They moved at a brisk pace and there was no sound as one would hear with a helicopter or plane. This lasted for about twenty seconds before it dawned on me what I was seeing.  I moved to a westerly facing window but the tree blocked my view and I did not see them again. Having spent hours looking out this window for many years I know that these were not helicopters as the lights were not those of the numerous helicopters that I have seen at night, nor were they the lights of a low flying place as I could see sky between the red lights. My best guess is that they were about half a mile away from my location and flying maybe 200 to 300 feet off the ground. I have worked in the film industry for over 20 years, mainly in the field of visual effects, and I know of no technological set up that would let one pull this off over a densely populated area and just below the flight paths of Bob Hope and Van Nuys airport.  And to that point, having heard and seen everything from Lear jets to military and commercial aircraft to news and police helicopters I can without a doubt say that what I saw was nothing like anything Iâve seen in the sky.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,34.14653157894737,-118.4467076555024

There is an airport nearby â Pearson International â and many planes fly in this vicinity day and night. I've seen many interesting things above my house in the past few years.  I've seen satellites fly over head; meteors, airplanes and unidentifiable object on occasion. This one was most definitely a UFO.  From where; I have no idea. I was standing in my driveway and looking at the sky â as I often do â and noticed a blurry object I thought might be a star.  As I continued looking; I was certain it was moving in my direction.  I watched for about 30 seconds and ran inside the house to tell my son and get my binoculars. My son joined me outside and I pointed the object out to him.  It was now approaching us and nearing the overhead position.  We both looked at it with the binoculars.  Neither of us could clearly focus on it. Either with the binoculars or naked eyes; the object looked blurry. It was rather dim â no bright lights.  The dim lights were impossible to focus clearly-on.  They were a dull grey colour and changed to a very dark, dim red on occasion.  It looked like there were perhaps 3 to 5 different lights; but they may have been part of a single or several objects clumped together. This object â or tight group of objects â appeared to change shape from circular to triangular with no definite shape at any given time  We watched this for at least 2 minutes with naked eyes and binoculars.  It was moving from the East South East direction to the West, North-West direction initially and turned pretty well due West near the end of when we could still see it.

On this night of November 14th, facing a little southeast, at approx. 7:31 pm, while driving with a sibling, we saw an unidentified flying object.  It was rectangle in shape and was black.  It had 5 lights on the front resembling that of high beams, but were blinking like hazard lights but in an alternating fashion.  There were 2 red lights on the outside and 3 white lights in the middle.  The white lights were the main lights blinking, almost like search lights.   The object flew in an upright position so that when it flew over me I could see its underside which was rectangle shaped as well.   The more extraordinary part about this sighting is that I could also hear the object.  It made a light whooshing sound that was softer than that of a plane and kept the same tone.  It was a calming sound like that of ocean waves and I live nowhere near a large body of water capable of producing such a sound.   It also was lower than any plane I've ever seen before.  The object came rig! ht out of the clouds in front of me as I was driving on a residential road near my home.   Seeing the object prompted me to pull over and get out of my car to witness this immaculate event.   The object literally flew right over me allowing to give such specific details.   After this experience was over I got back in my car and pulled off.  As I got on a nearby highway I was able to see the object once again as it faded off into the clouds once more and was at a higher position in the sky than before when it was right over me.

November 14, 2014, 19h45  https://www.google.com/maps/@29.8587106,-81.2653437,17z   I was walking on the beach of St-Augustine with my wife and dog and I was looking up in the sky for satellites when my eyes caught something that I first thought was a shooting star or a meteorite because it was quite bright and moving fast on a north to south trajectory.    The entire observation lasted between 8 and 10 seconds, the time it took to appear in the north and disappear in the south.  The sky was clear of any cloud.   The object consisted of five lights that were forming a pentagon shape (flat surface).  Each light was the size of a bright star.  The object was moving along a mostly-but-not-quite rectilinear trajectory.  The shape appeared to be âsurfingâ in the air as it was swaying on various axes.  It also appeared as if there was no unifying body between the lights, although the movement contradicted this observation (see below).  It is important to highlight the fact that the movement was the most intriguing characteristic of this observation. The distance was estimated to be anywhere between three to ten miles.  Despite the distance, the object appeared to be extremely large (approx. 3-5 degrees) - the size of one to four football fields perhaps.  It was probably travelling at an altitude of 10K to 30K feet. It could have been bigger and farther too. I immediately tried to point the object to my wife, but the dog started barking at nearby walkers.  I kept pointing and telling her to watch, but she was trying to keep the dog under control.  The object disappeared and I was  frustrated that she hadnât seen anything.  As I tried to describe her what I had just witnessed, she first made fun of me and then suggested commercial planes or jet planes. The fact that the shape was clearly swaying over multiple axis while travelling at a near constant speed implied that some of the lights were accelerating while others were decelerating.  This movement would have been virtually impossible to create if they were not part of the same body.  I cannot think of any human-built object of this size that could travel at such speed and not suffer incredible air pressure.  I also cannot see how a flight formation could produce such perfect movement given the speed differentials that would be involved.",2014-11-21T00:00:00,,

I grabbed my friends arm made sure she saw it too.  (We couldn't come up with anything to explain what we were seeing)  There was a light in the sky, not moving, and hanging off of that light was a large drop of fire (if that makes any sense).  It stretched until it broke free and then fell towards the ground.   Then more fire replaced that fire but this time in much smaller drops that fell quicker and in groups as well as by themselves.  It was so weird.  As I got onto the 125 I was facing the action again for a brief moment and even though I figured it was over I not only saw more fire falling from that light, I also now saw! fire globs dropping off of nothing.  At least I couldn't see the fire attached to any light or any other object.....probably the weirdest and most undeniable strange event I have ever witnessed.   We saw the event up close and for a relatively long time-in other words there is no way I am mistaken about what I saw....no mind playing tricks on me or optical illusions either.

It darts around in the air, stopping and changing direction mid path, it will travel a little to the left then stop and take off to the right.  Sometimes it goes very fast other times it just moves up and down or in a serpentine motion up to the left/right or down to the left/right then stop and do it again. It's far away so it's small and difficult to make out or get a good look but it's a small light that changes colors and even gets brighter, I notice mostly red,white and bluish colors but it changes fast.  It darts around in these motions for around 2 hours gradually getting higher but staying in the same area.  The first time I saw it I had about 5 friends come look just so they could see it and maybe help me figure ! out what exactly it was but what starts so many different directions then stops and goes in a completely different direction in mid air. I never hear any sounds and it's like the lights are moving or flickering, it's not a solid color or light that stays on or blinks like an airplane other helicopter and it sure doesn't travel like one either. It's too small and far away for me to get a video or photo with my phone because I have tried multiple times.  As I said, this is the 3rd time I have sat and watched this thing dance around in the sky like a bug does around a light gradually getting higher and higher.

I got the impression that the light was not very far from the edge of town but it's difficult to say.  It was round or spherical and a medium shade of orange with no other colors apparent.  There appeared to be a slight aura surrounding it. The light seemed to be moving very slowly toward what would be northeast of my position. It hadn't gone very far at all when it suddenly ""blinked out"".  Seconds later a new light of the same description and apparent size ""blinked on"".  The new light was trailing behind the first. In other words, I do not believe it to have been the same light.  The second light, like the first, blinked out after a few seconds.  Now, several more lights of the same description and size appeared in the following seconds, however, they did not all follow the same movement pattern of the first two.  Some moved up, some moved down etc.  There were also instances where two lights would appear together but there never seemed to be more than two illuminated at once.  A few of the lights did make some rather erratic movements as well.  I do not believe they were simply being blown by the wind.  All of the lights blinked out or disappeared within a few seconds of appearing.  The lights did not seem to flicker. I saw nothing dripping from them or being cast off them.  Seven to ten lights would be my best estimate as to how many I saw in total.  The event lasted no more than thirty to fourty-five seconds. I would estimate each light to have been about the size of a small pea at arms length.  The general look and movement of the lights seemed odd to me.  There is no way for me to be sure of course but I didn't get the impression that they could have been airplanes, helicopters, flares or fireworks.

This was at 5:00 pm in a deep blue sky; it looked something like a bright planet, but much too large for that.  As we observed it repeatedly on our climb down we speculated it could possibly be someone in a large paraglider who had been able to catch an updraft to a very high altitude, but it hovered so long in a nearly motionless state that that would have been most unlikely.  Hours later, at a few minutes after 8 pm, we observed it again from our home east of the plaza in Santa Fe.  It had moved a few miles west during that time, and seemed to be directly over the central area of the city.  Our only magnification was a pair of opera glasses.  It appeared to have an inverted tear drop shape, almost like a balloon (spherical but with a small conical projection underneath), but without! a distinct basket, and was very brightly illuminated, as though internally lit with a very powerful light which seemed to have no distinct source--like a brilliant, radiant glow.  My wife states she was taken aback by its âotherworldly"" beauty.  A good description would have been an inverted tear drop shaped light bulb with faint horizontal bands.  Checking back on it at 8:45 pm, it had completely disappeared from the sky.  I was sorry not to have witnessed how it disappeared.

This is just south of the Tappen Zee bridge.   From a standing stop it jumped about two miles in the blink of an eye to the north.  I leaned into the window to get a better look at were it had stopped.  I watched it rotate on its axis then shoot off to the north at high speed.   When it stopped I could see it had three dull white lights in the shape of a triangle.    Since this is such a highly populated area I wondered if anyone else saw this?,2014-12-12T00:00:00,,

Hello Peter. First, let me tell you that I am a big fan of yours and have been following your reports on Coast to Coast for the last several years.  I have always considered you to be an authentic, credible UFO investigator.  In addition to the cases presented in your reports, I have studied several hundred similar cases and I am, therefore, more than a little familiar with the UFO phenomenon.  However, only beginning this week can I say that I know with 100% certainty that highly advanced beings, piloting incredible and terrifying UFOs, are conducting some kind of research in Vermont.  Based on everything I have learned from you, I am also convinced that these beings number in the thousands or tens of thousands globally and that their research is being conducted all over the world on a massive scale. Now about myself.  I am in my mid-thirties and live with my wife in Franklin County, Vermont, on a hill overlooking a small valley of trees and cow pastures, which rests between the towns of Milton, Saint Albans, and Cambridge.  I am a well educated, rational ((deleted--scientific)) laboratory technician.  My mother, who lives in a neighboring county, is a PhD research scientist, whom I would consider to be extremely rational and never prone to hysteria or exaggeration.  My wife is also well educated, and very practical - even stubbornly skeptical - about strange phenomenon and other events which have no bearing on her life. Two years ago, my mother was walking with a friend, who is a radar operator for the Air National Guard.  The path they were walking is very near the downtown area in our largest city, about 25 miles south from my house.  She tells me the sky that evening was dark, except for the many stars which were at that moment unobscured by clouds.  She felt something odd and was compelled to look directly overhead.  She and her friend then saw a very large, black, triangular craft with faint orangish lights, one at each corner of the craft.  She said that the craft was so dark and so quiet as to seem as if it was absorbing light and sound.  They watched as the craft moved slowly from north to south and finally disappeared from view after a few minutes.  Apparently, my mother's friend was at least somewhat familiar with similar objects, but provided no information.  My mother told me about this experience immediately after it happened because our close relationship and mutual respect permit this. This week, I had my own amazing experience, and my wife shared it with me.  On the evening December 4th, 2014, at approximately 9 p.m., I was exercising in our basement and noticed a very bright light which I could see through our basement window.  I ran up our first flight of stairs, opened the front door and stood on the porch.  Before noticing any detail I felt an intense sense of dread.  I looked up toward the sky at a 45 degree angle, directly away from our house, toward Vermont's highest mountain peak.  In the near distance, perhaps a half mile from where I was standing, I saw an extremely bright object, pulsating red and blue lights, bouncing around slightly.  I stood for perhaps 30 seconds or a minute watching this object, feeling transfixed but also very fearful.  I recalled in that moment some of the stories of abductees who were paralyzed prior to their close encounters, and screamed at myself mentally to turn around and go back inside.  I walked quickly inside, locked the door, and ran up the next flight of stairs to our living room, where my wife was sitting and watching television.  I turned off all the lights and then the TV and told her, ""you need to see this.""  I brought her to our picture window, oriented precisely eastward in the direction of the object, and asked, ""WHAT IS THAT?""  She leaned toward the window, squinted her eyes and her mouth dropped open.  At the same moment I noticed another similar bright object to the north, but this object became a secondary consideration to us because it was partially obscured by tree branches near our window and appeared to be farther away and at a higher altitude.  I asked her to stand there and continue to watch the object for unusual flight patterns if it began to change position.  As she did this, I ran to my office to retrieve my Celestron Model #21035 travel telescope. When I returned, I noticed a light on the ground directly below the UFO, in a location that I know to be a patch of cow pasture void of any structures.  I quickly found the UFO in my telescope lens.  What I saw shocked me down to my core.  The object was disc-shaped, bright, colorful, pulsating and bouncing.  The pulsating red and blue lights appeared to come from within the craft, passing out through its walls.  I then found the light on the ground below the craft and saw that it was cylindrical, orangish-yellow and was illuminating a white angular object which sat closer to my house on the grass.  After two or three minutes, I decided that I would not see enough detail in the light and turned the telescope back toward the UFO. When my wife again examined the craft, she asked, ""What is that other thing...in the air, closer to us, in the bottom right corner of the view?""  I looked and saw the corner of another, mostly black and camouflaged object, perhaps two or three hundred yards closer to us.  I watched this object for ten minutes or longer and noticed that it was slowly rocking around and up and down.  On several occasions, I could clearly see that the bright, pulsating disc was casting enough light on the angular craft to illuminate two corners of what appeared to be a triangular black craft. My wife paced around the house, communicating irritation with me for looking at these objects with such interest at first, but eventually, after at least a full hour, parked herself on a chair near me saying, ""I feel weird...I'm scared...I don't like this.""  At some point, I noticed that the light on the ground had vanished.  Then, I noticed that the pulsating disc was calmer - more stationary and less bright.  The red light, especially, was mostly or entirely gone and the craft appeared to settle into a lower-energy state.  The triangular craft remained in the same position for another thirty minutes.  Immediately prior to going to bed, I saw that the disc and triangle had both changed positions.  The disc was now higher, perhaps directly above the triangle, which was now oriented with a single corner pointing downward.  Suddenly, I saw the full form of the triangle, which was hovering with its underside pointing directly at my window.  I saw one faint, circular orange light at each of three corners. The next day, I bumped into a resident who lives on the road directly opposite my house from the previous evening's activity.  This individual informed me that she had seen an object that matched my description of the bright object at 9 p.m. on December 3rd and 4th.  I knew this meant that the object might return soon, and watched from my window throughout the night of December 5th.  Two bright, pulsating objects appeared shortly before midnight, at least one half mile farther from my house than they had been the previous night.  I watched for over an hour as they appeared to follow a grid pattern slightly above the tree tops near a river. A quick scan of the internet reveals that Vermont is currently a hotspot for these phenomena.  Many people have reported similar objects in my area; MANY more have likely seen them and remained silent. I have attached a sketch of the two objects from the night of December 4th.  I would be willing to speak with you by phone, but I must be careful not to allow my name to be associated with my report as it is presented to the public. Thank you for all of your amazing work Peter!",2014-12-12T00:00:00,44.7079,-73.0225

There are no stars in the position we saw this, also.  I checked Vandenberg AFBs launch schedule and nothing was scheduled, also the directions of the launches from us is about 70 degrees to the west, so also quite unlikely.  My best guess is that it was a meteorite/fireball with a trajectory of zero from our position, making it look absolutely motionless, coming, basically, directly at us. Other possibility might be a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit, which had not yet passed the terminator.

My girlfriend and I were on I-10 west.  For several minutes before saying anything (I was reading out loud, oblivious) she kept her eye on a craft she saw over a mountain to the south of us.  This was about five to ten miles east of Deming.  She pointed it out ""this thing isn't moving"". The craft was large, black with a shape we could not define.  Hot air balloon?  Definitely not.  Blimp?  Nope.  Helicopter?  Maybe.  If it was a very, very, very large helicopter remaining stationary for an incredible length of time.  We watched this thing closely.  It was at least two hundred feet above the peak of the mountain but we could not discern how far south (how far away from us) it was.  We were certain, though, that it wasn't moving.  Not up nor down and if it was moving away it was doing so at an amazingly slow pace. We passed the mountain to see that it was avidly quite far from the mountain and closer to the town of Deming.  We exited a few miles up and attempted to head south in the town to get a closer look.  At this point the sun was going down quickly.  It wasn't until then my girlfriend claimed see some light flashing on the craft every so often, something we hadn't witnessed from the craft even though airplanes nearby were lit up for a long time before this. Now it finally appeared to be moving further south of Deming at an extremely slow pace.  We decided to return to I-10 and were able to keep our eyes on it until we drove too far away in the darkness for any further visibility. I will add that at certain points  we were witnessing  what appeared to be two pieces of the craft sort of pulling slightly apart and coming back together.  I rationalized that if it was a large military chopper it could've been shifting position and we were seeing it angle the propellers toward then away from us.  If I'm being totally honest though it looked much stranger than that.  I also felt as though I was seeing an aura or field of sorts around it, but that could simply have been my mind playing tricks with the sky around the craft.

We have a summer house overlooking North bay beach in Ingonish, Nova Scotia.   I was in my sunroom â windows on 3 sides â lights out â reading my Ipad.  I noticed a light in my peripheral vision â at first I thought someone had turned on one of the lights behind me and that it was reflecting off my Ipad.   I looked up at the trees [very tall spruce trees] on my left and saw a bright light coming down and towards my house.  The object  stopped in front of my sunroom window â at this point I was standing and looking at it  and it was hovering directly in front of me for probably what I would think would be a good part of a minute.   It was probably about 15 â 20 feet away from me hovering over my lawn.  The object was an ellipse shaped brightly glowing yellow object â it had something that looked like a red glowing wick shaped filament in the centreâthe closest that I can compare it to would be a candle wick.   The object had 2 triangular propellers or âwingsâ â one on each side â smaller than the main object and with the wider part of the triangle attached to the main object â the triangle tapered off to a point.  I could see the propellers moving â the closest description of the movement would be that of a hummingbird.   I couldnât believe what I was seeing - if I had thought about it, I would have taken a photo with my Ipad.  I ran out of my bedroom and into the living room to tell my daughter and my husband to go outside.  We all rushed out to the deck and as we did so the object turned around and flew at a 60 degree trajectory over the water into the night sky.  We watched it until all we saw was a red dot and then it disappeared.   The next day I looked up drones on the computer â none had the shape that I had seen.  I thought that perhaps this was someoneâs âtoyâ but that wouldnât explain why it hovered in front of my house then took off at a fast speed until it disappeared over the ocean â¦ you would think that someone would want to have their drone toy back.  If this was a toy it would be a very expensive one.  There were people on the beach that night so maybe there is someone else who saw it.  I can provide a drawing.

No one else has come forward but I'm sure that there were other people who would have seen it. Best regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2014-09-05T00:00:00,46.6482,-60.5396

There were bright lights lined up on it from the front to the back, unlike planes that have a bright light and then blinking lights on back wings.

Imagine a firefly's light going from high to low, that's what it was like and it was a combination of yellow/white/orange.   Then the object made what could have been 3-5 sharp drop moves.  The only way to describe it would be to compare it to the game of Plinko on the Price Is Right, you didn't know which way it was going until it got there.  Zigzag is another way to describe the drop; after its short sharp descend, it was to the lower left of the star that didn't move.  From the distance that I was at, it was still far away in the sky.    I remember saying ""if I were 30 miles closer we could get an amazing look at it.""   That's when I got up to get my phone and see if I could photograph it.   I stepped away from the camp site in order to walk into complete darkness, but the distance was too high for my iPhone to capture.  It stayed in place for another 10 minutes, blinking.   Then it made a straight move down.  That's when I knew I was seeing something other than a plane.  The descend lasted less than 10 seconds (5 maybe) it was fast and noticeable.  It dropped all the way down to the horizon and just like that it stopped, and (with me facing East) it made a right turn, now traveling South until it went behind the mounds and woods.",2014-09-05T00:00:00,32.3257,-95.9842

It floated/flew around each of our heads a few minutes while we tried to figure out what it was. I looked up to see if anyone was in the tree above us because I thought somebody was pulling a prank on us.  The leaves had fallen off the tree so the branches were mostly bare. I saw no one in the tree. I am not sure why we all just stood still while the sphere flew/floated around us. I remember being very curious but I didn't try to touch or grab it. It was opaque and a medium to darkish brown.  It made no sound.  There were no lights or markings on it.  There were no windows, either. Eventually, we decided to run and tell my dad and uncle about it.  The sphere stayed with us for a little bit while we ran up the hill to our grandmother's house.

We are both 23 year old females.   We noticed the first craft when we saw an immensely bright yellowish light in the sky, this light seemed to hover, and that light began to dim and started gliding through the sky.  We realized we had never seen an aircraft look quite like this.   When we looked back up at the sky to follow the craft, we began to notice the array of flashing lights.  There were two red flashing lights on the outermost points of the diamond shaped craft.  On one of of these points, there was also a bluish green light that would flash.  The craft had yellowush/white lights at the bottom base of the diamond and a yellowish/white light in the front.   We began noticing how different each crafts lights appeared.  As we continued driving, we began seeing so many of these crafts in the sky.  They were appearing out of nowhere.  One craft hovered over street lights so we could distinctly see the shape of the craft.  It was NOT a plane.   The way these crafts moved were unlike anything we have ever seen.  Hovering and gliding would be the best way to explain the movement.  At this point we pulled over at a remote farm in our town to get out of the car and get a better look.  The crafts continued to appear in all directions of the sky.  We felt like we were in a science fiction move with what we were seeing and experiencing.  It was alarming how quickly they were appearing. Bright yellowish lights would appear and another craft would present itself.   Some of the crafts had red flashing lights on the side points of the diamonds, some had yellowish/white flashing lights.  Each craft had a bluish green light.  The crafts were moving low and slow, and then would cover a huge distance at an untraceable rate in seconds.  One craft appeared larger than the rest we had sign.  It emitted a very large beam of yellowish white light from the front of the craft, and the yellowish white lights on the! bottom were the brightest we had seen.  It was larger than the other crafts we had seen as well.  We were able to see the diamond shape and bottom of the crafts clearly, and as we would watch it travel, it would reach unimaginable distances right in front of our eyes.   As we made it home, the crafts flew over us for the remaining 45 minutes.  One came so low to the ground that we were extremely spooked.  We had never in our lives, seen anything quite like this.  The sound the crafts made were almost the most eerie part of the experience.  At first it was a dull humming, and as it came closer it would get louder.  It emitted a low pitch sound frequency, and you could feel the vibration.  A sound, we have never heard, before last night.  It sent shivers up our spines.   At around 1:00 am on November 3rd, the sightings stopped.  The crafts had disappeared, and the sky returned to normal.    We know what we saw, I never thought this experience would happen to me, but these crafts were UFO's.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,40.3179,-74.5341

It disappeared behind the tree line across the road after a few seconds.  It left a very slight after-image or light trail in its path, which may have been a visual artifact due to it being so bright against such a dark sky.

I stepped outside to take my dog to the bathroom and saw a plane with blinking nav and collision lights about 30deg above the horizon, east of Gallatin Gateway.  I assumed the plane was coming in to land at BZN.  I happened to notice what I thought was a satellite in the same vicinity; at first, I thought it was the ISS as it was big enough.  I kept watching it and dismissed that though as it appeared to be moving much slower than other times when I've seen the ISS and wasn't nearly as bright.  In fact, I saw that what I thought was a satellite was really two lights--almost vertical--and, when my hand is held at arm's length, was about as tall as my thumb and forefinger held about an inch apart. It was interesting; I hadn't ever seen something like that before.  I stood there watching it and it's direction changed, from headed N to headed W.  At first, I still thought it was a satellite: it had no blinking lights, so I just thought it was a satellite in orbit and it's orbit happened to curve right then.  The longer I watched it though, the more I realized that it was being followed by the plane. Its angle in the sky changed; the lights went from appearing to be vertical in the sky to being parallel with the ground.  There were three lights in a triangle shape.  It flew right through the constellation Orion, south of Taurus and the Pleiades, and the plane followed behind.  At arm's length, the plane was about a foot behind the object. The heading of both the object and the plane continued to curve slowly around, from west to SW, and it eventually left the Gallatin Valley with the plane following behind, just off to the side. It struck me as odd; the object had no blinking lights AT ALL.  Normally at night, even at high altitudes, it's obvious to tell if something is plane or a satellite, primarily from the blinking lights.  This object had no blinking lights, no colored lights--other than white, and they weren't the same intensity as the ""chase"" plane. A description of the backgrounds of the observer(s) is useful as well: I have a MS in the quantitative sciences, a BS in Biology, and have been an aviation buff since I was a kid.

I sat there for a few minutes and darkness looking at my view of the Chicago skyline when a bright light caught my eye.   My condominium is the flightpath of O'Hare airport and I've grown use to watching planes fly past my balcony on approach to O'Hare airport.  I am also fairly close to the city's medical district and will occasionally see emergency response helicopters fly by my window as well.  However, I've become very adept at identifying types of planes, their altitudes, and the speed in which they are flying.  As the son of a military and commercial pilot, I've spent more than 45 years around airplanes.   This object was flying far too low and moved more fluidly then any aircraft I've seen as it made an ark across the sky.  Its lights flickered brightly, making and arcing tracer as it dissipated in the same manner as a signal flare.

I got out of my car that was parked in front of the front door of the house and I looked at the sky and I saw 2 bright lights close to each other that look like identical stars.  I was looking at them for about 10 seconds.   I knew I saw this happen to me before I walked fast in my house with snowy boots on to get my Windows phone so I could film it.  I was walking fast back outside 12 seconds later with camera ready to film and I knew they would be both gone.   I reported this before when there was the lunar eclipse a couple months ago.  I am sorta in shock and a little worried knowing that it's back again.  I think it won't be the last time I see it.

It was low enough that I lost sight of it through the trees and buildings and flying slow enough, I thought it could be a helicopter.

On 1/15/2015, at approximately 1311 hrs., while standing in the backyard of my residence in Whittier, California, I happened to look up, and facing to the north and about 11 oâclock, with clear blue sky and no clouds, I began to observe what appeared to be a flock of approximately 20-25 geese traveling due east in a V flying formation from my left to right side at approximately 1,500-2,000 feet in altitude.   As I continued to watch I tried to identify exactly what type of birds I was observing.  While squinting, I was able to make out white wings with black on the tips.   As I continued watching their flight I began to notice several oddities, (1), the flight seemed to be moving at a speed too fast for geese in flight, (2), I also noticed that the wings on all the objects were not moving at all during the entire flight of the formation, (3), there wasn't any noise as they passed directly overhead, (4), I did not observe a head, neck, or tail to the bird/object, but then noticed that the main body of the objects were perfectly round with a silver translucence color such as a balloon.   My next thought was just that, a string of balloons with wings held together by a string.  As I continued to watch the formation it was starting to become obscured by the house roof, so I immediately walked to the front of the house and resumed watching the formation, when at this time the entire formation stopped and âallâ the objects broke from the V-formation and began to do random irregular circular movements in all directions.   At this moment I briskly walked about 15 feet to the front door of the house and yelled to both of my daughters (19 and 16 years old) to come out to see what I was watching.  Upon both daughters stepping outside and standing next to me I pointed out the objects still doing random movements while still in one spot.   While this continued I ran into the garage and grabbed my small binoculars from my roll along tool box and returned to the driveway next to my girls and started viewing this event th! rough them.  About 30-45 seconds later, all the objects stopped their respective random movements and began moving again due east and formed back into a V-formation at their original speed of approximately 125-150 mph.   As all three of us watched them travel eastward, I then observed a private aircraft (Cessna) appear from a northeast direction flying towards us and then began a hard left turn, exposing the full underside profile of the plane which then leveled out and headed directly towards the objects in the V-formation.   As the Cessna approached the main V formation 2-3 of the objects from the right side of the V-formation broke off and began traveling due south with the Cessna, making a corrected turn to the right and pursuing the 2-3 objects which seemed to be a little faster.  About 10-15 seconds went by as we watched the main formation starting to disappear to the east when I tried to relocate the Cessna and the 2-3 objects I then observed the objects make a 90 degree left turn a! nd resume heading due east in the same direction as the main formation with the Cessna also making a steep left turn in pursuit.   Within approximately 15-25 seconds both the plane and objects had blended into the horizon.  In disbelief as to what I had just witnessed I went into the house and sat at the laptop and pulled up a phone number and made two attempts to call Fullerton airport, both calls went to voice mail.   I called Riverside Airport and spoke to the airport manager which showed some interest.  I also called Whittier police dispatcher which had no calls of the sighting. I called ABC news, nothing. I called Whittier Daily news, nothing.  At this time it seems only my girls and I had seen this event to date.   It was at this time I returned to the laptop and began any searches of sightings and came across the Natâl UFO Reporting Center which advised me to follow up with a written report of the incident, as well as my daughters.

From my back porch I immediately observed approximately ten red/orange objects or balls of light hovering in the sky.  The flight path of the objects appeared to be traveling from a Southward to a Northward direction.  The objects did not appear to produce any sound.  I would estimate the objects distance to be approximately five miles from my location.   The Northern most three or four objects of the group of ten objects made a 90-degree turn to the East, with the rest of the group following what appeared to be the exact same flight path.  As the last of the group executed the 90-degree turn, approximately three minutes had passed, I noticed a second group of approximately fourteen to fifteen more objects following what appeared to be the exact same flight path as the first group.

I could not be exact as to the time as I was somewhat excited over the spectacular light show and the precision of the flight path of the group.   Due to the precision of the 90-degree turn, and the absence of engine sounds, I do not believe the objects to have been fixed or rotor winged aircraft.

So we both watched the circular shaped flashing balls pulsing in the sky there were about 5 of them in a Y shaped formation orbiting in the sky it was about 10 minutes.   But I remember 3 mins in I did notice that 2 disappeared from the bottom of the Y. and so there were 3 on top like a V-shape balls lighting up.  It goes on for awhile.   But after ten minutes we left that area and drove off to another location.  I've heard of people seeing this object in the sky before but this is the first time I've caught it with my own eyes.",2015-01-07T00:00:00,33.57603490701001,-112.19439241773964

Here's his description:  A big ball of fire with ropes moving in the wind and hanging down with balls of fire!  First thought was: meteor.  No, maybe a weather balloon on fire and falling?  We live very close to the big intercontinental airport and there were lots of aircraft landing at the time; they are low and you can see the entire plane with blinking lights. I go to the front yard facing south.  I see a glowing red object like it was on fire and in the same flight path as the first object which spouse saw flying north to south.  About 2 to 4 minutes later I saw the third object.   These objects were not the average aircraft like I saw flying to land at the airport.  These objects were not on a path to land like the other aircraft.  The 3 objects all followed the same path and same speed.  These objects were not ordinary but appeared strange.  Pics on my I phone were blurry.  Thought about the Bible stories of the 'chariots of fire'.  No idea what they were.  Anyone else see them?

This object moved through water in such a way that if it were a naval vessel or ocean going craft it would have been moving along its port or starboard beam instead of bow wise through the water. Its gold/white circular lights, which seemed to surround its entire super structure - which seemed to be semi opaque or transparent in nature - seemed to be rotating like a circus's merry go round, while other lights, including a bright red one, a super bright white one, and some extremely brilliant star greenish blue ones as well as a deep dark blue one, appeared to be strung upon 1) a type of mast at the rear right side, and 2) perhaps strung in some kind of lines from that mast like a lighted sailing ships ropes and or lines of Xmas tree lights --3) as well as being/or simply interspersed throughout the entire semi opaque bodies mass of the super structure with the spinning merry go round white gold lights   This object was so large and must have displaced roughly the same amount of water as a mini nuclear powered aircraft carrier - yet when my fiancÃ© left our apartment on the beach on Malibu Road (right beneath PCH and Pepperdine University, by Malibu Canyon/Las Virgenes Road) to go for a ten minute drive, it was nowhere in sight off shore.  Yet when she returned approx. ten minutes later, there it was, looming right off the beach.  It just sat there in the water while we exclaimed and wonder aloud about it and went to fetch binoculars and a telescope and our iPhones to attempt to capture stills and video of it but it was too far and dark to enable a capture-yet it remained there while we scrutinized it for five or so minutes till she said, ""I'm going inside- it's too close.""    Then, as if responding to her fear it moved off so as not to trouble her to the north east somewhat laterally-port side first rather then bow or stem to stern... When we checked back in another five or so minutes, it was nowhere to be seen, yet a rather blurry and opaque fog had indeed moved in approx. where it was doing whatever it was engaged upon, before our scrutiny and my girl's sudden apprehension- and it's my pet conjecture and theory that it simply ""cloaked"" itself to be able to resume its tasks unobserved and uninterrupted, as the sun came up around six am and the entire sighting lasted only about fifteen minutes, or from 5:45 till when we checked back at six after sunrise, and it had disappeared.

I guess NUFORC would be more comfortable with the alleged incident if reports from other witnesses, who must have seen the event, would submit detailed reports.

As I am typing this it is still currently in the sky.  We ran out at earlier in the night to get a better view, but by the time we ran outside it disappeared again.  This object is bright red.  It fades in and fades out.  It starts out as a pin sized red dot in the sky and then it grows big.  We watched it flash so bright it grew 10 times the size from the tiny dot and it gets brighter and more red when it has big flashes.  This is the second night that it has appeared in the sky.  There is no sound and it appears to be hovering.  It comes and goes every so often, but remains in the same exact position in the sky.  We were curious of the location of the flashing fire like object, so we! used my iPhone compass.  From my viewpoint in my bedroom the bright red flashing light that changes color is exactly 0 degrees North on my Compass.  Exactly.  It is very strange.  I have witness multiple orange fireballs by my home in the same area, but they normally rise up in the sky one by one and disappear in the horizon after about a minute.  This object just sits in the horizon flashing bight red, but changes size as well.  It looks like a bright red star on earth.  It disappears for an hour or two then reappears for about 20-30 minutes at a time.  As strange as this may sound.  It seems to know we are looking at it.  I wonder if anyone else has reported this object.  I felt the need to write this post considering its the second night in a row it has been hovering near my home.

Anyway, as was panning around with my phone, I stopped and notice something in the northwest sky that caught my eye.

Thatâs when he said, they arenât starsâ¦they are moving! I shut off the phone and we just stared in amazement as these 2 white lights moved sl! owing through the northern sky.   As they continued to move in a pattern (as if they were surveying  the area) one seemed to slow down and the other got to a place and stopped. The light went dimmer and dimmer (bubbling like) then just vanished. A short time later, the other did the same. There was also no sound during the whole event.

Our Strange sighting   Event Date and Time:  Saturday September 13, 2014, 7:46 p.m. I was visiting with my cousin on my cell phone just outside my front door on Saturday evening (9-13-14) at 7:46 p.m. when I noticed a single cloud up in the Southern sky.  Just off to the left (perhaps the South by South East direction) of the cloud I also noticed what I thought was a helicopter heading directly for our local airport.   We are used to seeing helicopters fly from the direction of Albuquerque to the airport several times a week.   As I looked at this incoming helicopter, I noticed it had a rather large orange-reddish glow to it.  It soon came clear to me that this was not an approaching helicopter, as it was not showing the usual outline of the shape of any aircraft at all.  The incoming light was nothing more than just that, a large, soft, glowing light.  I donât feel real confident speculating the distance that the light was from me or even guessing the size of the object, itâs hard to estimate as I had nothing to compare it with as far as scale is concerned. As I proceeded to complete my phone call with my cousin, I immediately ran into the house to grab my video camera.  With my camera in hand and on my way out of the house, I told my nine-year old daughter to come outside and take a look at what I was witnessing on this nearly cloudless early evening.  I powered up my video camera and began zooming in to get a closer look at the glowing object.  I was unable to zoom in on the object, which made me think that it was probably farther away then I had first thought.  I continued to look above the viewfinder with my naked eye to check for the objectâs presence, it was still there.  After numerous cycles of checking the viewfinder and looking at the object with my naked eye, I was convinced that I was not going to capture the object in my zoomed in video. My daughter continued to ask me what the object was as I just kept the camera rolling with the object in my naked eyeâs view.  My daughter became frightened and decided to go back into the house.  I watched (with video camera rolling and it collecting my verbal frustration of not being able to zoom in on the object) the object growing smaller as if gaining distance between itself and me, the observer.  The object soon grew very small, made an upward climb and was soon out of my eyeâs natural vision. As I collected my thoughts about what I had just witnessed, I thought to myself; âWhat makes this experience different from any other visual of a typical man-made aircraft?â  My conclusion and rationale to my self-imposed questioning of this experience made me think of the following:  If I summed up the time from the moment I first saw the object to the moment that it was seemingly its closest to me and compared it to the time it took for the object to leave the area and vanish, I would say that thereâs no comparison between the two sums.  The object was able to vanish in much, much shorter time than it to took to arrive, plain and simple. My daughter thinks the object was red, I think it was more orange, hence, the orange-reddish description.  I am over fifty years of age, Iâve had a long career in the same occupation in public service, I am well respected in my local community, and I consider myself a very rational, logical, and reasonable human being.  I know what both my daughter and I witnessed this evening and it (the object) was not normal or typical of any man-made aircraft that I have ever seen.

I was 7 years old in 1958, and we slept out in our yard pretty regular in the summer months. Not just my brother and me, but the whole family.  We had a 2 story home on a farm in the country that was built in the late 1800s and while it was big and handsome, it did not have a stitch of insulation in it so it was cold in the winter and hot in the summer. I remember back to one evening in particular, our family was sleeping outside.  Mom, dad, my brother and sister and me.  Another hot summer night in about July or August.   As we lay looking at the billions of stars in the clear dark sky, one star in particular, we thought a shooting star, was coming straight toward us.  It came out of the southeastern sky and flew straight above us in a graceful arch to the middle of our sky.  It stopped and hovered directly above our farm.   It was large in the night sky, about as big as a silver dollar at arms length, looking up through our 5 archer window of evening sky.  It was a round metal looking disk shaped ship, and it hovered above us for a while with blinking white lights around the edges, and then other ships came out of it on 8 points of the compass. These ships were about the size of dimes compared to the mother ship.  All the ships looked as though they were very high in the sky and all looked like shiny metal.  The little ships came straight out and hovered for a few moments then shot across the sky in all 8 directions so fast it was like seeing shooting stars.  All at the same time and all completely across the sky out of sight in seconds. The main ship continued to hover in our sky as we watched and visited about what it might be.  We lived across the bay from McChord Air Force base at the time, so our first thought was it was something from the base.  But that would change when the smaller ships returned around an hour later.  When they did, they came from many directions, but not all at the same time.  These ships traveling as fast as shooting starts would fly halfway across the sky and with out slowing down, would turn ninety degrees and shoot across to the mother ship.  When they returned to the mother ship each hovered next to her for a few moments then disappeared inside.  After what seemed like all of them had returned (we didn't count them when they came back) and after all that returned had entered the mother ship, she started kind of glowing.  Going bright and dim and the lights around the edge started spinning faster and faster.  There was no sound at any time.  Then the ship shot straight up and to a pinpoint and out of site in seconds. Sightings such as these became pretty regular when we slept in our yard and we looked forward to the shows when we'd go out there to sleep.  We decided they were UFOs or flying saucers when they made their unusual moves across the sky, but no one ever said what they were and we never reported them to any one.   I let it go and figured it would be explained in time.  But I am now 63 years old and it has never been explained.  I decided I should get this story told before I am to old to remember it and to old to type it out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We both were in awe of this sighting,the objects shape was a parallelogram that tumbled in its movement from west to due east.  We knew from the shape and movement that this was something really different.  As it moved out of our eyesight a motorcycle was heading towards us (we still were walking west)the motorcycle stopped and the rider asked if we had seen what he also witnessed.  It so happens my friend knew this guy and he was really excited(as were we) he was driving home from 3-11 shift and noticed it. He was heading south and  he stopped on the side of the road to watch it.  When it passed over him it caused his motorcycle to stall out.

Along with myself, my husband and two children have been co-witnesses to the sightings. One of my neighbors was also present during one of the sightings. In October 2010, I moved to Goldendale, Washington.  We had just bought our 5 acre property and were living in a fifth wheel, while developing the property for a home.  Our property is 15 miles outside of town and is in the woods.  We had a small campfire and it was about 8pm at night.   My husband and I were standing outside around the campfire and the children were there as well.  It was a clear and cold October night sky.  My husband and I looked up, and right above the 70ft pine trees about 100 yards away, appeared a bright yellow light about the size of a washing machine and round in shape.  It was noiseless and moving towards us fairly slowly.   As it got above the trees that were right around us, it shot up straight into the sky as fast as you could blink and disappeared.  There was no noise.   We both saw this and the encounter lasted about 10-15 seconds.   My children did not see this one. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It is a popular place for people to park at night and just watch the boats go by  and chat with a coffee or something - so we weren't alone.   We eventually noticed a blue-white changing light scoping up and down the Manasquan inlet parking side.  Briefly it went down the road leading to the parking, closest to the beach and returned scoping up and down the parking.  We didn't think anything of it at first - thought it was a flash light or a laser pointer.   Then we noticed it going into the water near what we call the Dog Island area - near the bridge of Route 35-and saw it emerge with a second sphere.  They were perfectly in alignment with each other while moving - zig zagging even - and then they would go off in different directions scoping the area again and then re-connect (erratic movements and then sometimes in formation).  We were curious about this, as it came OUT of the water.   We got out of the car--and saw several other people who were parked there get out of their car too -- a dozen of us just talking about what was happening over the inlet.  They went again in the direction of Dog Island after scouting both sides of the inlet and then both went underwater -- only to re-emerge with a third sphere, one after the other.  They moved in triangular formations - equally spaced apart - and then would go off in their own directions before reforming again.   By this time, a lot of us were just speechless - all watching in silence.   After say 15 minutes - 20 minutes, they shot off to Dog Island itself.   I was eager to see more of it.  By the time we crossed the bridge to the other side of the inlet, we didn't see anything.  It was the most peculiar thing and seemed to be changing colors between blue and white - although that is all I can remember after so much time.  They didn't seem very big.  Just spheres that were initially thought to be a flashlight projection, or something similar to what could be projected by a laser pointer.   Silent too.  Didn't hear sounds as the lights came out of the water. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2014-11-26T00:00:00,,

I pointed and asked my friend if he saw anything and before he could answer my question I saw a thin blue beam of light shoot out from the white object.  The beam was aimed towards the south.   At the same instant that I saw the blue beam I saw another similar small round white object that was located slightly to the south of the first object take off at a high rate of speed to the south.   The object that shot the blue beam continued on its original path to the south and did not change its original speed.  It eventually moved out of my sight line.   I turned to my friend and asked if he had seen that.  He shook his head yes and looked stunned.  Then he described exactly what I had just seen and we were both amazed.

As the edge of the craft dipped I saw the top of it and it was more of a gray color but the color was not solid it looked like the three circle areas that form the craft were energizing in some way. The size of the craft was about 300 feet or so from one side to the next much much smaller than the one  that was hovering over the brazos center. The craft hovered at this angle âlooking at meâ for maybe 4 seconds then it leveled back out forming the shape of tube and turned back to bright white and crossed over to the right side of grassburr road and hovered above the pasture at a height of about 700 ft. I was super excited by what I was seeing and wanted it to come back closer so I turned on my lights and flashed them and the craft ended up moving up and away heading south west towards south College Station.

There were no sounds as the object passed and no visible landing or navigation type lights.  There were also no other aircraft visible in the area at the time.   As this area is very close to both Detroit Metropolitan Airport and Toledo Express, air traffic is very common place and the sounds of various aircraft extremely familiar.

I am a very practical person, I handle panic situations very well, 26 years old, female, electrician by trade.  So, I am traveling South East on the main freeway/highway between Valleyview, Alberta, towards Fox Creek, Alberta.  I scanned the horizon out of boredom, as it was a nice day compared to the last few, sun is shining so I wear my polarized sunglasses, also typical.  This first part may be of absolutely no connection to the rest of the story, but I am including it just in case. 	I looked at the sky and saw what looked like a small trapped amount of rainbow in a cloud.  I thought it was pretty, or visually appealing, and as I drove I could tell I was seeing slightly less and less of it.  At its clearest definition, it looked like it was caused by the sun shining directly into a funnel-like shape in the cloud, I thought it was probably just some natural phenomena of the sun and color spectrum and shape of the cloud/moisture in it.  Totally explainable but just beyond my understanding or comprehension of science/nature/or physics. 	Suddenly, as I pulled into a straight section of the highway, the colorful cloud disappeared and at a different location in the sky what looks to be about 4 feet upwards from the horizon, at a distance of roughly (going off of odometer distance at the time from Fox Creek 40-60 km, rough estimate I know, sorry).  Anyways, it just appeared at this location ahead of me, with a short white tail much like a comets, but it was too short, it didn't look like any jet stream/tail that I have ever noticed before, and the object appeared to be falling at a rapid speed.  I concluded it must have been a comet, headed somewhat towards my direction and that was why the tail appeared short, must have been due to my perspective/angle to the object.  I had trouble making out the shape of it, but there was definitely some sort of head of the âcomet-like objectâ that had sharp edges that stood out against the tail in the background of it. 	The next second, I look up, it just stopped its rapid descent and sat in the skyline, radiating a very small pink light in the distance ahead of me, about 1 foot up from the horizon from my current position, driving rapidly towards it at 100 km/hour.  I am going back and forth between driving safely (as it's icy winter conditions) and watching this happen on the horizon, and it is easy for me to continue looking at the exact spot in the sky because i am driving in a straight line and there are structures in the distance in which to reference it by.   When I next look up, there is a very short horizontal line appearing to the bottom right of the pink dot in the sky, that was NOT there a moment ago, and in the time span I watch it move (speaking from my driving perspective) what appears about a inch across the sky, then the next second I look up, both the pink dot and short horizontal white dash across the sky have vanished. 	I don't think I'm crazy, I have no history of hallucinating or psychological disorders, or even making up stories, though I do believe in the possibility of other life somewhere in the universe, but I don't believe I was desiring there to be so much that I made it up in my sub-conscious for whatever reason, at first I really was just scared that it was a comet or asteroid, and was actually going to hit the earth, until it stopped, and sat there, glowing pink.  I do a lot of troubleshooting and observation due to my job, so it is easy for me to observe a process without involving any bias or personal feelings into it.  And it was broad day light, I had just been driving for an hour on my way to work, after a good night's rest and a normal breakfast.  I don't know what I saw, but there is no part of what I saw that resembled a plane, jet, or helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time above, to reflect a daytime sighting.

I notice a white light orb fly from left to right into a long thin cloud (the cloud almost looked like a contrail).   I expected it to fly out the other side of the cloud as an airplane would.  But it did not but in fact remained hidden in the cloud for a moment, then exited, but from the opposite direction!  It flew left and out of view for a moment then came back to the right and flew a little higher and was just then hovering above the cloud.   My friend and I and I began taking pictures and video with our phones and we noticed the object is pulsating almost like a giant strobe light in the sky, but a slightly irregular pattern.  A moment later three other white orbs of light appear and are hovering there in place (So there are now four orbs that are just hovering in place above this odd looking cloud) and one of the newly arrived orbs (the one furthest right and lowest in the sky) just all of a sudden lets out a huge flash of light and then those three just disappear as quickly as they came, leaving the original one remaining.  It then slowly flew to the left and out of view again.  This was the end of the sighting which whole thing lasted about ten minutes (I have the last 5 minutes on video).   When I did check the video I was amazed to find that only the first white orb was captured by the phone camera (and only for a few moments otherwise it is apparently cloaked from video recording but not the human eye).  I was also very surprised to discover, on the video footage, much larger grey objects, moving at impossible speeds, that are shape shifting as they zoom across the view.

I then leaned back in my seat to glance up at the sunset's effect on the clouds.  That's when I noticed a white glowing spherical object in the sky.  After a brief check of the road in front of me, I looked back up once again. What I could see from my angle was a bright white hot glowing spherical light, but as it traveled it started to morph from the glowing all white light in to what looked like the shape of a metal or aluminum box that only had three sides.  The left side was a mix of bright white hot orangey colors as if it were fire or maybe reflecting the sunset.  The bottom side was mix of the same colors, bright but warmish.  The top was a mix of light blue to silvery to grey colors that changed as it traveled. I briefly checked the road again and then looked back up and took a few seconds to get a good clear focus on the shape again when I got the feeling it was tracking my speed which was about 45 mph.  As I stayed focused on the sphere I tapped the brake with my foot to shut off the cruise control and it led me for a second or so as I declined in speed but then I noticed I caught up to it again and thats when I saw what looked like antenna protruding out of the 3 sides of the now squarish shaped sphere then it started to slowly increase its speed as I got closer to going under the overpass to go onto the on ramp to go towards Chester county. Once I got on the overpass, it was out of my site.  I guesstimate it was about 2,000. to 2,500. feet up I say this only because of its size.  But as I think about it now it could have been higher. I now have a broadcast quality video camera in my glove compartment just incase.

He was about an hour ways from where I am.  He tells me he sees an orange line in the sky, he tells me to go outside and look so I do so.  I look around for a couple seconds and I notice it.  The thin, distinct orange line was located slightly above the sun's horizon (the sun was setting at the time).  The line started moving to the right for around a minute, then just stayed in place.  At this point I realize that what I'm looking at is not a jet, the line stayed the same size and remained very thin.   Then, after the line sitting in place for around 10 seconds, another line from the same line started moving to the left.  So, you have the same line remaining in the same spot, and then another line moving to the left away from that line.   Now, the two lines were apart.  At a bit of a faster speed then they were separating, the two lines start getting closer and closer together and now they are combined into one line again.   At this point, I run inside to get my mother and we get outside and its still there in the sky, in the same spot.  A couple seconds later, it slowly fades away.  The line/lines are gone now.  When they faded away, I also saw sort of like a magnetic force shot up through the sky.  Thank you for reading my report.",2014-12-22T00:00:00,48.6167,-80.9333

Suddenly, my attention was drawn to a triangular formation of three dark objects slowly approaching from a valley in the distance.  Taking somewhere between 5-10 minutes to approach my location.  As they did, two of the objects moved away to the east, the third coming to a halt almost directly in front of where I had now relocated myself on the verandah. Hurriedly, I obtained my camera and proceeded to note further details through the telephoto lens.  In the clear blue sky the black craft had three distinct ""bumps"" on the upper surface, and though apparently stationary, was clearly rotating.  Not only was I awestruck , but also scared, though not quite sure why.  At this point the UFO appeared to be the size of a dollar coin (Loony) held at arm's length.  At no time during the lengthy observation did the craft reflect light from the brilliant sunshine.  It was later assumed that as the object was visually at the at half height as the distant snowline, then its altitude could have been around 2000 feet.  No accompanying sound was heard. Suddenly realizing additional witnesses were close by, I called out to them.  This group watched the craft through binoculars.  It wasn't until the object began to move away to the west did I realize that I hadn't taken any photos!  This I very quickly did, being unaware that all three UFOs were within the view finder. The total observation of this sighting was approximately 45 minutes, this was established through later questioning of broadcast program times.  A local weather check determined that the local wind speed was 8 km/ in this event a picture was taken and went national news on TV. My mother was on a visit.  We went up the gondola to Grouse Mountain. I was telling her the story of what I had seen.  The person operating the gondola interrupted my conversation.  And he had said that he had seen the same three craft pass within feet of the cable wire holding the gondola up.  He was so frightened he said that he ducked down thinking these craft we're going to hit the wire. Eighteen year old M and friend W were returning from shopping at Metro Town in Burnaby at 3 PM, April 5th, 1995, when they spotted what appeared to be the same three black UFOs in the sky ahead, holding a vertical formation.  The objects hovered, appearing to rotate from right to left.  No noise was detected during the 5-7 minutes observation period.  Visually, they were smaller than a dime held at arm's length. As they continued to walk slowly back home, still facing north, the craft slowly moved upwards into the fairly low cloud cover and subsequently out of sight. In this event, no pictures were taken.   Further investigation revealed that the immediate area contains a small lake and a nearby cemetery.",2015-01-09T00:00:00,49.24709033771107,-122.97921566604128

I do not recall the exact date on which this incident occurred, except that it was during the autumn-winter season of 2007. At approximately three o'clock in the morning, I was playing a video game, and decided to get up and get a glass of water.  When I went to the kitchen and started filling my glass, a very bright blue light came through every window in my house.  It was so bright, I thought it was a spotlight.   I went to the window on my backdoor to look outside and I saw something that I initially thought was a helicopter.  I couldn't make out a shape but I saw two red and blue spinning lights, such as that seen on a vintage ambulance/police car.  For whatever reason, this strengthened my suspicion that it was some sort of helicopter, which is unusual for Haskell, so I stepped outside to see what was going on. I stepped out of in to the backyard. I looked up at the sky and it became very obvious to me at that point that this object was not a helicopter.  It was a giant triangular craft around the size of a football field with a massive circular light in the middle, and three smaller (yet still huge) lights on each of its corners.  In between these lights, and scattered all around the bottom of the craft, were hundreds of thousands if not millions of little ""stars"" and ""bars"" of golden light.  They seemed to glow like the embers of burning wood.  I recall seeing golden bars arranged in patterns along the edges of the craft. There appeared to be squareish ""windows"" on the craft when viewed laterally, but I did not get a very good look at this because it was so low to the ground.  I remember thinking that it appeared to be only slightly higher than the treeline, which would have placed it maybe 50 feet in the air. It hovered over me relatively slowly for what felt like about one minute.  It toally obscured the night sky and the moon, and I felt warmth coming off from the bottom of this thing.  I remember this very well because it was a cool night and this impressed me.  The light which was shone from the four big bright lights resembled that emitted by the old incandescent light bulbs of days gone by, which I found beautiful.  The object was so beautiful and impressive that I felt the desire to jump in to it, but alas I cannot jump that high.  At no time did I feel any fear or anything except amazement and curiosity, and a hot urge to join in on the ""party"" that was passing above me.  It was like a big nightclub hovering in the sky. As the object came over my house it stopped and a red laser beam shot out from the front of it.  It then tilted and turned slightly, and the big light in the middle began to glow a bright red. It pulsated.  The rate of the pulsing started off slow and then began increase by stages.  It was then that the most spectacular highlight of this event occurred.  The craft shot off in to the horizon at a speed far beyond supersonic.  It was almost as if it vanished, it was moving so quickly.  Still yet there were no sounds, no sonic boom, nothing.  It was a joy and a privilege to watch an object that large accelerate so quickly. Despite the fact that it was no longer recognizable in the night sky,  I swear to this day that I could still see it far out there in the sky.  It appeared to be a stationary star several miles away. After it shot off, I went inside and turned on the news to see if this was happening all over the world, and it obviously wasn't.  However, I vividly remember that a few days after this took place I was watching Larry King Live and he was talking about UFOs in Texas. I don't claim to know exactly what it was that I saw but I'm absolutely certain it was not a known military aircraft.  I was pretty confident it was extraterrestrial in origin the moment I got a good look at it.  I still believe to this day that it has extraterrestrial origins.  I hope one day we will learn more about these things because I believe every human being alive should feel the happiness that I did when I caught a glimpse of it.

Some made triangle formations Around 5:30pm on 12/23/14, my fiance and I were heading back from our daughter's appointment.  We were at the intersection of Hwy 100 and Oklahoma heading East when we noticed 2 orange/amber looking lights in the sky directly in front of us.  One was higher than the other.   We pulled over to the side of the road a few blocks up since they seemed to be right over us at this spot.  The lights were coming from the SW and were heading NE.  They came by the pairs with one usually slightly higher than the other and they all (the pairs) seemed to be equidistant from each other  When directly over us they were a really intense orange/amber color and extraordinarily bright and they all had an aura of color over them that was either white, red or very light baby blue.  At random, some lights would flicker out and then sometimes went back on.   They moved at a steady pace and some even stopped and hovered fora short time before continuing on.  We observed some of them get into a triangle formation, and then moved together at the same speed so as to retain the triangle it had made.  I briefly captured the formation on my phone.   I believe these objects were capable of great speeds due to the fact we were able to see these intense orange fiery orbs go from a massive light to just a point in the sky like a star.  Then as the second the last pair flew over us, one of the lights blacked out (my fiance observed this).   My fiance said he still saw the object moving despite the fact it went out.  After a few moments I saw it too.  It was easy to see it because it had been raining so there was a lot of overcast.  What I saw was a solid black circle silhouetted against the sky.  We watched it until it eventually it disappeared behind the trees in front of us.  The lights either faded away or they either blinked and went out. At first we thought these were helicopter but there wasn't any headlights or anything which was odd since it was dark and overcast out.  I don't think they were flares or anything because they were sometimes stationary, and we were able to observe the shape of the object.  There was no sound except for the cars behind us. We both were able to obtain footage on our phones",2015-01-09T00:00:00,,

At first my boyfriend thought they were flares but then we noticed they weren't moving AT ALL.   At midnight, the fireworks went off and we lost sight.  When I found them again during a break, the point of the triangle was on top instead of bottom, but the whole formation was in the same vicinity as before.

Possible UFO Sighting, Tuesday, November 4, 2014 Locust Grove, Georgia, 30248 05:45 P.M. (17:45 hours)  The below sighting lasted roughly 30 seconds. Driving northbound on Georgia State Route 42, Locust Grove â McDonough, I observed what at first appeared to be a large commercial aircraft flying southbound, in my line of sight, above and to the right â due northeast â within the vantage point of my vehicleâs windshield, and (though I cannot confirm), it appeared to be traveling towards me, due south, some ten to fifteen or so miles in the distance, but bright enough for me to take notice. Though I was busy concentrating on the road, this apparition of light commanded my attention. I thought it odd that a commercial airliner was traveling due south over Henry County, as this flight path and direction is rather unusual for the local airspace (most commercial jets descend through Henry County on their approach into Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson Airport, either from the south, east, and occasionally, the west, but rarely from the north; Henry County is located south of the airport). I assumed it was a commercial jet because of the pattern of lights â three concentric circles of white light, indicative to me of the two lights that appear on both wings of an airliner, and the center light that appears beneath the nose of an airliner. However, there were no other visible lights, red or green, colors that are clear markings of the wing tips of commercial airliners. I merely concluded that perhaps it was a jet that had taken off from Atlantaâs airport, and was traveling ! due south, though there was no visible or recognizable movement. However, in just under 30 seconds or so later, the lights simply vanished. The sun was setting at this point to my left, but it was still considerably bright enough to have noticed if this craft made any turn, the sunlight allowing for the possibility of identifying the shape or color of this craft; but no, all I had seen were lights, with no apparent movement, hovering in the distance, and in under a minute, they were gone. It was akin to the lights atop a water or radio tower, such lights that brighten, then fade, brighten, then fade; these lights definitely were bright, and definitely faded, but did not brighten again. It did not move or maneuver to another location in the horizon. The lights simply went out. I have never observed this kind of phenomenon before.  Thank you for considering this eyewitness account as evidence of a possible UFO sighting.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,33.3448,-84.1155

We all kind of fixated on this one light though that my wife thought was a plane because you could see it blinking, but I thought was something else (honestly, I thought it was a star) because I was able to lock in on it through the telescope.  I said that if it were a plane, then I wouldnât be able to hold it in the telescope long enough that we could all take a look at it. We started watching it at about 2012 as it started to do some pretty weird things.  First it would blink like crazy (white, red, and blue), then it would just sort of twinkle a little.  Then it started swinging left and right, just sort of rocking back and forth.  It also started bouncing up and down in the sky and doing loops (moving in a circle) in front of us.  I saw three planes in the sky around this odd light that were able to move along like I had seen most planes do, but this thing was still in more or less the same place it had been at when we first saw it after almost half an hour.

We ran into my neighbor, who we showed the light in the sky to, and he said, âThatâs cool.â And then went to get his wife to show her too.  Thatâs when I came inside and started talking about maybe calling the local police or something.  My wife was outside still, but when she came in she asked if I was serious, told me that she had seen the light go out and come back on again, and then looked up a way to report a U.F.O.

It was twilight but still very light out. 2.  What made you first notice the object? - I don't know, I just looked up into the sky and saw the 1st one of the ""balloon-like"" clusters. 3.  What did you think the object was when you first noticed it? - The objects looked like balloon clusters at first, descending down from the many wisps of clouds high overhead. Then it became apparent that instead they were some ""balloon-like"" cluster UFOs that we'd studied about before. 4.  Describe the object and its actions and motions in detail. - These were the infamous ""balloon-like"" clusters, as well as some single spheres that seemed to slowly move in paths. The 1st group had 3 separate sphere clusters, the 2nd group had 2 separate sphere clusters. Some groups had a red sphere within a cluster of apparently white spheres. We've seen many photos, videos and have read about these ""balloon-like"" clusters before this event today. They would move along on slowly and then seem to stay in the same area for awhile at times.  5. Describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. - We had no strange feelings, just excitement. We've had different types of encounters numerous times, but have never witnessed these ""balloon-like"" clusters in person. We've also never gotten any photos or video of any other incidents before this.  6. How did you lose sight of the object? - We never really lost sight of the objects except when they eventually would rise above and beyond certain wisps of high clouds after awhile.

My father and I are typically looking up when we can for satellites, aircraft or celestial bodies.  My father was discussing flashing satellites and he spotted a strobe and pointed it out.  I'm a bit of an aviation enthusiast and this did not fit into anything I could readily explain.  It was a strobe, but interval was just over slower.  I would say approaching 3 to 4 seconds.  A single xenon-like strobe (blu-ish) was all that was visible to us. My father and I both thought weather/observation balloon as it was coming from the North heading SSE.  Twelve to fifteen seconds after initial observation was when the path deviated.  It appeared to head to the East.  It turned out that this was a loop to the East and after approximately 360 degrees it slowed to near stationary for 3 or 4 flashes of the strobe and either started a slow descent or heading East again when we lost it.  My father went for his binoculars! at this time and I walked to the North along the road to a more open spot from atop a hill.  Neither my father or mother nor I saw it after that, though I spotted a faint orange meteorite (assumed) dispersing in the North.  I asked my parents if they were messing with me as they'd recently been in contact with a commercial pilot friend of mine who was into RC aircraft as I am.  They said no.  I thought it moved as if it could have been a radio-controlled quad-copter, but heard no motor whine at all.  If it were at a much higher altitude, I cannot fathom a civilian RC aircraft that had that rate of speed.  I don't know that a weather/observation balloon would make a loop as this did unless there is some wind phenomenon I'm unaware of (which is possible.)  The last explanation I could think of was perhaps a night-skydiver wearing a strobe.  It would explain the loop and apparent stationary position afterward, but the strobe did not increase in intensity I would expect with the descent that would occur.  Also, the local municipal airport does not have skydiving and I saw no GA aircraft headed back to the airport or in sight at all.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,43.41729139072848,-88.17783245033114

I had turned off the TV at 9:00, and before showering, decided to look out at the night sky.  I noted a particularly bright star in the n/e section of the sky above the harbor and the Strait of Georgia.  As I looked at it, it began to change color.  I assumed it to be caused by atmospheric conditions.   Then I saw red and green lights flash, and I assumed it was an airplane probably about to turn about to head toward Vancouver Intl. airport.  But then I also saw blue and yellow moving lights.   At that I thought it might be a UFO.  So I went to get binoculars and said to my partner, âI think I see a UFO in the skyâ.  My partner said, âItâs probably a star.â  Then with the binocular I saw a small circle of flashing lights.  Again my partner said, âAh, just a starâ, as I continued watching.   The lights began moving quickly, and the source was moving about as well; it was obviously not an airplane or a star.  I noticed another possible same thing lower in the sky on the left, and 3 other ! possible shapes in a kind of triangular shape in the lower right side which my partner confirmed.  My main focus though was on the first object (?) that I saw.  Then the object grew in size, or appeared to, probably moving closer.   Then I called my partner to come and see, with binoculars.  Before he got there, the object suddenly became ovoid in shape and I realized that it was heading toward me.  Suddenly it stopped, and âflippedâ, apparently on its side, showing the full surface of what was probably the top side. I yelled at my partner to hurry up.  The side or top was almost perfectly circular but the top edge was slightly flattened, and the lights appeared to be on the outer edges.  However, the flashing moved across the surface in different ways, as in forming patterns.  The surface was covered with an irregular grid.  Visually, my partner and I both watching, the object now almost completely filled the visual field of our binoculars, which meant â we assumed- that it had come! much closer to us than originally.  After several minutes of w! atching the flashing lights moving about the surface, the object appeared to be moving backwards in a straight line to where it was before.  But it then began moving about in a display of aerial acrobatics and movements that nothing we know of could make in the air.  The movements were up/down, side to side, twirls, spirals, fast threads up or down or sideways or just about all over the place. Gradually, though, it settled back down and seemed to climb higher in the sky and become smaller to the sight.   We then noticed the other lights below and on the sides had disappeared.  There was some thin cloud moving about in the atmosphere, but it was otherwise quite clear during the time we were watching this wonderful aerial show.  However, the âclose upâ was quite unsettling, especially in its implications as to size, etc. and in regard to the possible meaning of this sighting.  It appeared to us that it might somehow have known we were watching it!  Not that we can prove that, however, but when it flipped on its side for the full view, the hair on my neck stood up!   As a professional social scientist, I am a relatively trained observer, and somewhat used to seeing anomalous phenomena. Nonetheless this was an amazing event.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,49.181053980099506,-123.99673656716418

At first I thought it was a helicopter. But the object moved so fast. It dove down and right back up and swirled around, way too fast and too bright to be a helicopter. It was not a plane either. I knew that from the start. It did not have the right shape or fly like one. As I turned on to Hodges blvd I continued to watch this light rise and fall in the sky. It would go way up in the air maybe 100 or 1000 feet and then fall right back down fast and zoom back up.  When I made it to my home my family got in the car with me and we drove toward beach blvd to try to find what it was. As we turned onto Hodges again we saw the ball of light zooming around.  It flew over the Windsor realty office and when we got in the turn lane to get closer it flew above our vehicle, about 10 feet above us. And then we pulled into Cape House and it zoomed away from us.

I purposely chose this stand to be down wind of deer traveling the draw. I saw a small object come down about 4 feet in front of me.  At first I glanced at it and thought it was a spider or some insect.  I stared at this object for a few seconds and realized it was not an insect.  This object was a round ball slightly smaller than a marble with a brownish iridescent color, like motor oil. This ball hovered in front of me at eye level, about 4 feet directly in front of me.  It was moving up and down and side to side about 6 inches as if it was trying to stay stable in the breeze blowing in my face, but not getting closer to me. I instantly grabbed the seat of my deer stand with my left hand, to keep from falling, and reached out with my right hand to grab the ball.  The ball dropped to about level with my feet staying about 4 feet out and began hovering again. I sat down and the ball rose to above eye level about a foot.  The ball slowly went up and down in front of me and began hovering at eye level again.  I grabbed my seat again and before I could reach, it dropped at a curving angle away from me into the wind.  I lost sight of the ball as it blended in with the leafy ground of the draw. I could not understand what I had just saw and I tried to explain it away in my mind.  I relized the wind was blowing towards me and it stayed the same distance away from me the entire time, about 20 seconds. I am used to seeing spiders, moths etc. while hunting but it was 25 degrees and had been below freezing for several days.  You do not see insects in this weather at all. This ball had no wings, legs or propellers and it was not natural like a piece of leaf or stick. It just looked like a ball of shiny motor oil hovering without gravity. I did not see this out of the corner of my eye, I looked at it clearly and close the entire time.  I was very concerned and still am.  This troubles me as I can not think of a logical explanation for this. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  He served as a public employee, in a very responsible position, for approximately two decades.  PD))",2014-11-21T00:00:00,40.8599,-90.2018

Close Encounters in Joplin Area:  Part Two By Sam Uptegrove 	I need to begin this weekâs column with an apology.  Due to a typo on my part in preparing notes for my files, I mistakenly indicated two weeks ago [Close Encounters in Joplin Area: Part One] that an encounter in Joplin took place in early August when it actually occurred on July 8.  The full report is the subject of this column. Then, it was so hectic when I was writing the column last week that I completely forgot to give credit to NUFORC, the source of all but one of the sightings described.  (Sorry, Peter. Oh well, they say as you get older your memory is the second thing to go, but for the life of me I cannot remember what the first one is.)   That being said, the incident that occurred that Tuesday evening was a ufologistâs dream; three reputable witnesses, willing to be identified publicly, reporting a close encounter that left behind physical evidence of its reality.  In addition, the initial witness possessed the training and experience to be considered an expert on objects and craft in the sky; he is an airline pilot. At about 9:15 p.m. on July 8, Barry Powell, the pilot, was walking his dog when he noticed a strange craft with orange lights in the northern sky.  He realized almost immediately that it was approaching him, descending as he did so, and his leashed dog started to jump excitedly in the objectâs direction.  At that point John Cruzan, general manager of the Joplin Globe newspaper, and his wife Traci, who is a technician in the medical field, came around a curve and were confronted with this strange scene.  They immediately stopped and got out of their vehicle, joining Barry in trying to determine what they were all seeing. As it approached the confounded trio could make out a huge object, apparently soundless and displaying multiple lights in of yellow, blue and orange on its underside.  I said âapparentlyâ because every dog within hearing distance was barking excitedly.  Barryâs dog was even jumping up toward the craft to the extent his leash would allow. When the UFO departed, still at slow speed, the witnesses followed in the Cruzansâ Jeep. They lost sight of it as it descended behind trees, but continued to an area they felt it might have landed.  At that point even stranger things began to happen.  A spotlight they were using, which plugged into the cigarette lighter, dimmed but did not go out. The seatbelt warning buzzer began sounding intermittently, and the vehicleâs automatic transmission began to act up.  None of these oddities had occurred previously, and to my knowledge none of them have been repeated since. But the most chilling aspect of the incident showed up in its aftermath. On John Cruzanâ arm was a sizeable red spot that caused enough discomfort for him to go to a doctor, who told him it resembled an injury caused by a laser. It has since healed. I spoke with Mr. Cruzan about his experience earlier this month. Although he did not express it in so many words his attitude was clearly that of knowing the experience was real but also knowing that many people would find it incredible. He was unwavering, however, in the fact that he was simply describing the event as completely and accurately as possible within the limits of human vocabulary. I came away from the visit convinced that he was one of the most credible witnesses I have interviewed in years. Clusters of UFO sightings in a limited area within a relatively short period of have occurred on several occasions before, and the diehard skeptics insist that they result from a single case of misidentification receiving publicity and triggering the imagination of others, making them even more prone to turning the lights of distant aircraft into an alien spacecraft. In this instance, however, the witnesses were in almost all cases unaware of the previous incidents prior to having their own encounter.

It was an orb, very bright, brilliant white, and kind of had an appearance of a 'sparkler.'  The kind I used to play with on the fourth of July as a kid.  It was not more than a foot above the roof, and was about the size of a cantalope.  It lasted 3 seconds and my daughter and I gasped in amazement having both seen it.  My husband and son had not looked up in time, having therefore missed it. We marveled at the moon and described the orb we saw for several minutes, and at that point, my husband went back inside.  As the children and I walked off the deck and into the yard, we saw another orb just like the one a few minutes prior.  It appeared  20 ft above us, flew for 3 seconds and fizzled out.

It was a clear night and we counted at least six white lights that were flickering at what seemed to be a much faster rate than ordinary commercial or military aircraft.  My first thought was that maybe Tucson Airport (or possibly Davis-Monthan Air Force base) was experiencing some kind of incident on a runway causing air traffic to backup and circle in a holding pattern.  This was not the case.  Soon it was clear that these lights were not ""flying"" but hovering in place.   Not too long after the shimmering lights had appeared, a larger, bright orange light materialized beneath them.   Then things got a bit stranger.  The large orange light appeared to split into two distinct orbs, each retaining the same shape and color of the original.  In a matter of seconds the two lights merged together again into a single orb before vanishing along with the twinkling background lights.   At this point my wife was more concerned about my staying on the road because I was starting to swerve in and out of my lane.  The best that I could tell is that at least some of the twinkling lights flew into the larger orange light.  I couldn't believe what we were seeing.

As the object moved closer to 80 degrees above me, it banked more towards the west and seemed to increase in luminosity and size slightly.  As the object moved into the western portion of the sky, again about 65-70 degrees above me now, a recognizable aircraft (jet/plane) came into view directly above me moving in a WWN direction.  It seemed as if the red flashing plane was nearly on an intercept course as they moved closer and closer together. The plane/jet did have a slightly visible chem-trail, and as the object seemed right about to intersect with the plane/jet, the jet turned almost directly W, avoiding the entities intersecting.  The object then curved slowly and steadily toward a NNW path, and suddenly vanished about 8-10 seconds later. On a most likely unrelated note, the very instant the object vanished, coyotes all round me began to howl for about 30 seconds.

It was about an hour ago and obviously 20:07 hasn't happened yet :).    The sky was clear with little clouds at the time of sighting.  We were playing in backyard, watching humming birds when we saw this object.  First I thought it was a helium balloon because it was about the same size, but its speed, height and direction didn't gel with any free flying balloon.  It was flying towards Thousand Oaks which is west of Simi Valley and I am sure others might have seen it if someone was driving in the car or outside looking towards sky.    My daughter was first to notice, then my mom, and then me.  My mother said, she observed something like fans on either side of round object, but when I looked up it was a bit far and didn't notice anything like that.    Hope this helps.

I was driving on route 100 from Stowe into Morrisville on Vermont Route 100.  The sky was very dark and clear, and the stars were easily visible.  I was debating what route I wanted to take through Morrisville, when a moving object in the sky caught my eye.  I was on the phone as I was observing this object and informed the person I was speaking with that I was looking at something moving in the sky that was either a plane falling or a very large, abnormally slow moving meteor.   I only saw this object for approximately 3 seconds, as it was moving at a consistent pace and lost sight of it as it moved behind the tree line.  I attempted to find it again by continuing on the road that I hoped would give me a clear view of the object, but it was nowhere to be seen, in the sky or on the ground.  It was close enough to me that if it had been a plane crash, I would have felt the reverberations from its impact.   There is a small airport in Morrisville; however I observed this object a few miles to the east of the airport.  Also, had this been a plane on its way to the airport, it would have flown over my vehicle.  I did not hear any sounds that would have been associated with the object.  The lights on the object were yellow/orange-ish.   The way in which the lights were traveling together and the number of observable lights are what caused me to initially think that it was a plane.  However, the lights on the object were all the same color which is why I also considered the possibility of it being a large, slow moving meteor instead of a plane.   My main issue with this explanation is that the object as a whole was not illuminated, distinct smaller lights could be seen along the object.

We were walking my dogs in the desert.  It was dark and we had just started walking into my neighborhood from the desert.   I noticed an odd sound coming from a long wall that encloses houses, separating them from the desert.  At first I thought there was something in the bushes.  It was an electrical sound, kind of like bees buzzing; or water running, or, a rattle-snake sound.  It was a distinct, loud buzzing vibration that I couldn't figure out.   I commented on it to my boyfriend walking behind me.  He pointed out a craft with red and white lights in a southwest position in the sky, but I kept focusing on the sound below.  The more I followed the sound vibrating in the bushes along the wall, it seemed to keep moving with me.   Finally, I realized it was coming from the space craft above us, and the sound from it was vibrating below. I had originally figured this aircraft was an airplane of some kind but upon closer observation, I realized that it was unusual how it w! as hovering in the same spot for several minutes and not moving.  It was an oval shape, and the lights and sound were the most distinctive features.  I kept watching it for a long time and then it suddenly turned off its lights and headed in a bee-line toward the mountains, which was in a western direction.   I continued to hear the unusual vibration while it became softer, and observed a dim light and shaped of the craft as it disappeared over the San Gabriel Mountains.  It moved rather fast too.   I later speculated that it was definitely a UFO and neither one of us had ever seen anything like it before, and we are elderly.  It also seemed to me that it may have been using some kind of ultra-sound to take pictures of the terrain below, or was looking for something.  It even occurred to me that it was possibly a craft using vibration or super ultra-sound to levitate.  I had heard of experiments in this area a while back.   My boyfriend and I were both amazed by this experience.  I felt unthreatened by it, at the time of the experience, and my dogs did not seem disturbed by it, but they did seem to notice the sound that we heard and were curious about it too.   Later at home, I started feeling a little uneasy at the possibility of what it could have been.  I looked up some images of UFO sightings and there was one that correlated with what we saw; an oval-shaped craft with red and white lights.

Its direction changed to a slow arc toward the sun.

I was looking NNW, when a neon blue light came into my field of vision.  Again, it was mostly a neon blue, but there was a much smaller red light glow or light too.  The red light was about one quarter the size as the neon blue or smaller.  The light was as large and as bright as the landing light of an incoming jet preparing to land at the San Diego airport.  The light did not blink off and on as the anti-collision lights do.  It was a steady light.   Anyway, this light was moving very fast from the east to the west when it came into my field of vision.  Within 3 seconds it was NW of me and made a 180 degree turn.  It came back east a little and then went almost straight down but at a slight angle.   It disappeared for 20 seconds or so behind the tree line across the canyon and then came back up for 10 seconds.  It moved in a swimming motion in different directions.  Then down again below the tree line; almost straight down, but again at a slight angle.  This was not a long way away from me; it was close.  The light was closer than the planes coming south towards the San Diego airport.  When the planes are preparing to land, they get close to the airport and turn or head east along the Interstate 8 freeway corridor before turning back to the San Diego airport.   So, this light was moving much faster than the planes preparing for their approach to the airport and of course was closer to me than the Planes heading east along the Interstate corridor.  This light was also lower than the incoming jets and planes at all times in this sighting and must have come down close to the ground in order for me to loose sight of it, twice, behind the tree line across Dove Canyon (western finger of Dove Canyon).   This light moved gracefully, but not in straight lines.  It moved slightly erratically, a little like a d! olphin swimming rather than straight lines.  When it made a 180 degree turn, it was almost instantaneously.  This obviously was not a plane or helicopter.  If it was a drone, it would have to have been a jet powered drone, but that is not possible either, since there was no sound.",2014-12-05T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

A buddy and I were enjoying a quiet, clear evening on a west facing deck overlooking the east arm of Grand Traverse Bay in the northern lower peninsula of Michigan.  The moon was less than half full and becoming orange as it was settling down on the horizon mostly west but slightly southwest of our position.  The sky overhead was full of stars and the wind was almost calm though slight, variable breezes would occur.  The waves in the bay were moving from north to south.  You could hear a truck off in the distance for several miles and several minutes until it faded away.  We were waiting for it to disappear so that we could witness complete silence with exception to waves and crickets.   At approximately 23:15, I noticed a red light above the bay coming from south to north (left to right).  It was common for aircraft to fly along the bay but most often it would be a coastguard helicopter or a care flight air ambulance going from Traverse City to Charlevoix or Petoskey at that time of night.  The coast guard helicopter is red and I thought since the light was red it was probably them but I continued to observe expecting to hear the typical sound made by copters and to see a blinking light.  I estimated the craft to be 4 miles south of us and pointed it out to my friend.  When it had traveled another several seconds, I recalled thinking it was traveling the speed I expected a helicopter to move.  Its course was level and unchanging.   When it was about a mile south, I said that it was odd we couldnât hear it since it was so quiet outside.  This made me think maybe it was a small plane of some type since they are sometimes less noisy.   I continued to monitor its unchanging flight and at the point it passed the directly in front of our location I asked my friend, âWhat is that?  Thereâs no strobe light and no sound.â  He didnât have an answer and neither did I.   At this point, I estimated the object to be about 300 feet above the bay and maybe 5-7 mil! es out ... which is to say Â½ of the way to the Leelanua Peninsula or right down the middle of the bay.  The object never seemed to be definable with regard to shape though it was rounder than any other shape since it was just a fairly bright red light and I guess at that distance it seemed rounded.   As I write this recollection it occurs to me that the object may have been a bit closer, since I really couldnât determine its size and I had no sound to use as a guide.  Nonetheless, the object continued its heading and maintained the same altitude on its northerly flight.  I changed my position on the deck in order to continue my observation until trees obstructed my view.",2014-09-05T00:00:00,45.1072,-85.3501

I sit on my roof every night stargazing so I quite often see ""shooting stars"" or space junk which range anywhere from 5th magnitude brightness to 1st magnitude brightness.    Tonight, I noticed an unusual amount of space debris so I  was paying more attention to the sky than usual.  The first phenomena I experienced is what looked like an unusually bright object also usually colored that seemed to originate from one point in the sky and stretch to another point and vanish. Around 30 minutes later with the continuous bombardment of space debris I started to notice what looked like a star, not pulsating erratically, moving what seemed relatively slow but at such a high altitude that it was moving at a remarkable speed.  Either the same craft would appear and fly across the sky and vanish or multiple craft were flying across my field of vision. (I was facing south west). What was unusual about the crafts movement was that it was seemingly flying straight as though trying to appear to be an airplane but it would make sudden erratic turns that passenger aircraft were not capable of.  There was no sound coming from these craft, in Maui meadows every sound echoes and you can clearly distinguish the cars on the highway about 3/4 of a mile west of where I was. The most usual thing that I saw was an actual commercial flight fly across my field of view and another spacecraft appear and maneuver dramatically to almost intercept the plane and then follow it out of sight.   I have tried to rule out other possibilities but it could not be space debris because they were directly contrasted next to each other.  It also could not be an airplane for 2 reasons, Maui is quite isolated, there are only 2 airports, the closest of which is 15 miles away, and comparing these lights to an airplane confirmed my theory that they could not have been airplanes because they moved across the same airspace at what appeared to be the same altitude in incredibly short intervals.  Also the commercial flights would not have been able to reach such great altitudes in such a short time.

It was the same as stated in that report:  A very large object; in the shape that migrating geese fly and the so called bottom of it had many equally spaced lights on it.  For the little time I was able to get a fairly decent view, the lights appeared to be all white, but pretty large.  Just as I was about to pull over to get a better view it appeared to ascend slowly into the clouds with an eerie type glow in the surrounding clouds.  Then it was history.   This was also fairly near to an airport; but with a few farms and many wide open totally dark farmlands surrounding the area. I have only lived in Maine 2.5 years, but have seen all sorts of weird objects in the night skies year round.  I have been reluctant to report until now.

I wanted to share what my wife and I saw the other night.  I googled UFO Punta Gorda/Cape Coral to see if there was a news report of a UFO that night, and came across this website.  Thursday night, my wife and I were in bed, and I got up to close our bedroom window for the night.  We are used to seeing planes in the area since there is more than one airport in close proximity.  What we saw that night occurred above the Yucca Pens Unit Wildlife Management Area from our best guess.  When I went to close the window, I noticed a red/blue/yellow light, and I at first assumed it was an extremely slow moving plane.   After a few seconds I mentioned to my wife that there was plane or something with more lights then I have seen before.  She took a look and didnât mention the lights but said, âItâs not moving,â so I am there staring at it to see if it moves, then I donât know to explain it but it moved abruptly then stopped again.  At that point it had our full attention.  I asked my wife if she saw what I just witnessed and she confirmed that she had.  It then stayed stationary long enough for my wife to lay back down.  I could not stop watching since I was curious to what I seeing.   The next thing is literally like something out of a movie.  The thing shot upwards (vertically), then it disappeared in the horizon.  I said to my wife that it shot up vertically then disappeared to the North.   Then it shot back South to where I could see it and my wife and I watched it and were just both were asking each other if the other could see what was happening.   We are not into this kind of stuff but jokingly I high fived her and said scratch that off my bucket list.

It appeared to be almost above me, but still hundreds of feet in the air.  I saw a single light coming from it and the rest of it appeared bluish greenish.   It was a very clear blue sky, so that may have played a part in it.  My dog noticed nothing.   I went to call my husband to tell what I was seeing and once I got ahold of him and looked back up, it was gone.   Maybe it was a fancy adult toy...I am a lady in my early thirties.   I have never seen anything unlike this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2015-01-09T00:00:00,37.5422,-122.5161

A red glowing object flew directly over my car.  I thought that it was a meteorite because of the brightness and the way that it seemed to blur as it moved across the sky flying directly southbound along highway 101.  I was driving at a speed of 50 miles per hour and I assumed that it would burn out seconds after I saw it, but it did not, it continued on, in a straight trajectory, not losing any altitude. 	The next thought that I had was that it was going as fast as a missile and, living in Oceanside, Ca near Camp Pendleton, it may have come from there.  My confusion turned to concern, knowing that it had no other flashing lights like the jets that land at Carlsbad Airport or the commercial jets that fly southbound along the coast over the ocean.  The only other aircrafts that fly along the coast above the land are the police helicopters that fly over head at times, but mostly over the water. 	I continued following it down the coast, rarely taking my eyes off of it so as to keep my car on the road.  The light was very bright at first, like a meteorite, bigger that Venus when you can see it on a clear night and itâs closest to the earth.   I had kept my eyes on it for about 2 minutes when I saw that it had seemed to be flying over the Sea World tower, approximately 30 miles away.  I had reached Leucadia, Ca, and couldnât see past the cliffs at this point, but at my last view it had traveled far enough so the light was just a speck in the distance. 	In my approximations, the light was about 1000 feet from the ground and traveling at a speed faster than the F15s from Miramar Air Force Base. 30 miles in 2 minutes would equal about 900 miles per hour.",2015-01-09T00:00:00,33.12780664961637,-117.30352710997443

On the way to a gas station in northern Durham, North Carolina, my girlfriend and I witnessed an extremely bright hovering object, amber in color.  We decided to drive around to get a better view of it over the treetops and witnessed what looked like a triangular light pattern -- one very large, very bright amber light in the nose and a smaller flashing light on each wingtip and center which stayed illuminated but strobed brighter in order from left to right.  It passed in the opposite direction of our car.  Because it was so far away we could not make out any structure.  The large light was unlike anything we had seen in the sky before in terms of its size and brightness.  Once it was out of view we continued to the gas station. On the way back to the house we saw the object again, hovering back close to its original position.  It was much closer and we turned into a neighborhood to get a good look:  The object was very close.  I would compare it to watching a plane in take-off pass overhead in terms of its distance.  As we pulled into the neighborhood it stopped hovering and began moving -- drifting might be a more fitting verb -- across the sky towards us.  We parked the car and got out as the object passed directly overhead.  As it did we both witnessed the solid black outline of an equilateral diamond:  a small white running light in the center and at each tip with an over-sized, amber-colored seemingly directional (forward to forward-down) light at its nose and a significantly dimmer light on its tail.  The three lights from wingtip to wingtip constantly strobed in a left-to-right direction as it moved away from us.   The object was silent as it passed over and disappeared behind the tree line. We jumped back into our car to try and get a better angle to continue watching it but as we circled the woods which it had passed over it was nowhere in sight -- until we happened to catch the faint strobe of the object now a great distance away. We drove to my girlfriend's parents' house and watched this object glide back and forth across the sky at a great distance -- like a commercial plane at altitude --silently for over an hour.   At one point her mother came outside to watch it pass at about 45 degrees above the horizon close enough to make out the triangular front of the object.  We kept noticing that it seemed to pass in a straight line until we could not see it anymore and then begin its trajectory again from where it started -- but we never saw it fly back.  We assumed that we simply missed its return path.  Finally we watched one disappear not behind trees but simply into the distance and made sure to watch for its return.  It never flew back.  Suddenly it was once again close and over our left shoulders.  We were in disbelief that it could have 1) flown back to this position with such speed and 2) have done so without us noticing. We tracked the object as it passed about 60 degrees above the horizon when suddenly we noticed a second, identical object flying towards us from a great distance.  We continued watching these two objects pass back across the sky. The total sighting lasted from 9:20pm to 10:45pm, which is to say that at 10:45pm I finally came inside out of the frigid cold to write this report.",2015-01-09T00:00:00,35.98046262866192,-78.8981362628662

It being unusual to see planes traveling that close together ( as the brightness and size of both lights were identical) I watched a moment longer and noticed that they were stationary.  They were definitely hovering. I naturally assumed they were helicopters, though the red lights were unusual compared to other helicopters I've seen at night. With that thought I pulled slowly onto a side street where I could watch the lights, and confirmed that they were not moving. At that point, three bright white lights in a triangular formation replaced one of the red lights. in other words, the red light went out as the other lights came on.  The triangle and the other red light began moving together, quite as if they were connected, yet at this time they were still a short distance apart from each other.  The remaining red light went out and was replaced by the same pattern and brightness white lights as the first object.  They then moved together, very, very close, so that if you drew two triangles of three dots each, the two would ""share"" the center dot.  They started to move west, at first quickly, then they paused in place for a few seconds, then extremely quickly they went west and soon were lost from view.  They appeared to be rising in altitude as they moved, but despite this they were lost from view due to my position in a valley of sorts between hills.  During this sighting I lowered my car windows to hear any jet engine sounds, but I heard none.  I did notice other aircraft, much higher, and much more typical of commercial planes.  I've seen military fighter jets travel in that close a formation, but never outside of an air show, and not at night. If these were military, they have to be of the variety that can hover, and then speed off.  Certainly military planes exist that can do so, but I think those are rare enough that the sighting deserved to be reported here.",2014-11-06T00:00:00,41.5315,-73.6674

Upon exiting our vehicle we noticed the attendant and a customer looking up in the sky to the West.  We looked up and noticed 8 objects at a high altitude fixed in the sky, like a constellation. There were no stars visible as it was still light out. The objects appeared to be angular in shape like an elongated hexagon.  The attendant told us that they had been visible for about 20 minutes already.  There was no sound audible. The objects did not move for the 30 or so minutes that we watched.  I cannot accurately estimate the size of the objects but an airliner flew over at one point and the objects were higher and larger than the airliner. As the daylight diminished, the objects grew less visible leading me to conclude that they were not emitting their own light but were illuminated by the sun, reflecting the sun that was already over the horizon.  The 8 objects were spread out over about 1/3 of the sky in front of us, 60 degrees high or so and about 60 degrees left to right.

I saw a bright fireball moving in the sky for 10 minutes at a constant speed and path.,Frankfort,KY,2014-09-29T21:30:00,fireball,10 minutes,"Occurred : 9/29/2014 21:30  (Entered as : 09/29/14 21:30) Reported: 9/29/2014 10:16:27 PM 22:16 Posted: 10/3/2014 Location: Frankfort, KY Shape: Fireball Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114096.html,"I saw a bright fireball moving in the sky for 10 minutes at a constant speed and path. It was about 9:30 PM. It happened on September, 29th 2014. I stepped outside on my deck to smoke.  I looked to my right and noticed a very bright, orange light that had a hint of red to it.  I immediately thought it was a plane like the small ones that often fly in this area.  I was thinking it was a small 4 or 5 person aircraft like a Cessna or something.  However, there were no flashing lights like are commonly seen on a plane.  I then thought it might be a helicopter and it was shining some type of bright front light ahead of it in my direction.  However, there was no sound.  It was moving fairly slow in a horizontal path.  It did not waver from side to side at all but continued on a straight course.  It was going the speed that local small planes in the area normally seem to go.  I then realized that it actually appeared as though it were on fire. 	As it approached my house on its course, I could distinguish what looked like flames.  There was a central round core of glowing orange light with a hint of red light inside and around it.  There was also what looked like two plumes of large orange flames jetting on both sides.  As it came over the house I noticed that there appeared to be a dark structure of some sort beneath the flames.  It almost looked like there were possibly jet black wings like a plane around the flames and central area of the object.  The object left no trail. The object was mainly round except for these two plumes of flames and the two wing-like structures.  I became very concerned because I thought this could be an aircraft on fire and in distress.  However, there was no sound or any other flashing lights or colors.  The only colors were orange and the tiny hint of red.  The orange was a pumpkin orange.  The red was not a bright red, but a brownish red.  The object did not descend or slow down, no! r did it speed up.  The speed seemed to be moving in a constant speed and the direction or path of the object did not change or vary.  It was going coming from the Northwest and heading toward the southwest. 	As it passed over the house and continued past the neighborhood, the flame plumes began to diminish.  It almost looked like they were being turned down as if I were turning off the flames of a gas stove.  When the flames died down the center of the object was still glowing orange. I could then make out a dark structure of some type that did resemble an aircraft in some way.  Suddenly, the central core flickered into what appeared to be two small orange lights.  The lights then went out.  For a second it seemed I could again make out some type of dark structure.  The object was still there and moving, but it blended in with the night sky and passed out of my range of vision.  It bothered me a bit.  I have watched the skies a lot, and I know what planes look like.  I have witnessed meteorites and such often and know how they move and appear in the sky.  This did not appear to be a meteorite.  It kept a consistent path.  There was no sound.  The speed was relatively slow.  The! event lasted at least 10 minutes if not more.  When I first saw it and realized that it was not a plane or helicopter, I called my fiancÃ© to come outside and see it.  She brought her phone, and I recorded at least 3 minutes of it on the phone.  The video from the phone showed no color.  All you can see is a white blob of light.  You can hear us talking about what we are seeing. 	I did see an object in 2004 sometime over Berea, Kentucky that was rather large in the skyâ about the size of a full moon.  That object was perfectly round, low to the tree-line, and glowed the same orange that this object tonight did.  However, that object in 2004 was much, much larger and closer to the ground.  It did not appear to have flames or be burning, it just glowed pumpkin orange.  It also moved slowly and in a straight path until it disappeared behind the hills in Berea, KY.  At that time, I had never seen anything like that before in my life; and I never expected to again.  Tonight, I mentioned on the video that the color and movement reminded me of what I saw in 2004.  It was very similar.  The object tonight in 2014, however, must have been higher in the sky.  It wasnât near the tops of the trees but was up about whatever height the small planes in the area fly.  It was much bigger in comparison to the stars.  It was like a low flying plane. 	I called 911 tonight to report it because I thought there might be a possibility that it was a plane in distress.  The 911 operator told me to call a different number because it was not an emergency.  They were not interested in taking a report.  I then called the number they gave me, and that number was not in service.  I then decided to call the local airport.  I got a number there that gave me a hotline to call.  I called that hotline number from the recording.  I left a detailed message on the hotline number about what I saw.  This call was made after 10:00 PM.  I then decided I would look on the internet to see if there was a place to report UFO sightings.  I found this website and called the hotline and spoke to a man that told me to write up this report.  My fiancÃ© will also be writing a report as well since she was there with me and witnessed the event. I also made a post on Facebook to see if anyone had seen the same object. 	I would really like to know what this was.  It makes no sense.  I even thought of a Chinese lantern, but the object was being propelled in a straight course at a constant speed and was as large as a plane.  It couldnât have been a burning balloon or Chinese lantern.  I donât know what this was tonight.  I donât know what I saw was in 2004.  I am an educated man with a graduate degree and professional career, and I would like to know what this was.  Thanks for your time.",2014-10-03T00:00:00,38.2349,-84.9563213483146

Me and my cousin we returning home from a vaction and only ten minutes away from home witnessed a large strange object traveling above across the interstate.  I noticed it first when and it appeared to be the shape of a triangle.   Then as we moved along it appeared more cross like.  Really tried to focus on the object and wish I would have just stoped because we wanted to identify the object.   It was not our luck as well because it was flying so low that after I first noticed it, trees in the intersection we also obscuring our view.  It was a very strange flying object like none I've seen before.   As stated before it seemed difficult to actually determine the shape.  The size of the shape was enormous for such a low flying object and was covered with about ten or more white balls of light.  I have never seen as many lights on a plane before so at first I thought it might be some sort of miltary plane that I have never witnessed before, but I do not understand why they would want to be so lit up.   We could see the enormous object through the tops of the trees but it never rize above for a clear enough view.  None of the lights seemed to blink like any other normal plane and almost seemed extra bright white and glowing light.  The object also seemed to be moving extremely slow for such a large low flying aircraft.    After the object left sight we continued to search the sky and also stoped off the side of our exit to search the sky again outside of the vehicle.  No sight of the once large, lit up object but we had traveled a few miles to arive at out exit.  We did however notice unusual amount of plane activity where at first there seemed to be four planes flying close together then separate and seemed to just kind of circle the area.

Around 11:00pm on Monday night, I was driving home talking to my wife on the cell phone. I was driving west on Chastain Rd. towards Canton Rd. Just after passing Chastain Meadows, I noticed 3 large, white lights in the sky, apx. 100 feet or less above the ground and probably just 20-30 feet above the trees the lights were above.  The lights were sitting above the trees above the homes that appear to have been built in the 60âs or 70âs on the west side of the Bellâs Ferry if you had turned right onto Bellâs Ferry from the direction I had been driving.   The lights appeared to be apx. 20 feet apart from each other and I noticed a much smaller red light between the left and center white lights.  The red light was also sitting lower than the large white lights.  The lights were not moving or flashing. I am very familiar with this intersection and knew that the lights were not coming from a permanent fixture but I could not figure out what it was or see any object or shape from what was creating the lights.   As I drove through the intersection on Chastain, I continued to look to my right and knew it was not normal and I was really seeing something strange. I pulled a u-turn at my first opportunity to go back and get a closer look.  When I got back to the intersection it was no longer at the spot I had seen - it was now over near the Suzuki office in the Chastain Meadows business park. I took a left onto Chastain Meadows and at the point it was gone - I could not see it anywhere. What initially got my attention was how low and bright the lights were and that they were not moving. Whatever the object was, it was hovering or sitting still for at least 30 seconds. There are several houses right there and I am really tempted to go door to door in that area and ask if anyone saw anything strange. It was just too obvious to ignore. I cannot forget what I saw and I am posting my experience here in hopes that someone else saw it too and will be motivated to say something after reading my experience. After this, I will be much more attentive and conscious of the sky. I cannot say what it was, perhaps it was some kind of military craft or something along those lines but I do remember the sensation and the confidence I had when I saw it - it was not normal and I had never seen anything like it.   I did a quick search and it seems like other people have seen similar things in this exact same areaâ¦ Thanks",2014-11-21T00:00:00,34.01628083989501,-84.61814120734908

I live on a suburb on the northwest  side of Houston known as the Bear Creek area. I was doing a little cleanup up in my back yard at about 7:30PM this evening and a bright orange light caught my attention as it was approaching from the west in a direction that I usually observe airlines as they pass overhead to land at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  It began to curve to the north and a second orange light appeared paralleling it a little further to the west. These were no ordinary craft.  They were much brighter that the landing lights that we often see on aircraft.  They were solid without any blinking or pulsing normally associated with known aircraft.  They were a color orange that was almost as intense as looking at a welding arc with almost the same sort of sharpness.  Very orange.  The first thing I thought of was all the reports of the orange fireballs that many people have been sighting lately.  These were definitely self directed. Piloted!  They were moving about as fast as a normal aircraft.  I would estimate that they were at about 3 to 4 thousand feet in altitude.  They appeared to be roughly 500 ft apart. They continued to head in a northwesterly direction at about the same altitude paralleling each other  when another one came into view trailing behind the more westerly one at roughly the same distance. They were in a rough 90 degree pattern all moving in the same direction.  All of this transpired within approximately 30 seconds.  At this time I rushed to call my wife and 18 year old son  to see this. They came out quickly to observe what I was seeing and at that time another light appeared further back and  more to the west. At  maybe 800 ft. further back. As we observed all 4 lights they continued to move in a northern direction and began to fade out one by one. They remained the same brightness till within the last 15 seconds or so when they began to fade and then totally disappear. All of this transpired within about 3 minutes before they were totally gone. They all appeared to remain at about the same altitude and speed the entire time. There was no sound heard by any of us. I attempted to bring out a camera to photograph them, however they were to far away to capture them by the time I was able to retrieve one.  I am 58 years old. My father was in the Air Force for 18 years of my life and I have lived on and around many Air Force bases in the U. S. and in Europe.

About 5 seconds later, I saw a very bright flash of light out of the corner of my eye in the Southern sky. I thought this may be a meteor shower and kept my eyes trained in that direction. I saw another flash, nowhere near as bright, but brighter than a star or an airplane light.  This flash appeared further North from the first very bright flash.  I continued to watch and saw another flash about five seconds later, again further North.  Between flashes, the object was not visible.  I kept watching and saw a flash every five seconds continuing to move North.  The flash was mostly white, but had a bluish tinge to it.  Although the object had a Northerly heading, it did not appear to move in an exactly straight line. The time from visibility of each flash to fade out was not as fast as the usual airplane strobe, it was noticeably slower.  Also, there were no accompanying steady lights that airplanes usually have. I had the impression the object was far above normal air traffic.  I cannot dismiss the possibility this was a man-made craft.  However, I have never seen flashing like this and I often go out to gaze at the stars with the unaided eye. I experienced no further dizziness.

It captured our attention as we crossed the overpass and began to turn on our home street.  The object was spherical, bright, and deep red.  My wife was sure it occupied the Northwestern part of the sky just 60 seconds ago, although now it wasn't moving fast.  It was the biggest object visible in the sky, so much so that we pulled over to look at it some more. Bizarrely, staring at the object gave both of us the perception of VERY large, red lightning streaks emanating from it.  I vocalized this red streaks experience and my wife said the same was happening to her; the streaks appeared more orange to her.  At this point we pull out and iphone 5 to capture the brilliance of it on camera.  Naturally, the video just shows a bright white sphere against a black background.  The camera could not see what we saw. We must have watched the sphere for a few minutes.  We had the inclination to drive another .5 miles to go home and get a better camera.  We started the car and the object lost its red brilliance.  Within 5 seconds of losing the red streaks characteristics, it disappeared by closing in on itself.  While driving and lamenting this fact, a much faster moving and closer red and white object was visible in the Southwestern sky.  The first object was far away.  This second one was so close and so low that it appeared to descend quickly just over some trees not that far away.  The road did not exactly allow us to investigate exactly where we thought  this thing was aiming to land.

Dark blue with rose/pink pulsaing interior light. On Saturday September 13, 2014, at 11:15 PM on the 1500 block of West Embassy Street in Anaheim California 92802 (the cross street is Loara 1 block south of Lincoln Avenue).   I observed the following:  In the middle of the street (Embassy Avenue) I saw an egg shaped object floating 2-3 feet off the ground.  The object was about 2 Â½ feet across and it was approximately 20 feet away from me.  It was a dark blue like an India ink blue and it blended into the night and the black asphalt.  The only illumination was from a street light.  I first thought it might have been a helium balloon that had drifted from Disneyland.  Disneyland is about 2 miles away and sometimes helium balloons float away and they land in the area.  Upon close inspection it had no string attached to it and it stayed in the same position.  It never touched the ground. As I approached the object I could see that the âballoonâ had a thin semi-transparent membrane covering it.  Inside the object I could see a faint rose/pink colored light that was the size of a football and the light slowly pulsated.  It was a faint light.  Not bright.  And it was inside the object.  The object was smooth and it looked like latex.  Not metallic.  It had no antenna, fins nor propeller.  And it had no exterior lights. As I walked towards the object it remained in place about 3 feet off the ground.  My first impression was that it may be a balloon, drone or remote controlled object.  But it made no sound.  The object was totally silent.  It seemed peaceful and tranquil.  Not threatening. As I walked toward it (I did not run or make any fast moves), I thought I would try to capture it but when I got within about 2 feet from the object it slowly rose out of my reach straight up into the night sky.  It banked to the north and went over the buildings across the street and out of sight.  Its motion was smooth and not fast.  I never touched it. I did not experience any adverse reaction from it.  In fact it seemed inviting and almost playful.  I regret I did not have a camera with me to photograph it.   I was alone and no one else to my knowledge saw the object.",2014-09-18T00:00:00,33.83243273727648,-117.89132517193949

I kept watching them and following the jets with my eyes and head and could still hear them as they went by us and now I could see their tail ends, when all of a sudden a white flat circle that was brighter than the white clouds flew across (intercrossed) the tail ends of the jets.  My husband quit watching the jets as they had crossed over him.  He just slightly turned his head to watch them.  The jets were flying one behind the other keeping perfect spacing between each other.  I followed the bright white circle until it went behind a tree that obstructed our view.  The white Circle didn't go behind the tree on purpose, it was just a big tree that was on the side of the house that blocked my view.    My husband watched me stand up and follow the circle with my eyes and he turned to see what I was looking at and pointing at, that's when our view was ob! structed by our tree. The circle was flying as fast and steady as the jets and was very high in the sky. It was a perfect circle, brighter, whiter than a cloud. It looked flat almost like a orb dancing in your vehicle from jewelry or a watch that the sun reflected off of.  The circle didn't fly behind the tree on purpose it was just a big tree beside our house that blocked our view from seeing the circle any longer.  The circle was moving as fast and steady as the jets and was very high in the sky. There was no sound from the circle.  I don't know if the circle came out from a cloud next to the jets or where it came from.  I just began seeing it come from the right side going to the left side of the back end of the jets.

On the night of November 15th 2014, there were low clouds and I estimate the ceiling to be approximately 400 ft.   I was sitting in my Spa in my back yard, when I noticed a redish yellow light flying low and slow.  It appeared to be pulsing or rotating.  It looked more like a flame than a navigation light.   Then I noticed two more that appeared to be flying in formation with the first. Because of the cloud cover, I could not make out the aircraft that were displaying the lights, but my first thought was that it was a formation of Helicopters.  As they approached, however, I was struck by the lack of any noise.   As the lights were directly overhead, they extinguished.  The lights had been flying SE to NW, but about 30 seconds after they went out, I saw a large, black, triangular object flying (or floating) very slowly moving in a Northerly direction.  It appeared to be about the size of a C-17 at about 400 ft in altitude, but was of a triangular shape.  It was in complete view below the clouds, and I could see the shape perfectly.   My first impression was that it was a Stealth Fighter, but after a couple of seconds, I realized that the trailing edge was perfectly smooth, unlike the jagged edge of a Stealth Aircraft.  Add the very slow movement and the complete silence, and I realized that this was like nothing that I have ever seen.    I watched the object as it flew over my house, and it appeared to be dropping something like a parachute.  At that time, I saw 2 more lights appear from the SE, and they extinguished at about the same point as the others had.   I then saw 2 more of the Black, Triangular objects on the same flight path as the first one.  I lost sight of them as they flew over my house.   From the time that I saw the first lights to the time that I saw the third object fly over my house, was about 4 to 5 minutes in duration.

Low Level Flight pattern. I first notices a VERY bright light coming out of the South and proceeding more or less due North.  Its lights were ""intense"" to say the very least.  I have been around aircraft for many years in the USAF so I know what landing lights look like and the intensity of even the largest airplane.  This had to be 5 times as bright (or brighter).  Additionally, the lights were 2 seemingly separate but ? attached ? lights shining straight down. The leading light was the largest and the trailing attached light was 50% (plus) as bright.  It seemed to be having trouble turning its lights of as they were fluctuating together but randomly.  I perceived that fact only because I could think of no other reason for such random fluctuations. As it came overhead I noted that it was so low that it was in the region where local single engine aircraft would fly and NOT where Passenger/Military aircraft fly in our area. As it passed overhead I heard absolutely NOTHING, not anything.  Total and complete silence. It lit up my yard and everything within a mile or more so that I could clearly see my dog who was in the back yard with me.  It was casting so much light that I could distinctly see the shadows of my fence, my dog, and the house.  Not distinctly but notably casting a perceivable shadow. The light itself was PURE white and there were no flashing lights (running light) with which I am extremely aware of due to being around airplanes of all kinds (including stealth). It continues STRAIGHT north and eventually either disappeared over the mountains to the north of us or was able to extinguish its lights. To indicate my professional credentials.

It failed to release one stabilization chain and the rocket tilted and was quickly over ridden by staff to re-fire the explosive to release the chain.  It flew toward Adelaide and crashed just on the outskirts.  It never got into space to finish its mission.

November 20, 2014.   My sister and I were driving toward Clarksburg WV, on US-19 about 2 miles outside of Shinnston, WV.  It was around 19:30 when I saw the lights out in the distance.  I noticed two white lights above a hill.  They looked like headlights.  It was about as high as a cell tower.  I thought it might be for a while because the lights were staying in one place. Something didnât seem quite right with it. I pointed it out to my sister.  She agreed it didnât look right. We became transfixed on this light.  It was hard to concentrate on driving. We rounded a turn and the lights are now on our right.  Weâre both staring at these lights suspended above the hill.  We are now about a mile from where we first saw the lights.  Then the object started moving.  It flew over the road to our left an unknown distance in front of us.  We began to feel uneasy.  As it flew over the road something came out of the object.  It looked like a fireball.  It was attached to the object because any move the object made it did too, but it never returned to the object.  The object turned back toward us and flew directly over us. I had my window down with my head halfway out the window, and I couldnât make out any shape to the object.  The radio was off, and I couldnât hear any sound coming from the object.  I opened the moonroof of the truck and my sister got a very good look at the lights, and she said that she couldnât make out anything on it either.  It was like it was there, but not.  Itâs something that I canât quite find the words to describe.  I went and turned around at a diner that was right up the road.  When we came back it was gone. We dismissed it as probably an airplane, and we were overreacting.  We went into town and got what we needed.  On the way back, we used I-79N to Fairmont.  There was a small plane that was trying to line up for landing at the North Central West Virginia Airport.  It flew over the interstate and made a sharp turn similar to that the object made earlier.  This is when the differences in the two became apparent. One, the plane had a lot more lights than the object had earlier in the night.  The plane had red and green lights that were clearly visible.  Two, the plane was faster than our object.  Finally, the planeâs turn was nothing like our objectâs turn.  The plane didnât have the maneuverability the object did.  When he plane turned it banked to one side.  Whereas, our object stayed on a flat plane the entire time.  The plane went a great distance to make a turn.  Ours made the turn in an instant.  It moved much more gracefully than the plane did. I donât know what I saw.  I do know that the object was less than 500 feet above us, and neither of us could make out any shape to the object.  I also know that whatever came out of the object didnât appear to go back to the object.  I donât know what it was or if there is physical evidence out there.  There is a public trail over there.  I plan to go out this weekend to search for anything that might have come down.",2014-11-26T00:00:00,39.3939,-80.2939

Then I noticed there were many of these lights.  They were not blinking.  Once in a while, they would appear to twinkle.   Since I was driving, I couldn't tell if they were moving or not, so I pulled into a parking lot to watch.  The lights were moving, all to the northeast.  As I watched, more lights appeared from out of the southwest, and moved in the same direction as the other lights.   These lights were larger than the size of the planet Venus when it can be seen shining brightly in the sky--probably three times the size.   Once they moved past me, I would lose sight of them, but more and more kept coming.  A plane or helicopter with flashing lights appeared and seemed to be going in a wide circle in the area.   After about 10 minutes, no more lights came out of the southwest.   I don't know exactly how many lights I had seen, but at least 20.

This is where I smoke, since my wife is pregnant, and I donât want a smoke filled house.  It is also very common for me to wake and smoke throughout the night.  I proceeded to light my cigarette and was on my smart phone, when I looked up and saw it.  I have a short backyard, about 15 ft, and then it slopes upward at a 45 degree angle for approximately 40 ft, to a road with a newly built vacant house on the other side of the road.  This house always has the outside light on. 	At the top of the hill (in front of the road and vacant house), there was a black box looking mass approximately 8ft long and 6ft tall.  Next to this there was the being, which looked like a classic grey, 4-5ft tall, but long skinny arms.  The being had one arm on the mass as if to be leaning or bracing itself on it.  The being was clear to see due to the light of the vacant house shining behind it (Directly).   This lasted for only 2-3 seconds, as my mind processed what I was looking at, and then my animalistic fear rushed over me like I have never felt before.  I had the immediate feeling the being wanted me to see it, since it was standing directly in front of the vacant house light for me to see.   But when fear and panic shot through my body it quickly darted either into, or behind the black mass (as if it could sense my fear of it).  It moved quit strangely, almost like a sliding mechanical way, smooth, quick, graceful and without a sound.  I have never seen anything living move like this before, which elevated my fear more.   I stood there looking for approximately for another 8-10 seconds and then yelled, âYouâre freaking me outâ.  I closed and locked the door, turned off the TV and lights, and ran upstairs, jumping into bed with my wife, where I laid awake waiting for sunrise so I could go check out the premises of the sighting.",2014-12-12T00:00:00,39.61804627329193,-79.95917639751553

I had just turned north off of Foxtail Dr. onto Rocky Mountain ave. in Loveland's Centerra Shopping area, when I saw a bright orange dot, initially solid in color, appear from the top of my jeep's windshield and begin heading north.   At first I thought it was a plane landing at Fort-Collins/Loveland airport but then quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be landing.  My next assumption was that it was meteor falling from the sky.  However when it didn't dissipate, as most meteorites do, I realized I must be looking at something very special.   As I looked closer I noticed that it was an almost semi-opaque but well defined circle... or orb as you people call them.  As I looked, the object very clearly changed color to a pinkish color for a few seconds and then changed back to orange.  It did this a few times as it flew north but because it was moving at such a high rate of speed, I only saw it change color 4 or 5 times.   It was traveling south to north, paralleling I-25 on its west side, appearing to head to Wyoming.  I watched it almost disappear into the northern horizon, to the point where you could barely see it.  It looked like a faint star very low on the horizon, maybe 5 degrees.   I was having a hard time seeing it at this point, so I pulled over and on the frontage road and watched it on the horizon.  It didn't move for a long time and just looked like a faint orange star.  It stayed there for maybe 8 or 9 minutes, at which point it went straight up and disappeared.   I have never seen anything like this and have never believed in this sort of thing until now.

I have never seen anything in the sky that I could not find some explanation for.  I was outside on the front porch with my mother for a cigarette.  She pointed toward the sky behind me, suddenly very animated.  I turned around, still sitting, and saw what looked like huge glowing orange lights in a perfect V formation moving in sync over the trees across the street.  It was silently heading our way in a cluster.   We hurried to get a closer look and stood watching from the highway.  About three more appeared as if out of nowhere; if anything they were already up and lowered to meet the rest as opposed to floating up or rising.  They were moving together, the first three more in sync though the spaces between them were not perfectly in unison as we continued to watch them head our way.  My mom was panicked and thought they were actually coming to us, since we were the only people out watching (it was a little before 11pm and we are mostly surrounded by shopping cente! rs that were closed.)  They had to be either very big or not that high, though higher than the trees.   The first three then began to curve around and turn away, going over the lake and disappearing.  The rest followed suit one by one, becoming more of a line and getting smaller as they travelled away from us.  They all vanished into the sky except for one, which slowly glided away before it was blocked by the top of some buildings or condos over on the further side of the lake.   I have heard of orange lights before but until you see it, you don't understand how far out and perplexing it can be.  My mother kept saying how she felt like it was aware of us and though I do not like to make such quick assumptions, it felt a bit eerie.   I had tried taking a picture but they didn't show on the camera preview on my phone, possibly because of street light glare. I did a search online and am going to keep checking to see if anyone else saw this but so far (its been 30 mins since it happened! ) nothing else has come up for tonight though I'm reading acco! unts fro m five days ago around NY and before that the same description was in Britain.  I read ""explanations"" blaming Chinese Lanterns.  These were not Lanterns.  I've seen Lanterns set off in the sky at night, I've seen balloons with flames set off at festivals, air balloons, sky divers, flares, this was nothing like that.  They moved with precision.   My stomach is still fluttering.  It was like a one time event sighting.  In my mother's 56 years she has never seen anything like it.   My window faces the sky where she first spotted them.

It was flying high, but not as high as an airplane.  More like the height a helicopter would fly at. As I watched, clouds rolled in and over the moon and lights.  When the clouds passed over, and the sky was clear again, the object was gone.  There were no stars in the sky that resembled what I had seen.

The sky was clear to the left of the diminishing stars as if those were the last clouds to pass. They were not stars.  They actually may both weren't moving and the clouds moving made it look like they were.  They were trying to pretend like stars and were UFO's that looked exactly like 2 stars.  I will never forget this happened. There was a helicopter around the area at the time and was flying around maybe because of a car accident in Crestwood next to Oak Lawn.

It looked similar to jets flying in formation but when it was directly overhead we could see it was solid and blocked out stars as it passed in front of them.

I saw a strange grouping of three soft white lights moving at a VERY high speed flying east straight overhead over the campus.  The strangest thing was that I hadn't heard any roar of engines or a sonic boom from the speed.   I called an associate, who I knew was out walking nearby, to ask if he'd heard or seen anything, and he denied that he had.  It didn't look like any of our planes, and I called the flight supervisor ~21:06 to ask about any planes on the radar, and he said they hadn't tracked anything.  The grouping of the lights suggested either a chevron shape, or a formation that was very precisely close at such a high speed.  I will assume it was rather close to the ground, as I only saw it for a few seconds before it was gone over the dorms, and the lights were roughly the size of a child's size fast food drink lid held at arm's length, to my perception. (That's all I have nearby to compare it to, don't judge.)  I couldn't see any outline past the lights, only the haze of the low clouds fuzzing out the lights a good deal.  They moved uniformly for as long as I saw them, giving me the impression it was a single craft.  As this is an aeronautical school, there were at least several student pilots within a few miles, but the flight supervisor said no-one else had reported anything.

I want to  report that I saw  3 brilliant bright orbs of light at about 9:30 am on September 1, 2014. 1.	  I was on a United Airlines flight from Denver to Orange County.  These bright blinding lights were flickering out in the middle of nowhere in the Southwest desert.  I believe the location was somewhere between the Grand Canyon and Nevada. It was in an area minus of any trees, rivers, or lakes. Only miles and miles of dry, arid brown and red soil in all directions  which looked as it had once been the bottom bed of a deep ocean. The sky was clear on the morning of Sept. 1, 2014 and I saw three blinding bright lights flickering from a plateau.  These lights remained grounded in a stationary position on this plateau which was in an uninhabitable arid area with no sign of life for at least a hundred miles in any direction.   I saw no river or lake, on signs that once in the prehistory of the region that an ocean had been present.  This region looks as if it can support no life.     The lights were lined up one in front of the other with smaller blinking lights, just as bright blinking.  The  3 large orbs of lights glowed steadily and did not flash.   I wasnât able to get a photograph of this sighting  but I did go online to see if anyone else had witnessed this strange phenomenon in the middle of nowhere.   I did find a video posted on  youtube.com which appears to be exactly within the same region and of the same type of vehicles that I sighted.    This sighting occurred on  June 10 2014- and can be f! ound on Youtube under :  STRANGE- THREE UNUSUAL BRIGHT LIGHTS   The person recording this sighting also observed the lights while in flight to Los Angeles.  The only difference with his sighting  is that these lights he filmed appear to airborne whereas the lights I observed were stationary on a large plateau.   Given that the lights were so bright it made it difficult to see to what these lights were attached.  It did look as if they were attached to some large dark triangular shaped  aircraft sitting all one in front of the other.  I only know that the area where these parked vehicles were emiting the brightest light I have ever encountered most probably did not originate from any human being, as survival in that area would be next to impossible without the aid of aircraft to transport anyone to that region.

A split second after the object entered my field of view, however, the âBirdâ appeared to have its wings folded in.  Birds who ride the thermoclines at that altitude very rarely flap their wings so I thought this odd.  I waited for the âBirdâ to open its wings.  It never did. As I describe this at the luxury of taking the time to sit in my living room and record my memory of the event, please bear in mind, the entire event was over in approximately 5 seconds.  When my eyes became fixed and focused on the object,   I jumped up from my chair and moved to the right to prevent my view from being blocked by a tree that is next to the pool.  What I was looking at was a solid black sphere.  I got an extremely good look at the object and could judge altitude better as it passed under a large cloud.  My view was never obstructed by the cloud.   The object did not appear to have any lights on it, nothing flashing, and it made absolutely no sound.  It left no form of contrail, but at that low of an altitude, neither would a commercial or private aircraft.  No contrail, moved under a cloud so my estimation of altitude would be at or under 1000 ft. The direction of the object never changed.  It continued out of sight on the same Southeastern trajectory it was on when I first saw it.   I work in the aviation field and I am familiar with what a fixed wing and or a non-fixed wing aircraft looks like in the sky.  I also know that any aircraft I am aware of, short of a non-powered glider can be heard from the ground at a below-cloud altitude.  This object was absolutely silent.  This object appeared to be a perfect sphere.  There were no wings. I am not claiming the object I saw was of extra-terrestrial origin, but I know what I saw was no typical aircraft that I have ever seen before.",2014-09-05T00:00:00,33.2677,-84.5999

I tried to rule out, though I am not denying the fact that it is a possibility that this craft was in fact a helicopter, plane, or other perfectly normal object.  However, there were no ""blinking"" lights like a plan, nor would a plane hover in the same spot for a few minutes.  A helicopter could hover, however I would have assumed I would have heard some bit of noise.  Not here, it was silent.",2014-12-22T00:00:00,,

About 8 minutes later, as I turned away from the lake heading towards my house, I saw the same lights over a housing development.   I then witnessed the lights stopping over a house and saw that they were in a triangular formation.  One light was green on light was red and one light was clear.  The triangular shape was about the same size of the house and low enough that I could make out the edges of the shape.  I put my car in park by the house across the street from the house that the triangle was over intending to take a picture or video when it started moving away.  I then proceeded to follow it around until it stopped over enough development closer to the lake.  The same pattern of following the shape and stopping under or near it continued for approximately 20 minutes.  It hovered over the high school softball field, various neighborhoods, and road intersections.   Whenever it would move the green and red lights went out while the clear light remained blinking.  I was able to take a short video of the clear blinking light moving.  I was on the phone with my brother from half of the event and then I stopped following the triangular shape to pick him up to show him what I was describing to him.

I next expected to see it burst into a pretty display.  But I quickly realized the orb of golden light I was seeing were no longer in motion.

My mom and I went out to smoke our cigarettes, when I noticed that the sky didn't look right.  There was a ring of lightly colored clouds that covered the horizon, in all directions.  When we looked up it was like a giant circle of black (like the world had turned into a dome shaped skylight), and there were three lights in the sky, dispersed to where I thought I was seeing the stars.   When I looked to the south, there was a gap in the clouds, which was a very lightly colored sky, as though the sun was still setting.  When I looked back up at the black, I started to notice, I couldn't tell if it was really clouds or not.  It didn't look right.  Then I noticed the brightest of the three lights (mentioned earlier) was actually moving, with a lesser bright light slowly tailing behind it.  The brightest light seemed to split up into two bright lights for short instances.   The two lights were moving south, but the further they went it seemed as though they weren't moving! at all, despite the speed at which they were moving.  I stuck my finger exactly where I saw the brightest one last (making sure I wasn't seeing stars) and sure enough they were moving.  But, they still seemed to be going nowhere.  About the time I confirmed they were moving I noticed the third star disappeared and several little lights dashed and flashed all over the sky.  At one point one little bouncing light dotted the outline of a square.  I think there was thirteen of them, maybe more.  This went on for a while and I noticed the clouds coming from the horizon stretching all the way across the sky. (It took about three minutes to occur) the clouds stretch across like ribbons laid out side by side.  It looked like the lighst were pulling the clouds in, it wasn't natural. Next thing I noticed was the brightest light and the little light tailing it had finally made some distance.  It went from directly overhead to west over the house.  I was soon able to make out the shape of the brightest star, a triangle with a little red pulsing light in the center.   It and the little light ducked in and out of the clouds (Six minutes after the clouds appeared, the sky was covered by clouds), and the lights soon disappeared.

I yelled to my co- workers ""Ovni! OVNI!!!!!"" ( Which is Spanish for UFO). Everyone immediately looked up and it almost seemed as if time, inside the van, slowed down immensely.  I felt as if the van was just smoothly floating down the road. A few seconds went by, (5-10 by my estimation) and after moving a few miles to the West, the craft disappeared into nothing.  As if it just collapsed into itself and it was gone.   I've always heard of black triangular shaped crafts, but never a white one, which just added to the strangeness.  This one had many of the same characteristics as its black counter parts.  It was totally silent, it showed no exhaust system, and it seemed to defy the laws of aerodynamics gliding  flawlessly through the air at a slow speed. It's hard for me to be sure of it's exact size, since I have no reference points to do the trigonometry, but if I had to estimate it's size, I would say it is somewhere in between 35-40 ft in length, from the front tip to the back of the craft and 25-35 ft in maximum width from one of the back corners to the other. I realize this is much smaller than the black triangles that have been reported, which is also a bit strange.

It was about 01:55am and I was driving from Vero Beach, FL, toward West Melbourne, FL on U.S.1. I was about 14 or 15 miles south of West Melbourne (approximately 25 miles north of Vero Beach) heading North on U.S.1 along the coast when I observed a round, bright yellowish orange light.  At first I thought it might be the moon, but, I quickly realized that it was too small and too bright.  This light was unusual as it gave the effect similar to what you would see watching a safety flare or a piece of magnesium burn - very bright & glowing. The next thing I noticed was that it was too big to be a star. I also noticed that it was moving from North to South down the coastline, but over the ocean - in my general direction, but not directly at me.  It didn't seem to be moving incredibly fast but I would say it was moving at a moderate pace, it was slightly off to my right - but in front of me, again - yellowish orange & very bright - too small to be the moon & too big to be a star, so now I am thinking to myself - this has to be a meteor.  With my curiosity peaked, I actually parked in the median of U.S.1 and got out of my car and observed this ""Thing"" for about 5 minutes.  Now I have my cell phone out and I am gonna try and get some video of it. I had a little trouble finding it at first, I am guessing at it's closest point, it was probably 1-2 miles from me and if I had to guess an altitiude, I would say somewhere between 3,000 & 5,000 ft.  There was no audible noise associated with this object or it's! movement.  Once I finally did get it into view and was ready to record it, it suddenly burned extra bright - and then disappeared - just like that. Or, so I thought. Upon looking closely for about 10 seconds I picked it up again but the bright yellowish orange glow that was there previously, was now gone.  There was still some light there still, but it was very dim (to the point where it could have easily been overlooked) and appeared to be coming from behind the object now, thus silhouetting it.  So, I surmised that it had simply changed direction, I am guessing it had made, approximately, an abrupt 90 degree turn.   Now the object was still moving but appeared to be heading away from me - but still remained in the same general location with a little lateral movement back & forth. I understand that this object changed direction abruptly, but, I can't explain the dramatic decrease in the light it was emitting, it went from super-bright, to virtually no light at all.  And again, there was no noise that I could associate this object.  I watched it for a couple minutes longer, as it seemed to be moving away from me (East) o! ut over the open ocean and then I decided to leave as I was meeting somebody.

It looked as though it was going to turn around but then stopped and hovered in a different location.

Profile of sighting(s):  Sighting 1-  11.09.14 2200  At approximately 11pm I was out on a run here in west Nashville.  My approximate location was at the highway 100 highway 70 split.  Upon looking down at the city scape, I noticed a light that seemed to cut the sky in half the way a spot light would if it were pointed directly up into the night sky.  The stream of light was faint due to the saturation of light coming off of the city and the almost full moon.  To give you an idea of my vantage point- the at&t building is facing my direction with this stream of light appearing to disect the building in half vertically.   I looked at this stream for perhaps a minute or so as I tried to discern if it was light coming off of another building (such as a hospital) and as I was doing so a globe appeared directly over the at&t building itself - or so it seemed.  The light was circular or globe like in shape and it emitted a red and orange pulsating light.  The light I saw was akin to tossing red and orange glow in the dark balls into a circular tumbler and then revolving the tumbler in a fashion similar to the way a drying machine might tumble clothing around.  The light I saw had an extremely unusual characteristic to it.  The light appeared to strobe, yet it was faint enough that I didn't get the impression I was on the dance floor or having a laser pointed at me.  The light lasted approximately 2 minutes and was 4-5 times the size of the at&t logo itself.   After a couple of minutes the intensity of the light decreased -as did the frequency of strobes.  The light then moved in a south/east path over the city and out towards Memphis if you were headed on I 40.  The velocity was""slow"" yet constant (similar to that of an airplane cruising at altitude)  with no apparent change in trajectory or pitch.  The light continued to move horizontally across my field of vision until it went behind a tree line and into the night.  No jet stream or sound observed. Sighting 2 -  11.10.14 2200  In an effort to gather some additional information about the sighting - I decided to head out at the same time and be at the same place as I originally saw the object.  I didn't think that I would be able to replicate my experience, but fortunately I was able to gather some extremely important observational data that may help in identifying what it is I originally saw.  Again at 2200 the night after my initial sighting I saw this object but this time it was different. At this point the object flew into my line of sight as if it came from Memphis into Nashville.  The object exhibited the same behavior as the object I saw last night during it's exiting phase. I saw it fly in a constant velocity and altitude as it did the night before. This time however - the object stopped in mid air just outside the city and hung there for approximately 30 seconds. Then it proceeded to head out the way it came without any sign that the object actually turned around mid flight.  Essentially it w! as like the object was attached to a tether (like that of a yo-yo approaching the ground- appearing to stop for a second- and then going right back towards it's initial point of entry into my vantage point)  The entire sighting lasted approximately 6 minutes.  2 min entry. 1 min ""stationary."" 2min departure towards initial point of entry.  This is the third time that I have witnessed this object - earlier in the summer I saw the same thing as my inititial report above but I didn't record it on my phone.  I have footage from the Nov. 9 sighting but unfortunately I gave up my personal information in the video.  Que the X-files track!",2014-11-14T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051
