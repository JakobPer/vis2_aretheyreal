I was sitting on my porch when a bright ""star"" caught the corner of my eye. The light was cast between the branches of a Red Pine, and I couldn't help but to stare at it. The rays coming off the light made it look like a snowflake I first counted 7 rays beaming from it but as I continued to stare I was able to count 12.  I was fascinated alone with its brightness, but then it dissapeared; so I thought. I moved my head and was able to see it again from my new vantage point, and that's when it hit me... stars don't move. So I moved to the middle of my yard for a better view through the clear moonless sky, and I noticed there were more lights with the others much more distant.  As I gazed at the lights I could see they were subtly moving side to side, up and down and in small circles.  Usually the movements were slow which caused me to second guess whether or not they were actually moving but then the larger closer light moved erratically to the right and then up, before back down and left to its starting point.  I called my fiance to come outside and she saw it move as well, but wasn't as convinced as I was. I called a friend up and he couldn't see it from his place so he drove to my house and we watched it for a good 5-10 minutes before it made a large movement like previously described. He freaked out and drove home, this isn't anything either of us would have dreamed we would witness.  We were both hesitant to call it what we both thought it was, a ufo, but now I am convinced. There were also several ""shooting stars"" near these lights throughout the course of observation. I took video footage, but I don't know how well it is going to turn out with the simple quality of my camera.

At around 12:45 am last night I got out of bed to go to the bathroom Approximately 5 minutes later I returned to my bedroom and got into bed and saw an orange glow on the wall opposite of the window and i noticed that the blinds had an orange light behind them which i thought was odd because that window doesn't look out to a street but a yard, garage and another house.  I looked out the blinds and couldn't see where the glow was coming from at first because it was obscured by the house and tree next door. So I stood up on the bed to see if I could see it better out of the top of the blinds and I could then see what looked to me like a fuzzy bright orange ball which I thought at first was just hovering. It was about the size of a dime held at arms length and to my eyes had no defined edge. Just bright, fuzzy and it looked odd, not like a plane's landing lights, a satellite (too big) or the international space station (again too big). I noticed it was slowly moving from right to left.. I was trying to figure out what it might be. It moved in a very slow, deliberate and steady way. It was kind of windy out so I do not think it was a chinese lantern because it did not flicker and the light seemed almost directional in nature. like as if it were a bright orange spotlight. I watched it for about 10 minutes before I thought to go get my iPhone to take a picture of it. I held the iphone steady and snapped a photo. When I did it was a little disappointing as it didn't seem like much of anything  on the iPhone's screen. It just looked like an orange light in the sky. My iPhone is a 3g so its camera is not sensitive enough to pick up stars or bright planets even. Also as I stated, the object was moving, slowly right to left across my field of view and rose at a very shallow angle of maybe 15 to 20 degrees before it was obscured by the  trees in the yard  and out of my field of view. It was hard to tell at night but it did not seem to be coming towards me or moving away from me but rather kept a steady course about equally distant from me at all points. The light did not flicker, brighten or dim. It was constant. I watched for another 20 minutes to see if it returned or if anything else would appear before going to sleep. My window looks South-East and the light was moving from south to north. This morning when I looked at the photo on my computer I noticed that the camera captured it as egg shaped, though my eyes could not see a shape (it just looked like a bright fuzzy orange ball to my eyes). Also you can see the edge of the window to the left slightly being lit up by the light. I live in a very quiet neighborhood and can hear planes without my window open. I never hear planes at night and I opened the window and couldn't hear a sound shortly after a took the picture I've attached to this report.

The plane was a few thousand miles high above the San Gabriel Mountains at approximately at a 30-40 degree angle in the sky from my vantage point   At first I thought it was a flock of birds but realized they were further from me than the sighted plane and could not have been birds. My wife who was with me confirmed the sighting. Initially it formed a wavy chain formation and moved in a westerly direction across the sky.  The objects appeared to be reflective and seemed to move relative to each other. The formation stopped their movement when they were roughly due north from my line of sight and formed a circular cluster. Some of the objects in the middle of the cluster appeared to rotate and catch the light from the sun. It appears that the objects, because of this behavior, were faceted.  The reflected the light from the sun in unison. I tracked the objects for about 3 mins. and at one point asked two women who were siting next to me to confirm that they could see the objects. The formation seemed to appear larger suggesting that they stopped moving in a westerly direction and started moving south.  I turned to the woman to ask her the time and when I turned back to see them, they objects had vanished from view.

Just west of this formation, in the sky, was an airplane which left an extremely long plume of white vapor. In the same area as this plane, was a solid black object, sort of, cylindrical-shaped, with some kind of blurry feature on it. Both the plane and the black object appeared very high. I'm guessing that that plane was at crusing altitude, so what's that, 30,000+ feet?  Well, it appeared that the black object was at least that high. At arms length, the object was about the size of a pencil's eraser. If this object was indeed around the same height as the plane, it must have been 1/4 size in comparison to it. The distance from the object to the plane appeared to be 300-400 yards.  The object made no noise. At first, I thought it was a bird, but it didn't move. I observed this for at least a mile, still in the same spot. At some point, the trees got in my view and i was unable to see it.

I pointed them out to my boyfriend, who suggested that they were planes putting on a show or perhaps may have had something to do with the space shuttle Endeavor finally reaching its destination. As I was beginning to mention that Los Angeles was in the opposite direction, the lights began, in unison, to move in a non aggressive manner and seemed to ""softly tumble"" lower in the sky. It was then that the three lights stood out as not being three individual objects (which explains my confusion behind the number of air craft I had seen), but that the three lights may actually have been part of a large triangular shaped aircraft, because as it was rolling ""out of the sky"", in the same fashion as something would when tumbling or falling into water.  I could almost see the outline of the craft, an accurate way to describe the actual view of it would be as if a triangle made entirely of glass with an LED light on each corner of its shape were dropped into water.  And finally, the person watching this occur is viewing it all from outside of the water, and from a much lower level, with only the lights actually visible in the darkness. The lights then spread out to form a horizontal line and with smooth effort, picked up  speed and glided quickly away as different helicopters and airplanes came nearer to. These lights continued to show up over the next hour or so, and I did not give them much thought until after my boyfriend and I were home and nothing about the incident was mentioned on the news or anywhere online for that matter. I am filling out this report with the hopes that an explanation exists somewhere that won't be along the lines of being a natural phenomena. The three lights in formation of a triangle craft was significantly larger than average passenger or commercial airplanes, I realized, after a helicopter passed my window and made its way toward the lights. Although the lights did not ""allow"" for any thing in the sky to approach it, it was very obvious that if it were one craft, it was similar to comparing the size of a cat to the size of an elephant.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,33.741524958402664,-117.86342978369385

I have three strange occurances to report on three different nights at the same location. I work at night and often go out to pray or muse under the stars. The first strange occurance was a couple weeks ago. I see planes a lot. They are colored and blink and easy to identify. Something came over that was a straight white light. Not blinking. Very bright. No noise heading in a straight line south to north. Due north and NOT west or east in any way. I watched it from one end of the sky to the other. North of us a couple hours drive is an airforce base with stealth fighters and bombers. I assumed it was one of these.  The next occurance was Monday June 18, 2012. Once again I was out praying and in the tradition of the early church fathers I face due east. In front of me a very large red or orange fireball fell from the sky. I see shooting stars every once in awhile but this was odd because of it's size and color. I finished praying and got up and turned around when another fell due west of where I had been kneeling. The exact same size and color.  The third thing I would report is probably nothing. I assume they are satelites but the amount of them are getting ridiculous. I see the occasional satelite. Usually dull white travelling at a decent pace across the sky. Sometimes they shine a bit brighter for a few seconds and then dull down again before disappearing. Over the last week when out praying I have noticed a very large amount of these things. Usually I'd see one every couple nights or so but tonight I seen four in one spot. Two travelling one direction and two the other on north/south trajectories. Two almost crossed on top of each other. I have been noticing a continual flow of these in the same pathway across the sky for the last week to two weeks. Tonight I counted, a dozen or so. Way more than any other times and I've been watching the sky in my nightly prayer for several years.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,,

After we missed the Orionids, due to rainy/cold conditions, we made it our mission to see the Taurids early morning light show Nov. 4th and 5th.  We are both extreme creatures of habit, so staying up late to seek shooting stars has become our normal routine.  Together, we've probably seen over 75 shooting stars in the last 5 days, but what we saw last night was most certainly not like anything either of us has ever seen. At around 3:15 am PST, my wife pointed at the sky to where she had just seen a bright flash of light between the constellation of Orion and Jupiter.  Being that we are very close to LAX, when I saw the blink of very bright white light a few seconds later, I immediately thought it was an airplane.  However the light did not appear to have any sort of intervaled blinking and it did not move.  It was Bright! Brighter than even Jupiter, which was to the NW of the flash.  Through my binoculars I saw the flash come and go about 4 times.  Each was abrupt, bright, and in the same spot between two very small distant stars. Based on the other celestrial and orbital objects around it, this light appeared to be coming from deep space.  No object or shape could be made out, but it lit up approx. 7 or 8 times within a minute and then disappeared. I've spent the last 24 hrs researching Weather Balloon citings, Iridium Flares, and other logical explanations for what we saw.  None of them have even come so close as to mimick our happenstance.   Needless to say, we're out here again tonight!  I don't see this curiousity ceasing ANYtime soon.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,34.138264772727275,-118.39205681818181

A few minutes after apparent sunset on 11/7/2012 5:20-5:40 I saw an object begin glowing brightly about 6-7 degrees above the horizon, at this point 3 degrees above the sun (was obscured by tree line) the object was about the same angular size as Venus, maybe a little larger.  It was visible over the course of a minute, I first noticed it as a soft glowing object the same shade as the sun during sunset, but it got continuously brighter until I was able to see white light in the center, it quickly faded until it was just at the edge of my vision and then brightened up again. During the phase where it brightened back up I noticed an identical object five degrees north of it, and 10 degrees above the horizon.  This one had a much shorter life cycle of about 20-30 seconds and did not re-ignite like the first object.  So transfixed was I on the second object that I did not notice what happened to the first. After about two minutes of staring at the horizon trying to detect another I noticed a third object about 25 degrees directly above where the sun set, this one may have been in existence longer but I only saw it for about 5-10 seconds, which was enough time to point it out to a passerby to verify that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  She only noticed the contrail of a plane 10 degrees below object. All three were exceptionally bright objects that did not move during the times they were visible (verified constantly with reference points on the Horizon), all presented with an orange glow similar to the surrounding sky during sunset, but they all at their peak brightness had a visible bright white core. What I have concluded/believe:   1. They were not one object.  Two were visible at the same time. 2. It is not an airplane, or airplanes.  Angular size of light source, brightness and duration of visibility especially in close proximity to the sun would not exist without apparent motion. 3. They were not a satellite, positioning is too erratic, and they did not move. AND in order to produce a similar orange glow, light would have been reflected from the sun, but the objects were too close to the sun.  The only man-made objects to pass through area between sun and earth during time specified were ISS (ZARYA), Cosmos 2278, Atlas Centaur R/B and Okean-3.  None of which, according to computer program Stellarium 0.11.3, were in proper position or at proper times to be the objects spotted. My mind first jumped to supernova, and second to aliens.  Both seem equally improbable. Location of viewer during sighting: +28° 25' 6.99"", -81° 34' 49.53"" (28.418608, -81.580426)  In addition to these viewings at 7:52 a fireball/shooting star fell in the exact same region of the sky as the position of the aforementioned objects.  Angular size equivalent to quarter held at arm’s length.  No one else in my immediate vicinity appeared to have noticed it.  Highly visible fragmentation, with a short tail roughly equal to that of the body size, there was no noise.

No dust in the air. Sightings (flap?): Driving from Bishop, CA to Tonopah, NV:  We approached Coledale Junction. I slowed and made the turn  from Hwy 6 onto Hwy 95.  I then saw a bright white light to my left. It was a craft flying less than 200 knots and in low level flight.  I assumed it was a training jet, or general aviation plane running North on Hwy 95 (towards Reno).  I  estimate that it was 2000 Ft. AGL, or lower. As it came abreast of the car and off into the desert ¼ mile east of the hwy, it turned into an orange glow and then dispersed in a shower of sparks like a meteor and trailed a comet-like tail and then burned up in level flight and was gone.  By the time I alerted my wife-she missed it. It was low and on the driver’s side of the car.  I assumed I saw a meteorite coming in-but was mystified by the slow, level flight pattern. Then as we progressed Southbound on Hwy 95 towards Tonopah, I saw an orange circular light around two hand spans high in the windshield above the lights of Tonopah-some 12 miles distant & high above the twinkling lights of Tonopah.  This was perhaps 7 minutes after the first sighting. I called attention to it and My Wife saw it too.  Then another orange glowing ""orb"" appeared to the right of the first one.  They were both spread out and at the same elevation-the distance of separation was the full width of windshield.  First the left one snapped shut-turned off.  Then the Right one went out. We both watched this. As we approached our turn on Gabbs Pole Line road, these orange lights re-appeared-first the left one, then the right. It seemed they were stationary and in the same location still.  High above Tonopah. They stayed illuminated perhaps 20 seconds, then vanished in the same order.  We both saw these again.

This actually happened in 2005 but I remember it like it was last night. I was a junior in high school then but it was a weekend. I lived in Willow View Apartments in Staunton Va.  I had been hanging out around the apts with friends all day as usual and it was starting to get late...prob around midnight or so. Everyone decided to call it a night except for me and one of my friends so we walked up to my apt and sat on the steps talking and joking around. I was getting ready to call it a night myself when I happened to look out in the horizon and I saw it!  Staunton is a very hilly city and where I lived was on a hill so when looking at the horizon you can see very far and notice distinct land features(mountains,ECT...)  With one mountain really more of a really big hill to the SW of my porch that to me always looked to be out of place being an almost perfect pyramid with no other mountains close to it. Back to the story when I looked out there I noticed a very very bright light right above the peak of that oddly shaped mountain.  It looked the same as someone pointing a bright flashlight about 100 yards away from would look.  It did not move and did not make any noise that I could here.  After staring for a moment or two and letting it process in my brain I pointed it out to my friend.  We both agreed that it was way way to big and bright to be a star or planet and could tell it was far off but not very far probably within 10 to 50 miles. We watched it for what seemed like forever but was really about ten minutes and it didn't move or dim or even flicker the whole time.  Then out of nowhere as we both were watching as fast as you can blink it just simply disappeared like it was somebodies huge lightbulb and they hit the switch.  It never came back and have never seen it again.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,38.13703786407767,-79.06304077669903

Within a couple seconds it went from about 1,000 feet up to what looks like about 4-5,000 feet up. Walking through the French Quarter at about 6:30 am,  I looked up saw/ heard a passenger jet fly over. I recognized its shape and saw its blinking navigation lights immediately as i have seen many hundreds of air craft before it.  I've always been able to identify every single craft i've ever witnessed in the air. I'm an air force brat, born and raised spent my life studying jets, planes and all things in the air. Plus 'always known about UFOs, seen pictures, heard stories been a fan of Science Fiction since i was old enough to read & about the universe at large.  What happened yesterday morning was nothing like i've ever seen or even thought i would ever see. It was like something out of Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, accept real and in person. I was confused at first because i didn't recognize the color of the bright lights, heard no sound and couldn't actually see the shape of the craft.  It's as tho the lights were deliberately being shined at me. It looked like very, very bright, orange headlights at first on a slow moving helicopter that hovered to a stop in the middle of my point of view. It was in the middle of the street about 1 mile away and about 500-1000 feet up.  It came to a stop when i stopped in the middle of the street. I looked at it and thought ""what is that ?""  The shape of the air craft was obscured  due to the practically blinding brightness of the orange lights.  Now, It reminded me of the feeling of being under a spotlight.  The same light in your eyes a DJ person on stage might feel. It was briefly a blinding light. After a couple seconds of trying to see the shape of the craft, it looked like it was fading and going up into the sky so i grabbed my camera took the photo and it was gone. The craft was low enough to look like some kind of big hovering mass i couldn't even tell what shape it was due to the brightness of the light shining on me as tho i was under an extremely bright spotlight.  I grabbed the camera too the pic and it vanished. Sorry gentleman, something extraordinary and life changing has happened to me. Yesterday i experienced what i've explained here.  Something wonderful, unexplainable and ... after some thought, something i was ready for.  I've been preparing since i was old enough to read. You see those three lights in the picture ? I've just told you where they came from, what it looked like up close as they shined a laser or spotlight on me and that's what it looks like as it speeds away into the sky at about 10,000 miles an hour. I'm an artist and musician who is creative in many ways, however i'm not creative nor skilled enough to make this up.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

I had left my best friend's house after watching a movie. While on the highway I noticed maybe 10-13 red lights in the night sky. Because my car was dustier than usual due to local construction, I had to roll down my driver's window to get a clearer view.  The red lights seemed so out of place I decided to stop the car and parked it on the emergency lane. They were fairly low, close to the western horizon and they were slowly moving due south.  They were spread out but maintained their places, all appearing to move at the same speed. They reminded me of aircraft in formation but the pattern was irregular, rather like a constellation's shape.  They were essentially red lights, and were only slightly larger than any star in the sky and they seemed to twinkle softly as stars do.  Because I didn't have a great camera on me, I called my best friend on my cell phone! and told him to run out and look west.  But as he was getting out of his apartment, they all began to fade slowly and one after another until they disappeared entirely. As an artist, I consider myself an extremely open-minded person. But I try to approach such situations with a rational mind.  I have never before seen anything like this in person.  I am also sure there must have been several people who witnessed this.  The lights covered at least a sixth of the night sky. While there wasn't a great deal of traffic at 2:30am, the city wasn't entirely asleep either.  Anyone driving due west on several roads would have seen these lights gliding overhead.  I don't drink nor do I take any hallucinogenic drugs and I was wide awake when I witnessed this. As soon as I got home, I immediately went online to see if there was any news of a meteor shower or maybe a satellite burning up and found nothing. I did find an article on a British news site of what is ""believed to be"" a recent meteor shower.  But the pictures show a phenomenon that looks entirely different.  I then googled pictures of meteors and similar events and again, completely different images came up. When finally going on youtube at about 3:30am, I searched for the terms ""red+lights+sky"" and found a few videos showing lights over Galveston and Farmingdale and finally found a match for what I saw!  While mysteries make life more exciting, explanations can be more comforting. I would very much like an answer to this one.

Object/Formation with six orange/red lights in equilateral triangle formation flying NE over South Everett, over NW corner of Everett Mall parking lot. I went out on my first break of the evening (was at work) to stargaze and relax. It was a clear, open sky, with clear visibility of the stars. While looking directly up into the night sky, a perfect triangle of orange/red lights flew directly overhead at a high rate of speed at an altitude of approximately 500-1,000 ft. At first I thought it was a very low flying airplane, but it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. It wasn't solid, I could see the stars through it. There were three smaller lights in a similar equilateral triangle in the center of the formation (looking up). None of the lights were blinking, they were steadily lit. It moved in a North Easterly direction then changed trajectory to North, North East and changed formation slightly and the lights dimmed out slowly as they flew away. The initial shape of the objects were an equilateral triangle flying/pointing towards the NE, then changed slightly to a non-geometric shape; uncoordinated looking, but still flying together as they dimmed out. As they dimmed out I could see that the lights were definitely circular/orb-shaped. The initial brightness of the three outer lights was approximately -4, -5 magnitude, very similar to standard aircraft strobe lights, except these didn't strobe/rotate, and were a little dimmer. I have watched various airplanes fly since I was a young boy, love flying and have seen flight in night and daylight. I have never seen anything like this before. I was facing directly North towards a two-story building next door; the duration of the whole event was approximately nine to ten seconds. I've also noticed light/white colored helicopters flying over the area starting around August 23, 2012. Usually flying alone, but sometimes two flying together in tandem at various hours, but usually between 9:00PM to 6:00AM when I am at work in the area.

Soucouyant or UFO.. Around 1; 30am on the 6th August 2012 me and eight friends {young and old} were playing cards when we saw a ball of fire in the sky. It was about 200 – 400 feet in distance and about the same in height from where I was standing and it seem to flicker as a candle would. It wasn’t falling or going up in the air, it seemed to be floating across the sky very slowly and suddenly it began to drop and the fire started going out at the same time, then all we cud see is a white odd shaped thing floating to the ground behind some trees. It was too far for us to go see what it was. Before we could gather our thoughts as to what it was we just saw, another one came from the same direction at the same speed but landed in a different location. After that they kept coming one after another. We saw 10 of them pass us, all landing in different locations. I was facing east and it was moving in a north to south direction. A friend of mine saw it already, not too long ago. I know this because before the first one went out he said that it would. He said it was a Soucouyant{an old folk tale} but I beg to differ. I have no logical clue as to what it was but I know it was not normal. It didn’t make a sound and it was too close to mistake it for something normal.

UFO over Admiralty Inlet  In the early morning hours of August 6, 2012 at 1:12am I observed a stationary light that was dimmed and then became very bright yellow/white over Admiralty Inlet of Puget Sound, Washington.  The sky was slightly overcast and I could see only one star as I looked through the window in its direction.  The moon was visible but with a haze over it.  The moon’s light was diffuse.  I went outside and there was no sound.  Normally there is noise from planes and boats.  It was quiet---no boats or ships going by at the moment.  The water was very quiet too, no strong waves.  The light was too close to be a star.  It did not move. I thought maybe it could be a plane coming straight toward me and that would be the reason that it did not move. About ten minutes later I decided that was not a good explanation as it did not seem to come closer either. I went inside to get my binoculars and leaned my elbows on the back of the couch to try to keep the binoculars still.  My cat bumped my arm so I shooed the cat away but by the time I looked again, the light had vanished. I went to the kitchen to put the binocular away, when suddenly the light reappeared in the same place before my eyes.  I thought, “This cannot be a plane.  Who in their right mind would turn the lights off and on?” I then noticed a tiny speck shooting very fast that appeared under and going past the bright light.  I would have thought it to be a shooting star but only one star was visible that night and usually a shooting star is seen clear down to the horizon.  The little tiny fast moving thing was lit up as it approached the bright light and for a split second after it passed the bright light then no longer visible.  The tiny moving object was visible for only a split second.  I do not know if it was related to or independent of the bigger bright light. I had the feeling that the small thing must be of some reflective material that was light up by the big light as it passed by and underneath. I continued to watch it get very bright.  At about 1:40am there was a flash of red light and it was gone.  I did not see it fly away.  It just disappeared.  I watched ten more minutes.  It did not come back.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,48.0558,-122.6874

I took my 2 year old son outside to look at the stars, at approx. 21:35 (9:35pm).  He is a total night-owl, and I was trying to him to calm down so he would go to sleep.  The sky was very (VERY) clear, with virtually zero visible fog or moisture in the air, and the moon wasn't directly visible, and there was not a whole lot of ""light pollution"" from the ground. We looked around for a few minutes, when a flying object of some sort appeared from behind an oak tree.  It produced a relatively bright orange light, brighter than any star, but not by a whole lot. It was bright enough that it produced a clear halo.  The light was pulsing from orange to red at a steady rate, approx. 60-80 pulses per minute. (I am a musician so I am pretty good at determinating pulse/rate.)  It appeared to be at a fairly low altitude, I would say less than 2000 ft. possibly less than 1000ft. The object continued pulsing as it travelled, maintaining a straight line. I watched the object closely as it approached our location, for 10-15 seconds, and when it was just about directly over our heads, it began to ""disappear"" into the darkness.  Again, I was watching it VERY closely, and it looked like it was passing behind clouds or fog, but there was clearly no fog or clouds in the sky.  It disappeared compeletely for about 2 seconds, but then I was able to make it out faintly for about 2-3 seconds. I swear it looked just like when you see a plane pass behind a remnant of a cloud or thick fog.  Then it desappeared completely and never re-appeared. I scanned the whole area for 3-4 more minutes, hoping it would re-emerge, but it didn't. I turned to my son and said ""Whoa dude, you just saw your first UFO!""   The object did not necessarily look like a solid object that was producing light.  I couldn't make out a solid mass, just a bright pulsing light. I wonder if it could have been an earth produced, gaseous ball of fire, but it was such a slow and steady pulse, which seemed to be deliberate, or mechanized.  The object also did not necessarily appear to be under ""intelligent control.""  It very well could have been a manmade aircraft, maybe some new technology perhaps?   NOTE: I live about 15 miles from a Lockheed-Martin Facility which is very remotely located at the end a winding two lane road road, in the densely wooded Redwood forest, which is also very close to the coastline.

I was in awe at how many stars were visible and how clear the skies seemed. I had been sitting in the car for approximately twenty minutes, enjoying the air and listening to music with my seat reclined while I looked at the sky when I saw a large black triangle glide over my home and car. The triangle was large, black and isosceles triangular in shape. It had three lights; one on each point. The lights were white but not brilliant enough to illuminate the bottom of the triangle for a closer inspection as the triangle itself seemed very black, blacker than the sky. The entire event occurred so quickly and I was so startled that I cannot tell how far away the object seemed; I can only put it in perspective that it seemed much lower than a plane would fly. It was not flying as a plane would, either, since it was moving much slower and differently in the sense that when a plane moves across your field of vision, it does so in a linear fashion across the sky and this object's flight deviated in such a way that seemed unnatural and in-conducive to flight. I was very startled and, quite frankly, afraid after it left my field of vision and quickly restarted my car and ran inside. I am still afraid and have looked up for twenty minutes how to report a sighting. I'm not sure why I feel so compelled to tell someone about this and I feel quite foolish stating that I think I saw a UFO but I have no idea what I just saw.

We drove out of the city and off into a farm field where there were no lights around so we could see the stars clearly.  It was difficult at first to actually see the stars because it was a cloudy night and we were only 15 minutes away from the bright lights of the city.  As we searched for Andromeda, we all started commenting on the orange light that hung right above our horizon dew North.  The light appeared to be moving, but after a few minutes we agreed it was still and that it could possibly be a radio tower or fixated light of some sort. We tried to get a closer look with my telescope but all we could make out was a grainy, orange glow. (Definitely in the shape a circle- we were able to see the shape with our telescope set at 25x) I attempted to use my phone to zoom in on the object but it was still blurry so I just gave up.  In our opinion it was not a star because it was so close to our horizon and the brightness of the city wouldn’t have allowed us to see a star that low.  It was lower than any observable star in the sky. The clouds South of us were moving in so quickly that we could literally watch them roll over the horizon covering the stars.  We got distracted by this and turned around for a second, when we turned back around the object was completely gone.  We did see a plane flying through the sky (at about the same altitude) but it was definitely not the same object because it had a red blinking light and it was definitely a plane. After we all realized that the object was gone we got such an eerie sensation that we just had to get out of there.  We decided to drive down the road a little bit to make sure it wasn’t a radio tower with an orange light on it- we drove a mile and realized there was no tower, still feeling afraid we turned around and booked it back to the city.

Where I saw the UFO was in Normandy, TN, which is approximately 90 miles South of Nashville.   The object was to the right of the sun about one quarter of a turn. The object was highly reflective especially on the top left and lower right corners.  I could not determine a color of this object because it was so reflective, it was the color of the sun.  I was not around a telescope so I had to use binoculars to observe this object.  I was only able to observe for a few minutes because I had to be somewhere else.  When I arrived at the place I had to go, approximately 30 minutes later (11:00 am), I could not find the object.  I don’t believe it was of alien origin, but by definition it is a UFO.   Earlier in the morning, around 8:00 am, my grandfather also observed this object and he said it was lower in the sky than where I observed it at 10:30 am.  However, it was in the sky the entire duration from when ! he first saw it until when I saw it, but as far as I could tell, it disappeared around 11:00 am. I am a beginning astronomer and a sophomore in college.  I am fascinated by space programs and alien shows, however, I do not believe this object was alien.  If anything, it was probably another government test of a new undercover aircraft.  I am submitting this not because I think it is alien, but because I want to know what it was.  I asked my astronomy professor if he saw this object and he said he did not, but a week or two after the sighting he did turn me onto a video on the internet about a man in KY that got footage of the UFO and was interviewed by CNN.   The UFO in that video is precisely what I saw, only I saw it on Oct. 15, 2012 and the man in the video saw it on Oct. 16, 2012.    Thank you.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,,

I noticed a very bright star at the base of the big dipper and was trying to place it in the sky from my novice astronomy knowledge.  At first is was stationary like a star then began to move southward. Just as I said there should be nothing there it began to move over head to the south.

I thought an aircraft was on apprach with landing lights but it was not headed east to Toronto or to WaterlooWellington Airports but to Hamilton which is at least 100 kms away.  Then I new it was an UFO since there was no deflection or change in brightness as if it was bright all around it.  There was no air traffic that we could tel! l and I ran to get my binoculars while my son spotted for me.  When I came back outside, he said it had just disappeared. He said it diminished in size rapidly and it was as if the very bright white light that had been emmitting from it grew very small and disappeared.  We both surmized that it accelerated at high speeed to space.  The light was quite clear, extremely bright and pure white in colour.  Its intensity did not pulse nor did it blink, just a consistent magnitude and colour.  As soon as it disappeared there was air traffic moving from west to east at approximately FL7, 7,000 feet and descending to Toronto.

Total observation time: 23:30 to 23:52. Weather:  clear with slight haze near horizon. No moon.  Object appeared yellow orange over approximately Berkeley [but could have been as far as Livermore], no blinking lights.  Observed it with Bausch&Lomb 20x80 binoculars on a tripod, switching to camera every few minutes.  Photographed [and viewed] through open window with 12x optical zoom 10 MP Lumix [full zoom], on highest resolution [3072 x 2304  Pixels (7.08 MPixels) (4:3 aspect ratio)] , hand-held but steadied against window frame, on setting: 'scene;  night'.  One picture I deliberately 'streaked' the image by slight hand movement, to obtain additional light information such as other colors, blinking lights, etc.  Object was nearly stationary, barely moving to SW.   Object brightness slowly varied [not consistently though] over 20 seconds to 30 intervals from full brightness to invisibility [could not see it in the 20x80 either], then slowly brightening again over 20 to 30 secs.  Color varied from light orange to medium orange.  Object was a little fuzzy, even though 20x80 binocs were in sharp focus (which I checked a couple times; binoculars have separate left and right eye focus.)  Addendum:  There's a lot of air traffic in the Bay area; there's the SF airport and the Oakland airport.  I see all kinds of planes, and they always have blinking lights associated with them, Nor are they a steady light orange color with no additional blinking lights.  The object was higher than the general [incoming/outgoing] air traffic.  Object finally disappeared behind a hill in my foreground.  At full brightness, it was about like Venus or Jupiter, but light orange in color. At it's dimmest, it was not visible at all even when viewing through the 20x80 binoculars.  There was no noticable change in elevation, nor was there any sudden changes of position or speed.  Possible conclusion:  internally lit blimp, though this might be unlikely since, a) there were no navigation lights that I could discern b) it was operating so close to Oakland airport [class C] and San Francisco airport [class B].

Looked up into the sky to check out the stars.  I observed a huge, boomerang shaped object moving from North to South.  I pointed it out to my friend. At first, I thought that it was a formation of birds since the shape was somewhat of a Vee, but with rounded edges.  However, it was dark and birds don’t usually fly in formation, at night. There were no visible lights on the object.  It moved silently, high above the cirrus clouds which were at a very high altitude. Commercial airline traffic was in the air, at much lower altitudes.  These aircraft were dwarfed by the object that we observed. We were amazed at the size of this flying object or formation.

On the way home from work at approximately 1940-1945 hours, I observed six bright stationary orbs in the sky to the north/north east of Wasilla, Alaska, as I drove north on a dark rural paved road.  The objects appeared approximately three times the size of a planet such as Venus when seen in the dark night sky.  The lights were not directly overhead but rather part way up on the horizon.  Tonight the air was very cold and clear and all stars are visible clearly.  The air temperature is between 15 and 20 degrees with very low humidity.  The objects were orange in color and circular in shape. I called a coworker who was.driving the same road in the same area and he said he was attempting to film the objects on his smart phone. When I observed the lights/orbs, there appeared to be small red lights that would fall quickly off the objects traveling directly toward the ground in a straight line.  The red lights would dim and go out in 3 to 5 seconds time.  A description was like red hot slag that could be seen falling off a hotter orange main orb.  I observed this on the majority of six orbs but not on all of them. At this time I noticed that nearly every vehicle on the two lane highway headed in the northerly direction had stopped and citizens were observing what I was. At this time I noticed that no cars traveling south were stopping, only those traveling north. Four of the objects were aligned in a nearly straight vertical line with nearly equal distance of spacing.  Two more of the orange orbs were slightly off to the east of the vertical four or to the right side as I headed north. Next, I turned off the highway onto a gravel road that headed west and parked my vehicle.  I turned off the vehicle and all lights I had on.  I exited the vehicle and looked to the north, I could no longer see the orange lights or orbs.  To the south west/ west I could see one orange orb traveling in a southwestward/westward direction.  I would estimate it was approximately 50 to 70 miles from my position and very high in altitude compared to normal flight patterns.  If I was to estimate, I would say it was at 70,000 feet or higher altitude moving at a slow yet constant velocity.  The rate of travel was approximately twice as fast as a normal satalite that you observe traveling in orbit across the night sky. I called a coworker located 20 miles to the southwest of my position and the orb dimmed and disappeared a few seconds later before he could go out to observe it.  The whole event lasted less than two minutes from the time I observed it until the last orb disappeared from the cloudless sky unobstructed by mountains or  any other objects sans the stars.  When I exited my vehicle when it was turned off, there were no sounds.  No rotor noises, prop noises no jet engine turban sounds.  Whatever the orbs were they were silent as I observed them and at no time did I see any navigation strobes or red/green navigation lights.  I have no explanation for what I saw.  I have observed metopes, satellites , military night rocket launches, aerial search and illumination flares and many things but none of these were like what I observed tonight, November 7, 2012 to the north east and south/ southwest of Wasilla, Alaska.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,,

The same orbs were seen the night before and seemed to be moving back and forth through the sky.  Sort of like a liquid motion.  Helicopters were noticed on the first night and although it was dark sounded like they were flying over the orbs location.  This didn't seem to be the case on the 2nd night.

On the evening of Wednesday, June 20th, 2012 (the end of the solstice) at approximately 9:20PM I had just finished walking my dogs in Marina, California and was looking for a place to get something to eat in nearby Seaside (Monterey County). I passed Jim’s Chinese Restaurant on Del Monte Avenue next to Cardinalli’s used car lot on Broadway in Seaside. I parked my truck on the side of the street containing the restaurant (across the street from the Dunes Bar). I exited from my truck. As I turned to make my way to Jim’s, I saw in the air above the Dunes Bar what appeared to be four large, burning, pumpkin-shaped balls (for lack of a better description) hovering stationary. The glowing balls in question soon revealed themselves to be anchored to a huge object in the shape of an isosceles triangle (approximately the size of a battleship). Three of the glowing balls were attached to the base of the triangle, while another appeared at the point (nose) of the object. The object soon began to move, following the uphill path of Broadway (southeasterly direction), cutting through the fog before disappearing into a cloudbank. As the object disappeared, I spoke to a black gentleman standing across the street from me: he, too, had seen the tail end of the object as it vanished, but he hadn’t acquired any footage of the event on his cell phone. I immediately called my friend Brian D. on my cell phone as I made my way back down Broadway towards Jose’s Mexican Restaurant across the street (near the Commerce Center). Proprietor Jose himself was standing outside and watering his lawn at the time, and I asked Jose if he had seen the object—he denied it. But just as I asked the question (with Brian still on the phone with me), the object reappeared in the sky directly above us. I urged Jose to get footage of the object with his cell phone, and he immediately began recording—however, he was reluctant to move from the cover of the streetlight above him. At that point, I raced over to the Dunes Bar and urged the customers inside to come out and see this object for themselves. Eventually, a crowd of approximately a dozen people formed on the street outside the Dunes Bar. One of the onlookers took a look at the object and voiced the opinion “Aw, man, it’s only a glider.” No sooner did he say this than the object shifted position and actually stood on its nose (still in midair) in front of all the witnesses (who were heard gasping simultaneously by Brian, still in contact on my phone). The craft (for that’s exactly what it was) then straightened out and resumed its journey up Broadway towards the same cloudbank in full view of everybody. The cloudbank itself seemed to be only half the size of the craft and did not appear to be capable of completely concealing the object—nevertheless, as the craft entered the cloudbank it seemed to “phase” itself completely out of view and did not re-emerge from the other side of the cloudbank. That was the last time I saw the craft that evening. After saying goodbye to Brian, I immediately called the local police, who denied any knowledge of any unusual aerial activity in the area. They informed me that I was not going to be able to call the airport tower to confirm any of this and eventually requested that I refrain from calling them again. They did, however, provide me with the phone number of the UFO Center (206) 722-3000.  	Brian D. later informed me that a total of six armed helicopters took off from the nearby naval base and appeared in the vicinity of the opposite side of the cloudbank previously described, circling the area with searchlights for over an hour.  	On Thursday, June 21st (after my conversation with the UFO Center) I returned to Jose’s Mexican Restaurant to request the footage he had acquired the previous night. I gave him the assurance of the UFO Center that he would remain the sole copyright holder and owner of the footage. Jose himself, however, was not at the restaurant—a contentious young man working there demanded to know my business with him before he would tell me where to find him. I explained the story to the best of my ability and repeated the assurance that no harm would come to Jose or to his footage—and that the sharing of said footage could be extremely beneficial to him in the future. The man then told me that Jose was at his other restaurant on Cannery Row.  	Several hours later, I finally reached Jose at his restaurant—unfortunately for the both of us, Jose seemed to have “forgotten” exactly how to use his own SmartPhone and retrieve the footage in question. With Jose’s apologies, I returned to the previous restaurant empty-handed. There, a young woman also in the employ of Jose’s Mexican Restaurant quietly informed me that the other man had reached Jose ahead of me and told him to refuse to give up the valuable footage to anybody—that I was merely a profiteer seeking to rip him off.  	This is a true and accurate account of the events of June 20th and 21st 2012, and I am prepared to submit to any form of lie detector test or any other proofs of veracity.  Sincerely,  Christopher R.

They were hovering lower than a plane would fly, but higher than the tree line. The orbs were larger in size than any aircraft lights I've ever seen-I'd estimate about twice the size of a landing airplane's lights.  There were 3 lights/orbs in a slightly arched triangular form, then a 4th orb appeared between the 1st and 2nd orb.  They weren't moving, just hovering and glowing. They were visible for less than one minute and then vanished.  I saw a very diminished light blue colored streak appear for a millisecond and it was gone.  My mother said she saw it too but dismissed it as an airplane for lack of explanation/perception on the matter. Our vehicle was the only one in the area, except for a pick-up truck that was in front of us aways. I am retired law enforcement, my husband is active law enforcement, and we are experienced in responding to all sorts of strange calls about lights, fireworks, etc...but nothing I have ever seen has ever looked like these orbs. However, approximately 10-11 yrs ago, on the same road traveling the opposite direction I had an experience seeing some strange lights above the tree line and then for 2 hours I was ""hypnotized"" in some sort of trance like state.  My fiancé witnessed this and informed me that I spoke to him the entire 2 hours but was not ""myself.""   He said when I got home I went directly to bed and slept for 2 days.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,,

It was so weird because as quickly as they appeared out of nowhere, they disappeared in the same manner. Now you see it now you don't kind of thing. What kind of air crafts fly 5 at a time.

Object appeared to Pulse at random intervals and with random lengths of duration. Object was first thought to be stationary, but after approximately 2 minutes of observation, it changed position in the sky.  The object continued to appear around the area of Jupiter in the sky.   Moving in a random, yet semi-circular pattern, it remained in a relatively small area of view until approximately 11:15 PM. At this time the object appeared to move in a South Westerly direction, but at varying rates of speed and with multiple apparent sudden ""darting"" movements and course deviations. The object then appeared once again to stay in a relatively small area of the sky, but continued exhibiting sudden bursts of movements in random directions and often at near to absolute right angles. I continued to watch this object for approximately 55 minutes before it eventually seemed to either cease to emit light, or moved out of visual range. Throughout the entirety of this event, the pulse demonstrated no apparent pattern or rhythmic behavior as would a typical aircraft anti-collision light array. It was also not accompanied by the typical white and red lights of traditional aircraft. Based on my personal experiences as a pilot and lifelong aircraft enthusiast, with a profound understanding of aerodynamics and atmospheric phenomenon, I would estimate the object to be upper atmospheric or low space in altitude. There was no accompanying noise to indicate any type of typical aircraft propulsion and the ability to both “hover” and perform abrupt, high speed changes in direction as well as sudden bursts of acceleration run contrary to what is understood to be within the aerodynamic capabilities of winged or rotor aircraft. I.e. the altitude alone would prohibit sufficient lifting across a typical wing surface without the object having to move at a constant and extremely high rate of speed.

I stepped out onto my front deck to smoke at right around 3:00 Am.  We live on the Gulf of Mexico in a beachfront home so there is less light making the stars seem to stand out more than other cities I've lived in, so when I smoke at night I always stare straight up at the stars.  Almost right away,  I noticed a bright, white light flash one time out of the corner of my eye. I tried to focus without blinking on the area that the flash seemed to originate from and waited.  Finally after what seemed like an eternity, I saw it again!  Only this time, I was looking right at it when it flashed.  The light was so far up, that it appeared to be a star.  It appeared to be stationery at first, and was located near the Southwest corner of the constellation Orion.  After the second flash, I pulled up the stop watch application on my smartphone and began to time the spacing between flashes.  To the best of my ability, I timed it to exactly 7 seconds between flashes. I went inside quickly to ask my Fiancee if she would get out of bed and come outside to look at this light.  Luckily, she wasn't mad at me for waking her because we had seen the same sort of light last winter in the same exact location in the sky.  The only difference is the last time, the light flashed twice and was gone. The skies were completely clear, on both occasions, and the light  was so far away, the only way I can think to describe it is by comparing it to a star, that only shines for a half second every 7 seconds. The only thing that makes this worth reporting, is the incredible altitude at which it appeared to be coming from. I truly believe this object was in either low earth orbit, or in space. After watching the object and timing the frequency of the flashing for some time, I began to realize that it was actually moving, just very, very slow. After around 15 minutes, the object had moved a little less than the distance between the star furthest to the right of Orion's belt, and the center star in Orion's belt. Although it was actually located off of the Southwest corner of Orion, the distance between the stars in Orion's belt was the closest point of reference in determining the distance of travel. And given the very short distance the object travelled over a 15 minute period, this to me, has to be something other than an aircraft because I have never in my entire life seen an aircraft even half that high, and never have I seen an airplane that could fly that slow. The other thing that made me report this sighting, is the very slow, 7 second interval at which the light was flashing.  All the aircraft I have seen have marker lights and a strobe light. Whatever this was not only had no marker lights, but you could hardly consider this light a strobe purely because the period between flashes was so long, and the strangest fact of all, the fact that after about 15 minutes, it simply vanished and did not reappear.  And since the sky was perfectly clear and I could see every star and planet in the sky, the object could not have been obscured by a cloud.   I hope someone can look into this and check weather radar, air traffic radar, and find out if it could have been a satellite of some kind, or possibly even some military drone or experimental aircraft.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,26.958632653061223,-82.32509999999999

My alarm went off at 5:33 AM. I was lying prostrate and opened my eyes.  At this time I saw an orange light illuminate my bedroom door.  The light was from the South and was very warm in color.  The duration was similar to that of a car driving by; however the road is on the West side of the building and head lights could not shine into my South facing windows.  My bedroom is on the North side of the house; the intensity of light was bright, especially since it came through the Southern bedroom window to illuminate the door to my bedroom.  My family has owned this home for over 30 years and I am very familiar with the typical patterns of light that shine through the window. This strange light woke me up very quickly. I then saw another light pass by the exterior windows on the North side of the house.  This could have been more typical of headlights passing by the house.  At this time I got out of bed and went into my living room which has large picture windows to the North and South.  I did not see or hear any vehicles in the neighborhood – from my windows it would have been possible to see the vehicle that had passed by on the North side, but there was nothing.  I then looked out to the South and saw a very bright flash of light.  This appeared to be about ¼ of a mile away, only lasted for an instant, and was a bright white light.  I kept looking around and saw another light across the river to the Southeast; however I believe this really was a vehicle.  I observed the sky for a few more minutes, but did not see anything else. I do not believe I have witnessed anything like this before – this is the first time I have reported a strange sighting.  My background is a professional lighting designer.

I called my wife out of the house to check out whatever it was. We both watched the object remain completely unmoving in the clear, cloudless sky, for at least a minute.  Without a good reference to scale, the guess of altitude was maybe 10,000ft, and about 3 miles distant from our point of observation, towards the WNW.  I was interrupted by a cell phone call, during which, my wife retrieved a pair of binoculars for closer inspection.   She observed a silver, telephone pole shaped object that rotated slowly, with no other apparent movement, laterally or vertically.  The flash came from one side of the object reflecting the sun as it spun very slowly.  Shewatched the object for several minutes while I returned inside.  I finished my call and returned outside to find my wife clearly astonished by what we had both seen. She handed the binoculars to me, and when I turned to where the object had been, it was gone.  She was confident that it was not a mylar balloon, (too long, skinny), nor any aircraft that was easily recognizable (no wings, not moving, no rotor).  In that general direction lies the regional airport, and possibly even the approaches to Knoxville airport.  My only possible explanation was atmospheric distortion of a flight climbing out of Knoxville, or maybe a weather balloon.

The 7 of us just couldn't believe what we were seeing.  The lights were traveling much faster than a regular commercial jet would travel.

Satellite &quot;flaring&quot; in the same manner on two different nights two weeks apart.,Apex,NC,2012-06-21T22:00:00,flash,1 minute,"Occurred : 6/21/2012 22:00  (Entered as : 06/21/12 22:00) Reported: 6/22/2012 12:21:49 PM 12:21 Posted: 7/4/2012 Location: Apex, NC Shape: Flash Duration:1 minute",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89935.html,"Satellite ""flaring"" in the same manner on two different nights two weeks apart. I'm 44 years old and have been a night sky watcher all my life.  I observe the sky every cloudless night as I walk my dog.  I'm very familiar with low altitude local air traffic (near RDU) as well as high altitude eastern seaboard traffic.  I also know how to spot reflections from low orbit satellites near the daylight terminator in the hours after sunset.  In fact looking for them is a casual hobby of mine and I've seen countless.  However over the last couple of weeks I've seen what appeared to be two satellites on two different nights behave in a way I've not seen before.  The first time I wrote it off as a fluke.  When I saw it a second time it got me questioning that maybe they weren't satellites at all but something very much more peculiar.  The first event was a point of light almost directly overheard in a northerly direction.  I've observed that one aspect of satellite sunlight reflections versus aircraft lamp illumination is that reflections tend to have a blueish hue, almost starlight quality, where lamps are more yellowish.  I look for almost invisible points of blueish light moving at speeds very much faster than air traffic would be at an altitude where the running lamps would be equally dim.  Another aspect I look for is a gradual steady brightening and fading of the light, versus abrupt changes in brightness that would be caused by lamps being masked by the structure of a passing aircraft.  In this case the point of light met all of the above qualifications.  However as we (my wife and I) were watching the light over a period of about 15 seconds waiting for it to fade away it suddenly flared with a much brighter yellowish light for about 3 seconds then equally suddenly went completely dark with no trace.  During the 3 second period it seemed to stop completely, at least that was my perception.  But I dismissed that as just being a side effect of being spellbound by something I hadn't seen before.  Convinced it was a satellite from the start we both gasped and even joked that it must've been a flying saucer engaging its hyperdrive and blasting out of sight.  We were amused at the spectacle.  But then last night, again while walking our dog, we saw it again.  This time it was in a southerly direction but otherwise the circumstance were nearly identical.  An almost imperceptible blueish light moving at high speed relative to its apparently altitude just like any other satellite.  However we saw it flare again and much the same way.  Again it was for about 3 seconds but it seemed to be even brighter this time.  This time I realized that it was actually brighter than the forward lights of an approaching airliner.  We are in one of the approach paths to RDU so I'm very familiar with that.  It was very brilliant.  In fact I estimate it was brighter than any other natural or man made night sky object would be except the moon.  Unlike the first sighting though it didn't completely disappear after the flare.  It returned back to the dim blueish light but then seemed to ""skip"" across the sky.  Instead of fading out gradually in a straight line it seemed to jump ! forward and side to side by small amounts as it faded.  I have to confess the skipping was my perception but I'm not 100% sure it was the case.  The flare was bright enough that it may have affected my focused night sight.  But again it's something I've never witnessed before.  I'm no longer 100% convinced what we saw were satellites due to this flaring behavior.  One time, maybe.  But twice in such close date proximity just makes it seem very unlikely.  If it was a satellite it seems that it must've been the same one to behave in the same way.  It would've had to have had some surface area large enough to reflect enough sunlight from 250+ miles away to make it so bright and we would have had to have been lucky enough to see it just when it was overhead and just when it was pointed just right to witness it flare on two different uncoordinated occasions.  Again seems unlikely.  I look forward to seeing this thing again or finding an explanation!",2012-07-04T00:00:00,35.71733365853658,-78.8808643902439

Three of us observed unusual objects in sky.  All of us live in the area and have never seen objects like this.  We were in a drift boat on the KLAMATH RIVER.  The view of the sky was very large.  Objects were moving North and South.  They were white and long.  They were moving low and slow.  At least one disappeared behind mountains and reappeared.  They seemed to return or be replaced by other objects.  They were very bright white appearing to be reflecting sunlight not self luminous. There was no sound  We could hear.  There was background noise in the boat so there could have been noise.  Four or five cycles of objects were seen.  During one cycle a northbound object came close to a southbound object.  The southbound object had a contrail. No contrails were observed on the northbound objects.  A vague estimate of distance would be under 12 miles.  Later in the afternoon around 18:00 hours a southbound object was seen with a contrail.  The contrail disappeared.  A this point I was able to photograph with a digital camera with a 12 power telephoto lens.  It appears like a fuselage with a possible wing near the center. I have not blown up the photo on computer yet. Sightings of black silhouetted birds were also seen. In My opinion these objects could have been drones in test mode.  The did not execute any unusual behavior other than they were slow and low. They moved in straight lines The three observers are local and spend a lot of time outside.  Two were Indians. We all agreed these were unusual objects and We have never seen anything similar. THANKS for Your interest,2012-08-05T00:00:00,41.3114,-123.6166

I was shucking oysters in our garage with my nephew when I stepped outside onto the edge of the driveway to take care of some personal business…  While standing there I looked skyward at the stars directly overhead as we have had days and days of rain and the sight of stars was a welcome one. I noticed a very small point of light moving across the heavens and I initially figured it was an airliner.  After viewing it for a few moments I couldn’t spot any red, green, or other marker lights which would be visible from the ground of an airship passing six miles overhead… It was not a bright light, at all.  I continued to watch it and it suddenly slowed its speed to almost half of its previous speed then actually wobbled a bit to the side and then sped up continuing its previous heading.  At that point I yelled for my nephew to rush out and look at this strange light with me.  He immediately spotted it and then the object repeated the same motion of slowing down, jogging a bit off course then speeding back up to its previous speed. And then it vanished. It moved from directly overhead to the ENE.  Total sky travel was from directly overhead to a little less than 45 degrees from that first time I spotted it.  We remarked with a “What the hell was that?” then laughed about the notion of telling anyone about it…    Firstly, I do not drink alcohol since a heart attack earlier this year.  Secondly, I am a retired federal weatherman, namely a “meteorological technician” for 37 years. I spent my professional career staring into the sky at all hours and shifts judging weather phenomena to report in aviation weather observations and forecasts. I have never seen an object I would classify as a UFO, until now. And it’s not because I didn’t try! I have released many high-altitude radiosonde weather balloons with lighting attached and know well what that looks like. I have also seen the International Space Station pass overhead several times and even pointed it out to younger family members as a “Wowee!”  The object I am reporting looked like neither… I’ve seen “burn-ins” of manmade and extraterrestrial objects. This dim, fast-moving light was nothing like that, either.  Had the object simply maintained its speed and heading, I wouldn’t have thought much of it. I still wouldn’t have know what it was… But, when it slowed down and momentarily wobbled and varied its trajectory, TWICE, then sped back up to the original pace it was then that my childlike curiosity took notice. And then it was gone. Had it disappeared behind a thin deck of cirrostratus I would accept that. But, the stars in the background were still visible…  I’ll just scratch my head over this one and wait for a logical answer if one is ever served. This was not a dramatic sighting, by any stretch, but something different than any other point of light I have ever observed in the heavens. If it was indeed manmade, it surely has some of the finest control surfaces ever built. And quiet, too!",2012-08-05T00:00:00,30.612100000000005,-87.5653

Relatively speaking they were traveling slightly higher velocity as an airliner coming in for approach, about 250 knots, but their altitude must have been near the edge of the earth's atmosphere, which I would then estimate as 6,000 - 8,000 MPH.

Tonight was one such night.  To the south I saw what I thought might be the Pleiades, but after my son and I examined it through binoculars, we could see that it was a single star. Remembering that the Pleiades was higher in the sky, we walked around to the front of the house where we had a wider view of the sky, and as soon as I started searching for the star cluster, a bright white light suddenly appeared high in the southern sky.  My son saw it, too. It lasted for about a second or two, and got about as bright as Venus gets when it’s at its brightest before it faded. I quickly grabbed my binoculars which were hanging from my neck and focused on the area where we saw the bright light. My son was also searching the area.  Then both of us noticed that there were two star-like objects moving vertically in tandem, pretty much due north, about two thumb widths apart, arms fully extended (my son later told me).  They maintained precisely the same distance apart.  As I was tracking them with my binoculars, I was explaining to my son that they were probably satellites because the lights weren’t blinking and they were moving about the right speed for satellites, although I was thinking that they were moving a tad too fast to be satellites.  But that seemed like the most logical explanation. Then he asked me why there would be two satellites, and while I was thinking of an explanation, the two objects suddenly banked about ten degrees to the east, still moving north.  They started the turn at precisely the same moment.  It wasn’t a sharp-cornered turn, but the radius was fairly tight.  What amazed me was how precisely they maintained their distance apart.  Then we both lost them around the constellation Cygnus.  My son later told me that the trailing object was the one that got bright. One explanation is that they were military jets, and the bright light was one of the jets reflecting the sun which had set three hours earlier.  And I suppose that the pilots could have been able to maintain a precise distance apart.  What didn’t seem right, though, is that they didn’t have any blinking or colored lights. They were single white lights, like medium-faint stars. I’m 55, amateur astronomer, been sky-gazing since I was a kid, and besides one strange object I witnessed from a plane a few years ago, which I reported here (it’s possible it may have been a Mylar balloon), I’ve always been able to explain everything I’ve seen.  Although the best explanation might be that they were military jets, the absence of blinking or colored lights or contrails (we couldn’t hear any engines, either, but they seemed to be way up there and we wouldn’t necessarily have heard them) seems to place that theory in question.  And I don’t have any other explanation.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

You had to sit real still to see the lights, it appeared to be red and blue moving really fast so the colors blurred.  It appeared the lights were on the bottom but couldn't see it clearly enough.  As I stated before it appeared to just be a very large and bright star.  The colors only happened in beginning, a few occurances later but spaced out much longer apart. Someone asked me how high it was.  I know that a plane came towards it and it lowered quite a bit and the plane went over it.  There were a lot of planes that night that headed that way.  Some flew near it, some changed their paths, not sure if it was coincedence or on purpose.  There was one really low plane that seemed big enough to be commercial but flying lower than I ever seen commercial fly unless you were by an airport.  At one time we heard a loud jet, significantly loud yet couldn't see it with the trees.  Never seen it near the thing we were looking at.  It seemed to be a busy night, a lot more planes than normal and odd flight patterns but that may just be a coincedence. It lasted for sure 45 mins then when I came back out 1/2 hr later it was gone. I tried to record it on my Iphone and even took pictures but all that I got was darkness.  In one still shot where I'm positive I was taking a pic of it, the pic has this swirly thing in it so I'm assuming the pic took late while I was moving?  My Iphone camera messed up?  I would of seen swirly thing so I have no clue what happened there. I think the most interesting part was that it just seemed like a bright large star but it would just jut back and forth moving every few minutes that it was one of those things you just don't believe your eyes.  Then the colors would appear and your thinking to yourself this just can not be happening.  Logic takes over, and as an educated person I applied every probable cause I was taught in school to every creative idea I had and nothing made sense.  I live in town and because of all the trees the 45 mins I viewed it was when it was visible between 2 trees so after that it moved west and I'm not sure if it left for good or just left my view. I would really like to know what it was.  It moved in a circle at times for goodness sake... it was just so weird.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,38.3353,-87.5968

I saw a brightly glowing object in the sky that was pulsating red, blue, green and white light.  My son asked me if I saw what was outside the window and asked we what it was.  I replied that I didn’t know and we both went outside to get a better look.  The object was almost due east of our home and we didn’t hear any sound. It was above a ridge to the east and was completely motionless.  After a few minutes I went back inside to get my binoculars and then observed the object for a minute or two. I gave the binoculars to my son to see if he could make out any details. He could not, so I got my iPad and took some still photos.  There was still no sound and the object did not move. I switched the iPad to movie mode and shot a one-minute video of the object.  Since it was rather cold we both! went back inside.  About a minute later I noticed that the object was still in the same position and still pulsating with light so I went back outside and shot another one-minute video of the object.  This all occurred at about 8:15 pm PST. The next day I examined the videos and found that what we both thought was a single light had other, clearly visible lights around it.  There seems to be a triangular shape to the lights.  I have no idea what it was that we saw but I’ve never seen anything like it before.  I enjoy seeing the night sky and know many of the constellations.  Orion was well above the object as was Jupiter.  The night was crystal clear.  I don’t know what I observed I know what I saw.

It was heading West and it looked like an airplane or jet violently flying, as if it were about to crash. It was pretty low to the ground, but not dangerously close.  The object had dim lights (like those of an airplane or jet) and they were spiraling and moving around everywhere with the tumbling aircraft.  I can't remember if the lights were blinking or not.  The aircraft left a jet stream (or what seemed to be a trail of smoke or something) in the sky for about 5 minutes before it faded away. I was waiting for this 'plane' to crash and make an explosion, but it just spiraled out of view.  As I was watching it, I almost called 911 or the police to report what I saw in case it was in fact a plane crashing.  But because I saw no impact, or explosion, I didn't call. I called my father and my words wer! e ""I think I just saw an airplane crash"". The object was visible in the sky for about 20 seconds. The jet stream it left stayed in the sky for a good 5 minutes. The weird thing about what I saw is my friend (also from Morrison, IL) saw the same exact thing as I did at about 11:45PM. He posted a facebook status about what he saw and I IMMEDIATELY called him and had him describe to me what he saw and it was EXACTLY the same thing as what I witnessed. There was a few differences in what he saw, though. The object he saw flew East, the opposite direction of the craft I saw. Also, he told me as he watched the aircraft fly over the town of Morrison, the power went out citywide for a good 15-20 seconds while it was overhead, and as soon as it disappeared, the power went back on. He explained it the same way I did, a violently moving aircraft of some sort that was not flying straight at all and left a jet steam. Also, this is a different friend's status besides the two stated above: ""I would say I just saw a shooting star, but no shooting star moves like that.""   Here is a comment he made about what he saw: ""Didnt have colors that i could tell. It looked like a shooting star, but it stopped.  Then went the other way.  Then it was gone.

Hill field is an hours drive from here however, in my 30 plus years of living here I have never seen a commercial or military plane take this route or fly this low unless it was on the fourth of july for a fly over. Also the planes did not head back to the base they continued on a southerly course. I am just curious as to why they were flying where they were and why were there two of them. The activity is just a bit strange from what I had seen in the past. Wonder if anybody knows what they were up to?",2012-09-24T00:00:00,41.74376212121212,-111.82852424242424

Around 9:30 Pm, my mother and I were sitting on the back porch smoking a cigarette, when we heard a plane flying over, we both noticed the speed at which it was flying, tremendously fast, from south to north.  Then she noticed a flashing light in the south-eastern sky.  She asked me if I could see it, and at first I barely could.  She claimed to see it blinking, but after the before mentioned plane passed by, we listened for this blinking light and it made no sound.  She went inside a pair of binoculars, and attempted to focus in on the object.  She watched it for a few minutes, commenting on how strange it was, and then she said it was making her nauseous.  I took the binoculars from her and focused in myself.  What I saw was very strange.  While it had no distinct shape, there was a central light that was primarily white, with red and green twinkling dots flicker! ing around it in no specific pattern.  It remained stationary, but tiny glowing orbs seemed to orbit the central light at an amazing speed.  I watched it through binoculars for a while, noticing the red and green lights appear in different spots, almost like flickering Christmas tree lights.  At one point the red light shown brightest and I got goosebumps, followed by a splitting headache.  I stopped watching shortly after this.  I then went back inside and went to bed at an unusually early hour in an attempt to alleviate my headache.  These strange lights have become common in the past few weeks.

As I’m sitting there, I quickly hear what sounds to be like a tornado siren starting up.  I thought to myself “Hmm, that’s weird?  This is not the weather conditions for a tornado?”  This sound had a very wobbling electronic frequency noise.  The sound was loud and started moving toward me from the East.  I got up from sitting down and walked into the street to see if I could see a plane or something, when I walked into the street, it sounded like there was something hovering right above me.  When I looked up, directly above me, there was a quick flash of a cluster of bright blue lightning.   The lightning was squiggly and looked to be contained in a circle.  I could feel whatever this was flying above me in a weird way.  It felt big and it was moving slowly, too slow to be a plane.  And I know what a jet turbine or any type of propeller sounds like.  It sounded like a subwoofer on a massive level, it was unexplainable.  As it passed over me, the frequency of this sound started to slow down as it got farther away like when you listen to a tuned guitar.  Almost at a state of resonance.  Now this sound is to the west of me.  It sounded like it stopped and was just hovering right above the clouds.  I was panicked and scared.  It seemed to hover to the west for a moment and then the frequency of this noise started to speed up just a little bit and sounded like it was moving away to the SW.  The noise got fainter and fainter until I heard no more.  I ran everything I could possibly think of that would make this sound through my head and left only one outcome, a U.F.O.  I immediately called the Hewitt PD to see if they were testing tornado sirens.  They said no.

I had just gotten a text message on the way- at 21:58(9:58pm), so that is my time reference.  Seconds after putting my phone in my purse- I started to look out of the window (passenger side) at the night sky.  There were a few clouds visible, but a good amount of stars.  There was one star in particular that caught my eye- and my increasing interest.  One reason was because of its size….it was much larger than any star I’d ever seen, and second because it seemed to be moving. I asked my husband to stop the car- he did at the location given above and he saw it too.  A car came behind us and we were forced to move- maybe 30 seconds after initially stopping.  I attempted to follow the speeding light but it proved impossible.  Seconds later I lost track of it. I would not have reported this- however what happened next made me really question what we had seen.  A group of three helicopters- two in front- one in the back, triangle formation, rushed in from the NW.  I was able to follow the helicopter for some time- maybe 15 minutes throughout the drive home.  They eventually split up- each taking its own direction.   One of them was flying very low, a single blue light and a single red light- but unblinking.  I’d never seen a helicopter like that- and the original three all had blinking lights.  After arriving home (some 12 miles from the location of the original sighting) I continued seeing helicopters at various altitudes pacing the sky.

After just two shots it gradually began to hover and rise east.  Then it began to accelerate and was gone. This ball of light’s diameter was much larger than any spot lights I’ve ever seen.  When it moved, the light never lost its spherical shape.  Its motion seemed to defy the effects of momentum in a way nothing human made I know of could move.  Wind was not a possible explanation either. I was able to adjust the shutter speed enough to get a better look at it (kind of like adjusting to get the structural details of a full moon in a photo).  The light was so bright in the night sky that my eyes couldn’t make out any structure.

So, I spend a lot of time star gazing. I've never before seen anything out of the ordinary. But the other night, while driving, something caught my eye. A stationary blinking light that appeared to just hover and blink. The road I was driving is quite curvy, so I slowed, and watched for about four seconds.  The blink then reappeared very far away toward the east, then once again, then I never saw another blink.  I did not mention this to anyone, my friends already ridicule my UFO enthusiasm enough.  But walking with a close friend, who absolutely does not believe in UFO's, she reported seeing something ""weird"" in the sky around the same night of my encounter.  She proceeded to describe the exact same event.  I found out she, though in a different car, was on a nearby road, driving the same direction, at the same time.  She described all of this to me BEFORE I told her of my encounter.  Her description matched all of my details, incl! uding a stationary blinking white light, two blinks toward the east, then no more.  She, however, was not driving and had more time to really observe this object.  I find it most unusual she told me this, since she cringes every time I try to show her anything on UFOs.

IFO Incident (identified flying object) a.  on the night of june 21, 2012 I went out at night because I see things where I am all the time. I have seen one up close up, in march so I now know without a doubt they are here. As I wavered in the wind, for I am where windmills are. the wind gusts were up to 35mph blowing at their usual direction, from west to east in the palm springs-morongo valley wind pass.  It was an Exceptionally windy night. As I had almost decided I needed to get out of the wind, one of the stars I had been looking at, Seemed to flash.  Lately I am used to this too because so many plantes are around and making Strange flashes that show all colors of rainbows the more I look.   I noticed this star was not in the Night sky the night before, because as it was my birthday, I had made a point to go out and notice Where the stars were because they are in the same position as the day I was born.  This star Was not there.  As I looked to my right, I noticed a lot of planes really high up, then a plane Caught my eye back to the left, which Is over the southeastern portion of hwy 111 off the Hwy 10.  It is virtually desolate and one goes many miles through the middle of the desert To get to palm springs.  The plane seemed to be flashing really bright when I realized it Was the star. It looked like it had actually turned on. The plane looked like it was going to go right into this star, when I realized it was so high up that the plane was just a tiny dot in proportion to the immese size of this perfectly round looking planet/star.  Immediately, my mind knew it was Just another planet making the wild color show, when low and behold, it flashed bright red! Like a flashlight in the sky! The whole planet,star lit up! Then it flashed to white so fast It was like someone playing with the on off switch, from clear white to red. As it was blowing My mind, just for half a second I looked over to my right where I thought I saw something, But then my left peripheral saw something come out of the planet/star.  As I looked  back to the planet/star, an ifo craft had shot out of it and flew straight up and then over to The east, in it’s curvy straight way until it disappeared from being so high and going so fast straight to the east. And then I looked at the planet/star and it had started moving to it’s northwest at the moment The craft launched. The wind was gusting from west to east.  It then moved very very slowly northwest then went straight west, into the horizon.  I had time to go get my camera but was too excited to get it to work.  This all took like 15 minutes for it to cruise out of sight. It flashed red to white the whole time like it wasn’t worried about being seen, yet where it was is in the Middle of the big desert.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,33.80016511627907,-116.53537286821705

This is when i noticed that in the north west sky there was a bright object.  There was a building obstructing my view so I walked a little quicker to get around it and that is when I saw a huge fire ball type object sitting in sky silently maybe as low as 10 stories up.  It looked like a mini sun that was just hovering there.  The middle of the huge buring object however was black and I noticed it looked like something in the middle of it was moving. When I got a better look it realized that in the middle of this burning ball of light was what appeared to be the shape of a human  only larger than any man that I have ever seen. I noticed the figure appeared to raise it's arms up then the fire around it started to get bigger and bigger and then it went from a still position to moving slowly away. Then It moved diagonally up and imploded on it's self! after making an enormous flash of light.,2012-11-19T00:00:00,37.7721,-90.3672

I went outside to feed my cats at around 21:30 and living out in the country I have very few lights so I have a clear view of the sky.  As I bent over to put cat food in the cat’s bowls I saw a streak of light from the corner of my eye as I was beginning to bend over.  I looked up and the first thing I saw was how bright the planet Jupiter was and then I saw another blast of light which pinpointed where the first light I saw had come from. I stood there in awe with my mouth open because I could not believe what I was seeing.  It was a clear night with a few clouds and a soft breeze blowing and what I saw was a hole in the sky.  It was dark outside but enough light to show that clouds were around this hole but not blocking it. Inside this hole which almost seemed like looking through a tunnel, it was very clear through it almost like it really wasn’t our sky.  It was full of dancing lights that moved around all over the place and once in awhile they moved together in synch.   One more time I saw a blast of light come from something inside this hole that exited and seemed to go into our clouds.   The beam looked like this:   --------- --   ------   -- -------- -- ------------ -- ------------- -- -----------.    It was long and short beams going in a straight line. No sounds were ever heard during all this.  Most of the lights were red and white with a slight amber color on one. It seemed they were working on keeping this hole open and around the outside portion of the hole in what I think were clouds; they seemed to be manipulating the clouds or something into something that would appear alive.  In other words, the outside of the hole along with the inside of the hole seemed like a living entity. It moved very fluently as if looking around. I totally could not believe this and I ran in the house and called my parents to see if they saw anything from where they live 20 miles away. My dad said he saw something in the east but I told what I was watching was South East I went to my neighbors across the road and they stepped out and I had to point it out to them where to look. They both stood there in amazement and couldn’t believe it either how these bright dancing lights moved inside, and how the outer portions of the hole would move as if it were alive. At that moment two packs of coyotes started to howl and my neighbor’s wife went in the house. I came back to my place and called my dad and then I went out to see if the hole was still there. It was, but this time much fainter and fewer lights are in it. I can handle lights in a tunnel like hole but it bothered me how it was forming shapes that almost seemed humanoid at times.  The best way I can describe it is think of yourself as a tiny ant inside a hollow egg.  Someone comes along and drills a hole in the egg and puts his eye up to the egg to see the ant inside. The ant would see you and see you moving from his perspective outside that hole. That is what it looked like to me.  A giant peephole with something holding this hole open manipulating the area around it and then moving this animated matter in the shape of an animal or human reaching and grabbing things. If the bible is true and they say god will open the heavens and you will see him then I think I just saw a practice run, because I still don’t believe what I saw, but I did, and it’s disturbing on",2012-11-19T00:00:00,42.1662,-94.2518

Over the past few weeks, I have noticed some interesting activity. I was outside at work a few weeks back on our nightly break, when I saw a big green flash behind the clouds. It was very large in the sky. I was so shocked, I could barely express what I had seen.  That seemed to be the most significant thing to me, but I didn't feel like it was worth writing about until the last few nights. On my way home from work, I drive down a strip of road with fields on both sides. Being fall time, they're really empty and easy to see across.  For the past few nights, I've noticed 2 bright orange balls of light on both the north and south horizons.  Very far out, but still noticeable from my car. The first night I thought they were interesting, and then I saw the same thing the second night. The first night was very cloudy - couldn't see a star in the sky. I could however see these orange balls.  They weren't flashing or moving, just staying very still on the horizons.  Last night was exceptionally clear, and they were clearly visible in the same spots.  They are definitely a whole lot brighter than the rest of the things I could identify in the sky (stars, planes, etc). On a possibly related note, I've noted a significant increase in the static electricity around here. I got shocked a whole bunch of times last night from doorknobs, in the same place I work every night. I know the time of year probably has something to do with it.  When I woke up this morning, 2 lightbulbs (maybe more?) in my house were dead.  The incandescent kind. Both are bulbs that get a LOT of use in the house, and could have coincidentally died at the same time. I just thought it was interesting. As far as my (the observer) background goes...not much. I certainly am interested in UFO sightings, but have only ever seen a few times something I couldn't explain.  These few phenomenon in the past weeks have me puzzled, so I figured I'd say something - maybe other people have seen it too! :]  Thanks.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,43.0715,-75.7654

I looked through my binoculars and saw them. They didn't have any other flashing lights as planes do. Their brightness was about the same as a jet's flood light. They seemed to be in the same general vicinity, one of them I had in sight of my binoculars either faded down or disappeared. They were fairly slow, but about as high in altitude as a plane. I don't know how high they were, but they were about level with my neighbor's chimney, which, from where I sat on my deck would be about a 20-25% rise from atop my deck, which is 10 feet above ground level. I used my Suunto inclinometer for this 20-25 percent inclination estimate*. It would be hard to judge the actual distance the lights were from me. Within 10 minutes of this, or about 10:40 PM I got a call from my father who lives only 800 feet (N/W) from my house. He said he saw about 8 reddish lights in the same south eastern sky, they seemed to be moving upwards, and hovering in place, staying close to each other. Ultimately, I don't know if these are flares or Chinese lanterns, or what they were, but found them Odd. I only saw 2, but my father says he saw up to 8. I just felt it important to report.  Thanks.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

Beautiful summer day, blue sky, excellent visibility. Noticed a little aircraft, high up, thought it was a private jet. Couldn't see wings but it was very high and  silvery, reflecting the sunlight like a little mirror, so it didn't seem unusual at the moment.  But within a few seconds I realized how fast it was going--way, way faster than any aircraft I've ever seen.  My eyes fixed on it and I stopped walking. (I was on a sidewalk on a city street--Avenue du Parc--and I didn't want to walk into another pedestrian or a parking meter.) It was making a gentle arc, almost a straight line, across the sky, the way high-flying passenger planes do, but I realized it was not a normal plane or jet at all.  It was oblong, no wings, and it made no vapor trail and no noise.  (Too high up to be heard, maybe, like the highest passenger planes you can see.  But those always leave contrails, which is why you notice them in the first place.)   Then it dipped--it changed direction like no aircraft I've ever seen before.  I've been to air shows--I've seen F-14's and all kinds of other military craft--and I tell you there's no aircraft I know of that can change direction so suddenly.  It almost stopped, dipped down, making a path like the letter ""U,"" and then sped off to the left, a completely different trajectory. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I quickly looked around to see if anyone else noticed it--there were people sitting nearby at an outdoor cafe--but they were all talking to each other or reading, sipping their coffee.  The flying object would soon disappear behind the building across the street,  I thought, so I wasn't going to waste time telling some strangers to look at it. (It was so small and moving so fast, it seemed useless to do that.)   Then it flew into a wispy cloud, one of the few in the sky, and I lost sight of it completely.  I continued on my way and kept looking for it, but after passing through the cloud it must have been too far away to see with the naked eye.  As I said, it was going incredibly fast.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,45.51408695464828,-73.58579954756006

However as it then continued to travel as well as stop to hover for several moments at a time we began to rule out possibilities.  A plane or helicopter were the first options to rule out obviously, but as we continued to watch this in awe- we considered every possibility including the sky lanterns that people have been known to illegally ignite despite the fact that we knew this object was CLEARLY way higher than any vehicle flown by a person let alone a simple sky lantern.  It continued to descend at a rapid pace and move northward in the sky until the street lights on the corner near where I live made it impossible to watch and it also was after 2 am at that point and I had been monitoring it steadily. My neighbors witnessed but we all are unsure what this object was. Needless to say I did not sleep and will be watching again tonite. I very much would like some answers towards if this was a flaming mass or a UFO although I feel I clearly know that any flaming mass could not travel in the manor of which this object did regardless of how I attempt to rationalize it.

He stopped the car to observe direction of location of impact.  He described the event as ‘a teardrop shape object from which smoke and what appeared to be flames or heat of some type from the bottom of the object streaming to the top of the object’.

What was strange was how much light was coming from them on all sides of the objects.  I said there were 30 witnesses, because other drivers on the highway were slowing down to look at them and several had pulled over to the shoulder and were standing outside their cars. The lights were dazzlingly bright and were shining away from the craft on all sides like spotlights and were so bright that I could see that the objects were oval and greenish white overall with no windows.  I also slowed down and observed a stranger thing.  The lead light/object made an abrupt left turn almost 270 degrees and headed directly toward the second light.  The second light never changed course or speed, but the one that turned accelerated to an unbelievable speed and shot past the second one so closely that I thought they would collide.  For an instant, both craft were lit up by a little more and I saw them better. The one that sped up, continued to increase speed until it almost instantly disappeared past the tree/hill line.  I never saw anything move that fast before or turn like that, including all of the jets I'd seen at Air shows.  I had opened my window early on to see better and also noticed that the craft were completely silent.  I exited the highway onto S. Gulph Rd and could see the 2 remaining craft very distinctly through the tree branches and again when I stopped on Croton Rd and watched them until they too disappeared over the tree line.

This object flew slowly in a southwestern direction and crossed the big dipper from my vantage point.  It continued on a path like an airplane would and had no erratic movements.  However, I heard no noise of heli-engines or airplane sounds. It could not have been too high up, probably the average altitude of a plane landing in a few minutes.  I am not familiar with altitudes sorry.  Anyways, I first thought this was an owl flying and some lights were shining up into its wings as its shape was a chevron or V shape. The shape seemed to disappear and it looked like it was the same owl turning and flying and reappearing in the light. I was debating whether to take a picture or video the object as I was on the phone. As I kept watching this ""thing"" I realized that it was not an owl and it was some flying craft.  It had a pattern of light that was changing and blinking and this i! s what gave the appearance of an owl flying into and out of light.  The light was a solid glowing orange similar to a 60w light bulb color. The whole craft was lit from end to end. Then the light would blink off and on 2-3 times and return to the full glow. Then when it was fully lit a dark line would move from the left to right ""wing"".  Then the light would return to the blinking and then the left right.  It continued this same pattern until it flew out of my sight.  It was not a normal aircraft and I am not a paranormal or ufo type person. I dont drink or use drugs either.  The sky is very clear and I saw plenty of other aircraft in the sky during this same time period. All of them had the traditional strobes, red green blue etc.. It was not one of these.

I told mom to look and joked that they were UFOs, but said they could be lanterns.  Then, more lights came and they were all moving in the same direction along the same path.  I thought that they moved too deliberately for me to think they were lanterns, so gave up on that idea.  They may have been coming from somewhere around Midway airport area, but I am not sure.  There are airplanes that fly near the area, but these objects were definitely not jets or planes; they were too numerous, slow and quiet. So I asked mom if she’d mind if we pulled over to look.  She didn’t mind as she was pretty curious too.  We stopped the car and noticed that more and more lights kept moving on the path in the sky.  We noticed that they were round (oval or orb-shaped) and yellow-orange.  Sometimes the lights would pulsate and change color, but not in unison.  They did this individually, deepening into a primary red-colored glow and back to orange or yellow.  Sometimes they would fade out until you couldn’t see anymore light-- but only a gray round object floating in the sky.  The streetlights obstructed some of our vision so we could only see them as they traveled towards us and next to us; as they passed they faded into a light polluted area.  The unidentified lights were about low-cloud height, and could have been the size of a small car, I’m guessing-- I'm not sure how my judgement of this kind of thing is.  We saw as few as 50 or as many as a hundred… it is hard to tell since I understan! d that excitement can obscure one’s judgment of numbers.

I rushed outside with my two brothers, mother, and father and gaped at the sight of 3-4 bright orange lights moving in a formation from the East straight North. They were bright orange, almost the color of pumpkins, and moving in a straight line, with no sound. The lights did not blink at all and were obviously not any kind of aircraft, satellite, meteor, or naturally occurring in any way.   There were no clouds in the sky and the last light slowly faded out, almost like someone turning out a kerosene lamp.  We waited outside, discussing it, when two more lights appeared from the East and headed due North once more. One vanished faster than the other, which continued due North until it, too, disappeared.  These two seemed lower in the sky than the others, and the one that vanished last almost seemed li! ke it was constantly adjusting its height, dipping up and down.  None of the lights seemed naturally occurring in any way and we have not seen any since.

This light was also part of a pair and the second quickly followed suit with a large gap in-between.    My entire family aside from my oldest brother was out at this point and we were all staring at them.

It made no sound whatsoever and was moving about the speed of a single prop plane or glider; slow enough for observation.

Out the front window and slightly off to the right side  I noticed an extremely unusual light in the sky.  I commented immediately upon seeing the light, as it was so strange and moving so very fast that I exclaimed;  ""WHATS THAT! ""  while pointing to the moving light. My Assistant saw it too. The light was not too far away as it was clear and crisp, there was no observable haze or diffused effects of atmosphere to give a sense of a greater depth or distance, the light was only about 2 or 3 miles away at the furthest I think. I think the light was about 1400 feet off the ground when I first noticed it dropping into the top of my front window's field of view.  It was traveling at a very steep angle of attack ( it was diving towards the ground ) and diving at about a 45 degree angle downwards to the right.  It appeared to be dropping sideways to me, not coming towards or away from me but perpendicular to my perspective. The light was traveling at an extremely fast rate of speed when we say it, It was traveling much much faster then even a commercial jet diving at full speed .  We lost sight of the object at about 200-300 feet off the ground or so as it disappeared behind a small rise of trees off to our right side of the freeway so we did not get to see how it bottomed out of it's trajectory.  It was traveling far too fast to ""Pull Up"" from the dive.    As we made the gradual turn around the bend of the freeway  8 seconds later and the horizon was revealed to us on the now slightly elevated portion of the freeway we expected to see a fire ball or smoke where the object must have impacted but there was nothing to see.  The total elapsed time of the streaking object must have been only 2.5 seconds total. (From about 1,400 feet elevation down to 200 feet elevation in 2.5 seconds is fast )   The object looked like a jets landing lights when they are facing you.  Overly bright and it had an additional blue light on top and green accent light on the bottom, but all the time it was overly bright and cool white light looking.  We also observed that it was not a warm light like a streaking meteor, or something burning up in the atmosphere, and there was no contrail  or derbies field in its wake, just a overly bright cool point of light in 3 colors.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,,

2 possible UFO's that may have been seen by other aircraft,Brick Twp.,NJ,2012-07-21T21:13:00,unknown,2½--3 minutes,"Occurred : 7/21/2012 21:13  (Entered as : 07/21/12 21:13) Reported: 7/23/2012 9:51:55 AM 09:51 Posted: 8/5/2012 Location: Brick Twp., NJ Shape: Unknown Duration:2½--3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91118.html,"2 possible UFO's that may have been seen by other aircraft On saturday night 7/21/2012 sitting in the parking lot of a boat marina in Brick, NJ, me and my aunt saw what we thought may have been 2 UFO's in an east direction of the NJ coast that would have been near Mantaloking.  If NUFORC wants I can provide the name of the marina and the GPS coordinates of my exact location where I was but I will not put it on the internet report because it may be considered personal info. It was 2 red flickering lights that at first appeared to be propeller driven plane tilting to it's right in order to go north. Both red lights which looked at first like they could be at the ends of of fixed wings rotated from being side by side 45 degrees counterclockwise from where I could see (I was facing east) till one was on top and the other light on bottom. Then both lights began moving to my right (south) the top one on a slightly upward angle and the bottom one on a slightly downward angle until both faded off making it appear as if the 2 objects were going southeast. I know this may not make the story seem encouraging or credible but although there were 80 to 100 people that saturday night at the picnic no one cared what was out there, they were much too occupied with the partying, the music, and so on.  Therefore me and my aunt are the only real witnesses at the marina.  The night sky conditions were almost 100% clear except for a very faded cloud directly above.  There was one clearly identifiable plane flying north in the opposite direction in between the objects,  The only possible rational explanation could be helicopters but they were both all flickering red, conventional aircraft will have clearly identifiable timed flashes of light with green on one side and red on the other.  Therefore if they were UFO's somebody else may very well have seen them.   As soon as they were gone I looked at the clock on my cell phone it was 9:13 P.M.  Duration of the entire sighting was 2½-3 minutes  I called the Sandy Hook, NJ U.S. Coast Guard, asking if anyone else called them reporting something in that area and time and they say said they couln't give out such information and forwarded me to their New York installation. USCG New York said they have no reports in that area and time.  There's no way it could have been celestial bodies.  Meteors or falling space junk would not move independantly like that.  There were other aircraft out there before during and after so chances are if they were UFO's there may be other witnesses.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

As viewed by the observer looking straight up (0 degrees) relative to the eastern horizon (90 degrees) each light appeared to fade/get smaller at about 20 degrees, and then was no longer visible.  Each appeared to be climbing. The first two lights appeared individually, one after another. This was followed by a formation of 4 lights and the formation changed. A second formation of 4 lights followed the first. After the formations disappeared 3 more lights in succession appeared and disappeared. Except for the reformation described above all lights behaved the same and disappeared when they reached the same part of the sky. None of us could say how fast they were traveling but it appeared to be about 2 minutes for an individual light to rise from the west and disappear (we did not think to time them). All lights were the same color (an orange color very similar to sodium vapor street lights). All agreed that the lights appeared to flicker (like a candle flame) as they journeyed across the sky. None of us were able to identify any sounds that we could associate with these lights. Travis AFB is 9 miles from our location and there are usually flights in the air.  None were observed during the period we are reporting. Nut Tree Airport is 5 miles from our location.  One small aircraft was observed in the air during this incident.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,38.377459375,-121.9954875

We were just about to pass the exit for Claremore when out of no where, a bright light appeared in the sky.  It was almost dusk at that moment and the sky was a dim bluish- grey with pink outlining the hillside.  The light seemed to have the sun reflecting off of it and it appeared to be a thick vertical line.   At first, we thought it might be a jet leaving a trail of smoke behind it, but as we watched it closer it didn’t appear to be moving at all.  The line of light would become longer, then it would shrink back and become a sphere of light.   At this point it did not appear to be moving, but rather hovering in one place in the sky. To the left of it we could see a regular airplane flying towards it.  It had a long line of smoke behind it and it was not as bright as the unidentified object. The bright light than began ascending straight up into the sky very slowly! as the plane grew closer.   My husband and I held our breath because from our view, it looked as though they were going to collide.  Right before the airplane reached this object, it sped up in the sky.  It was going straight vertical.  When it moved up, there were two short smoke trails behind it.  You could actually see the smoke moving and billowing behind it.   The closer we got, we saw that there were flashing lights at the top of this object.  It continued vertical and continued to have a light aura all around it.  The light seemed to be vaguely changing colors.  We got to a point where we were completely underneath it, and my husband had to look straight up through the windshield to see it as it was over our car roof.  He explained it to look like a ball of red with smoke trails and flashing lights.  After this one last look, it was too high in the atmosphere to see anymore.   We continued driving and about two minutes later, we saw a black military plane flying lower in the sky.   At this time, we also encountered four small uncontrolled fires.

The distance to the objects was hard to judge but I would guess they were about one to one and one-half miles away.  At first, I only saw one object (which is what caught my eye) and I thought it was our local air ambulance.  That gives an idea of the elevation and speed of the object, not particularly fast or high above the ground.  I then saw the other four objects.  All five were moving together but not in formation.  Their position changed relative to each other, but they were grouped fairly close to each other (visually, never more than probably five degrees apart).   I called my wife to the room to show her what I was seeing.  We went out to our deck.  By this time the object had quit moving.  There was no sound that we could hear.   We observed them for several minutes.

I was driving to my friend’s house from the store at 10pm on January 6th, 2013.  I was on my way to go have a relaxing night watching movies with my friend until I noticed something unusual in the sky. I saw an orange glow in the sky that was definitely not a street light because of its height in the sky.  I was facing southwest when I noticed the stagnant glow the size of a small pill in the sky.  I was watching it for a minute debating what it could be; a fire, an airplane, a helicopter, or maybe even a star I’ve never noticed before.  I decided to take a picture and a video on my cell phone because of how unusual it was.  As soon as I began taking the video the glow began to move south and started to blink.  The blinking consisted of organge, red, and white colors.  Since this was on Cape Cod it should be known that I was basically at sea level, if not only a couple feet above sea level. At this point, what I had figured was an airplane now had started blinking.  I tried to reassure myself that the reason for the glow being completely still was that it could have been flying towards me.  Eventually it moved towards me and was soon almost completely overhead when I noticed how low to the ground it was.  I have never seen any aircraft, especially at night, flying this low. It was probably about 10-15 stories high, I would guess.  I then noticed that it was oval in shape with lights on the top and bottom and a band of white light wrapping around the craft.  Perhaps this was another light or possibly a window, that I am not sure.  At this point it was roughly the size of a penny or dime. I called my friend I was visiting to tell her what I saw when the craft took off in almost one second into the northeast into the next town.  I told her I was going to follow it so I did with no luck.  I turned around to go back to Hyannis when I noticed that same orange glow sitting in the sky in the same area I had seen earlier.  I called my friend back to let her know it was back so she could go outside to see it.  The only problem was that she could not hear me at all over the phone.  I could hear her perfectly but she barely had any idea what I was saying.  When I got to her house she said not only was the call cutting out but there was an odd electrical whining type noise in the background. My friend got into my car and we drove to the same parking lot across the street to look at this strange sight.  When I started taking a video again the craft repeated the same path it did earlier eventually taking off into the northeast.  I once again tried following it but this time it was completely gone.  The video I took with my friend was the best video by far as it show the erratic movements of the craft in the sky.  Unfortunately the cell phone did not pick up the actual ship but it did pick up the blinking so the path of the craft is clear.  It should be noted that there was no sound at all when the craft was in sight.  My friend and I decided to go back to her house and give up on this UFO hunt. The next day I went to work excited to show some of my coworkers the footage I taped.  When I asked my manager if he believe in UFOs, he showed me something odd that in turn made me write this repot. Apparently on the Cape Cod Times Online blogs someone written an article about how in 1971, to almost the exact date, two boys saw an orange glowing UFO in Hyannis and Dennis.  I found it too coincidental that almost 40 years to the date this happened again.  I would like to point out that I do live near Otis Air Force Base so it should be noted that it may be either out of this world or possibly a military craft.  I would also like to add that the media I have of this incident will be sent separate since I have yet to upload them online.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,41.6529,-70.2828

I was walking on the campus of the University of North Texas, and as I made the corner around a building and turned due north, I saw 5 glowing, fiery, orange lights in the sky.  I don't know how far away they were or how high they were as I couldn't make out exactly what they were and therefore couldn't judge depth at all, but the angle between me and where the objects were was under 45 degrees, probably around 30 degrees.  To clarify, I was looking at the objects through telephone wires that were across the street from me, probably 30-50 feet away. I instinctively took out my phone to record a video, but unfortunately the video shows absolutely nothing.  I stopped filming after 9 seconds of video because I realized that it wasn't working properly, and as I did so the lights had already started fading.  The entire ordeal lasted probably about 15 seconds, and within 2-3 seconds after I stopped filming, all of the lights had entirely disappeared. So to quickly summarize without unnecessary detail, there were 5 orange, fiery, glowing lights slowly moving in the sky. They were due north of the UNT campus and were drifting downwards in the sky, so I'm assuming they were moving north (or falling, I guess). Some were brighter than others, but all 5 were much, much brighter than any star. Their formation didn't necessarily look organized, but it didn't exactly look scattered either, and their movements were virtually uniform. Over the course of 15 seconds, the lights faded and ceased one by one. There is a lot of light pollution on campus, and that is why this was so startling to me at first. You could probably count the number of stars you could see from where I was on two hands because of the light pollution. If you were to look at the UNT campus map, I was walking between the Auditorium Building and Hickory Hall towards W Hickory Street, and was probably 10-15 feet in front of the Auditorium Building when I saw the UFO.  Hickory is a busy street but there was absolutely nothing that could have caused what I saw from the streets, nor from anywhere else in my surrounding environment. The only logical explanations I could come up with, outside of extraterrestrial-related things of course, are that it could have been a flare gun that I caught right as it was dissipating (which, to be frank, I do not know if that is actually a feasible explanation or not based on what I saw because I have no experience with flare guns), or that it could have been the remnants of a broken up meteorite that were burning up slowly in the atmosphere, but my issue with that theory is that they were seemingly way too bright to be that, however again, I do not know the exact details of how that looks so I can't be sure. Ultimately, I have no explanation at the moment for what I saw. And that is both amazing and frightening.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,33.19502279411765,-97.11429981617647

Then we realized that it was not two airplanes but was one extremely big round machine with white lights on opposite sides.

The sighting I described has occurred in the same general vicinity over the last three nights and has been consistent in the time that it appears as well as the directions it takes.  I first sighted this object at approximately 8:15p.m. on the night of December 13.  At first it seemed to be just another satellite as it moved through the stars.  As I followed this object I noticed it seemed to speed up then slow down.  That in itself seeming to be strange so I decided to watch it more carefully.  It was then that I was surprised to see this object slow down then come to a complete stop.  Now it had my full attention.  As I watched it further it continued to hover for approximately thirty seconds then continued on it’s path, west to east.  It continued in a straight line for another few seconds and then made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the south.  Not just a curving turn but a sharp, almost instantaneous left turn.  It then continued on this track but started a circling pattern south to east, east to north, north to west. That circular pattern, in my estimation, would have cover hundreds of miles of space.  It continued this pattern for about five to seven minutes and then abruptly shot toward the eastern horizon and disappeared.  The speeds of this object differed from very slow, barely moving to covering vast amount of space in seconds.  The following evening at about the same time (8-8:15) I was out watching for satellites and low and behold there it was again.  Same pattern, same various speeds, same sharp turn.  This continued for the next two nights so I decided to call and report this strange phenomenon.

On Thursday, December 06, 2012 my husband and I were on our way home from work and stopped in the Whitney Ranch area to pick up my niece.  While we were waiting (at around 5:30 pm) my husband noticed something strange in the night sky almost directly above us.  The object had been travelling rather fast from South to North when it came to a stop and hovered. This was the Southeast area of the Las Vegas valley.  This area happens to lie directly in the flight path to McCarran airport so it’s not unusual to see aircraft.  The object appeared to be a round sphere, glowing with pulsating red light.  By the way it stopped and hovered we first thought it might be a helicopter at high altitude but it didn’t have the normal lights you’d expect to see on any known aircraft.  It simply pulsated a glowing red light.  At one point, the pulse was rather large and shortly after that there seemed to be a white halo above it for a brief moment.  Immediately following this t! he object seemed to fly straight up very quickly.  The light seemed to become more and more distant and turned a dim white color and we assumed it was heading straight up to a much higher altitude.  This assumption proved incorrect however as we began driving (watching it through the sunroof) my fist impression was that it was taking off at a high speed.  Then I realized it only seemed to be moving because we were moving.  As we made turns through the neighborhood this continued which confirmed that it could not possibly be at the high altitude we thought it had climbed to.  The light had become very faint and it was hardly discernible amid the stars, but as we traveled the stars seemed to stay stationary while this object was obviously very close to us in relation.  It was higher than the incoming airplanes but I cannot judge the altitude.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,36.026650762829405,-115.0438399445215

When we reached the football field, normally a great place to see the stars, we noticed a very bright light towards the east and just below Jupiter.  Within a few seconds, we both heard rotor chop and realized it was just a helicopter flying in our general direction. A few moments later, and in the same general direction, we saw a meteor streak vertically downwards across the sky and burn up perhaps 10 degrees above the horizon.  As my son and I both commented on how “cool” of a sight that was, we both noticed a fuzzy patch of light above orion’s belt and just behind where the helicopter was and meteor trail had been.  This fuzzy patch grew larger until we realized it was a boomerang or chevron-shaped object moving faster and higher than the helicopter.  As it flew directly over us I noted it made no sound, had numerous equally-spaced fuzzy lights that looked like streams of whitish plasma on it front wing tips, and spanned about 5-6° of angular separation from wing-tip to wing-tip.  It moved from east to west, directly over us, and as it passed the lights on one side looked like they moved around or wavered underneath.  My son said it best in that one side appeared to “morph” into a different shape.  All I can think of is that somehow t! his thing was refracting light like crazy in order to change shape like that. The size was impossible to determine, as I didn’t know its elevation.  It was, however, low enough (or big enough) to block out the stars behind it.  As it faded into the west, my son was both exited and scared that it might come back.  We continued on to the concert. I teach high school science (including astronomy) and am very familiar with the local skies in this area.  This was not a jet, blimp, or anything else normal.

Suddenly I noticed a light moving across the sky from high above, proceeding north to the horizon. It appeared to be very high in altitude and moving too rapidly for a conventional aircraft. The speed, however, was far too slow to be a meteor. We are familiar with aircraft as they are constantly descending into Newark and other New York airports.  The luminosity was that of an average to slightly below average star.  I observed it with the binoculars and there were no lights….just the “star” appearance. A s I watched it, it suddenly stopped!  Among the stars this was easy to see.  It then proceeded forward…..zigged and zagged.

As our vehicle got further from the city, the treeline allowed us to see what was previously obscured: two sets of what appeared to be TRIANGULAR LIGHTS. The two sets of lights were EAST from our location. We were very confused and fascinated at first, uncertain of what we were seeing. My companioned asked, ""Are those stars?"" But I had mistaken them as lights of communication towers. However, we quickly both understood neither was correct, as:  -We were unable to see any stars due to light pollution from being near the city. -There are no communication towers in that specific spot or at that specific elevation. -The set of lights nearest to us were found to be slowly moving.  There were two triangles, very large and very peculiar ih their shape and position in the sky. It was enough that we immediately knew we were not witnessing something normal. We have traversed Route 6 many times at night and never have seen these before. Both sets had three individual lights which flickered or twinkled like fire or a very bright star. The color of the lights was ORANGE-RED. We pulled over on the side of Route 6 and turned off our lights to get a better view after approximately two minutes of witnessing the phenomenon.  By this point, the lights furthest from us (Figure B in my illustration) were either too distant/sunken behind the tree line to see, or had very peculiarly suddenly disappeared. Either way, we were unable to see Figure B any longer. Figure A (the nearer set), was drifting very slowly toward our location. NO SOUND was issued from the lights. I strained to see any more details, but was unable to. I was unable to see any visible lines or structure of any kind between or connecting the lights. I was unable to determine the make or nature of the lights, other than that they resembled fire of some kind, orange and flickering.  Unfortunely, I am not equipped to determine how high the lights were, but am able to say they were below a thin and scattered/spotty cloud cover.  One by one, they began to slowly fade. First the light nearest us, and then the two behind at the further end of the triangle. The lights dimmed very slowly and then went completely dark. We were unable to see anything again after that, and after waiting for a moment, once more turned on the vehicle's lights and resumed our drive.  I distinctly recall seeing a program on television a year before about triangular sets of lights a few years back in Tinsley Park, which is a few hours from this location. From the amateur footage and photographs I saw on the television, these lights matched them very well. I wanted to obtain a photograph or video footage as proof of the objects, but the triangles' lights were not bright nor large enough for my phone to be able to capture among the surrounding darkness.  No visible moon was present at the time.  After pulling alongside the road, the remaining lights were visible for approximately 2-3 more minutes, making the total window of visibility at approximately 4-5 minutes.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,40.73239708939709,-89.61464490644491

The only difference being when it reached the horizon it winked out of sight instantly. 2 minutes later I decided to walk out onto out deck and I noticed a bright light heading toward my position.  As I watched it approach I began filming it with my cell phone.  It was far below the orbits of any satellite, and as it grew closer the light grew brighter in intensit. We are less than a mile from the Augusta airport and there were planes doing instrument takeoffs at the time. There were no strobes or usual aircraft lights on this object. There was no sound as it passed over head and headed Northeast. I am familiar with every form of conventional aircraft having grown up an air show kid and I keep up to date on military and civilian craft that operate I this area.  The crazy thing about this is the next day two of my students who were in Winslow Maine! , which is 15 miles north northeast of Augusta told me they were outside at about 10:00 and an object passed overhead, spun around and took off.I know these kids and they wouldn't make this up. They couldn't believe what they were seeing. I also have two videos of the object. In one video you can clearly see the object as it passes. An early video I took as it first appeared shows the object winking in and out as it slowly moves across the sky. The strange thing Is as I recorded that I watched the object as it crossed the sky and I never lost sight of it. It did not wink in and out of sight. I don't know if it is because the quality of the camera or if it was due to some type of electrical interference.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,44.403367567567564,-69.75762072072071

I was in my home working on the computer when I heard several sirens coming down the street 1 block north of the house. I went outside to see where they were going and saw 2 fire trucks race past. As I was looking in that direction (north) I saw a bright orange ball about 1/2 mile away with the port and starboard edges appearing to be brighter than the center. I thought it was a little lower than an aircraft should be over town so i ran about 30 ft to my car to retrieve my 7x50 binoculars, as I had been using them earlier to observe boats on the local lake. What i thought was an orange ball was actually 3 glowing orange balls in a triangle shape (2 in front, 1 in the rear) on the bottom of a light colored (silvery) disk shaped craft.  The whole thing was surrounded by a very bright orange halo like a round ball. It was flying due south, about the speed of a normal small plane at about 1000 ft altitude, and flew diectly over me and made absolutly no sound. I estimate it was about 40 or 50 ft in diameter.  It flew about 1/2 mile past sraight and level then began climing at about a 30 degree angle without increasing speed. As it climbed it slowly faded in brightness until I could no longer see it with the binoculars. About 2 minutes later, a helicoter came from north, north/west and flew exactly in the direction of the craft at about the same altitude and speed. I couldn't make out if the helicopter was military or civilian, I will say that helicopters fly in and out of the local prison (1 mile away) and the local hospital (2 miles away) so this may have been unrelated to the craft.  As it was flying a perfect intercept course this would have been quite the coincidence. I wish to remain completely anoymous as there's nothing more I can tell you that isn't contained in this report, except to say that the local prison seems to be a magnet for these things. (Yes, I've seen them before.  They like to hover over the old State Home Cemetery about 200 yds off the east parimeter of the prison at about 1000 ft altitude).

I have seen many meteors, fireballs, aircraft in my 56 years, but have never seen what I would call a UFO until tonight. I am a high school teacher. 5 of us were sitting in my friend's (a middle school teacher) back yard around a small gas, fire pit from 9:00PM pacific time until about 11:00PM.  I looked up at the sky (clear, star filled- the moon had just gone down) and noticed what looked like a dark, winged object floating by low in the horizon, but just above the backyard trees. At first I thought it was large bird, like an owl (we have white owls that I've seen at night many times) but quickly realized it was much too big (and too dark) to be an owl or even a large hawk. It took about a second to realize what the scale of it was and to notice dim but numerous lights all along the wings.  The wings appeared to be curling, or slightly flapping but seemed obvious that it was mechanical now. I pointed and said ""Look at the UFO.""  Everyone turned to look and were all amazed at what we saw. I got up to see it a few more seconds before it disapeared.  3 of the others saw it and the one who had his back to it and was a little more behind the tree didn't. I probably saw it for 7 or 8 seconds. The others for 3 or 4 seconds. It didn't seem to be traveling extremely fast (unless it was high), but the angle of view and the trees eventually obscured it.  But it actually seemed to just disapear to me. It was traveling close to due north, maybe slightly west as well. It was hard to get a scale on it. If I had to guess, I'd say it was about the size of a B-2 bomber or up to a B-52 bomber with swept back wings.  I only saw wings, nothing sticking out the front or back. The wife of the other teacher (she works for a car dealership) said it looked like a dragon from Harry Potter with no head or tail. Most of us thought we saw the wings moving.  But the soft, diffused lighting on it (small spots of diffused lights, mostly on the edges of the wings) definitely showed it to be mechanical. It was completely silent.  That was an eerie part to all of us. It was either large airplane size, and about one or two thousand feet up, or gigantic, and far away.

When I first saw this bright light a few weeks ago I was amazed which compelled me to file a report. I also showed my mom as soon as I got home.  This time I was dropping a couple of my buddies off when something just randomly compelled me to look up at the sky (which isn’t unusual I often look up at the sky trying to find something out of the ordinary).  The very first thing I looked at was what I thought to be a star…but then it disappeared out of sight as soon as I acknowledged it was there. I freaked out and my buddies thought I was going to run off the road but when I told them what I saw they thought I only saw an airplane or helicopter.  I pointed to where I saw it and there it was bright as day, far away though, they both watched it for about 30 seconds and it disappeared again.  The expressions and faces they made…priceless.  They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.  For me it was still exciting to say the least but it was the second time I’ve seen this so I was just relieved they had finally seen it too. Anyway this light stays in the same spot and doesn’t move.  It was actually not far at all from the spot I saw it last time, might have been the same place.  All I know is that it couldn’t have been a hovering helicopter, it was beyond the clouds. It couldn’t have been an airplane, it was stationary. It couldn’t have been a star, it disappeared and reappeared from sight. It couldn’t have been a satellite, or anything else I can logically think of except either a space craft of some sort or some type of energy in the sky….who knows? Someone or should I say some people know exactly what it is. Who knows maybe it could have been a space craft outside or inside our atmosphere and either was or was trying to communicate with someone or some people.

I am a 27 year old man and this is my first time posting anything like this, I hope that someone else saw this to, and if not this exact event possibly something similar.  Here is a detailed account of what me and my 68 year old mother saw on October 17th 2012. I opened my front door to take my trash out at about 11:05 pm est and I saw what at first looked like a small,  very tight circle of 8 to 12 extremely bright, white, stationary stars due west of my location in Dunedin, Florida.  There seems to be 3-4 prominent lights that are much brighter then the others, then 7-8 or more smaller lights beaming out in all different directions.  I just stared at the cluster unable to look away for about 2 minutes.  I then began to notice a blurred halo/aura effect around the perimeter of the cluster.  At that point I yelled across the house for my Mother to come look and verify that she was seeing what I was seeing, and to bring me my digital camera. She was shocked when she saw the tight cluster of lights and started asking me what could possibly be making such a bright circle of dots in the sky, stating ""it looked like a cluster of stars exploding"".  By this time it started to resemble an explosion in space to me as well, like there had been a central object and all the lights were shooting out slowly in all different directions from a central point and then just stopped in place.  Then the area in the center of the cluster of lights which had been dark, suddenly had several smaller lights appear and begin to twinkle and blink in and out in different areas in the center of the cluster.  I took my digital Sony Cyber-Shot 2.0 mega pixel camera and attempted to take some pictures, but as soon as I would turn it on it would blink low battery and turn off.  I had brand new batteries in my camera so I have no explanation for this.  I then took some batteries out of a remote control and tried again and I got the same res! ult. It was at this time some clouds moved out of the way to the south of the first circle of lights and a second circle became visible, although this circle was much dimmer then the first one.  Both circles seem to be remaining stationary as far as their position in the sky, while the lights in the center of the circles continued to twinkle/sparkle and change location inside the cluster.  I have never seen anything even close to this in my whole life, and neither had my Mother who is 68 years old. I immediately started searching online to see if their was any celestial events visible from my location, and there was nothing listed for 10/17/12 at all.  I then began a search to try and identify what I was seeing and I couldn't find anything even close.  My search is what finally led me to this site, where I figured if I couldn't identify the cluster of lights in the sky I could at least share my experience with others, and maybe someone else had seen the same thing and could confirm it.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,28.028590588235296,-82.76900117647058

Someone out there has the answers but I doubt I will find out in my lifetime.  Maybe I don't want to know.  I'm jaded with the whole subject due to the misinformation and lies. We know something is going on but no one is ready to man up with the answers.,2012-10-30T00:00:00,33.9597712,-81.25034

Due to recent numerous similar events, I was convinced the object was far from any flight capable object I had ever seen.  When the object changed course west, it stopped near a star and the star began glowing brighter as did the flying object.  The object flew east at incredible speed, immediatly stopped, and flew upwards towards space in a similar fashion as a rocket ship, directly upwards.  As it was on its path towards space , the clouds behind it became thicker and formed behind the object, covering any way to continue viewing it.  Throughout it's flight patterns, it consistently flew behind clouds near the shining star.

Hello, I made an observation yesterday that I wonder if anyone can help me to identify.  I am in Alaska; I drove up a logging road to find a place where I could do some Astrophotography.  I chose a spot where there was very little light pollution and a low tree line and favorable foreground scene. After setting up my tripod and camera I chose my composition of the Milky Way galaxy flowing across the sky and into the planet Venus which was bright in the Western Sky.  With my camera positioned in this direction I began taking my series of shots, five sets of 25 second exposure.  While waiting for my intervolometer to cycle through the series of shots I began to look around for a different perspective to shoot next.  This is when I made the sighting. The sighting was four lights spread apart like the corners of a box, each light exactly the same distance from each other as you travel clockwise around the box.  I used my fist extended at arm’s reach to measure them and my fist fit perfectly between each of the pairs of stars horizontally and vertically. What initially caught my eye was that each light was like the beacon of a light house revolving around in a beam.  I could see the beam revolve growing longer as it approached the point of direct opposition from its center to my right then shrinking as it came to the position when it was nearly pointing directly towards me then again growing as it continued to rotate to its right angle on my left and again shrinking until it was a pin point as the light was pointing directly away from me.  Also it was brightest (like a flash) when directly point at me. Now this alone would be odd but add in the fact that as each light beginning in the top right corner made a complete cycle it would go dark and the next in a clockwise direction would begin a cycle commencing at the same point the previous light has stopped. So you have four lights acting like lighthouse beacons rotating in turn, clockwise in a square formation.  Additionally I observed them for two hours while I continued to take series of photos for my astrophotography practice; while the stars changed position relative to me, due to the revolving of the Earth these four beacons remained geostationary and in the exact formation the entire time. And yes I did take multiple photos of these lights I do not have a video and all the shots just show points of light not the beacons my human eyes observed. Any Idea what I saw, possibly satellites, space station or what?   The time was between 10 and 12pm Alaska Standard Time on November 9th, 2012.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,55.58700689655172,-131.59129655172416

I quickly realized the light that looked like a star was moving at a steady, fairly brisk speed, heading south to north. I first thought it must be an airliner, as it seemed high enough and fast enough that it couldn’t be a small plane.  It was only a steady white light, looking much like a star.

I have lived on the coast and seen lightning offshore but the tops of thunderheads are usually visible during lighting and never ever anything this bright.   I contacted a local news station in Seattle and asked them if they could look at the radar records and determine if thunderstorms were off the coast that early morning but they are not responding of checking this out.

My boyfriend and I were walking back from a friend’s house early Sunday morning around 3:00 am.  The night sky was very visible with only a few scattered clouds.  It was not until we were about two blocks from our apartment when I looked up at the Eastern horizon and notices a star that was extremely bright and much larger than any other star I had ever seen.  It was located beneath the stars, not in any constellation.  Its brightness was about 4 times a bright as all of the other stars as well as 4 times bigger.   At first we thought we were witnessing a Super Nova of some kind but soon realized that that was not the case. We had stopped to watch and admire this possible Super Nova when all of a sudden the object (star) Shifted, moved to the left.  It was at this time that we realized this was NOT a super nova.  We continued to watch the object as we ran back the rest of the two blocks.  When we returned home we woke up the others in the house and all climbed up on the roof of our apartment to watch what was going on.  It was also then that we noticed the other three, slightly less bright, objects moving in the sky. Each of the four objects followed the same movement patters:   The object would be completely stationary for a few min. and then move slowly to the left or right. Hover there for a few min. and the begin almost bouncing back and forth, Left and right, before it stopped and hovered stationary again. After it completed both the movements described above, it would then begin to spin. You could tell this due to the way the light was moving. All of these movements were repeated over and over in the same order for about 3 hours -	They did not stay in any specific formation, almost like they were individually surveying the land  The description of what the objects looked like: -	The brightness of each object was not the same; this was due to them being at different distances from my roof top. One would grow brighter as it moved towards my location, while others would get dimmer -	The objects would go from dim to very bright in only a few seconds. I took photographs on my phone of the objects and when zoomed in, looks like they are simply white spherical Balls  I continued to watch this phenomenon for the entirety of its performance. After three hours of watching their actions the sun began to rise. As the sun began to peak over the horizon, the objects slowly began to move out of the atmosphere. However, two stayed behind for a very long time. I watched as one took about 15 min. to move up and up out of visible view. The last one followed shortly after the sun had completely come above the horizon. The entire three hours I was not sure whether to be terrified, amazed, or excited. I was trembling the entire time. A little background on myself:  Born and Raised in Kansas City, I moved out to Boulder only this past January after finishing by Business Management Degree at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland OH. I am of very sound mind and have steady employment here in Boulder, CO. I am positive that this was not a natural phenomenon.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

The star wasn't out there earlier on in the night, but he told me it would pop up around 4am. I went out with him, and sure enough it was there. It was very bright and low in the sky...looks like a planet. I don't know if that part is relevant though to our sighting. I looked to the north because I saw a flashing light out of my peripheral.  I thought at first it was an airplane form the flashing lights.  I had my husband look, and we noticed that it wasn't moving. Then I noticed it had more than just blue, red, and white lights, some were green and orange.  It seemed that it was moving towards us after watching and then as it became closer, we noticed that it would move a little bit. It would dart from side to side randomly, in a really fast manner. I  looked back to the west where the star was, and saw another that had popped up.  This one looked like it was about the same distance away, but lower, so I think it was actually closer because my camera wouldn't pick up the first one and it would this one.  This is when I grabbed my laptop to take a video.  Then after videotaping them for about 12 minutes we went inside to grab our phone and take pictures on their as well, and my husband was looking for his looking glass.  I was also just freaked! out and starting to get really frightened and wanted to go inside.  When we came back out about 2-3 minutes later, a huge, bright, white star-like object had appeared south of the original star and just a bit to the left of it.  The 2nd UFO was flying to the right between both of the them, all of them making a triangle shape. The bright light really scared me because it was so low in the sky and looked so close. It wasn't blinking, but rather really bright and big and looked like a star. What was the scariest is that it hadn't been there before. We watched the two UFO's and the star-like object for another hour and a half. During this time another UFO popped up, coming from far away in the north(just right of the first UFO), looking like it was heading east towards the second UFO and surrounding star and star-like object. Then another popped up below the first sighted UFO, and it was coming from far away as well. It didn't look like it was heading anywhere to the right or le! ft, but just coming closer towards us. All in all, this experi! ence sca red me really bad. I've never believed in stuff like this before, and I don't want to believe it. Maybe what I saw can be explained, but I don't know what to believe anymore. This was a wake up call to me I think. If you think about it, you hear this all the time, but you blow it off as a crazy person. It is reported all too often to their not be some truth to the matter, and that is what scares me the most.  We also heard a strange noise in the middle of our sighting. It sounded kind of like a gun shot or a crash. Their were many trains going by while it happened and so i couldn't hear much ohther than that. I thought I heard an aircraft kind of noise, like a whooshing noise at one time,as well(around the time the star-like object appeared. I don't know if this is relevant, but thought I would add it just in case. Additionally, the objects were far away, maybe miles. The bright star looked very close though, and was very, very low towards the ground. Every once in a while it seemed like it would pulse. I don't know if that was just a trick of the eye though.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,34.188935384615384,-97.15978615384617

Weird loud engine noise flying over my house sounded like a slow garbage disposal,Sedona,AZ,2013-01-07T04:30:00,unknown,10 minutes,"Occurred : 1/7/2013 04:30  (Entered as : 01/07/13 04:30) Reported: 1/7/2013 6:00:24 AM 06:00 Posted: 2/4/2013 Location: Sedona, AZ Shape: Unknown Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95858.html,"Weird loud engine noise flying over my house sounded like a slow garbage disposal Around 4:30 a.m. today, I was inside my house and heard an extremely load engine sound flying over my house.  It sounded a little bit like a plane, but much much louder. It sounded more like a garbage disposal in slow motion flying overhead.  Very eerie.  It was something flying over my house and although not 100 feet above, still very low flying. It came from the direction of the airport and was passing overhead.  This engine noise I heard was in the sky.  It flew over my house and overhead in my general vicinity for a bit. I grew up living near an airport for many years and know the different sorts of sounds airplanes and helicopters make, including when there is engine trouble. I know what the sound a military helicopter and jet sounds like, and today the sound I heard was not anything I have heard before and it stayed in the area around my house flying in a strange pattern.  This sound stayed overhead in my neighborhood after it continued away from my house. It is freezing outside and I was cold in my house...no heat on in the rest of the house, except in my bedroom. I did not know where my coat was and had to stay inside.  If I hear this again, will be ready to go outside and look!!! If it is daylight, I will get a picture too!  It went back and forth over my house area in the sky for about 10 or 15 minutes.  I could hear it very very loud flying over my house and nearby.  The noise was not so loud after 10 or 15 minutes or so, but I could STILL hear it flying loudly in the nearby neighborhood over the city.  I have heard the noise that sounds like an explosion here in Sedona about 5 or 6 months ago. I know of one other person who reported seeing and hearing what I am reporting today and the report is dated 12/20/12 on NUFORC.  This person reported seeing the craft, I only heard it.  BUT, I have heard a similar, non-airplane, sound about 2 months ago over my house and it went slow like a helicopter travels...this loud sound was very different-like a garbage disposal in slow motion and very very loud. I was in shock listening and was so cold..so, I did not go outside.  I know that there are people awake here at this hour and I hope someone reports this also.  One of my cats came over to me and sat up with a quizzical look on her face and she appeared to listen with me for as long as I heard this sound!  Sorry, no other witnesses, only my cat!!!  The last time I heard something similar to this sound flying overhead was in California where I grew up and it was about 12:30 at night.  When I went outside, I did hear the initial first loud sound I heard flying over my house for a few seconds, but after a few seconds it stopped.  I stood waiting and watching the sky over my house for about 10 minutes.  I then saw a light flying over the area near my house and it was moving very fast..about 5 minutes later, I saw two air force helicopters and they came flying toward my area very fast. The two military helicopters moved into a position where they were facing each other and turned lights on so light it was almost blinding (it was at midnight) and stayed in mid-air for about maybe 15 minutes in this position as if they had something between them they could see, but I could not.  The light I saw before they came flew toward the area the two helicopters were hovering over and before the helicopters arrived, the light disappeared.  The military helicopters are very very loud, however, the sound I heard today and the sound I heard then over my house was much much different.  I awakened a friend who lived 2 houses away and she witnessed seeing the helicopters come and get into the position I just described.  The military helicopters stayed in this same position for about 20 minutes or so.  The sounds of their engines were deafening.  I cannot believe anyone else in my neighborhood could sleep through this noise!!! My friend and I were the only ones who witnessed or! heard what I am reporting in California. I have seen other UFO craft when I was younger. I know what I heard flying over my house today is not an airplane or helicopter or anything that is explainable because of the weird loud sound it made.   The loud sound I heard this morning was very very loud and the closest description of the sound I can think of would be a grinding garbage disposal (in the sink-an insinkerator) in slow motion.    I hope somebody else heard and saw what I heard and reports it here.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,34.904693548387094,-111.89417096774194

Right as we reached the Woodmen exit I saw something out of the corner of my eye that attracted my attention.  My daughter was driving so i was able to stare at this until it disappeared.  Up and to the left of our car I saw a very fast moving bright green/yellow ball of light that had a green trail like a commit.  I’ve seen ""falling stars"" before and it looked a lot like that in that it got bigger and brighter until it ""disappeared"" only it was bright green and it wasn’t way up in the sky. It was very low.  I know this wasn’t an optical illusion because I could see the outline of the mountain and it was definitely below the mountain line, in front of the mountain, and was parallel to the freeway at that point. I immediately stared at it as it passed our car like we were standing still.  (we were traveling at about 75mph at the time).  It came down at about a 30° angle then it disappe! ared out of my view.  It looked to me like it would have been pretty much right above Falcon Stadium at the Air Force Academy when it ""disappeared.""  At that point I can’t tell if it landed or it actually disappeared... it was low enough at that point that it was behind trees & buildings and I just couldn’t see it anymore.  This thing was completely silent.   I’ll tell ya what, it freaked me out.  I’ve never seen anything like that before. I tried my best to recreate what I saw with a paintshop program.

I walk him outside to the sidewalk and right as I walk out, I observe how beautiful the stars are.  Right above me was the North Star and various other stars of which I don't have names for.  They were really glowing bright and I couldn't help but admire them for there hasn't been a clear night in awhile.  As I was digressing I couldn't help but notice a bright light in my peripheral vision at about  250 degrees west.  I immediately give the apparition my full attention and as quick as it manifested, it was gone in a blink.  What was amazing to me was that it almost looked like a shooting star.  I have seen many shooting stars before and I knew for a fact that it did not look like any shooting star I've seen before.  I've only seen shooting stars at the beach or through countryside drives; and may I remind you I live in the vast glowing city of LA where city lights would make it unlikely to see a shooting star. what I saw did not have a trail and disappeared abruptly. It did not burn out or fade away.  The best way I could describe it is that it was just as bright as the North Star and same shape, but was moving in a diagonal fashion downward towards the ground; just like a shooting star. 3:03 AM- As I was writing this, just a little less than two hours after the incident, there was a bright blue flash in the window. The flash was relatively similar to a blue lighting flash for it had illuminated the sky.  There is clear weather and little to no clouds.  I debunked the idea of it being a car because there were no driving cars on my st as this occurred.  Another hypothesis is it could've been a blown transformer, but I don't think this is what the light appeared like.  There was no sound.  May I remind you again, it is a clear night in the LA area.

Very soon (a couple of seconds later) the other two started moving right (South) and then they all kind of danced around each other slowly moving down, although the did make movements up. I was on the phone with my wife the whole time and it was a 3 minute phone call, so I figure about 2.5 minute duration.  They all did gradually move downward disappearing behind the ! treeline.  At one point they all dissappeared for a few seconds only to reapear.  I estimate they were between 1-2.5miles away.  Between the size of a star and and asprin at roughly 30 degrees from the horizon.  They all left small glittering trails but not flame like. When the last one moved behind the tree I did not see them again.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

On the evening of December 7th, 2012, I was traveling south on New Highway 61; the city in question was located to my right. I was not driving, so I was at liberty to observe the sky without distraction. The sky was cloudy, and above the lights of the city, the clouds appeared grey and luminescent. Above the city, I saw five lights, each a warm golden-orange color.  They looked like stars to me, both in height and magnitude; if the sky had been clear, I would have believed that they actually were stars, and I probably would’ve taken no notice.  The lights were initially stationary in the sky. As my vehicle approached and drove parallel to them, they hovered seemingly motionlessly. In relation to one another, they were positioned thusly: to the north, three lights were positioned in an obtuse triangle pattern, with the northernmost light acting as the obtuse vertex.  The other two lights were positioned farther to the south, with one higher in the sky and the other lower in the sky than the triangularly positioned lights. I watched them for as long as I could as my vehicle moved farther south, away from the sky lights and the city of Eldridge. At this point, I believe that I saw the southernmost lights move. The lower light appeared to ascend and approach the upper light.  The trees were obscuring my vision at this point, so I am less confident in this part of my account than the previous paragraphs. I believe that these lights were too high in the sky to have originated from any buildings in Eldridge, which is a relatively small town with no highrise buildings.  Also, I do not know of any terrestrial aircraft that have the ability to remain so still.

The object had a fire or glow to it with a tail pointing up and the object descended to the point just above or near the altitude of the incoming and outgoing planes at the airport.  The object then became stationary at that altitude and then proceeded to break up into 4 different objects.  Each of these 4 objects looked exactly alike.

It moves in a similar fashion to that of a kite.   For awhile we discussed as to whether or not some college kids had figured out how to add neon onto a kite, but there was little to no wind to support our kite theory.  The way it hovers and moves slowly and then can swoop around in an erratic fashion, it looks just like a kite on a good day at the beach.  This is the second time I've seen these lights.  Each time we feel we have been close to it yet there's no sound whatsoever.  The previous sighting was 2-4 weeks ago  in the south east por! tion of the sky on our drive home.  The road was tree lined and I noticed a neon green and neon blue light through the trees to the east.  I didn't say anything because I thought I was tired but the other cars in front of me started slowing down and it appeared that they had seen it as well.  When I finally said something to my fiance a neon green light came over the road ahead of us and went down below our line of sight on the opposite side.  The lights did not appear to be orbital in shape but linear.  They did not appear to leave a light trail and were moving in a downward swooping motion.

A friend pointed out an unidentified object flying overhead.  It was flying fairly high at a fast pace, from West to East.  The object was a dark gray, triangular shaped, with a white light in each of it’s corners, and about as large as a jet. It did not seem to be like a jet, nor did it make any sound. I watched as it disappeared into the night sky.  There were several planes flying that night, including advertising planes for the concert.  I do recall seeing the object after a plane flying by. In addition, I saw a fast moving white light that resembled a moving star, which I concluded as a satellite.

Per the request of the information, I saw some lights over Carrollton, Michigan, west of the Saginaw Bay on Saturday June 23 between 10-11 PM EST.   I was heading out to get some takeout at Taco Bell when I saw two lights in the sky.  I assumed they were two military helicopters with their spot lights on because of the formation they were in however I had my window down and there was no sound.  These lights were much larger than a star or planet however smaller than the moon.   They were in the Northeastern sky heading south.  After turning on a different street I lost sight of them however with such heavy cloud cover due to an approaching storm, I assumed they went into the clouds.   On my way home I noticed these lights again when I turned onto Michigan Avenue this time in the northwestern sky however these three lights were in a triangular shaped form or I should say they formed a triangle.  There were three separate lights though.   In the southwestern s! ky I started to see several single lights heading from the southwest towards the three triangular forming lights so they were heading northeast.   As I approached Church Street still heading south, I noticed that these lights were still there but this time I could see one over the treetops and it looked like a flickering flame in the shape of a ball.  I was say a red and yellow fireball with a yellow circular glow around it.  I saw several people watching these lights and taking pictures.   When I got home, I alerted my parents, and they came out with me to watch them now they were in the Northeastern and heading northeastern.   They formed a zigzagged line with the exception of three more created a triangular formation.  I checked the weather per the directions of the report and it stated that the winds were 10-15 MPH W/NW.

UFO Report Location: 3 miles east of Castle Rock, WA, approximately 1/4 mile from SR504 and 1000’ east of Si Town Road. Date and Time: November 10th, 2012, 18:28 Pacific Standard Time. Sky Condition:  No Ceiling, Clear Sky, Dark   Period of time observed:  From initial visual acquisition to their departure, approximately 1 minute. Description of Objects:  Three totally silent, solid, reddish orange glowing spheres forming an equilateral triangle.   Size: Each sphere approximately  the size of a dime held out at arm’s length. Event Description: At approximately 18:28 Pacific Standard Time on November 10th, 2012, I was driving Southbound on Si Town Road toward my home.  Three bright reddish orange spheres low to the ground initially caught my eye when I was approximately 1200 feet south of SR504 on Si Town Rd.  Seconds after my initial visual acquisition these objects were momentarily obscured by trees. When I re-acquired these objects about two seconds later I now had an unobstructed view of them.  They appeared to be hovering at this point at an altitude of 500 feet or perhaps less above ground level and about 1000 feet horizontally to the southeast of my location.  The ground level at this location is about 700 feet above sea level. The three objects were close enough to my car that I almost stopped my car as I actually feared that they might block the road, but they stayed hovering where they had been the whole time so I continued southbound on Si Town Rd.  They were totally silent.  They did not blink, rotate or change color.  They maintained a constant luminosity until the end of this event.  They were each very bright and each sphere was about as big around as a dime held at arm’s length. At this point I was not sure if I was observing one solid triangular craft with lights at each corner, or if I was observing three independent objects. As I turned east onto Ness Rd. and approached my house about 45 seconds after initially acquiring these objects they began to maneuver independently of each other, but still over the same location.  At this point they maneuvered into a straight line, equally spaced from each other and began to ascend.  I quickly pulled into my driveway with the car facing basically toward the objects.  At this point they all ascended vertically together with no horizontal travel noted.  One by one each object faded out and disappeared up into the darkness. At this point I was quite shaken. I ran out of my car and into the house to get my wife.  I grabbed my camera and tried to explain what had just happened to my wife, but there was no longer anything to see.  I called the Cowlitz County Sheriff’s Office and Castle Rock City Police Department 15 to 20 minutes after this event to inquire if anyone else had seen what I saw.  They both responded in the negative. Let me add that until retiring I was a commercial pilot and I still hold an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate. I’ve been flying since 1977.   As such I am quite used to identifying and looking at things in the sky.  The objects I observed tonight were NOT aircraft navigation lights, emergency lights, landing lights, helicopters, lighter-than-air craft, weather balloons, flares, Chinese lanterns, meteorological phenomena, satellites, swamp gas, or any other nonsense.  I know how non-aviation people can often misidentify things they see in the sky.  This was not the case tonight. These were real, solid objects and appeared to maneuver under intelligent control.   I’m still shaking from what I saw more than an hour and a half ago.

She was outside for about 3 mins and then she brought something to my attention.  She has a puzzled confused look on her face as she pointed up into the night sky and questioned what are those orange reddish glowing balls.  I then took a good look and came to a conclusion that they weren’t several things.  Such as candles, air planes, dragon fly’s.  I knew that they were something odd.  I had already had my camera with me at the time and I soon then called my parents out to determine what they were.  My dad gazed up into the sky to further examine what they were.  At the time all of this was taking place there was a sudden stop of air traffic.  I live right by an air port so planes are coming in and out at all hours.  I notice that there were only two dots side by side heading towards the clouds going east to west.  During this time I soon began to capture everything on camera because I knew you would ha! ve to see it to believe it.  And then a swarm of 5 or 6 followed it in the same path after it disappeared.  After that 1 more came right along in the same direction I closely examined it through my camera lens and I noticed that the orange light started to dim and right in the center was a orange reddish dot.  I took a closer look of the whole thing and I saw a clear  3D outline of what looked like the whole thing.  The best way I am can describe them is floating orange jelly fish.

It approached me at an altitude approximately the same as that of small aircraft, which were flying at the same time.  Its size was about twice that of a small airplane’s red light.  The Torrance airport is 2 miles north, (plus LAX is 15 miles north) and there are frequent landings/takeoffs, so I thought that it might just be another airplane.  Airplanes usually have white lights in addition to red ones, so I remarked that this object only had a red light.  I did not hear any unusual noises. This object was too bright to be a star or Mars.  It was dusk and there were no stars in the sky yet.  The light did not flash off and on.  It oscillated slightly in brightness in a pulsating fashion.  It did not twinkle like a star.  The light glowed and had a very faint circular haze around it.  It approached my position and flew roughly from east to west slowly, at about the same speed as small aircraft.  This object’s trajectory indicates that it was not a flare.  I saw it fly for about 3-4 minutes and then it stopped.  It remained stationary for about 30 seconds then the light slowly faded out and disappeared.  I did not see a structure in addition to the light. The most unusual part of my observation was the sudden fading out of the light.  If the light did not fade out I would have dismissed the light as an airplane.   I did not see any other observers near me.  This was the second UFO I have witnessed, both in the Los Angeles area.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

I spoke to my husband right away and we both went out to the front yard and stood there entranced.  We could not understand what these were as they were very silent. There was no aircraft noise at all.  The amazing thing was the objects kept coming from the south going east for about 10 minutes in time.  I did not count but I would estimate that there were at least 10 perhaps 12 in all.

After stopping and taking a closer look I noticed that the light was not moving, but hovering over the ridgeline of the Mission Mountain range.  The air was calm and quiet and I could not hear any noise coming from the orb.  Looking carefully I could make out red lights, but from far away, the bright light overpowered and masked the red lights.  After viewing this object for about 5-10 minutes, an air-raid siren sounded in the town of Ronan.  I noticed all types of emergency and police vehicles driving in various directions in the town.  I then got into my vehicle to see if I could find out more information about the siren.  I stopped by the nearest gas station and asked the attendant if he had any information in regards to the air-raid siren, or the strange orb I had seen in the sky.  He said no, but guessed that maybe a fire had started in the area, and that was why the siren was sounded.   Afterwards, I got back into my car and continued to head south on Hwy 93, and at this time I could now see three orbs in the sky at various heights.  I stopped and got out my cell phone to take footage of the orbs.   Zooming in on the original orb that I had spotted, I could see that it was spherical in shape and it was flashing red and green lights from the outside of the orb and also from underneath the orb shape.  At that point I hit record on my camera, but at that same moment, the original orb I had seen was now gone.  It just vanished.  The other two orbs I continued to record, while still trying to locate the original orb that I had spotted first.  The two orbs continued to hover in the sky at different altitudes flashing red and green lights without making any noise from what I could detect.  After watching again for a while, I returned to my vehicle and drove a little furthe! r south down the highway.  At this time, the orbs also moved s! lowly south along the ridgeline maintaining their altitude.  I then pulled over and stopped and continue to observe.  At that time the orb shapes also stopped and again began to hover at the same altitude that they maintained which was around 10,000-20,000 feet.  I continued to watch the orbs as they hovered over the mountains and the valley floor below when sometime between 6:30 and 7 (I can’t be sure on this time) an airplane flew due east directly towards the orb shapes, but at a much lower elevation.

What’s your opinion…. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdQVIGdLxqw&feature=player_embedded    Monday morning, in bright daylight, 9.00 am, 23 July 2012, this object was filmed above the City Center of Vienna.  The quality of my mobile phone (Samsung Galaxy SIII) was not appropriate enough to zoom further in, but with the eye it could be seen as a rotating and at some points very very bright object (i guess due to strong reflection of sunlight). I had the impression it was chrome like metallic, but this could be too much judgement here. It was not emitting light, it seemed to be reflecting it. It seemed to have a high altitude. Rotating across several axis.  Nothing below a a couple of hundred meters. More in the region of low flying passenger planes. The object moved relatively slowly (south-east), at the start of the observation, then at 01.01 minutes (of the video) it shifts its direction rapidly (!!!!!) and then continued flying at this point in a rather more constant speed in a straight line south. You can nicely see it compared to the balcony of the building in the video. The more i watch that move to the side on video, the more it freaks me out. I could see it with my eye, the move was very sudden and swift, and rather not common to what i would expect from an object I know. I continued to watch it with my eye walking down the street in southern direction. I could follow it for at least 5 more minutes. I could not hear any sound.  It was very surely no plane.  No helicopter noise. It was not a balloon or kite. It was rotating, around several axis.  If it was a satellite crashing, it would not have made a turn at 1.01 minutes of the video and gone south-west... satellites crash rather with speeds in the range of several thousand km. Whatever it was...i am not sure...but it had me at ""owkayyy"". What was striking me the most, it was very very bright at points, so it must have a strong reflecting side and the rest must be also reflecting but not as strong, as it was always was visible but at some points very very much. I could see people on the street looking at it too and seeing it... You can actually see right at the start of the video, that when the camera is not in focus, that the object was pretty bright, when i started filming. It was really a bright blue sky with a lot of sun, and the object was extremely bright at some points. Maybe this footage can be used to be analyzed some more.  In making the video thermal colors (youtube function), you can see a plane crossing right at the start of the video, and  I just saw another (maybe 2) object(s) when the camera goes down to show the pedestrians, above the houses in the distance next to the pole.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

It was like a firework where it starts off not very clear and then it became very clear and then it slowing dissapeared.  This took about 3 minutes so we knew it was not a firework.

While driving North on Highway 287 approaching the Berthoud exit, my wife and I saw two, stationary lights in the sky in the direction of Berthoud, Co.  Due to the darkness, we had no reference for distance or size of the two objects.  Because of this we can only say that they were in a line from our moving vehicle as we moved from south of the bridge before the Berthoud Exit to the Bridge, it'self.  I would guess that the objects were well East of Berthoud as their position in the sky did not change much as we travelled approximately 1 mile before pulling over to observe. One object was blue, the second was orange and from our perspective were approximately 3 finger's-widths apart.  When we first noticed them, both appeared to be stationary. While watching them, and driving North, I had to split my attention between the road and the objects.  I saw the lights first but didn't say anything to my wife as they didn't necessarily seem odd. Then, sometime between when I looked at the road and back, again, a beam of orange-gold light appeared between the two lights, connecting them. Immediately, I pointed this out to my wife and we pulled over and stopped less than 200 feet before the bridge before the Berthoud exit. Since I did not see the initiation of the light beam, I cannot tell from which light it originated and, presumably, would not be able to do so if it was, in fact, a light. However, it appeared that there was some ""dripping"" of orangish beam where it was close to the orange light.  I would describe this phenomena as being similar to a high-pressure hose spraying a stream of water.  As it gets farther away from the nozzle, the stream widens and gravity overcomes the water pressure, causing some of the water to fall away from the stream. In this case, the ""falling"" portion of the orange beam did not seem to make it to the ground.  Rather, it faded out the farther away from the beam it got. However, the orange light (not the beam) seemed to grow noticeably brighter as the beam continued.   We continued watching for maybe 2-3 minutes and tried to take a photo with our camera-phones, but couldn't get a decent image (low-quality phones. . .we didn't get them to take pictures). After the 2-3 minutes, the beam disappeared. Upon termination of the beam, the orange light seemed to dim.  It's just a guess, but I felt that the orange light was a bit brighter after the beam turned off than it was before the beam started. As we continued to watch, both lights seemed to ""retreat' into themselves, getting smaller and disappearing.  This took less than approximately 5-7 seconds.  Again, from a personal perspective, neither light seemed to move, just wink out.  I say this because neither light seemed to get dimmer, just smaller and smaller until they disappeared.  I would presume that any light would get smaller and dim if it were moving directly away from us.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

Last night, The children and I  were driving home from my parents house.  The sky was over cast and no moon or stars. I saw a big red glow in the woods and thought it was a house fire. We went to check it out and saw a aircraft with 3 lights in a perfect triangle shape.  Lights were red blue and white. The craft was as big as a tennis court.  It took a few quick spins around and lifted up over the trees. It was about a football feild away from our car.  It was moving about 10 mph and was wobbling. It was above a cow pasture and when our car got closer it started flying faster and the blue and white lights turned off.  The red light turned toward us and it moved across the road into a hay feild, flying with the flat of the triangle foward.  As soon as it crossed over all the lights came back on. It flew fast but still wobbling across the feild and up over the trees.  We drove the car to catch up with it. When we got to the bottom of the hill, we saw it again, fly over the highwa! y and over the river and back in the trees on the other side and the last we saw it.  There was no sound , no windows and not anything I could ever imagion seeing. This morning, I drove back to the same location to see if I could find any markings or limbs down, but it was hard to say because I really didn't feel like getting out and walking in the snow.  I stopped and talked to the farmer of the property and  he said he saw strange lights behind his barn last night around 10am.  He at first thought someone was messing around but soon got scared because it was so strange.  Behind the barn is where the cows are fenced in.  And behind the barn is a field and tree line.  He didnt think any cows were missing.  Tonight, I called the vestal police department. They took it very seriously. The police said there have been many reports this month from vestal . He said even some police have witnessed strange aircrafts. The officer talked to me for almost 25 min.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,42.0567,-76.0272

Recently had even closer encounter Ive been seeing strange triangular shaped, multicolored flashing lights in the sky, mainly to the east but all around my house for a couple of months now.  I live in rural Texas, a town called Blum, that is just south of the DFW metroplex.   I am a recent college graduate with a degree in psychology. I live with my parents just outside of town. On the evening of Oct. 21st, 2012, the guy I was dating (who happened to be an ex-Marine) and I were sitting out on the front porch watching the sun set. It was about 6:30-6:45pm and we saw something odd in the western sky, a dark object just over the horizon. I asked him if he could see it too, and he looked. As soon as he did, he stood up and was silent, almost catatonic for a few seconds, then asked me in a very expressive way if I had seen what he just saw.  According to him, it was as though he was peering into the cosmos.  I didnt have the same experience he did. I could just see the object floating off in the distance.  It was too far away to make out a distinct shape and was hovering in the valley between our house and the other side of the valley that makes up the Nolan River basin. Hwy 174 runs along this from Cleburne to Meridian.  Anyway, we observed this for hours, even after the sun went down and my dad and stepmom joined us when they got home from work.  We observed it through binoculars and discovered that it was triangular in shape and that there were multicolored blinking lights on every corner of it. It appeared to move around ever so slightly. You could even clearly see the iridescent twinkle to it with just the naked eye. Eventually while we were looking at it, we began to see white bright objects that were itty bitty shooting off it and streaking across the sky. Probably tens, maybe even hundreds of them. My stepmom was the first to see this since we were passing the binoculars around. They shot off in all directions and disappeared. Although, when observing through the bi! noculars, it seemed like we could see some returning to the pl! ace of o rigin (the twinkling triangular craft). The white objects were disc shaped and very fast/agile.  It may also be important to note this at this time: several times during the month of September 2012, I noticed a disc shaped object floating like it was parked just above the trees just on the other side of the valley. It was bright and had yellow/white lights pulsating in sequence around it. At the bottom of the hill on our side, which is also where the cemetery and  school house sit (our house is on top of the grade, overlooks the whole valley) there were, on several occasions, blue light figures. I dont know how best to describe them, it was like a blue flame head and the body wasnt quite discernible over such a distance (about a half mile away). But it seemed like they were beckoning to me. This happened for about a week in September. I would still see the strange blue lights from time to time throughout the month.  On the evening of Dec. 2nd, 2012, my dad, stepmom and I were sitting out on the back porch which faces the east. I saw the same kind of twinkling lights like what we had been seeing before in October and asked them if I was the only one seeing this. So they turned the lights out in the house and we all walked out back to the edge of the house and lo and behold there were a bunch of them in a formation like this:  . .                  .                . . All of them were twinkling, although it was a little more difficult to see the distinctive colors of the lights emitted on the ones that are in a formation of a vertical line. The ones on the ends are much more visible and have been ever since that night and today is 12/11/12.  Also, on the night of Dec. 7th, I witnessed the most wonderful of all of these encounters. I was sitting out on the back porch, just observing this formation that I just described and the others that I have began to see also in the area around my house. I was looking in the direction of SE and I spotted a low flying one of these triangular shaped, multicolored blinking crafts probably about a football field length or maybe two off the ground rather close to my house. The colors on this were very distinctive and I noticed something else odd about it. It seemed to be flying at a 45 degree angle and there was a large, bright white light coming from one side of it that was kind of obscured by the rest of the craft. So I continued to watch this slowly drift across the sky until it started coming towards me. The closer it approached the further up in the sky it went. Then it stopped in mid-air. It started performing beautiful acrobatics and the feeling I had inside me was of pures! t joy! I felt like a little kid. During this time, I was texting my boyfriend (he and I have been dating on and off for the last year now) and he was at a party. Of course I was describing to him before just the craziness that had been going on for the last few days as far as seeing these things in the sky every night. Then, when this light started dancing across the sky I watched it for a few minutes before texting him about the incredible thing I was experiencing right at that moment. I remember consciously asking (in my mind) it to please not got away while I texted him. Anyway, he texted me back that he was shocked and since he was at a party I didnt think he would answer my call if I called right then, but I had the impulse to. So I did. While the cell was ringing, the craft started slowly drifting to the right, which was also south and the direction that he lives. It stopped moving when he picked up. And so I began describing what I was seeing, the motions it was maki! ng and all. Then it appeared to sign my name in the sky and I ! was like ""no way!!"" and told my boyfriend what it just did. Then he asked if I thought it could do his, and without knowing what his name was (it is saved as his nickname in my phone even), it signed his name. And then we were speculating on it and what its appearance could mean, especially around when it was happening date wise and so on, and we asked it if this would be a good time to ask questions. It drifted to the right on answers that were yes, or qualifying and then back to the center. It drifted to the left on answers that were no, or disqualifying and then back to the center. It also made a swirly-cue downward motion almost like the threads on a screw to answers that were too complex/werent ready to be given yet, and then back upwards to center. When it seemed like we were really on track with something we were talking about it would, along with drifting to the right, speed up, go up and down, almost like it was nodding (and at one point i was nodding my head alon! g with conversation while it was drifting right and it started bobbing up and down in time with my own nodding). It would nod up and down vehemently to messages of love and peace and of course eventually when the thought was done it would go back to center. This lasted for an entire hour. And then we were ready to get off the phone. I wanted to try and attempt to open up communication with it myself but by the time we got off the phone it began to disappear. Then all that was left of it was a dim red light and it was completely gone and then this dense fog fell about the place. From start to finish, this lasted from 10:05 to 11:06pm from the reference of my texts between my boyfriend and I.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,32.1019,-97.3827

So I was smoke a cig and thought I would try so I took 3 quick puffs then 3 slow puffs off my cig, and the light,responded. I was shocked, it was a UFO, so I called up to my son who was watching TV in his room with his window open, I said ""Shane get over here"" SEVERAL times to no avail, when I turned & looked at the object it was over in the direction of the police department which is maybe 1.5 miles north east of us, and saw the light make a couple flashes and then some sparkles came downward, the kind you see from a sparkler when a child just holds it. I wanted to get a picture; but have a disability and move very slowly so i SCREAMED ""SHANE GET YOUR CAMERA, GO TO THE WINDOWN"" but he didn't come so I went in the house to get my cell phone. When I came back it was gone.  It was no where. Not in the front, or other obstructed view areas. I have in the past had sightings; but for some reason this one really shook me up. maybe it was caught on a traffic light or business security camera?",2012-09-24T00:00:00,33.70999285714286,-117.94785267857142

Me and a friend of mine were fishing for cat fish all night in the town of Sebago, on Sebago Lake.  I had noticed across the lake over by a large radio tower (near the town of Raymond), a strange whitish orange light.  It was just moving slowly then it had climbed high.  I thought that it was just a military jet.  Then all of a sudden another one appeared by the radio tower.  Thinking, ""It's just another jet,""  Then it started to dart left and right up and down and ""wobble} in the sky.   I was starting too get vary curious about the object.  So I called my friend over too witness it too, and get his opinion on it.  He said oh its a helicopter.  Then he said no, they can't do those kinds of maneuvers that quickly.  We had just watched it for about 15 or so minutes, then it started to hover over the lake (100/200 feet)but had no noise, just a whitish orange light.  So now we were getting spooked, so we quickly cleaned up our gear and moved back to the truck were we watched it for another 15 or so minutes.  Then we noticed it was coming closer and closer too our side of the lake.  So we we're now getting out of there, seen enough of it, as we drove down Rt. 11 I had noticed that it was still moving slowly across the sky in the same direction as us, but in the distance.  Above tree level.   So he dropped me off at my house on Rt. 25 in Limington, it was still there.  But off in the distance.  He drove off, but I noticed from my bedroom window that it was still hovering (near or in the town of Standish).    I was a bit freaked out, so I locked my window, closed the curtain around 04:30.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

I noticed it as I walked out in my backyard to have a smoke. The light appeared to be above the mountains in the SSW of the valley, which lead to Lake Tahoe, not sure how high. At first, I thought maybe it was Jupiter or another large planet, but my stargazer app showed Jupiter in the northeast sky and nothing significantly large or bright in the area where I was looking. After about a minute of admiring what I assumed was a strange bright star or planet, it began to move northward. It moved at a slow pace much slower than what I am use to seeing the average plain in the night sky move, also there were no flashing lights, and I could hear no noise, simply a brilliant light blue light floating across the sky. After it ! left my view from the back yard, which was obstructed by the roof of my house, I decided to go out front to see if it was still there and it was. The light appeared to still be traveling at the same rate of speed, but a few seconds after spotting the light in the front yard it stopped, this time hovering in the northeast sky. Exited that it might actually be a UFO, I ran in to grab a small “moongazer” telescope, set it up out front, and located the craft with a 20mm lens, but it still just looked like a light, so I tried a 12mm, 6mm, and 4mm lens in the telescope. Through the 4mm lens, I could see that it was emitting a bright blue glow, and had Blues, reds, oranges and other colors, which I could not quite make out, shimmering all around it, although it still looked like a ball of light. I am not too sure how long it stayed there because I went in to check on my daughter around 5:40 and when I came out to gather my telescope equipment the sun was rising. I could no longer ! tell if it was there.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

At first it looked like a rather large glowing ""glob"" so to speak, until it got closer and was a little higher in the sky. At first sighting there was no specific shape to it.  I thought it might be a flare but as it gained altitude and came over us it took the shape of a cross, more so in the shape of a Christian Style Cross.  The cigar shaped structure that may have represented the belly was rounded at both ends, the cross structure that may have represented wings on a regular aircraft were too short to be wings of an aircraft and also were rounded on the ends. The glow was so florescent you could not tell if there was anything above it, such as height to the craft. My friend said if it's an airplane than it's on fire.

I'm not sure of the speed but it did not travel as fast as a jet, it made no sound and appeared to be lower in the sky than a passing aircraft would be.

Report of an Unidentified Object Over Sparks, Nevada, April 21, 2012 Sky   At approximately 21:30 PDT, April 21, 2012 my wife and I stood outside observing the stars and planets in the clear moonless sky.  She had her iPad so that we could identify the planets; the brightest of which we figured was Venus. It was Venus. And then, at approximately 21:40 PDT, I suddenly noticed a large, dimly-visible, ethereal object to the right of Venus, at about 45-degrees above the Northwest horizon moving toward the Southeast at about the rate of speed of a high-flying jet aircraft (or the ISS space station). I next noted that it might be under tow, as a dim dot way ahead of it seemed to be moving at the same speed and direction. (That could have been an unrelated satellite.)  The object would take about four minutes to cross overhead. It was on a steady course and I was able to predict where it would appear after I walked through the house to the front yard.  There we watched it continue on the same path and disappear to the Southeast.  My wife then called a Reno TV Station, and the Fleischman Planetarium at the University of Nevada, Reno but there had been no other reports of phenomena. I would describe it as being asymmetrical and slightly ovoid in shape, with variable shades of pinkish-gray (or pinkish-tan) and was larger than a blimp would appear at 1,000-feet of altitude a half-mile away.   Neither of us heard any sound during its transit of the night sky, and it was a very calm, quiet evening. We searched the internet for clues. I found nothing that would correspond with what I saw.  She went to a NASA website and found the IOTD (Image of the Day) which consisted of three red-and-white parachutes being tested over Arizona by the Orion Test Team.

SHe was driving and noticed three peculiar lights in the sky that individually resembled small balls of fire.  They were gliding in a triangle shape at a constant speed.  Our car was going at around 70 mph.  At first I thought they may have been low flying helicopters or remote control airplanes. I have spent some time in the U.S. Air Force and am familiar with many different kinds of aircraft but after watching the lights for a little bit decided that I have never seen lights like those on any kind of aircraft previously. We noticed that off to the east there was one more solitary ""fireball"" flying low over the horizon.  It appeared to be moving at the same rate as the three lights above us.  It was partly cloudy that evening so judging the height at which the objects appeared is difficult but I would approximate it at a thousand feet or so. I opened my passenger window to see if I could hear any type of engine noise but heard nothing.  Granted, I was in a moving car on the highway.  The lights eventually passed overhead heading north.  The light at the tip of the triangle eventually faded out but the two at the base just kept flickering off into the distance until they were out of sight. We don't recall seeing any other commercial aircraft in the area which seems odd because there is a municipal airport in the vicinity.  After the sighting I called the Joliet Police Department to see if there had been any reports of strange lights in the sky.  The night commander informed me that no such reports had been made.

(1214 Hamilton, Lockport, IL)  We see an orange light coming from the south heading north. It appeared from behind a tree line. It was about 40d above the horizon. It looked like a ball of slowly pulsating orange light.  No blinking or flashing lights on it. It's speed was like that of a regular jet. - About two seconds later a second orange orb appears from behind the tree line and follows the same path heading north as the first one.  It's speed and color were the same as the first one. - About three or four seconds later, a third light appears out of the same spot and was heading in the same direction. This third one seemed to stop briefly and then continued north. My friend took a movie of it with his cell phone. - About 4 or 5 seconds later, a fourth orb appears from the same spot and heads north. I took a pic with my crappy cell phone camera. - ! About ten seconds after that, a fifth orange orb appears. It appeared from the same spot, heading north, traveling at the same speed as the others. This 5th orb suddenly doubles or triples it's speed. It shoots across the sky and catches up to the fourth orb. This fifth orb then abruptly slows down to the speed that the others seemed to be traveling at. - All five orbs were the same color; they all pulsated the same way; and they were completely silent. - My cell camera pic was of the fourth orb. This pic shows that the fourth orb was made up of four smaller orbs - a white orb followed by an orange orb followed by a yellowish gold orb followed by an orange orb. My eyes did NOT see these smaller four orbs - I only saw a larger orange orb.

We were nearing the turn to our street travelling east when my husband, who was driving, alerted me to a round looking orange light to our right. My initial thought was that it was a light from the communication tower which was near our home, but upon studying it further, we could clearly see that it was nowhere close to the tower. We realized that it was moving, heading southeast, slowly and at about the altitude of a small plane or helicopter, but the light was burning steady, not blinking. By this point, all four of us in the car were watching it, and we had turned west onto the street to our home. We all agreed that it seemed to be “on fire”, or “burning”. My husband stopped the car and we opened windows to listen. None of us heard an engine or any sound from the object.

I initially observed it out of the corner of my eye while looking northeast  and conversing with her. I pointed it out to her and we watched it until it disappeared. In the last 5 seconds of viewing it appeared to have folded its wings back in a similar manner to various military aircraft, although its speed was not affected by this maneuver. It was triangular in shape, with the length (from nose to tail) of the craft being approximately 1/3 of the width (wingspan). Additionally, the main body appeared to be black with what seemed like a dozen or so orangish reflectors, or dimly lit lights, symmetrically dispersed on the underside of the body. While our depth perception was scewed due to the darkness, I would estimate it having been around 1,000 ft above ground level. From that  altitude, I would guess its wingspan to have been approximately 80ft. It flew at a consistent speed, and we viewed it for around 15 to 20 seconds prior to it flying out of eyesight. Our approximate viewing area was a total of 115 degrees out of 180 (horizon to horizon). It is difficult to describe strictly in words, but it dissappeared from our eyesight prior to reaching an obstacle that would have naturally inhibited our viewing of the craft (i.e. it simply faded away as opposed to flying behind the adjacent house). The night here has been crystal clear and we have experienced very little wind that may have kicked up dust. Our backyard and patio faces the east, with our two story house blocking any view of the west (including the moon at the time of viewing). We live in a typical Katy, Tx subdivision, so there is a certain amount of ambient light. However, we enjoy the relatively quiet evenings of the neighborhood on our patio with the lights off, which gives us as good of a view as we can get of the stars. I mention these facts only to emphasize that we had a clear view of the craft against a black sky background. As far as explinations, there is skydiving in our area but, as a skydiver, this was not a parachute. We have motorized paragliders in the area as well, but this was certainly not that either as there was no noise nor a parachute of any kind. We have a small airport near our house, but we watch those aircraft come and go everyday(and night), and this was neither on the proper heading, nor did it have the physical attributes of the planes that fly in and out of there. Hang gliding is highly unlikely as there are no elevated areas to start from, and the size of the craft and time of day would not make sense, in addition to the perceived speed. I am not necessarily a believer in alien UFOs, however I cannot explain what we saw tonight. I pride myself on my logical way of thinking and having a healthy skeptisism of many things in life. I am a (former) Marine infantry squad leader who left the Corps about 4 years ago with an impeccable service record at the rank of Seargent (E-5), and have since had a solid professional career. My wife is a teacher working on her Masters degree with plans to persue a doctorate. I do not wear a tin foil hat. I have scoffed at many on the news and Discovery Channel for claiming to have experienced similar things. I am not overwhelmed by what I saw i am just simply trying to find an explanation. For the record, I do not claim what we saw was was either extraterrestrial or governmental.  I only claim to have seen something over our house that neither my wife nor I can logically identify based on our own experiences and knowledge.  Take it as you will.

I watched for 1-2 minutes while rubbing my eyes and trying to focus on other things to make sure this is  what it really is.

My wife and I were walking our dogs in a field a couple miles West of Santa Rosa.  My wife had stopped to watch the sky and called for me to look at something. She asked if an object moving across the sky was a jet or not.  She had been watching it for quite a while before mentioning it to me. What I saw was a light much too large to be a high flying aircraft.  Rather than being a small pinpoint, it was maybe the equivalent of 1/8""-1/4"" at arms length. It was South and slightly West of us heading roughly East.  I would estimate it was about 25-30 degrees from the horizon.  I assumed it to be an aircraft at first because there is an air traffic lane that comes in off the ocean about due west. The object was a strange color somewhat like a high pressure sodium light.  The intensity sort of ""undulated"", but we could see no strobes.  There was no sound.  The other odd thing was the flight path. It didn't seem to travel in a smooth straight trajectory.  It sort of bobbled around on it's path.  Also, it climbed steadily and got smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it.  It disappeared about 45-50 degrees from the horizon and about Southeast of us. Approximately two minutes later, my wife spoke out about another one.  This one was farther West, when I saw it than the previous object, and much lower.  Lower to the point I thought it might have just taken off from a nearby airport, but there are no airports West of Santa Rosa.  We observed this light follow a similar path to the Southwest climbing rapidly in an undulating trajectory until it disappeared in the same spot as the first one.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

I quickly ran to a large group of people (about 20 people) and told them to look at it, by this time it had been going on for 5 minutes, it still continued to spin fly in circle patterns and tight hook patterns, just then we seen (what we think) a jet flying after it, then we got the real scale of the craft, compaired to the jet that was really flying fast and tightly manuvering, the ufo was amazingly huge and had to of been covering miles within split seconds in the sky while making circle patterns, it seems to me that the ufo was doing no harm, but was toying with the jet fighter.  After watching it dip and dive and circle around the ! jet it flew directly at the ground. From my perspective it went behind the tree line, i spoke with other people that seen it from a different view and they said that the lights seperated and split off then joined up and flew away at a high rate of speed. After it was gone we seen the jet still searching, then a helicopter could be seen in the distance in the same area with it's spotlight on. I tried taking video but ended up with one snapshot that just shows a streak in the sky.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,28.047227153284673,-81.9588497810219

It was dark, so we couldn't see much except for changing, flashing lights.   The lights came from different areas of the craft, and it looked a bit like a trapezoid, but then seemed to change shape.   Getting out of the car, there was a quiet drone unlike anything I've heard before.   Soon it started flying away at incredible speed.
