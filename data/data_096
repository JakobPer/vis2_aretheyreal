The object flew straight up and stopped, hovering, and within less than a second it was far to the south and glowing brightly, which was what made me think it was not a military jet.

My wife and I are in New York State visiting my family and have been vacationing several days by the beach in Montauk, NY, out near the tip of Long Island. This is a pretty clear and starry night so after the kids went to sleep we went out on the patio of the room we are renting and did some stargazing.  At approximately 11:20pm or so (we did not look at the time so this estimate is give or take 5-10 mins.), just as we were turning to go inside my wife shouted for me to look.  Looking to the SW we saw what appeared to be a bright orangish fireball rising slowly up into the sky.  There was no sound from the object that we could detect although it seemed to be close, perhaps a couple of hundred yards away at the most.  It then seemed to gain speed and ascend quite high into the atmosphere and began to head NE at what then seemed to be quite a high speed, as it disappeared from view in less than a minute.  We were awestruck especially since it moved so fast and yet made no sound. Our room is at the ((name deleted)) Resort in Montauk, which is right on the beach.  Our view from where we stood, looking in the direction of the location from which the object seemingly began to rise above the ground (or ocean?) was partially obscured by the building, to the extent that we did not catch view of the object until it had already (at first very slowly) risen to a height of what appeared to be 50 feet or more.  At first we both wondered if it could be some kind of object on fire being carried up by a balloon, but this did not seem to be a possibility once the glowing light rose up very high and then began traveling away from us at what seemed to be a very high speed.

I had some work to do late, and had just finished when I decided I would go outside and see how the weather looked.  There were low, broken clouds, moon partially obscured by the clouds. Clam winds. I saw what I thought was a life flight helicopter flying just above the tree line, but I noticed that the lights were solid red, no green, so as I continued to watch it, the light stopped.  It made a quick vertical circle, stopped again, and then started to flicker, then changed from bright red to bright blue, and continued to flicker at a high rate of speed.  There appeared to be 2 small white dots of light flickering in and out of the clouds near the red/blue light, but they would dart in and out of the clouds so quickly, it was hard to be sure. After the light hovered in the same spot for about 10 seconds, still flickering, still changing from red to blue and back, it changed to red and moved off slowly.  The entire sequence of events lasted about 1 minute and 20 seconds. I ran back inside to get my phone to take a video, but I could not get the video to play on the phone.  Kept giving an error code.  I will download it tomorrow to see if it will play on my desktop. The lights were totally silent, no noise at all.  I thought it might be a drone, but it was too high for it to be a toy, and because we live within 2 miles of the regional airport, drones are illegal. The most unusual thing was the brightness of the lights.  There were a piercing shade of blue and red, extremely bright, and they didn’t blink, they flickered and although predominantly red, they changed to blue intermittently.  The main light looked like a cluster of 3 lights stuck together, but they never flew independently or came apart.   The lights traveled south west, basically over Towne West Subdivision north of Sugar Land, and went in the direction of the Sugar Land airport.  Because it is a regional airport, there is rarely any traffic after 10pm at night, but there are 2 life flight helicopters that are stationed close by that make trips in the early morning hours, but you can hear them coming from a long way off.

Sitting on my back patio I noticed a blue/red/white lights moving erratically due north, about 20 degrees above the horizon (near the base of the Big Dipper). The lights moved in a fashion similar to somebody pointing a laser pointing at a wall and moving it around erratically.  However, these lights were much bigger and were blue/white/red, depending on which way the lights were moving. From my back porch, I sit about even with the treeline.  I could see a blinking light moving up/down and back/forth up out of the treeline, and above/down into the treeline.  The lights would do this for about 30 seconds, then stop for about 5 minutes , then start again.  The happened for about 30 minutes. At about 10:15, I also noticed, what looked like, a shooting star heading in the general direction of the moving lights.  I thought it was a shooting star, until I realized there was some cloud cover in that direction, so the “shooting star” had to be in front of the cloud cover (which I thought was strange)  At about 10:30 pm, I got in my car and drove about a mile north to get a better view, overlooking Standley Lake.  However, by this time the lights had disappeared.    The sighting was in the general direction of Rocky Mountain Airport.",2014-08-22T00:00:00,39.82714549180328,-105.11018401639345

The object was either relatively large or relatively low in altitude, and was bright enough to have drawn our attention before actually becomming visible.  The object roughly appeared to be the size of a full moon in the sky.

The light furthest left on the light then split 1 more time producing another light which moved in a diagonal position (about 45 degrees) below the line of lights.  All of this took place in about 5-10 seconds. Shortly after the 4 lights disappeared two objects with faint whitish blinking lights were flying through the sky.  They started out in line with each other with one above and one below, and proceeded to fly on a diagonal trajectory meeting, or coming very closing to each other and then vanishing.

The lights appeared orange in color and I thought at the time they would probably turn out to be the red and green wing lights of an aircraft, once they got closer and I could see more detail. I soon could see that there were three orange lights each separated by perhaps a half mile. They moved one after the other towards the northeast and then each in turn seemed to turn more northward in direction.  I thought anytime now I would see the flashing strobes of the planes, as we had seen various private and military aircraft all week.  The strobes never appeared, only a very bright intense orange light which never wavered. I have since read reports of “Chinese lanterns” being released in the past, while researching what I had seen, but I find it hard to believe the quality of the light I witnessed was the flickering of a candle.  In addition the height and speed of the objects approximated that of the aircraft I had been seeing in the preceding days. The first orange light flew almost directly overhead and while I listened intently for the sound of an engine there was total silence except for the occasional sound of thunder from a lightning storm just to my northwest. I turned to ask one of our traveling companions to take a look and then looked back at the lights and the third light had disappeared, I don’t know what happened to it as I had only turned away for a second.   However, as the second orange light passed by, there was an extended lightning strike from the storm which lit up the sky.  I could see nothing but the second orange light with no shape or body connected to it.   But moving across the sky behind it was a black or dark grey shadow that seemed to pulsate and change shapes stretching first longways and then sideways in an alternating fashion.

At approximately 11:20 pm Eastern on June 21, 2014, I witnessed what I can only describe as an orange fireball moving across the sky at a moderate speed.  I was in my back yard in Wayland, NY, just south of the Finger Lakes, Hemlock and Canandaigua Lakes specifically.  I noticed the fireball when it was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  It moved on what seemed to be a straight trajectory from the northeast to the southwest.  As the fireball moved to the southwest, it remained fairly regular in brightness and shape until it was past my location, when it dimmed until I could no longer see it.   After a few seconds, it reappeared a bit smaller and less intense and then it appeared to “flash” as a silvery mark in the sky.  Eventually it moved far enough that I lost it against the ambient light nearer the southwest horizon.   The sky was very clear and the fireball was very bright compared to the stars in the sky tonight.  The fireball seemed to be exactly th! at, a fireball- its shape was not totally regular, it appeared to have actual flames, not just a glowing light.  It was much larger than any star or planet as seen with the naked eye but smaller than the moon.   It made no sound that I could hear apart from any other noise this evening. My initial reaction was to record the fireball with my phone.  The video does not show nearly the amount of detail or intensity that I was able to observe, but does provide an approximate record of how long it was visible.   My second thought was that it was a sky lantern, but after just a few seconds it was evident that that it was too bright, moving too fast, and moving laterally instead of vertically.  I have spent too much time camping or at the lake to think this was a lantern.   After it was clear that I wouldn’t be able to see the fireball again, I called NUFORC and filed this report.",2014-06-24T00:00:00,42.5608,-77.5678

Family was outside after my cousin's graduation party. It was dark but we hadn't turned any lights on to avoid the June-bugs.  We were looking up because my uncle had an application on his phone that showed the various constellations.  Then, from one side of the sky I thought I saw movement, but it was hard to focus on what was going on (whatever it was blended perfectly with the light-polluted sky).  I pointed at it and told everyone to look. It flew directly over us.  No sound.  I wouldn't have been able to see it had it not been for the lights that appeared on the corners.  What was strange is that the lights appeared to be facing inward towards the center of the aircraft itself.  As it flew over I was become annoyed by the fact that nobody was saying anything, so I asked, ""Is anybody seeing this!?""  Two of my cousins replied exuberantly, with a hint of horror (which I understand completely, because this was really a strangely terrifying experience).  It disappeared a few seconds later into the light pollution coming up off the horizon. The people who saw it were myself (a 16 year old high school student), my cousin (an 18 year old who just graduated), my second-cousin (also a high school student), and another second-cousin (also a high school student).

I live in an apartment where cars are subject to tow so I always need to get up early in the morning to move my car.  I got up and walk to my car to move it which is about 300 feet from my apartment.   As I was getting in to my car I happened to look up and saw a black object in the sky.  I am used to seeing helicopters and military aircraft in the area since this is north san diego.  But I knew right away something was different about this object.  It was far away enough that it just looked like a baloon.  Luckily enough I had my binoculors in my car which they said 10 x 30 on them.   As I observed the craft it had an irregular flight pattern.. (going up and down left and right). As I focused in with my binoculors I could tell right away what it was.  There first thing I noticed every now and then on it was it had what appeared to be a set up lights on what appeared to be fins on the craft.  As I observed it spin, it appeared to be shape shifting and spinning its mass as it was moving with some lights visible.  Once I saw that I started to get excited and look for any other person in the area to point out what I was seeing. I kept an eye on it as I was moving, I found to construction workers talking in their trucks and walked up and pointed to what I was looking at.  They thought it was a balloon but with my binoculors I could see what it really was..   As all this was going on it was drifting south east and gaining altitude.  I did get a view of the craft when it was not shape shifting and it was diamond/teardrop in shape and had an organic appearance with fins in the middle with low light lights on it.  The surface had a vein like appearance of something like a vegetable with black and dark red in a striped like organic way.  I may have seen a windscreen but it was too far too tell. After seeing that I ran back to my apartment to get my camera and try and get a view shots through my binoc! ulors but by the time I came back out it had already been lost! in to t he clouds.   I have a broad knowledge of all kinds of aircraft and balloons and can say this was not like anything I have every seen in my entire life and has changed my perception about life as I know it. I have attached a sketch and a video of the area of its flight. Sadly I could not get any hard evidence of it.",2014-07-11T00:00:00,33.13531750972763,-117.1663392996109

There is an airport to the south west and they tend to travel in the general direction of the Tulsa airport, but the other two lights, which were not flashing, only slighty pulsing to where one could almost not notice, the other two stayed for a bit, then slighty went to the east, then faded away. The lights could be compared to a mix of the light that is given off by Venus and/or Mars, but both were not only in the wrong spot according to my google sky they also clearly moved, and then quickly disapeared into the night.",2014-08-22T00:00:00,35.9261,-96.0193

The first was spotted as I and the other witnesses exited a lake we had been swimming in. We could not see the object, but we were sure that it was neither a plane, an asteroid, nor a comet, and it seemed too near to be a satellite.  The lake in question is about 10 km from Iroquois Falls.  The circular red light advanced at a slow and steady pace, not leaving a trail behind it, and followed a half moon like trajectory from the point where we had seen it, and lost it from view.   We exited the lake and spoke about this strange phenomenon, and as we entered the cottage (we had not been looking at the sky for approximately 5 minutes) one of the witnesses spotted another object reflecting a circular red light exactly like the first one, that followed the exact same trajectory at the same pace.   Now we all wondered if it had been a second one or a third.  However, this was disproved because soon after seeing this second UFO, a third with the exact same characteristics, following the same trajectory at the same speed passed over us again.  Now if this third object had been lower than the others I can not say with assurance.

On Saturday, August 2, 2014 at approximately 2245 mountain time, I was standing on the sidewalk in Northwest Denver, in the vicinity of 38th Avenue and Yates Street when I saw two bright orange objects traveling northeasterly in the dark night sky.  They were well above tree line and houses, and were coming from the southwest traveling in a perfectly straight line at a stable elevation, coming from the Sheridan Avenue area in the Edgewater vicinity. Two of us saw them.  They were traveling quietly and perfectly synchronized together. After between 30 and 60 seconds both bright orange glowing orbs kind of flashed brighter one time, then immediately disappeared, both at exactly the same time.  They did not appear to drop in elevation at all, they just disappeared.  They disappeared when they were probably over Yates and 41st Avenue area or a little farther northeast. I would guess the two orbs, or what ever they were, were traveling about as high as a helicopter flies around Denver, maybe a little lower.  Very bright orange, almost red glowing, appearing to be round / oval in shape.  Pretty good size; smaller than the body of a helicopter but maybe about six or seven feet in diameter, about the size of a hot tub.  It was hard to really ascertain the size or the distance they were from us in the dark night sky and with the bright orange glow they emitted. The Denver skies were partly cloudy, but the area these were in was in a completely clear sky. They were moving at a good clip, completely quiet though and perfectly synchronized together. They were probably visible by us for a total of 30 to 60 seconds.  Two of them, perfectly spaced apart and traveling side by side, but not connected to each other. We have both seen Chinese type lanterns in the night sky, but these were NOT lanterns. These were two bright orange objects, separated by space but traveling perfectly together.

It should be noted that her street is near a major shopping center, but her street is secluded with trees and wooded area surrounding the road.  There are street lights along the road but quite spaced out and are often out/dim. There was a car approximately 500 yards behind me traveling the same direction.  As we approached her driveway, which is on the left, we both observed a UFO with white lights blinking around the rim of the object.  They blinked on and off rotating around similar to the light movement of the arcade game that you have to hit the stop button as it passes the 10 in front of your spot. The lights were very visible and the craft was just above the trees and about 20 yards in front of us.  The object was moving right to left passing over the road/trees.  As it went over the street we arrived to her driveway which we quickly jumped out to attempt a second sighting of it, however it was gone. She does live within about 10 miles from a small airport, however the craft did not have any green or red lights the the circling white pattern.  It should be noted that we couldn't see the full outline of the object due to the trees and darkness, however we could clearly see the edge shape due to the lights circling it.  I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately 75 to 200 feet wide. My girlfriend is afraid of the idea so she automatically said it was a plane, however there was a plane flying high up in the sky that was clearly a plane with the red, green, and white light. She accepted the fact that we saw what we saw, a UFO.  It should also be noted that for as low as it was there should have been a distinct sound, especially if it were a plane, however we heard none.  My truck is not the quietest in the world especially since I also had the radio on, however there should've been a distinct sound for as low as it was. This was the first time I had ever experienced seeing something of this nature, but I am so glad that I have my own proof enabling me to personally know without question that they are out there.

I sent the picture to my daughters and asked them what they thought about it. A few days passed and my daughter sent me the picture back, she had enlarged it and made her best attempt to make it a little more clear. When I seen it I completely freaked out, I was in a panic, crying, just scared to death There is no doubt that it was some sort of alien creature. It is a light color with a slight greenish tent , it has large almond shaped eyes that are black and a large head. I called a alien research to seek answers. He told me I would be ok not to worry. So, anyways that same creature I think, came in my room in the middle of the night too, it didn't do anything to me, but,, I started really looking at all the photos that I had taken that day and I don't know what to even think.. There are several more of them in that picture that wasn't noticed the first time I looked at them. I also caught a object in the air above my house,, im not sure but it kind of looks like there may have been two. The objects in the sky are complete different shapes... I cant say im sure about the other wierd things on that photo but im hoping maybe you all could clear it up more and see what is there, and maybe help me if possible. I will send some pictures, I tried to make them more clear but even with what I have its obvious.

After reaching on of the the peaks,(an altitude of 2940 feet), I reclined to rest on a concrete platform near one of the newly constructed transmission towers, I witnessed four ""extremely high altitude"" white circular objects.  They ""appeared"" rather than ""approached"" as would be the case with any traditional aircraft.  These objects were not unlike a satellite in size but unlike a satellite they did not move across the sky at the expected speed.  They hovered and moved very slowly in a more or less linear formation in the direction of Palmdale and Lancaster.  These objects seemed to leap frog one another at times, appearing and reappearing.  They eventually moved out of sight. Five or ten minutes later, my interest peaked, three more objects appeared very near the same position, directly above me.  Similarly, the three objects were small white circular lights hovering at an extremely high altitude.   One of the lights was flashing, reflecting light back, unlike any of the other lights previously observed.  I interpreted this as the one object to be rotating with a reflective surface. Like the other objects, these three moved away slowly and eventually out of sight. As I observed these truly unusual objects I had plenty of time to consider the possible explanations.  I ruled out conventional aircraft.  These things were hovering. They moved much too slow and were at too high an altitude.  I ruled out satellites.  They were too close to one another and satellites don't just ""appear"" and they don't move in mass formations.  I ruled out stars.  Duh.  I could not, however, completely ruled out high altitude weather balloons of some kind.  They were not any sort of balloons I'm aware of at the least.  If they were balloons, they were huge and moving in formation with one another and one was flashing or reflecting light. With Edwards AFB so close, I am guessing these things were military in origin.

My daughter was pointing out a large jet airliner traveling South from the North to our grandson, and she noticed way above the jet two objects traveling West from East that were moving very slowly together much that appeared to be much higher than the jetliner.   We all then looked from her pointing them out.  My first thought was balloons, but because they were moving so perfectly together (in sync) slowly and going against the wind and clouds.   The clouds were coming in from the North West going east.  Not sure if it was light reflecting off of them, but they appeared to have small arced wings, again most likely spheres?   We watched for about 15 minutes and then it just disappeared in some clouds.    My whole family saw them, and we can only say there were like nothing we've seen before in our area.    We do have a lot of jetliner activity over our area going from SF to LA (North to South). Spheres, commercial sub-orbitals, balloons, or small drones?

This was at or around 23:30 hours local time (daylight savings time).   The weather was clear skies (there had been some cloud cover approximately 30 minutes before) and the stars were plainly visible. The shape of these craft could easily be described as “chevron” shaped however I chose to identify them as “other” on your form because there were nearly rectangular.  I’d best guess if you drew a line through the middle of the chevron it would be no more than 10 to 15 degrees swept back. They were pure black in colour.  Likely a matte finish as I saw no shine or gleam on them.  The thing that made us notice them is they had 4 or 6 very, very faint red lights glowing on the bottom each craft.  They were extremely faint and almost unnoticeable.  There were no aviation lights of any kind (red, green or white) blinking or solid (other than the very faint red glow under each craft). These two objects were observed by us while we were standing next to our car in the parking lot of the Joe Fowler Memorial Park.  Lake Scugog is approximately 40 feet from the parking lot to the east.  Use Google Maps to help visualize this if needed.  The Park is on Water Street in Port Perry just north of Hwy 7a (Scugog St). There were two crafts.  I will identify them as Craft 1 (closest to us) and Craft 2 (further from us).  Both craft were heading a course of nearly due north (north north east) at an estimated altitude of 60 to 80 feet.   Both appeared to be identical in size and shape however I cannot swear to that.  Their dimensions would be approximately from “wing tip to wing tip” 30 feet.  The width of the “wing” would be approximately 3 to 4 feet.  The height I don’t know.  I didn’t notice anything note worthy about them and they blended in so well with the night sky.    All you could see was a silhouette and extremely faint red glowing lights under the wings.  Their speed I would estimate at 30 miles per hour.  There was NO noise at all and there was no wind at all this evening either.  So they were in fact dead silent.  Not even wind noise that one would expect something that large moving through the air at that speed would make.   They were not air propelled craft (jet, electric or prop)! as at this close a distant no matter how well engineered there would be some noise made by air disturbance causing a craft of that size to go that speed. We were standing beside the car facing Lake Scugog looking up at the night sky.  Craft 1 was spotted first and then approximately 3 to 4 seconds later we noticed Craft 2 slightly behind.   At this point Craft 2 appeared to be following directly behind Craft 1 (about 200 yards) but took a slight course change to the east (Craft 2 did) by approximately 50 yards.  It did so at about a 45 degree angle.  It travelled for 100 yards or so after the course correction it took then sped up and caught up to Craft 1 and trailed directly behind it (approximately 10 yards behind Craft 1).   Again it closed the gap with no noise or sound and I’m guessing its speed would have been a short burst about 100 miles per hour.  It did this in 1 second or less (so it seemed as I obviously wasn’t timing it).  However it would be accurate to say it did it “immediately”.  Again there was no sound.  Not even a faint “swoosh” of disturbed air. The crafts continued heading north at approximately 30 miles per hour until they were out of sight.  From first sight until we lost sight I would guess this event was 10 seconds or less.  It’s so hard to say for sure but it wasn’t +/- 3 seconds of the estimated duration for sure. I wish we had photographic or video evidence but we don’t.  And even if we had a camera and the presence of mind to use it there would be just no way they would have been visible in the picture.  The human eye was strained to notice the very slight difference in contrast between the sky and the crafts.  Again if it wasn’t for the odd faint red glow we never would have seen them. I’m lousy at drawing pictures but if you’d like a rendition of what I saw I would be more than happy to draw it, scan it, and email it to you.  It’s not physical evidence but circumstantial may be better than nothing. Before I forget I would hazard a guess that these crafts were unmanned just due to the small size of it.  I couldn't notice how thick the wings were but I do know for sure if they were thick enough to hold something human sized I would have certainly seen that on the silhouette.  So because I didn’t notice it I’d guess 1 foot give or take a couple inches. I have checked ""I would like to be contacted by an investigator"" however without any physical evidence I feel it may be pointless unless there were others reporting similar activity in the area recently.  Email is the best way to contact me.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,44.1068,-78.9444

On May 26, 2014, at 1200 noon I glanced up from yard work to see something white in the sky.  I initially assumed it was a pair of geese flying together at a high altitude.  I thought one flew off to the left but one remained, which didn’t make sense and gave me pause.  As I concentrated on the object, I realized it wasn’t a bird at all but something round, shiny, and stationary.  I took a picture of it with my phone. From my yard, which is 40 miles NE of Sacramento, the direction was ESE at 45 degrees.  The altitude and actual distance were difficult ascertaining because I lacked a point of reference.  Judging from aircraft throughout the afternoon, I would assume it was higher than a helicopter and lower than a jet. I called and left a somewhat animated message for my fiancé about this, then ran into the house for my glasses and binoculars.  I was afraid to leave the site I was standing for fear it would be gone when I returned.  I have to stress here that when I first saw the object,  I was only wearing protective safety glasses, not prescription, yet could clearly see it was round, white, and shiny. With the binoculars it was round like a ball, white, shiny, with bright light on the top, which could have been the sun’s reflection.  Sometimes the light became brighter, sometimes dissipated completely.  It was difficult to tell but it seemed as though there was something grey on the back of it that would occasionally be visible.  I wasn’t able to visualize any apparatus or ropes dangling from the bottom of it. In an attempt to eliminate the possibility I was imagining this, I called friends who were one mile away.  They saw the object, with the same coordinates, also stating it was shiny and unusual.  They gathered additional people to evaluate this, ensuring that the entire town would eventually be as crazy as we were.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos on weather balloons and read two articles, but I still wasn’t able to tell if this was a balloon or something else. The weather balloons online drifted and, while the photographers had to continually adjust the camera to follow them,  I didn’t.  What if it was Venus?  Or worse yet the Moon and I was creating perplexities out of the rational?  The mind is capable of creating any reality it wants to so I have tried to remain as logical about this as possible. I called the local airport.  I was told they had no reports of any sightings or weather balloons in the area and they expressed concern about flight paths.  I was asked if it could be an advertisement but it was much too high for that.  I was given two numbers for the FAA.  Since it was Memorial Day, the offices were closed so I left messages. The object remained stationary for over three hours, completely undeviating in location, my point of reference being between two trees.  The sun’s position was changing over my right shoulder and back, this was not.  By 1500 it began slowly drifting East, remaining at the same altitude.  It became increasingly difficult to find it in the sky until it eventually disappeared from view at 1630. I received return calls from the FAA this morning.  One person said it was likely a weather balloon, while another encouraged me to contact NUFORC.   I was told someone else reported a similar sighting, only 24 hours prior and 1 ½ hours north of mine.  It is now 1200 on May 27.  There is presently nothing in the sky where this object was yesterday.  That, coupled with the fact that it traveled east, eliminates the planet theory.   I suppose a logical explanation would ensure our sensibilities.  The unexplained though, would make our current perceptions of reality a lot more interesting.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,38.8835,-120.9835

As I looked further I noticed the object was hovering above something, as if it was observing something.  After noticing that the object was not moving, and having concluded it was not a bird, it suddenly zoomed off due east at fantastic speed.   I have never seen any aircraft that operated like that before.  It was either a government test vehicle (which I highly doubt) or a UFO.   About one half an hour later I noticed two high flying jets going both east to west and west to east at a high rate of speed.  Those both had contrails and were moving much more like traditional jets. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When we came closer we could actually see that this light was in the middle of an open field and that there were two other lights along with it that were orange and blue in color. 		       The shape of the lights formed an isosceles triangle, with the red light being on the top (pulsating), then the orange and the blue being at the bottom, closest to the ground.   The object was huge and would have been bigger than a house or barn if it was placed next to one.   None of the lights were moving and it remained stationary as we drove past.  We could not hear any noises coming from it either.  We could not see anything that connected the lights together; it just seemed like they were free floating by themselves making up this pattern.  Another car coming in the opposite direction seen the same thing, and they pulled over to try and figure out what it was as well.  We did not stop since this object gave me a very uneasy feeling.   We have never seen anything like this and it was so close to the highway (about 100 feet away or so) that if it was a plane or anything we would have been able to tell.

I was laying on my right side which was strange as I have not done it in the 16 years since my spinal injury & resulting bad sciatica down my right leg, it was too painful to consciously do.  I turned around to see why my cat was going crazy.  I was startled by a black shadow figure about 5ft tall, slim with a large bald head.  It had green L.E.D. like lights in positions around its body.  As I looked on, it bent over me 2 times looking at my lower back & legs.  It stood upright in between the bends to examine my lower body. All this time my cat was still yowling.  The perfectly black figure was lit from behind by a night light so I could see its outline distinctly, doing what it was doing, plus the green lights on parts of its own outline enhanced its shape.  I challenged it by shouting ""who are you?"" and ""what do you want?""  I did this twice. It made no noise.  It just did what it was doing.  I then plucked up the courage to move towards the lamp switch to turn it on. As I was changing position, it began to gradually disappear.  By the time the light was on, it was gone and my cat stopped his crazy yowling.  I was quite frightened by the ordeal, but I was wide awake after being startled from the time I first saw the black figure.

The golfers face south to drive balls, looking directly at the butte.  The elevation provides for nice views of the town, surrounding landscapes and the Rocky Mountain peaks to the west. The afternoon sky was clear above with some clouds gathering in the west over the mountains.  I drove a ball (using a 7-iron) and as it climbed at first it seemed to stop and hover, but I immediately realized I lost track of the ball and my eye picked up another object in the sky.  It looked small, round and white like a golf ball, but much higher in the sky.  I thought perhaps it was a plane, so I stopped to watch it for a minute.  After a minute or so, I realized it couldn’t be a plane because it was not moving forward, it was just hovering. It’s not unusual for hawks to be flying around there, but this was much too high and looked rather inanimate.  My gaze wandered to the right (west) where I spotted 3 additional objects just like the original one.  There was another “tandem” object – the top part of that object looked like the other 4 and the bottom one looked like a larger version of it.  They were connected by a vertical line.  To draw it, it would be a small circle directly over a larger one, connected by a line.  There was one more object that looked a little more oval and it was red.  The four small white objects and the red one surrounded the tandem object. I looked away for minute and when I looked back they were still there.

I mentioned this to my friends as they had not seen this event, but roughly 30 seconds later, all three of us saw what looked like a triangular shape of 5 lights in the sky follow the trial of the meteorite that I had seen earlier.  It appeared out of nowhere and slowly followed the path until banking away (rolling, tilting leftwards away from our view) and eventually fading into the black of night.  As if it were following the meteorite curiously.",2014-08-01T00:00:00,41.149224771404825,-104.82391246882793

We immediately asked each other what it was noticing it was moving very slow, wasn't blinking and seemed to burn orange with no tail or sound. The light drifted a visual distance of a foot to a foot and a half before it appeared to drift in our direction.  We would later comment that it seemed to notice our headlights and swerved in to investigate.  I put my car in park as the second light entered from the same direction. The second light passed with seemingly more resolve.  It was larger and passed by much the same way. The first light had seemed to pick its spot in the sky to diminish in brightness.  Light number two seemed to decide on turning in our direction more aggressively at this point I felt nervous and turned off my headlights. Upon turning off my headlights, the second light went the same as the first.  This one persisted as the third enter from the right. My co-witness captured crude photos on his cell phone as well as a short video capturing their pass. The third light, more consistent in brightness did not seem to notice us as it passed by and went the way of the previous two. These lights were bright and clearly different from the other celestial bodies.  I compared it to my wife later as a fireball who's light reflected off a thin mist. When we returned home upon completing a short scan for any other such objects we noticed a second 'patch' of three similarly moving, similarly colored objects moving on the horizon.  The second patch was too far to see with the same profound detail however the similar behavior led us to a relative conclusion. The reason for the + followed by the question mark is that along with the obviously unique sightings mentioned earlier, a huge number of 'stars' were acting very odd.  More like a junebug around a streetlight then a star.  Wiggling and pulling from side to side.  These 'wigglers' can be found nearly every night however the six fireballs are things we have never seen before and defy our ability to explain.",2014-08-01T00:00:00,43.4632,-71.4709

It was so bright that it was disturbing to me and I grabbed her in fear and shouted, ""What the heck is that?"" She explained that it caught her attention because it was so bright against the still dark sky and she first observed it as a ball of light which quickly changed into a triangle and then quickly changed back into a ball of light again.  She said it reminded her of a holographic image the way it changed from one shape to another. It moved too fast to be an air craft and we wondered if it could have been a meteor although I have never seen a meteor that low to the tree line and that large.  It frightened me.   There was also no sound at all associated with this light.  It passed right above us and then completely disappeared, like a light bulb turning off, within about 5 or 6 seconds.

Around 9 pm, we all witnessed a bizarre string of lights over the trees in the distance in the North sky.  This object was far too wide to be plane.  I estimate that the object was a few thousand feet from the ground, as it was below the clouds.   The lights from this point of view were in flat string, as if all the lights were in a row on the same level.  The lights stayed there for about 5 minutes, without moving.  There were 5 lights, 4 red and one yellow.  After it hovered for about 5 minutes, it began moving towards the Northwest.  There was no sound coming from the object. It had a triangular shape.  There were two lights in the front, two lights on the outer tail-end wings, and one located in the middle of the object.   It moved in a very direct path.  As it was moving northwest, it changed shape.  The rear right light (when looking at it, the rear left light if looking at it from behind), moved to the front of the object as if it was rotating, however the object never changed paths.   When the object was coming from the North, a slight outline of the object could be seen, which was triangular.  The sun had set, but the sky in the northwest was still a light blue color.  As it moved into the light blue area of the sky, it was clear that the object was transparent.  The outline of the object could no longer be seen.  We could see the sky through the object, as if the object was not there at all. The object continued moving northwest until it was out of sight. There were no other vehicles/objects that were seen following this craft.  Upon further investigation on the Internet,  I found that someone had reported a helicopter following the same path (of an object of the same description) about 2 hours after the event. I have never seen anything of this size in the sky, nor have I ever seen an object change shapes while continuing to move in the same direction.  It’s hard to say due to the unknown distance and height how big the object was.  Although even if it were a plane straight over our heads it would only be a fraction of the size of this object.

I had some friends over for a hot dog roast and they had just left.  I went outside to bring in items from a yard sale we had earlier that day and I was walking towards my carport.   I looked up and saw a bunch of circles hovering in the distance and yelled for my sister and her friend to come outside and they freaked out and told me to film it.  I didn't have my phone so I ran into the house grabbed mine and ran back out.   While I did that, they grabbed their phones, too.  I started my camera app and tried to record with my iPhone but the lights didn't show up on the screen, so I put my phone in my pocket and just watched it.  All of a sudden it started moving towards us and as it got closer it looked more and more like a triangle and I pulled out my phone again and could see the lights on the screen, so I started to record it.   The object passed over-head, it was massive.  Others and I estimate it to be 300 to 500 feet wide in size.  The object emitted 6 lights.  The front light was white, followed by a set of 2 lights that were red/green at the same time, and those where followed by a set of three white/yellow lights.all of the lights pulsated.  It continued on a path south west.   I remembered that my friends had just left and shouldn't be that far down the road so I stopped recording and called them and told them to look towards the sky towards my house they pulled over on the highway and watched it while discussing it with me till it was out of sight.  Other people I don't even know have reported seeing it on Facebook too.  Sorry for the profanity in the video she was a little freaked out.  I have tried submitting this to MUFON twice and within hours the case is missing from there database I screen shotted the thank you note that includes the case numbers as proof.   Also the UFOstalker web site which automatically saves cases to track in real-time still has these cases listed along with the descriptions.  I just find it weird that MUFON would do this.

Immediately I saw a weird dot that seemed to be made up of different colors.  I told my dad and brother and they saw it too.   At this moment it was just staying in a single place, not moving left right up or down.  After a couple minutes my dad ran in the house to get my mom and a pair of binoculars.  He came out with the binoculars and we each took turns looking through them.  It gave instant clarity to what we were looking at.   What I saw was four separate lights shaped in lines; unfortunately I couldn’t make out a shape, only the lights.  If I were to guess I would say that it was a d! isk.  They almost looked like a crosshair in the sky with each line being a different color.  It was hard for me to see the colors but what I could make out was white, red, green, yellow/orange.  The thing is though is that at least one of them changed colors because I know I saw blue/purple at one point.   After another couple minutes using the binoculars my mom came out.  I had the binoculars at this point and almost right after my mom came out the colors starting slowly spinning.  I stopped looking through the binoculars and saw that not only did it start spinning but it also went from multiple colors to all white, then all red.

It looked high in altitude, maybe 500-1000 ft.  While I stared at it with disbelief a second one appeared behind it.  Then a third and a fourth.  All four seemed to travel in the same direction.  The first one moved on a bit faster than the rest.   I recorded the incident on my iphone.  I did some research on Chinese lanterns and how people mistake them for UFO.  With the videos I watched I can say with certainty that these were not lanterns.  They did not start as a faint light in the distant and get closer as a lantern would.  The sky was clear and dark and the lights just turned on at around 1000 ft.!!   After researching UFOS reported I found this website.

At roughly 20:55 on Thursday night, my wife and I were lying in bed with the windows open. We both heard an odd sound in our normally quiet high altitude pine forest neighborhood.  It sounded like people chanting, but quite eerie.  Then we heard what sounded like gun shots.  We have coyotes and bears in the neighborhood, and so I questioned if our neighbor was scaring some animals off, but these noises were definitely not the typical animal sounds we have heard in the past. So, I went out to see if I could see anything.  I walked out the back porch without turning on the light.  I couldn’t hear anything.  I was facing Northeast.  I saw multiple blue lights (orbs?) above me in the sky.  The sky was cloud-free and not much of a wind.  There was no moon light out.  We live away from much light pollution.  These blue lights were moving smoothly, quickly and intertwining.  I though initially someone had shot off a firework or flare, but the sound was quiet.   The lights moved directionally, then I noticed they straightened out and shot up toward above the back peak and toward the Reno area.  The blue lights then seem to make themselves look like stars. During this time there was a bigger object following slightly behind and amongst them.  If I remember correctly it was round or oval.  I think it was translucent and had various lights on it.  These lights were yellow, red, and blue and seemed to glow.  Again no sound was heard.   I don’t remember where it went or if it just disappeared over the pine trees.  I could not judge how big it was but I had a feeling it was rather close to the ground and not too big.  If it were not for the preceding blue lights I would have thought this to possibly be a big drone, but this was not. The entire sighting lasted at my best guest 5-10 seconds.  There was some road construction occurring above our neighborhood on the Hwy 431 and they usually have many lights to help them work, but I could not see their lights. I can truly say I saw something that was unidentified.  The closest military base is over 50 miles away Northeast of us in Fallon.   I am hoping others post this sighting.

This ball of light disappeared when it reached the same location in the sky.  All the objects reached the same point in the sky within about 10-15 seconds of each other.  As we stood in disbelief we noticed that the point in the sky where the objects disappeared seemed to black out other stars.  We noticed a circler type black spot in the sky.  Then we noticed the dark spot slowly fade out revealing the stars behind it.   After the whole incident ended we noticed a very unusually amount of small engine aircraft in the area.  Just small planes,  No helicopters.  We counted 5 planes total.  Which is also unusual for this particular area.

It was maybe 200 feet up in the air, and it was a hexagonal shape, and on the bottom of the craft, there was a large blue circular light in the middle, and smaller blue circular lights at each corner of the hexagon.

I looked up and saw a very bright red light moving from north to south over the house.   I told my daughter to look at the airplane.  It was moving across the sky directly overhead very fast. I looked like the speed of a low flying aircraft, but was not low.   I watched for a minute then noticed another following it, and then another.  They were all in a line and quite a ways behind each other.   All took the same path.  I would guess it to be at 10,000 feet and extremely bright orange.  There was fairly heavy clouds cover to the south, and they disappeared behind the clouds before reaching the horizon.  I thought they were below the clouds due them being as bright as they were.  I watched them until they disappeared in the clouds in the southern sky.   My wife was in the front of the house and asked me if I had seen them.  She said they looked like flares shooting out of the ground! when she first saw them.  I would agree that it had the color and brightness of a flare.  It flew like an extremely fast aircraft, but I never heard a sound.  The brightness of the orange light, the speed by which they moved, and the lack of any audible noise struck me as odd.   I have never seen anything quite like this. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) You are correct. It was the 10th, at about 21:00.

My friend, who pointed in the air, then told us to look.  3 of the 4 of us saw what looked like a thick blackish-gray disc, hovering in the air a few hundred feet out.  It was not a plane, because we had seen many moving around that night.   I thought it was a balloon floating up but my friend and I stood up and approached the edge of the rooftop to get a better view and I quickly ruled that out.  What I personally saw was something that looked large enough to not be a balloon, and it was definitely oscillating.  It made no sound, but I did not expect it to at our distance.   I rationalized at first it was a balloon floating from the light into the atmosphere and thus disappearing, but something was off about that idea.  However, as I approached it went from a darker color to gray, and then disappeared almost as if backing away.   We all 3 were very creeped out and thought it was a drone or definitely a UFO.

At this time, two neighbors came out and asked what we were doing, to which we pointed out.  Needless to say, they were in awe.

The visibility of the sky was completely clear of any clouds, making all the stars and airplanes visible to the naked eye.   The appearance of the object my boyfriend and I saw was much brighter, and larger than any star.  The object was traveling at the rate of which seemed to be a fast airplane, but had no blinking lights, as all of the airplanes seen in the sky flying at the same time had.   The object headed to what seemed to be directly across the sky right over us, bearing no sound, and suddenly appeared to change direction heading  south in the sky; away from us, toward a star in the sky.  We continued to watch it closely, almost in dismay; captivated, as the object still had no sign of any blinking lights and had no change in its form; staying a consistent bright sphere of light.   The object appeared to then not just be flying south, but straight up toward the star just south of us.  As we watched my my boyfriend stated “look it’s starting to fade”, and then right before our eyes  the object just disappeared; which happened in seconds. I was absolutely dumbfounded, the object appeared to be there in the sky one moment and then what I would describe as it telescoping, farther straight up in the sky, and as it did so, it seemed to have a reddish color as it vanished into the sky.  Something like out of a movie, as a star ship might go into hyper drive, and all you see is the afterburners of its jets. The whole occurrence lasted about 60 seconds, to a minute and a half long.

After receiving a call from a co-worker, I stepped out to my backyard to observe the skies south east of my home in Oak Grove, Oregon.  The following account documents my observations over the next 2 hours. Within minutes, I spotted over a half dozen stationary objects in what appeared to be a ""V"" type formation, in symmetrical and near perfect alignment.  Using my binoculars and a tripod to steady my view, I concluded these things were motionless, and displayed in common, a distinct array of multi-colored flickering lights, green, red and yellow. Within the first 20 minutes 2 additional objects appeared from the south taking positions flanking the formations southeast wing.  These two objects appeared more distant than the others and  not as bright, still displaying colored lights and assuming symmetrical positions in reference to the other objects. Separate from the formation was an object with the same features including the colored lights in a stationary position.  This object was positioned more north from the other objects and shined brighter. During my observation of this activity, I was drawn to observe an entirely different type of object which appeared much closer to my home and much larger as it moved from dead south in a northwesterly direction.  Its elevation was extremely low, and it was traveling at a low rate of speed very similar to the way the Goodyear blimp might travel.  Because of its low proximity to the ground I was only able to observe it briefly, as it passed by the trees across from my home, obstructing my view.  I would describe its shape to be similar to that of the bottom of a pie pan.  The entire shape was lit up as if its exterior was amplifying a bright light from within.  I made no further observations of this object for the remainder of the evening. Approximately 11:30 p.m., I made the most astounding observation.  Appearing from the south directly headed over my home and my neighbors I saw two lights approaching my location in a direct south to north flight path.  As it approached I was able to get a clear view as it passed directly overhead. Its frame was shaped like a ""V"" bearing one large, dimly lit, milky white  spherical light, toward the outer most portion of each wing.  These lights were not projecting any light they were more or less just a steady glow, with no fluctuating characteristics.  I can only guess that this craft was flying at an altitude near 3000 to 5000 feet.  I could make out its shape as it displaced the background of the sky above me.  As for its size, it appeared larger than anything I've ever seen, military or otherwise.  What also seems very strange is that as this craft moved in a slow steady northward direction, it made absolutely no sound.  No sound whatsoever. Curious about the previous nights observations, I decided to observe the skies again the following night at 9:30 p.m., making similar observations with the stationary lights ""V"" type formation.  This time there weren't as many.  I counted five, one in the center, flanked by two on either side set apart by identical distance, each bearing the same colored light signatures. As with the night before, there was one singular object shining brightly above my house, slightly westward. I woke up at 4 am and stepped out to see if the lights were still there, only to find they were nowhere to be found.",2014-08-01T00:00:00,45.4462,-122.6393

Beautiful. I called my neighbors out and they saw the second object as it came over the trees and their house.  They then disappeared in the east, possibly No. Fort Myers.  A short while later I called my neighbors out again as I saw 2 orange lights in the east, one directly above the other, then another appeared and then another.  We watched them for a while and they disappeared, then we saw 2 of them to the north of us.   I later saw 1 of them in the sea, which went out of sight after a few minutes.  I gave up watching and went into my home and out to the ((name deleted)) which faces south and saw 2 of them coming from the sw and then they disap! peared from sight.   I did not have the cell phone with me when they were so close and missed a great picture for you.  I went into the house to get it but none of them came close enough after that.  The time is approximate.  There was no sound from the objects.   On another occasion, November 19, 2013, my sister and I left our house (faces north), I looked up and I saw a very bright white light slightly nw and in front of us, it started to blink..then another bright light came on slightly ne and it started to blink then another in the center (but in front of the others forming a triangle) came on and started to blink.  All three blinked together for a few seconds then they all went out at the same time.  IT was huge as at my level there is about 160 feet of land between two of the lights.  I hate to lump this together but there is one other occasion.  I can't recall the date but one evening coming home on Gator Circle I saw something odd in the sky.  I turned south at ne 13th ave and s! topped to ask 2 girls if they needed help as they were parked with no lights on..they said no, we're taking pictures.   I turned my car around and saw in the north 3 red lights on what must have been a huge object and then saw the object I had just seen and another go into that dark area.  I said, look, theres two of them and they said ...there were six.  The huge object then very slowly turned to the north, started moving in that direction then just disappeared in the distance.  I asked the girls if they had pictures, they said yes but they weren't very good.  Then we left the area.  I lumped this for your info as I hadn't made reports on these.

It seemed to also be watching the fireworks display although it seemed like it was very high up in the sky.  I couldn’t stop looking at it because of the intensity of the color.  It eventually moved back and forth a little bit and I could see a red light right in the center of the green lights.  It also became a little larger and I could see that the green lights were not like one would see on an airplane.  Besides, this craft seemed round or saucer shaped so definitely not an airplane.  The best way I can describe it is that it was like looking at the top of a carousel with the green lights going round and round really fa! st.  The way the craft moved also made it highly unlikely this was something that originated on this planet. There were no turns to change direction, like an airplane would have to make. I took some pictures with my Samsung Galaxy 3 but they aren’t very good as this craft was so high in the sky.  Eventually the craft started to move south as the fireworks display was ending.  I was sad to see it go as it seemed to be enjoying the fireworks.  I have never seen a UFO before and this has really had an impact on me.

Moving in the same direction it looked like a mix between a dimly lit (yet palely shining) cloud and the aurora borealis.  Almost like the ‘Nexus’ from the Star Trek movie if it also fit the description of the dimly shining aurora borealis cloud.  It also looked as if you were looking at an extremely large seagull as it flew directly above you. Over the next 20 to 30 minutes I saw about 12 more of the cloud shaped UFO’s in various sizes.

A few steps ahead of me she called back me, ""Honey, what's that?"", fully expecting me to provide a comfortable and critical natural explanation for the large and very bright light in the sky.  Now standing at the front of the house and facing North I see a very bright sphere of light that I first assume is either a very near and low-flying aircraft or a very large fireball coming straight at us. I am an amateur astronomer and cosmology buff for over thirty years.  I am critical nearly to the point of cynical, yet I find myself refusing to admit that what we saw was anything other than unfamiliar or not earthly technology. Looking North from the Niagara River the object appeared about 5 degrees above Polaris and appeared to be getting closer as its size and brilliance increased.  A very bright orange/yellow it was similar in size and somewhat in color to the street light on the road in front of our house before it stopped approaching (or increasing in size).  It outshone the streetlight only seven meters away.  Until that moment I was getting a little fearful that this may be a city killer asteroid coming straight at us.  There was no sound and no trail behind it.  It was headed straight at us or it wasn't a massive bolide at all.  It appeared to slow or stop so the bolide question was answered. I opened the door to the house and yelled for the children (ages 8 and 30) to rush outside.  The object, now at its nearest, would no longer appear to be coming Southward toward us, but slip Westward at great speed, then stop, then slip on over some more, then stop.  It did this about eight times before remaining stationary.  The whole time it scintillated as the stars do above a moist sky.  The four of us stood there with our eyes trained on it while it begin to shrink and dim in spurts as though it may have been moving away from us the way it had been moving to the West with the jerky movements.  With each successive ""pulse"" it grew smaller and fainter.  It didn't seem like it was moving away.  It appeared more like it was just shrinking and fading. I have no idea of how large or distant the object was.  I'm no expert at scale. I can only relate the scale by saying the object at its most brightest and biggest was easily as large as my thumbnail with my arm outstretched in front of me.  I spent some of the night and this morning looking for news of sightings over anywhere from Niagara Falls to Ottawa.  I just can't seem to guess how far it was away. The light surrounded the object.  High humidity would have easily revealed beams of light from lamps as it did for every other passing aircraft that night and most nights. There were no beams, just a large, very bright scintillating light moving awkwardly through the sky. As I told my wife before sleep, I was so excited to have witnessed the event.  I didn't know what I invited my children to see.  Did I call my little boy outside to witness the end of his life by an asteroid, or was this an alien craft and what were their intentions?  It was all very exciting and terrifying at the same time.  I have never felt like that before.  Skeptics don't get much excitement. All my life I have wanted to see a ""UFO"".  Two weeks ago my wife and I and one of our sons observed a daytime object and actually had time to retrieve two sets of binoculars for further observation.  I was unable to explain what I saw.  It looked like a large building made of up compartments (cubes) or maybe like a bunch of buildings stuck together. It wasn't round anywhere.  The Sun reflected brightly from only one small part at a time as it moved across the sky.  The rest of it appeared a dark grey or black.  Without binoculars it simply appeared to be a small ball of light as you would expect from sunlight reflected from a metallic object.  It caught our attention in the first place because it was so high in the sky yet didn't appear to be moving (like all the rest of high-flying air traffic was doing).  It did move large distances in quick moments somewhat like the ball of light last night.  We lost track of it after each quick shot across some distance, then found it s! tationery ahead of the direction it seemed to go.  We lost it for good the third time. I told my son, ""You are so fortunate to have witnessed such a thing. That could very well have been people from another world!"".  Wow!  I never expected something like that to come out of this skeptic's mouth.  My childhood dream of seeing a UFO is now fulfilled - twice in one month.  Although my son (age 8) also has his own telescope and a very good knowledge of astronomy and cosmology, I don't think he entirely grasps the measure of what we witnessed together. I really don't know exactly what we saw, but I'm still sort of in a state of shock.  I woke up still excited from last night's events.  My wife and I can't stop remarking at how last night's viewing was the first time I did not have my cell phone with me. I could have recorded video...",2014-07-04T00:00:00,42.9001,-78.9329

Large pulsating (5sec) white light in sky above New Orleans for 20+ min.,New Orleans,LA,2014-06-29T02:00:00,unknown,20+ minutes,"Occurred : 6/29/2014 02:00  (Entered as : 06/29/2014 02:00) Reported: 6/29/2014 4:40:02 AM 04:40 Posted: 7/4/2014 Location: New Orleans, LA Shape: Unknown Duration:20+ minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110814.html,"Large pulsating (5sec) white light in sky above New Orleans for 20+ min. A friend and I saw a white light in the sky directly overhead as I was leaving her house tonight, around 2:40AM in New Orleans, La, June 29, 2014.  It appeared to be holding a position for 5-10 minutes just above a cloud layer that obscured most of the stars, and could not have been more than a few miles above the ground.  The object appeared to be roughly the size of a house (but I’m normally not a great judge of size at such a distance).  I can say for sure, though, that it was either extremely large, or very close, as in, incomparably larger than the perceived size of a star at my distance.  I should also make clear that we never saw its contours--we only saw the light coming through the dark cloud layer that created the almost starless night, tonight.  It quickly faded to full brightness and back to darkness (as opposed to blinking) periodically, every 5 seconds, the entire time it was in-sight. I sent my friend to retrieve her point and shoot camera, hoping it would have better light sensitivity than my iPhone 5S, but as soon as she returned, the light disappeared. We stared for another 2-3 minutes and it did not return.  Before finally leaving, I walked back inside to attempt to see if anyone had spoken with the New Orleans Police Department, but no one answered their non-emergency line.  After about 20 minutes of that and speaking with my friend about the occurrence, I stepped back outside to leave.  The light was back.  This time, it appeared just to the right of the same pair of stars it had appeared near earlier.  I ran back inside to grab my friend and we watched it pulsate for another several minutes, attempting to video tape, but the light was too faint for the camera.  This time, the light appeared to be moving away and then towards us. I thought I saw a flash or two from possible neighboring objects, but it was so faint that I can’t tell for sure.  My friend als! o claimed that the light was faintly tinted blue, and I may have caught that once or twice, as well, but once again, I can’t tell for sure. After a good bit of thought, the following are the points that stand out to me:   1.	  I have only ever seen a combination of red and white lights coming from man-operated aircraft. The fact that this light was purely white is interesting to me. 2. 	The regularity of the pulsating of the light (5 seconds between ON states. For whatever reason, this made me lean towards “man-made.” But, who knows?)  3.	  The size and proximity. My friend suggested that it could be a satellite, but I don’t think it could be so close or so big. I will research the likelihood of this as soon as I’m done filing this report. 4.	  The fact that the object “disappeared” and “returned.” I believe it’s possible that there were multiple thin layers of obscuring clouds, and that enough finally came between us and the object that it was finally obscured completely. Thinking in these terms, its return was simply those clouds continuing past the object. From this, one may conclude that it disappeared and reappeared, or that it never left. From this, one might also infer that it was moving slowy the whole time and was not exactly static as implied in the first paragraph of this report. 5.	  UPDATE: 4:38AM, CURRENT TIME: Said friend just called and said someone walked into her back door (that she negligently left unlocked). She believes she say a T-shirt, so we’ll assume he was human. This most likely has no connection to the white light, but I thought I’d mention it. 6.	  Apparently, the International Space Station has just passed over us, but that was the evening before this one, Friday June 27 2014 at 8:41PM:  http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=United_States&region=Louisiana&city=New_Orleans#.U6_1aY1dVH0 a.	  Also, the ISS is described as having a constant white light, and specifically not a flashing light, from the two articles I’ve read on it. That is all!

It moved incredibly slow and hovered, and would slowly zig zag up and down and then would sit stil and move quickly along.   The flying object traveled from the south of Allentown to the west.   When trees were blocking the UFO, I ran to the front of my house and no longer saw it.

Last night my son and I were freaked out and stayed up half the night afraid something would happen.  As we were going to bed, I noticed my radio in the bedroom had some serious interference.  I started to feel sick and dizzy and had an over all feeling of being watched, but was going to bed.  I laid in bed feeling really uneasy.   A few minutes later my 17 year old son came running up the stairs into my room, saying he felt like he was being watched and had a feeling like something was about to happen and his chest hurt.  He said his cell phone has no service which was odd because we never have that issue where we live.  I checked my phone and it was not working at all.  We didn't turn any lights on in our home and crept outside to see if a UFO was somewhere in site.  We didn't see anything, but both of us were too scared to really get out in the open to check.

The radio interference, cell phone problems and uneasy feelings stopped after 1am.  My son and I were so scared that we stayed awake most of the night.

I thought they were the orange street lights on the highway at first, but as I kept staring I noticed that the three lights were forming an acute triangle and they were not moving very fast.  I tried looking for a string or wire they could have been hanging off of, but I couldn't see anything.   It was a cloudy night so I couldn't make out any stars or planes in sight.  These three lights just sort of hovered above the 25th St. shopping center near Olive Garden.   We started to drive underneath them and I had to turn my head back to look at them (which means they were not moving or they were moving very slowly).  They were pretty bright lights and they did not flicker or flash at all.  They were pretty stagnant as well; they didn't move around a lot and they kept the triangle shape consistent.  Today 8/4/14 my boyfriend drove on Rt. 22 again and drove on the same exact spot that we saw the lights at last night, but they were not there anymore.  They were too low to the ground to be air planes and too high up to be street lights.   I tried for hours to try and come up with a logical explanation and I couldn't.  I do not want to jump to conclusions, but it looked like all the stories you hear about UFO's.",2014-08-08T00:00:00,,

Also, compared to where we live in NJ the ground light pollution is much less so we actually could see the stars, etc., very well.

It was very very high, more like out of earth’s atmosphere (a lot).  It looked like a very large circular-shaped object passing earth in space.  It was moving from our position from west to east in the direction of Europe/the Atlantic.  From when we saw it first till it disappeared beyond the treetop line it was about 45-60 seconds. It was very gradually lighting up, but not to a very bright white light, than it went gradually back to dark and alternatively back to light.  Very steady and even change of brightness.

Originally with the air traffic from MSP I was expecting an aircraft of some sort.  At about 130th street I was able to better make out the object and saw no other running lights, which aroused my interest.  The object was about the speed of a light plane and continued changing the observation angle to the point where I was directly under it. It was round with no appendages.  The outer edges of the object were a dark red and the object was an increasingly brighter red toward it's center.  There was a bright white light in the center which varied from very bright to much less so. I saw this object while I traveled 3/4 mile at 40 mph and it crossed from my right front to overhead and to my rear in that time.  It crossed my line of sight going into trees.  It was no higher than 500 feet in my estimation, steady in that elevation and by reconsidering my positions on a map it was traveling to the South-SouthWest, against the reported breeze from the South.  It was 5 to 8 feet in diameter if its elevation was 500 feet, proportionally greater if higher in elevation.  It was sharp and distinct when seen closer and especially when it was directly overhead.   Total time of the observation was about 45 seconds.  This was just after sunset with cloudy skies.  I had two cameras with me, shame on me for not stopping and trying to grab a picture, or two. Conventional explanation seems limited to a balloon flare but the object was going against a light, but prevailing breeze. With many people out on the Fourth looking at fireworks, some kind of balloon drone combination would have to be considered too.

About 10 of them, then perhaps 20-30 more flashing on and off intermittently.   Then the white lights appeared to blink on and off in a kind of photon white blue, very bright.  Back and forth randomly blinking on and off or just holding position these lights sprinkled on and off.   Then some white lights appeared to streak across the air in front of the mountain range back and forth very fast.  Some of the lights appeared to leave momentary trails of white behind as they zoomed across the sky.  Then some of the blue lights, about 3 or 4 of them to the left blinked on a bright vibrant transparent light above them and looked like a dome shape.  On and off very quickly ... then the blue lights appeared to have a brilliant red light right next to or within it.   The lights danced across the foothills up down all around in various areas.  Then some of the red lights had beams of red light flash on and off here and there.  To my visible eye, these beams were only a couple of inches long beaming down, but could have been yards or more.   I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime.  The strangest thing is that to my eyes these flashes of light would have all appeared separate.

The exact shape is hard for me to remember but they were not overly large and had a shape unlike any I had ever seen in a military or domestic aircraft.  What I remember like it was yesterday, though is how the formation was too perfect and why was there no sound being emitted if they were so low in the sky.   Some of my neighbors' children started to yell UFO mom UFO's.  I looked at mom who was white as a ghost and at the same time we uttered to each other frigging UFO's.   Our neighbors' parents came outside and the father uttered holy shit!  What the hell are those.  The objects slowly and in perfect exact formation started to drift out of sight.  I remember wanting to call the police or the Air National Guard base to report this sighting, because it absolutely spooked the hell out of us, but I decided not to, out of fear of not being believed.",2014-06-13T00:00:00,44.86216021505377,-68.83885806451613

Three white (my dad says they were red, as he remembers) lights in form of triangle.  It was flying from west to east, first thoughts were it was a plane of some kind until it stopped in mid air in a blink of an eye.   We both knew no plane could just halt like that, it wasn't slowing down to stop, it just stopped and that was wierd as hell at the time.  It hanged there for about 30 seconds, the lights were still shining bright.   And then like that it took off with incredible speed like I never seen before,  We were awestruck.

Blinded by craft. 25+ minute sighting. In the summer months of 2003, I was heading home traveling West bound on Highway 40 towards Hanes mall.  It was around this point that an egg shaped pod with two large spheres on either side is seen flying around 1,500 ft, at approximately 40-70mph in a South-Eastern direction.   We decided to follow as far as we could and figure out what this was.  Myself and my passenger kept watch on the object as it changed direction, heading towards Lexington.  The object began making a turn, at which point we exited on Hickory Tree Rd. and parked in the Harris Teeter lot to watch as it began its turn.   The object turned to face us directly, and flew toward our vehicle at a slow pace.  It was visible at this time for over 1 minute.  I could clearly make out an off white color, and  spheres on either side that looked from the front like insect eyes.   Flying about 800 ft above ground at this point, the craft activated these spheres, which emitted a blinding flash of brilliant white light.  Both myself and passenger were blinded for what I would guess was about 10 seconds, and by this time, the object was gone. I grew up on military bases most of my life, and so I recognize very easily a military or civilian aircraft and its flight characteristics.  This was not one of them.  This may have been some kind of drone.   I don't think we even checked to see if we were missing time, but now that I think about it, it's all together possible.",2014-06-13T00:00:00,35.9029,-80.257

On the night of April the 18th of 2004, myself and my mother were witness to a greenish/grey disk shaped object, some miles away, and I can only guess, around ~7,000ft off the deck.  This object was first observed as I walked from a friends house back to mine. It looked at first like a star, but seemed very bright.  We observed the object painfully slowly move across the sky in a Northerly direction.  Over the course of 30 minutes this object moved about 1 mile, if I had to make a guess.  It then began to rise at an angle of about 30 degrees and then slowly made a dual loop going back in a Southerly direction from whence it was originally spotted.  It completely a full two loops over the course of 15 minutes, and then began going up, down, and side to side in the same area, maybe 1 mile in length.  I happened to have borrowed a friends digital camera just a few days before, and started zooming to the cameras maximum onto the object.  Three photos were taken, and wh! at I found later blew me away.  A clear and classic disk with a half bubble shape in the center is seen while the object is (I think) tilted towards me.  Two consecutive photos show the object from its side, and reveal an oreo cookie type craft of two disks sandwiching a center black (From that far away and being night time,  I could not see the center) area. This event repeated over two evenings.  The first lasting longer than the second. On the second night the object appeared much later.  This time around 1:00am.  It completed a series of maneuvers, very slowly, just like before, and then just blinked out.

It was 5 lights in the shape of a triangle, or from the angle I saw it the shape looked like a ""backwards"" checkmark.  The 5 lights changed from a very bright (soft) white color to all 5 turning red with no dimming in between.  It was either white or red.  The lights pulsed all at the same time between white and red.   The object flew in a direction I haven't seen flown by aircraft in my area.  The object moved very slowly and made no sound.  After a minute or so it disappeared behind trees.   Within a minute of the object disappearing I saw the second object. I saw it exactly in the sky where I first saw the first object.  The pulsing lights, colors, apparent height, and speed were to me exactly the same as the first object.  It stayed in my view the same amount of time as the first object, and disappeared over the same area in the trees as the first.  Later when I was! thinking about this I came up with the idea (possibly) this was actually one object and I saw lights on the front and backside.   Unfortunately, I don't remember seeing the stars in between the lights being blotted out.  I wasn't even looking for that at the time because I assumed it was two separate objects, especially since it would have been a massive size.  FYI, I am an amateur astronomer for about 20 years and have fairly good observation skills. The things that strike me about this is the number of lights and their colors, how the lights blinked in unison with no dimming in between, the slow speed, no sound, a different flight path from normal over my area, the fact the second object (had they both been airplanes) would have been flying in the ""air wake"" of the first, which I think airplanes avoid.",2014-06-04T00:00:00,41.7351,-88.0447

Suddenly, half a dozen or so bright blue lights appeared out over the ocean, perhaps an eighth of a mile off shore.  When I pointed them out, each person stopped to watch in amazement. The lights were orb-like in shape and appeared relatively small from that distance, and they seemed to be dancing with one another like fireflies.  They swirled about each other at a constant speed, similar to the way summer gnats do.  Though it was a dark night, we could see the lights moving in and out of an overhead cloud that was heavy enough to obscure them when they flew into it.  They continued to move in and out of the cloud, randomly swirling about.  They made no sound whatsoever. This phenomenon simply astounded me, and I ran along the shore telling everyone, “Look! Do you see those lights?  What are they?!”  Nobody had an answer.  They just froze in place and kept watching.  When I finally asked an older Hawaiian man these questions, he said, calmly, “Oh, those are just the fishermen’s lights.”  I asked what he meant, and said that the lights were up in the air and not coming from any boats.  He said, “We've seen these lights for many, many years here, and we just call them the fishermen’s lights.”   After about five minutes, the lights faded from view.   I stayed up very late watching the skies, but I never saw them again.  During that last week of my stay on Kauai, I kept asking everyone I met if they had ever seen these lights.  Few had. But several older hippies who lived way back in Kalalau Valley said the Air Force was constantly chasing things out over the ocean in that direction, and that they’d heard plenty of rumors about UFO sightings, especially over the ocean between Kauai and Ni’ihau. I’m almost 60 years old and I remain haunted by this experience, which has never been explained to my satisfaction.  I came to this website looking for any description of a similar occurrence, but found none. Puna area on the Big Island of Hawaii was also known for a rash of UFO sightings by Japanese anthurium farmers during the mid-70s, and there had been several newspaper articles on that topic when I first moved there in 1977.  I was told by the late Dr. Graham Odgers, Canadian head of the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope project, that a famous international UFO committee (of which he was a long-time member) held its annual meeting in Hakalau on Big Island in 1979.  I remain convinced that something serious and quite mysterious has been going on out there for a very long time.",2014-04-24T00:00:00,,

I've been wanting to tell this event for a long time, we lived on the corner of 13th and F streets in downtown. across the street from our apartment was a vacant lot where I would walk my dog and let him re-leave himself.   I had walked him over to the lot and he went, my two son's where in the apartment, my youngest was 2 years old and my oldest was 15 years old.   As I was headed back across the street to go home, I don't know what made me look up? maybe it was something my dog did, but I did, I looked up.  It was one of those nights where the fog was sitting just above the tops of the buildings, not on the ground.   There in the fog I saw lights in the shape of a triangle, hovering just above me in the fog.  The triangle was large maybe about 10 ft per side.  I ran back in the house with the dog and told my oldest son to come out with me fast so he could see it, we left the dog in the house and went back down to the street.   The triangle light was still there, we stood there n the middle of the crosswalk staring up at the sky.  For the next several minutes we watched what is somewhat difficult to describe, other than it reminded me of something you might see when dealing with special effects on television, (computers now), but that's not how I would have described it then.   The triangle divided itself in half smoothly without a break in the light, into two triangles, always touching at some point, as they seemed to roll along the others side, before dividing again turning into three then four, almost dancing off of each other.  The lights where bright blues and reds, always changing. It was like watching nothing I have ever seen from anything that I know could be in the sky.   Standing there fixated on these lights, we heard some neighbors come out of the apartment just a few doors down on F street, seeing us standing there staring up into the sky, we heard them laugh and say something to the matter of, ""what the hell are they doing?"" I turned my head and looked at them, there were two people there, and at that point they had looked up, the next thing I heard was, "" Holly ((word deleted)),"" as they too saw the lights in the sky, and then out of no where the lights vanished and it stopped.   The strangest thing about this event, was years later my youngest son when he was somewhere between 8 to 11 years old, told me he remembered as an infant being visited by what he would later know as aliens.    Having very vivid memory's myself as early as 2 years of age about just life, normal stuff, I am inclined to believe him. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They were odd, I didn’t realize at first what I was seeing, but in the back of my mind something was telling me to keep checking them out.  I am an aviation buff, love all things that fly, and also know my town pretty well and it didn’t add up that there were lights where they were, and that they didn’t fit anything I had seen before. This is my second sighting, the first being a single green orb UFO I reported back in 06’ and was with about 10 people who could verify what we saw.. These lights were a pulsating/light flickering type that change from orange to red, or were red and had an orange hazy light that would come on and overpower the red...hard to explain. I noticed 1, then I saw 2, then the third as I came into an area that they were in a clearing and could see them.. at that point my jaw dropped and I fumbled to get my cell out and get it in camera mode.. of course it had to pop up with a ton of different warnings about wifi being on so no flash.. blah blah blah.. all those crummy photo messing up blurbs that in this case REALLY cost me some good footage.  I was trying to get to video mode and actually accidentally took a shaky picture of them.  they can be seen in it. Okay they were in a triangular formation in the sky, and before or during my trying to take the picture, one I thought had vanished, in the picture it shows the two lower lights coming together more closely.. so that explains that.. A car came up behind me and I HAD to deal with that, I didn’t want to as I was going to miss the event.. errr.. bad dang luck.. so I drove toward them and quickly pulled into a post office parking lot. There I get the truck stopped and jump out...by that time they were a dim flicker in the sky, they had turned a more metallic shimmer and all together vanished :(  I will be keeping my eyes peeled to the sky even more than before.

I went out before her, lit my smoke and from the top of the stairs to our patio, my wife asked asked, “What are those?  They aren’t planes.”  I looked up to where she was pointing to the SSW.  There were two orangish orbs that were flickering slightly. The first thought I had was that they were Chinese Lanterns.  However, the hair on the back of my neck stood up as I realized that they were moving towards us and, far too fast to be any sort of lantern or balloon.  The objects appeared to be at 2,000 - 3,000 feet in altitude, moving at 200-300 miles per hour.  The two objects traveled silently and in apparent formation, perhaps 2,500 feet apart.  They traveled at a constant rate and did not change bearing. As the objects approached, not quite overhead, but maybe offset by about 15-degrees from directly overhead, I noticed that the glowing, flickering orange nearly disappeared and I was able to observe the underside of the objects, which appeared round in shape with a dark center and a ring of somewhat dim, fuzzy light around it.  The two objects disappeared behind our building.  I considering running through the front of the apartment to see if I could observe the objects on the other side of the building.  My wife ran inside to grab her camera.  She returned just as a third orb appeared and followed a similar vector to the other two objects. Again, as the third object passed nearly overhead, I observed the same structure as the first two objects.  My wife was able to get one very nondescript, streaked image with her camera but honestly, it doesn’t look like much. The entire incident lasted perhaps 30-40 seconds.  After the three objects had passed, my wife and I were somewhat shaken and tried to make any sense of what we had just seen.   They clearly were not any sort of aircraft or drone that I have seen (and I consider myself an aircraft aficionado along with being a drone and R/C aircraft pilot).  The other thought I had were that perhaps they were some sort of debris entering the atmosphere and burning up, but that would not account for what appeared to be a level flight path. About a minute or so after this, a commercial aircraft crossed the flight path of the objects at a perpendicular angle, heading east.  I have no idea if the pilot of that airliner, likely landing at JFK, was able to see what had just occurred, but I suppose we have no way of knowing.  We checked the internet for any other reports of this incident and found nothing, which is astonishing considering it occurred over New York City.  However, we found Nuforc and filed this report in hopes of anyone else coming out and reporting this.",2014-07-04T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The two clouds appeared to be around a half a mile from each other and the craft flew slowly from one cloud to the other.

Last night my Wife, 14 year old son and I were in the driveway launching fireworks.  We noticed 3 lights in a triangle shape in the distance (few miles away) above the tree line.  At first we thought they were other fireworks that didn't explode because they had an orange color (even though fireworks don't really travel high enough to be seen that far away) But these did not go any higher and stayed in a perfect triangle formation.  We kept waiting for them to disappear or to flash like aircraft but they stayed in the air in the same place.  I believe there were 3 objects because the distance would have made the object massive if it was a single object.  My son tried to photograph and could not. He retrieved my phone and it would not capture the light either because of the distance.  I switched to movie mode and I thought I did not capture anything but once reviewed I was able to capture the triangle formation for a second and have the picture as proof. After a few minutes the left most light disappeared and the other two went higher in the air and disappeared too.  My years in the Air Force AND life experience up until now have left me without an explanation.  They did not act like 3 aircraft such as helicopters, the only manned vehicle I can think of capable of staying perfect shape without moving for the amount of time.

A few minutes into the show, I saw what I thought was an airplane flying by in the distance, and I remarked to my husband how nice it was that the passengers got to see the fireworks.  As we continued to watch the fireworks with the aircraft in the distance behind the light display, I saw the craft suddenly change direction which immediately piqued my interest.  I again pointed out the craft to my husband to note its change in direction.  The craft that we were watching did not have any discernible form other than the light coming from it, which would change from bright, flashing red, to a bright flashing green, and would also stay solidly colored in each tone as well (not flashing) with no discernible pattern to the change in color or flashing patterns.  We continued to watch this craft move from! side to side across the horizon, which at my best guestimation would be perhaps the distance of a few miles (again it was difficult to tell it’s height and true distance from us in relation to the horizon) but it was as high as the fireworks were and would disappear below the horizon, only to rise again, many times hovering perfectly still with no movement whatsoever, to quickly moving to the left or right, then up and down.  When the fireworks ended, only about a 20 minute show, so we saw this occur for about 10-15 minutes, the craft went below the horizon and we thought it had gone, only to get up and prepare to leave and we saw it again.  This time it was leftward to us, moved back and forth a few times over the course of maybe 3-4 minutes and then made a final descent below the horizon. I would like to state that I am definitely a skeptic of so-called UFO sightings.  This is not the sort of thing that I seek out, that thrills me, or even particularly scares me, I primarily just laugh these sorts of things off whether heard from someone or in say a movie. I am perhaps mostly just in a state of disbelief.  No aircraft that I have ever seen or even know of can behave or perform in the manner I saw this craft do tonight. Hovering perfectly, perfectly still, moving from side to side at higher speeds than even a helicopter can move (that I have seen at least), disappearing below the horizon, only to reappear, move about, and then disappear. Unfortunately again we could not discern a shape other than that of the light. The only lights I have seen associated with traditional aircraft seen in the sky would be a blinking red light or a variation therein. This had distinctive brightness, distinctive change from red to green, and change in solid light to blinking. I have! never seen anything like this before, and I knew immediately that I needed to find some place to report this. I believe that I have witnessed a true unidentified flying object, and I am interested to look further into others’ reports of similar experiences.  Thank you for the forum and for your time.",2014-07-05T00:00:00,38.22604202898551,-122.65297500000001

At 12:05am on Tuesday, July 22, 2014, I was driving south on Belleview Street, when I spotted a large, round, orange light in the sky to my left…which works out to south-southeast.  Best guess is it was about 20 degrees over the tree line.  I first thought it was a star, but soon figured it to be too large.  Then I thought an airplane or helicopter, but still would have been too large for those kinds of lights.  It also appeared to be moving in a left-right-left pattern over a short distance, relative to the object.  If you google Belleview street, Worcester, MA, the little green arrow that pinpoints the road on the map is precisely where I was positioned at the first sighting. As I approached the intersection of Belleview and Chandler Streets, I spotted certainly three, and possibly four more orange lights sitting dead south in the sky, not apparently moving.  One was slightly lower than the first one I spotted, perhaps at 15 degrees over the tree line.  The other two I am certain of were considerably higher in the sky, one at 75-80 degrees and shading toward the southeast, the other at about 45 degrees, directly below the highest one. There were no other unusual objects near these, and they did not show any distinct pattern or shine light on anything near to them.  My car window was down, and I heard no sounds to possibly indicate their proximity to my position. I was near my home, so I gathered my head, and sped to grab a good camera.  By the time I got back, about ten minutes later, there was no sign of these objects in any direction. One side observation:  on my arrival to my driveway before getting my camera, I looked to the sky to see if they could be seen from my house, but in the general direction of where I saw them, all I could see was a vague pinkish glow behind the shadowed profile of trees and other houses.  Couldn’t see any stars in any direction, so I thought it might be clouds obscuring the night sky.  When I returned home, disappointed and without pictures of anything, at about 12:30 am the glow behind the silhouetted houses and trees was gone, and there were a good many visible stars in every direction.

On the night of July 22, 2014, I was returning home from my night class from my local university which is only about 3 miles from my house.  I was backing my pickup truck up the drive way and while backing up, I could hear a helicopter get louder as if it was approaching my house. I parked the truck and glanced at the clock on the dash noticed it was 9:20 pm.  I stepped out of the pickup and turned to see why the helicopter was so close or low flying.  It was coming from the northwest proceeding to the southeast. To my astonishment, two large pewter gray colored craft where flying in front of the helicopter in a tight formation, one staggered to the left rear of the front pewter craft. These objects were approximately 60 to 70 feet across in diameter, about 10 to 12 foot thick in the centers, the outer edges of the craft were similar to the edge of a coin like a nickel, smooth with no markings.  I would estimate the sides would be about 2 to 3 foot on the vertical measurement.  The craft made no noise whatsoever, had no markings, no windows of any type, no lights. The two craft were in very tight formation.  The helicopter was all black, had no markings on the fuselage but was an Apache Helicopter.  This I know for sure, being that I am a USAF veteran and have worked on a flight line with military aircraft in my past. The helicopter was about 200 yards behind the two craft, following the two objects but not trying to gain speed or overtake the objects, almost as it was tagging the objects.  The two objects remained very close to one another, about 20 to 30 yards apart, one behind the other. The formation including the helicopter flew about 200 feet off the ground, very close to the tree line, the two disk flew in a straight line and maintained the tight formation.   The entire clear viewing window that I had was about 20 seconds, before the formation flew behind the tree line that is behind my house.  I had a clear view of the objects from the start to finish.  The light in the sky was good being that it was in the city and over a strongly lit neighborhood.  I was about 130 yards away from the flight path of the formation. Right before the helicopter went behind the tree line my wife was coming out of the house and commented to me, “What in the world is all the noise from?""  Before I could answer her, the helicopter along with the craft went behind the tree line behind the house and proceeded in a direction that took the formation away from us. The best description I can give of the craft was that if you were to hold a 3 inch sugar cookie at arm’s length at about 30 degrees up and tilt it slightly that would give a good reference to the size and how I was able to see the bottom and shape, I was able to observe the craft for the full period of viewing, the disk shaped craft made no noise, very smooth, no lights, no markings, no appendages, just very smooth, pewter gray in color. I came in and made a detailed drawing of the craft and event to make sure I remembered every detail.   Being ex-military and having worked with aircraft, I know what I saw was a real event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we were impressed with how eloquent and seemingly serious-minded he is.  PD)) ((2ND REPORT FROM WIFE)) Mr, Davenport, Here is a written report by me of the event on the 22nd. that occurred with my husband and the objects and the helicopter. Secondary witness to the event in Baton Rouge Louisiana;  July 22, 2014. My husband who attends night classes at a local college called to let me know he was on his way home when he left his school.  He does this so I can put the dogs up in the house and open the gate in the driveway so he can back in with his pickup truck.  It only takes about 5 to 10 minutes for the drive home from the school.   After I had gone outside and opened the gate, I went back inside the house to wait for my husband to drive in.  It was just a few minutes, maybe 5 minutes or so, when I started to hear a noise outside.  The noise continued to increase to the point that it was loud and had me concerned.  I knew it was the sound of a helicopter and I thought it must be flying very low over the house so I went out to see why the noise had gotten so loud.  By this point it sounded like it was right over the back of the yard at our house and I was very concerned of what was going on.   I went out the back door and started walking out under our carport to investigate the noise.  I saw my husband had already backed up the driveway in his truck and was standing by the driver side rear wheels staring over the back of the property pointing and saying something out loud to me.  I could not hear what he was saying because of the noise of the helicopter.   I walked rather quickly out from under the carport to see what he was pointing at and I saw a black helicopter go behind the tree line very close to the top of the trees behind our house.   My husband seemed to be in shock at what he saw and kept asking me if I saw the other objects.  I did not, being that I was walking from the backdoor through the carport which is covered and it took a bit to walk from the back door out into our driveway where I could get a good view.  I did manage to see the helicopter.   My husband came inside with me visibly upset by something he had seen and began explaining it to me and drawing down his sighting.  I know my husband well enough to know that if he saw something like this he would not say so without it being a real event. This is what I witnessed that night.

I am grouping the three together because I do not know specific dates, and I am writing this report about 8 years late.  July 30 is my best guess at a median date. That summer I routinely spent evenings at my friend's house, a girl that I had a crush on.  The first event was the only one to my knowledge that had another witness, and was at this girl's house.  The second event was witnessed while walking to her house.  The third was witnessed while walking from her house back home.  All three were at night. First Event:  The girl and I were hanging out in her front yard near the basketball goal, and for just a second the entire sky illuminated with a flash of blue light.  I am not sure, but the light may have originated to the west near Austin or Pflugerville. Second Event: On a dark night, I saw a massive black triangular object creeping silently across the sky.  This triangle may have been equilateral, but I can't say for sure.  One thing I can say for sure is that I could clearly see the three defined edges, even through the darkness.  It emitted no light and seemed to be flying low, though it is impossible for me to confidently give an estimate of it's altitude.  I watched it until it disappeared past the tree line.  This is the most amazing sight I have ever seen. Third Event:  I saw a bright blue streak of light zigzag on the horizon in the direction of Austin.

I think fireworks smog the atmosphere so these ufo's can be given a chance to spy.  Who or what was behind it, is still unknown.  I was a little terrified but also amazed.  I felt dizzy and confused after the experience.  They felt fine. Later that night, red lights rolled through the clouds in fleets.  A loud humming sound was produced.  I was alone, during this separate sighting on the same night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2014-06-13T00:00:00,38.8251,-90.7289

Lately, I pull the images files from that trip, one of them caught my attention, there was a bright spot in the blue skies, so I tried to edit it the picture and as a result definitely it is a UFO, very strange in its shape but the picture can show clearly the basic form of such object. The edited one I keep within my images files.  The pictured object was much closer than three other, can be seen in the picture too but as curved shapes in white bright colors. Since I was taking picture from the van, I do not know if other people noticed about those strange objects.

I am not crazy and at the time, I was totally within my senses.  I wasn’t drinking or doing drugs. I was totally alert and fully aware of my surroundings. I was pet-sitting for a friend and at approximately 11:30 pm, I was outside in the yard while the dogs were going to the bathroom and doing their thing. This particular night the sky was very clear.  The stars were so bright.  I started to gaze up – and just stood there looking at the stars for a couple of minutes. That’s when I saw it.  At first, I thought it was a shooting star.  Because it shot across the sky—fast.  I thought I was lucky witnessing a shooting star, so I got excited and continued to watch with fascination. The light I saw was very bright. Like a star.  It was high up in the sky too—just like a star.  Except this light moved fast—very fast.  The bright light then started to move upward.  Within a matter of seconds, (we are talking zero to five seconds later), this bright light ascended into the heavens and was out of sight. What I saw scared me.  I didn’t get a warm fuzzy feeling about it either.  I was anxious and a little frightened.  I immediately went back inside.  For the rest of the night, I was on edge.  I even had trouble sleeping. My friends think I’m crazy whenever I mention this.  Honestly though, whatever it was—totally and completely scared me so much, that to this day, I do not gaze up at the stars anymore. Maybe it was a re-fueling mission.  Maybe it was a satellite.  I don’t know. Whatever this light was, it traveled so fast that within a matter of seconds it was out of sight.

I reported a sighting on May 9, 2014, to this website.  I had a strange thing happen after, that somehow appears connected.  I was siting on my porch. The night may have been a bit overcast.  I was thinking about what I observed on the 8th of May.  I was looking south when just about 50 feet off the ground a black object whizzed by my view and disappeared over the roof of the house.  It was about 20 feet in front of me. It was travelling east.  Less than a second later, from over the roof the object shot out in a southerly direction and headed south.  It was travelling directly away from me.  Of course the speed is the key. You could barely see it. I was questioning what I had seen when it first went by and over the roof.  I can only describe it as a black opaque sighting.  I first thought it had to be a bat or bird.  I realized that was impossible.  This object had to be solid, but was going so fast it looked as a blur.  The blur was about 8 inches wide, not just thin.  While I was trying to figure out what I saw, it obviously changed direction in a micro-second and shot off south.  Exactly away from me.  Now the black object had mass.  Going away from me, it appeared as a small black dot. About the size of a golf ball. What ever this was, it appeared that it ""triangulated"" over my house.  It did apex my location.  It appeared to be a deliberate destination.  This is the most interesting part of the phenomenon.  It appeared mechanical and with purpose.  It appeared that my location was it's destination. I spoke with my son about it days later.  He related that he just viewed a video from Boston that was about the ""rods"" phenomenon.  He suggested I look at the same video. I viewed the video and I concluded that this was exactly what I may have witnesses.  I am sharing this only for purposes of facts, surrounding the UFO phenomenon and the ""Rods"" phenomenon.  These both appear related, at least in my case. I think this is very important to document. I have no conclusions to these 2 occurrences, except I do think they are related.  I questioned what I seen, and am 100% sure I seen it.  I know I did see what I described.  I seen it a night or two before, but thought it was birds or maybe it did not happen.  When I seen it this time, I took notice and I knew it was real. The key point is, when travelling across my view, it was a blur, then going away from my view, it had mass and was a black dot.  That in itself indicates very strongly that it was there. The date and time is approximate.",2014-06-13T00:00:00,42.7324,-71.1862

I have never really believed in this sort of thing, but I just saw an object in the sky over south Charlotte at 8:00 p.m., 6/15/2014.  It was black and seemed to be a semi-circular shape but seemed to change shape in a slow, wobbly manner.  Almost like a blob or jellyish type structure.  It did not look natural. It either had a bright white light or some sort of reflection of the sun, but it was slowly spinning so the light would come and go. It was directly over me and in plain sight at low altitude.  Someone with terrible eyesight could have easily seen it.  I watched it for over five minutes, probably closer to ten.  It moved very slowly, gaining in altitude pretty steeply in regard to how quickly it became too difficult to see.  I recorded it from my phone, but it has no zoom.  By the time I decided to find my phone and record, it had floated quite a distance.  It was indistinguishable on the screen because of its altitude and the sun and lack of zooming ability.   My neighbor walked out as I was filming.  He watched it with me.  By the time he saw it, the object was at a greater distance and higher altitude so he asked if maybe it was a weather balloon.  It was not, though.  It was almost thickly transparent-like, but then it would “morph” into a jet black with absolutely no plasma look to it.  It did not look like it was “made of matter” in the sense that we usually perceive matter. I am somewhat shocked because I am a hard sceptic of almost any phenomena reported on any subject.  I called the airport.  They said that they know of nothing in the sky, that there is a National Guard Base nearby.  Really though, I’m not sure why I called them because this “object” did not look natural and moved in a very unnatural manner as well.  It was not a “vehicle” per se.  I am truly at a loss for words. I saw it earlier this week too, but it was very far away so I didn’t call or make a report because I wasn’t sure what I saw.  On that day, it seemed to hover in a completely still position and darted off at an extremely high speed.  I was intrigued as to what it could be, but it was very far away and pretty much a small, dark spot in the sky.

I spotted (and heard) a propeller driven and also several jet aircraft.  As they progressed across the sky I could hear them as well.  They were at varying altitudes as observed.  All these aircraft had typical blinking lights as commonly seen on commercial aircraft.  I spotted, then heard, a jet coming south, and it passed my location slightly to the east.  I could hear its engine sound and I estimate its altitude at approximately 5000 feet.   Then I spotted another light object trailing behind the jet by several seconds and going in the same general direction.  It was a very steady non-blinking white light and seemed to be at a much higher altitude.  It was unusual.  The light was bright but not glaringly so.  No sound came from this object as it passed which added to the impression it was at very high altitude.  It proceeded across the sky in about the same time fram! e as the previous jet.  So I estimate its speed to be much faster than the jet in order for it to cover the same distance in the sky in that short amount of time.  Then it quickly faded out.  The visual impression is that it just ascended out of the atmosphere. I have observed objects before in the sky that I could not identify.  I reported one here several years ago, and one to MUFON.  I received a follow-up inquiry.  In that case, I made further observations of the area of the sky where I'd seen the later object for many days, to be fair and thorough and possibly see an explainable repeat of the sighting.   After my followup observations I determined I could have seen explainable, if even unlikely, naturally occurring phenomena, and I explained that in detail in my followup answers. That is how I answered the follow-up inquiry.  I keep a healthy skepticism.  I do not go looking for unexplained sightings, I simply occasionally sit and relax and look at the night sky.  I am always ready to accept the most likely reasonable explanation.  I think that what sightings are most likely to be, they probably are, and have no illusions or belief agenda to see them to be labeled as “extraterrestrial.”  I will not report a sighting unless I can't understand what it is.  Only then I think it is my obligation to file a report that might be corroborated or possibly support another's sighting of the same object.",2014-06-20T00:00:00,41.475,-87.6256

As promised I was ready for the next nights event.  If the objects re-appeared I would accept them as planets.  And so it was with much anticipation that I took a chair amongst the cactus to examine the evening sky.  The time was 2025.  Oh the disappointment!  For there they soon appeared in nearly the same place and in the same triangular formation.  Oh well, I’m not the first to be duped by atmospherics. But wait?  These look just like two planets and one star?  These 3 are no where near as brite as on the previous night, and there is no red “navigation” light attached?  What gives here? I must also report that my Mac went to a black screen immediately following my report on your web site.  It took 3 days and 5 tech’s at Apple to solve the problem.  “I’ve never seen this before, What’s this?  This isn’t right…”  Those and other comments from Apple while trying to restore the computer.

I was on a dirt road at 2:50pm on april 8th.  As I turned north, I saw in a mostly clear blue sky, straight ahead and about 30% above level (landscape here too irregular landscape to call it ""horizon""), a wisp of cloud about 2"" long horizontally at extended thumb and forefinger, about 1/2"" high.  As I looked at it the center became a bright silver, irregular shaped, like metal shining through the cloud.  The silver disappeared back into the cloud and the cloud shrank in both dimensions and disappeared.   Total time from when I noticed the cloud to total disappearance about 8 seconds.  This was not a reflection off a windshield.  I've never seen a cloud disappear like this. Sun at this time of day was on the left, a little forward of 90deg left. There is an airbase south of here (Davis Monthan), and I regularly see planes from there, but but I've never seen one manifest itself from within a small cloud and then both disappear.

I was playing in the yard when my son told me to look up in the sky.  He said that there was a shooting star falling out of the sky.  I took a look up in the south east direction from my Florham Park yard. I initially saw what looked like plane, as it was the most logical thought.  Note that I do live near Morristown Airport, so I just assumed it was a low flying plane.  But it wasn’t flying like a plane.  It was moving a slower and there was a change of speeds.  It seemed to be flying at a steady pace at first, but then slowed down and with that change of pace was a slight change in direction.  Seemed odd to me.  This is when I thought it was more than a plane. After it flew for what seemed like  a minute, I had a hard time making it out and seemed to have disappeared from my view.   In regards to the object itself, I would say it was just 1 color.  It was an orange color of lights.  It appeared to be diamond shaped.  I even said to myself that it looks like a kite with lights around it. In what might be a coincidence, after the object went out of view, there was a plane that seemed to be flying in that same direction.   My thought on that was it saw what I saw and was going to take a closer look.",2014-04-24T00:00:00,40.7747,-74.398

We watched it for a little bit, but as we started the car up, the engine made the usual raucus noise that it does.  It was at this time that I noticed the light darting up to the right of its former position.

I took my dog out to the front lawn around 9:30 p.m.  At this moment, I could hear a commercial airliner flying above.  The airliner traveled from East to West at a high altitude. It was at this moment when a bright orange fireball in the sky caught my attention.  The fireball appeared as a oversized star and I assumed it could be a possible satellite in orbit.    The object traveled from West to East.  It moved slightly faster than a commercial airliner.  The object appeared as a orange fireball in the Western sky.    As it flew direct overhead, the light faded away.  Although there was no light or glow to the object, I could see the object continue in the sky to the far East.   Now the object appears to be larger with no lights.",2014-08-15T00:00:00,27.460967103347894,-82.52932940320234

Red to Orange silent flying object - mid ground level then flies out of sight.,Harpers Ferry,WV,2014-08-13T21:45:00,circle,30 seconds,"Occurred : 8/13/2014 21:45  (Entered as : 08/13/2014 21:45) Reported: 8/13/2014 7:09:18 PM 19:09 Posted: 8/15/2014 Location: Harpers Ferry, WV Shape: Circle Duration:30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/112/S112447.html,"Red to Orange silent flying object - mid ground level then flies out of sight. Craft was circular in shape, red to orange glowing in color.  Silent.  My home is above the US 340 bridge overlooking the Shenandoah River as it confluences with the Potomac in Harper's Ferry, in between 2 mountain ranges.  I was sitting on my second floor balcony enjoying a cigar preparing for bed.  The object appeared from my right side at tree top level from up river (my property being on the WV side of the Shenandoah) and at first I thought it to be a helicopter with a search light, perhaps searching for a drowning victim in the river as sometimes happens.   However, as the object approached it was silent, grew larger in diameter, until at closest approach, appeared grapefruit size at arm's length perspective from me and continued floating along the river valley at relatively high speed--then gained altitude over the mountain range at the Potomac confluence and color began to shift to more of a red yellow.  It then continued to float/fly and gain altitude until it appeared to look like a star in the sky and eventually disappear. Could possibly have been some sort of drone, but I don't think so.  It was too silent and had no searchlights or navigation lights.",2014-08-15T00:00:00,39.227,-77.7897
