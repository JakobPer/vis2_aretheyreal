MY sister and her two kids years later also saw a huge UFO just above hwy 101 at the marin county civic center.   The year of the sighting is based on best guess on my part recalling what she said.  On a side road above the hwy my sister was driving along when she was amazed to see a huge UFO below her hovring just over the hwy with traffic passing under it and no one appearing to notice the craft.   She atopped the car and got out to look at it and could have easily bounced a tennis ball off of it.  The craft was making faint humming noise but no one else appeared to notice it.  As she and her kids watched black helicopters came over the hill and they chased the UFO around in ghe air over head above San Rafael.   Finally the UFO took off flying north with the helicopters after it.  No one else still seemed to see the UFO.  Looking down on the hwy! traffic my sister thought what terrible fools they all were Years later black helicopters were involved in an attack on my sister   About the same time coming home late at night to my home in the deep woods I was surprized to hear deep heavy growls of a large animal in the dark.  I pulled my legally carried firearm and a dog whistle begain to blow recalling the animal.  The next night this same scenario was repeated with a dog whistle again calling off the large animal growling in the dark  Its a dangerous game to play ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

During the summer of 1987, in either July or August, I was on a canoe trip in Northwestern Maine-it was a program run by ((name of group deleted)).  I was 18 years old.  The trip was a circular route on the Moose River system, near the town of Jackman, and was of two weeks duration.  Twice during the trip our group (there were 8 or 9 of us- I can't remember exactly, it was a long time ago) was overflown by fighter aircraft flying very low and very fast.  Each such flight consisted of two-plane elements. On the final day of the trip we camped on the shore of Attean Lake.  Looking now at a Google map, I believe we were camped on the North shore of the lake, very close to the railbed.  Each night of the field trip consisted of exercises designed to enhance our (the participants') understanding of the area's ecology and/ or fieldcraft skills.   On the last night, we did two exercises:  a hike to the summit of the hilltop past the railbed, overlooking the lake, and following that, each participant was to write down his or her overall impressions, and what we learned from the trip. To sum up the trip, each participant was to find a place of our own, separate from the other participants so that each summation would be the genuine thoughts of the person writing it down.  Then, following dinner back at the campsite, each participant would read what they had written to the others:  this was so the group leaders could evaluate the success of the trip, and so the participants could add to each others' knowledge base.  I remember walking about a half mile down the beach and finding a convenient log to sit on as I reflected on the experience. This is where it gets interesting, but it only became interesting to me about ten years ago (important to remember here that the trip took place in 1987) as I was sifting through some old photos I had taken on the trip.  In the same bag as the photos were the notes I had written on that last night of the trip, detailing my impressions- and it occurred to me that we had never completed the exercise.  We had each taken our notes, but we had NOT done the group reading and assessment of them, as we were supposed to have done.  I wondered why, and thought about it hard- and here are the memories to the best of my recollection. I had finished writing my notes, and was walking back down the beach towards the campsite.  There was a little sandy point adjacent to the campsite, and as I came around it, I noticed the moon out over the lake- it was intensely full and bright, though the evening was early with plenty of daylight left.  As I rounded the point, I could see the rest of the group sitting around the fire (I am not sure if all the participants were present at this time- one or two may still have been off on their own), looking out at the lake.  I looked out again too, and I distinctly remember how striking the moon was. I carried with me an Olympus OM-1 camera- I had taken several rolls of film with me and got plenty of great photos of moose, other wildlife and landscapes.  This was a 35-mm camera with a manual light meter- you had to adjust the camera's settings using the light meter to get good photos.  I unslung the camera and aimed it at the moon, and flipped on the light meter.  It instantly registered overexposure.  I fiddled with every adjustment and could achieve nothing except overexposure.  I remember no conversation with other group members at this time, though I did look at them several times as I played with the camera- they were all looking at the moon.  Finally, I removed the batteries from the camera and again aimed it at the moon, and somehow it was still registering overexposure.  I remember that I was standing in the water up to my knees at that point. The next clear memory I have is of waking up in my tent sometime much later that night when a train went past on the tracks above the campsite.  It was raining hard.  I have no recollection whatsoever of any moment between standing in the water to waking up in my tent.  I can only allude to ""missing time"" for reference to this time frame and I do not know what transpired therein. The next morning, we packed up the campsite- there was uncooked food (beans) still in the pans, filled with rainwater.  Nothing about the previous night was discussed on the paddle back to the landing, though I do remember all the group members being extremely tired. I might not have remembered any of this had I not been looking through  those old photos, but I believe it significant that the anomalies- the fact that we didn't discuss our impressions of the trip, nor did we discuss the events of that night- struck me immediately once I found the notes.  I remember the names of some of the group leaders but have not maintained any contact. I wrote to the USAF to ask them why the fighter jets might have been in the area in that time frame, and received a reply from a Public Information Officer (a Major, I believe), who told me that such flights were common, and were likely routine training flights, originating from any of a number of bases, including Pease in Massachusetts or Loring, Maine.

I’ll add that I noticed that there were no rays of light in the glow of the orb. Look outside at any man made light at night and there will be some rays round it. Not so with this orb. Strange light . I was sleeping behind a bar in a camper shell .  Got up to relieve my self. Turning my head to the left where my chin was just in front of my left  shoulder . There was the orb, at about 20 feet in diameter, floating at tree top,[15 to 20 ft. high]  From my left, going to my right  down the row of trees that separate the two businesses. It moved very slow, until my chin was in front of my right shoulder then took off fast still in a straight line until it was over glacier creek, made a perfect 90 degree turn and straight to Turnagain arm a few miles south.  At that instant the deafening sound of an f-15 after burner shook the ground. The jet followed the path as the orb over the tree tops to glacier creek, but the jet had to cut the corner  to make the turn to pursue the orb.  Then a second f-15 ,shook the ground as its after burner came to life and took the same flight path on the tops of the trees.  It made a tighter turn then the first jet. I guess to make up time .   Those two Jets were so close I could see rivets on the under belly from the parking lot light.

Friday, August the 25th in 2012. We went about doing a number of things and had a nice time seeing the area. The last place we went to was Kranky's coffee (correct spelling).  It was between 9-9:15 pm, as we were walking back to my sister's car, I looked up at the moon. I am always looking at the sky, especially the night sky, as you never know what you will see. WHAT DID I SEE INDEED!!!  Lo and behold, next to the clear moon there were some clouds, BUT what made this view MIND BLOWING was the 8-10 lights that were flying around in an apparent dog fighting pattern, these lights were the size of planes in the night sky, I would call them orbs as they were round and had no shape as the eye could see. In fact, a plane was flying by into view for a frame of reference as this was happening.  They were dipping and weaving like fish in a fish bowl, all of them, like they were playing. After a while it was apparent that this was more of a game than anything else, as some would stop moving and others would be weaving around each other like an airplane dog fighting pattern/fish weaving around each other. On top of that, they would move, stop, then move at a quick speed, which is impossible for modern craft.  They also move, stop, then go perfectly in reverse, which is impossible as well! These couldn't be helicopters, as they were too high up, and moving and speeds too sharp and swift.  this was a beautiful sight to behold, and it wasn't far into this moment that I realized that I was seeing something that was very rare, and something that couldn't be easily explained away. My sister was the first witness with me, then she went into the car and sat down, as she was chilly and had seen enough, and frankly was probably spooked by it all.  Then I was looking for people showing up to the coffee place to say ""hey, LOOK AT THAT"" to, and after about a minute of me watching in amazement, a group of 2 girls and one guy walked up. They saw me looking up, and began to look towards the direction of the moon as well. I said something along the lines of ""what is that?"" or ""that's pretty crazy huh?"".  Finally as they realized what they were seeing, they stood near me and were watching in shock as well. They were like ""what is THAT"" and ""it's ufos"", and they were laughing in a nervous way of when you see something that is incredible and shouldn't be happening in waking life, it must be something strange indeed.  The guy said something along the lines of ""it's bats and there's light from the moon reflecting off of them"", but I quickly countered, saying that they were too big to be seen from such a great height, and the movements they were making, coming to a standstill then moving in reverse, is impossible for them to do. TO which he replied ""I know"", more or less saying ""my reasoning is maxed out and I don't know how to explain what I'm seeing to rationalize this to myself and these women I'm with"".  I joked saying ""it must be swamp gas"", to which they laughed. I of course was referencing the explanations given by government officials when trying to explain away such events. They usually will try to explain such events as ""natural occurrences"", which usually to most of the time doesn't work sufficiently.  this continued for about 10 minutes total, about 3 minutes with my sister and I, then about 7 or so minutes with the 3 strangers and myself.  I took one photo and it had a flash, so it didn't come out well, though it does look like some kind of light ball is present. In hindsight I should of turned off the flash, take a bunch of photos, then worked with them to see if I could improve visibility, but alas I did not.  The saving grace is that this occurred with me and 4 different people! then as those people were walking away after the lights started to leave and there were less and less, I noticed other people at the coffee shop looking, just following what we were doing, so at least 1, maybe 2 other people saw this separate of me, which is great and makes this occurrence that much more than a chance of my ""imagination'.  Seeing something like this, as I said to my sister, puts us on a short list, as it's not every day you see a real, genuine UFO sighting. Once in the moment of such an event, it is chilling, exciting and just plain awe-inspiring, as you realize you are seeing something that is beyond the scope of day to day existence.  Being north carolina, there is always the chance this was military testing, such as of the aurora space craft, which is supposed to be able to take off from earth and go all the way to the moon, though the physics these things displayed had a fluidity of fish in water, and a grace of fish underwater, which is best way to explain them, like fish at play, doing something of a delicate game or ballet in it's precision, with no moment of fear of ""collision"", it was truly stunning and if it's the only time I have such an experience, it will have made all the research I've done up till now worthwhile.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,36.093568617021276,-80.27833537234042

It was mostly a glowing iridescent amber or orange color, emitting its own light, but also had a small, bright, dark-blue light at the front. It was shaped almost like a rowboat, but was about as big as a house (single-story, rambler size). I could see no wings, propellers, wheels, pontoons, doors, windows, rudder, or blimp-like parts to it. It did not look like any floatplane (common in the Lake Union area), regular airplane, glider, helicopter, balloon, or blimp that I had seen before.  If it were a blimp, it had no gondola or ""passenger car"" visible below it, and no visible tailfins; and at the top of the amber/orange light, it was straight across, not rounded at all. It was moving too slowly to be a plane.  (It would have fallen out of the sky.) And it was much too large to be a helicopter, and wasn't even close to the shape of any I've ever seen. Again, it was about as large as a small house. I knew very little about UFOs, and wasn't sure I even believed in them, but because I had heard that UFOs could quickly zip away, I tried to not even blink as we approached its path.  My friend was driving; so I unbuckled my seatbelt, and got up on my car seat so that I could quickly turn around, and keep my eye on it through her side windows; and I did this. It was close enough that I could have thrown a baseball, and hit it. As we passed it, I was not sure that I could still see it.  And as we kept on going past, I could no longer see anything there at all!  I said to her, ""It's gone!"" or something like that. I no longer saw any indication that it was still there. DETAILS:  It was at night, and dark.  At least the one lamp it was passing over was out (not lit). (Two or three of them might have been out.) Other freeway lamps were lit. I recall no rain.  So I believe it was dry. When I first saw it, we had just entered I-5 not many seconds before that; and only part of it had come over the bridge yet. It continued to move in the air, across the width of the bridge from East to West.  As we passed it, we were, I believe, in the far right lane; and the back end of it had just then crossed over the railing of the bridge, on the West. It had crossed over the bridge just a short distance before mid-span, and was maybe 20-40 feet above the lamp posts. The area where the amber or orange light was emitting (not reflecting), I would guess was between 6 and 10 feet high, but not more than 20 or 25 feet; and maybe between 50 and 80 feet long. The entire craft seemed lighted up by this light, except for the small blue light at front. Neither she nor I seem to recall the exact year or time of year, or the time of day. I am thinking that it was either in 1999 or 2000. I didn't report it then because I was afraid that we had seen something that we weren't ""supposed"" to see, something from the military or government, possibly. She didn't report it either. To date, she won't even discuss it with me!  I am reporting it now because, years later, I have found out that UFOs are far more common than I had then realized, and because whatever it was we saw moving slowly over the bridge was now more than 10 years ago, and now maybe the ""owner"" of it wouldn't really care since it's been so long, and because I just wanted to finally report it. I only wish I could recall the date and time. This event came as a total surprise to me, and was startling at the time, especially since it seemed to me that while the craft was visible from one angle, it was apparently non-visible from another; or else it became invisible to my eyes; or it moved so quickly (after moving so slowly) that I didn't even see it jump away. I didn't take my eyes off of it, or blink (at all, or very little); I just couldn't see it anymore, even though we were still pretty close to where I had last seen it, a little more than maybe 7 lanes away. It was in our view for maybe 20-30 seconds. MISC: I think the height of the bridge is over 180' above the water or streets below. A Wikipedia article says it's about 119 feet wide. We were going too fast to know whether or not it was making any sound (probably between 55 and 65MPH). The lights on it were steady, and none were blinking. There were no red or white lights on it, from our angle. CONJECTURE AND/OR IMPRESSIONS:  I am not sure why, but I got an impression (or imagination) that there was much more to the airship than we were able to see; but we were so close to it that it seems unlikely that I would have missed seeing more of the craft. It seems unlikely to me that the rest of it was hidden by the cover of night; though, after seeing some recent science articles, I suppose that it could have been hidden by current or advanced ""invisibility"" technology. I also had the impression that the craft we saw was visible from one angle, but not visible from another, vs. either it taking off so fast that I didn't even see it move or disappearing ""coincidentally"" right as we were passing its back end. ©2012.

My friend and I were talking and looking out at the sea & stars and there was an elderly couple standing next to us using one of those viewers mounted to the pier on a stand.  We were watching what looked like 2 airplane lights moving toward eachother slowly, one from the S & one from the N.  There was nothing strange about the lights at this point.  Suddenly, the one on the right (moving S to N) accelerated and zoomed toward the one on the left.  Then, the one on the left (moving N to S) circled very quickly around the other, almost like a fast mid-air dance, and shot off very fast up to the left (the opposite direction) at a diagonal and disappeared!  The one that was moving S to N continued moving in that same northward direction at the same altitude and its original velocity as though nothing happened.  Well my friend and I both said, ""Did you ! see that?!"", and the couple next to us quickly looked into the viewer at the area and the man said to his wife, ""We'd better get out of here."" and they left.  This confirmed that they saw it too. There was no sound associated with these objects and the color of the one on the left was slightly greenish while the one on the right had a slightly reddish orange color.

Also, the hybrids on earth, which mask themselves in a matrix, are coordinating with the pure bloods in an all-out attempt to persuade me into an agreement of sorts.  The Matrix I believe is similar to the matrix in the movie LIVE, which stars Rowdy Rodney Piper. This agreement would be an acceptance of their right to dominate earth and its people.  I will not cooperate with them!  I know of other Alien’s that have better intentions towards us and they are near or present now and more are coming.  This is the reasoning behind this assault.  I believe the new comers attacked the assholes. Ex. Lake Michigan, the Green Fog. This probably hid the craft at the bottom of Lake Michigan.  The other one was from god; Ex. Mass corona ejection from the sun melted a craft near Venus. After these events their where two attempts to take my life, I survived only because I am super natural and god protected me.  They keep repeating to me, listen, and I will not listen to the assholes, because they are planet takers.  I only listen to my inner voice or conscience.  May GOD bless us and good luck!",2012-05-13T00:00:00,40.3372,-80.5716

Something caught our eye... it was a bright light in the sky.  We couldn't tell what it was, but we decided it wasn't a star and it wasn't a plane so I drove closer to it.  As we got closer the light became brighter and more visible.  The light became clearer as we got closer.  The light was actually 6-8 lights in a very precise circle pattern hovering in the sky.  We estimated it was no more than a few hundred feet in the air.  At our closest point we stopped the car to get out and look, shut off our headlights so we wouldn't be noticed.  No more than a few seconds after we got out of the car the lights moved very smoothly and took only about 4 seconds or so turn into a ""V"" pattern.  Once it was in the ""V"" the object flew west so fast... it was out ! of our sights in less than 20 seconds.

The lights were almost halogen like - a brilliant white blue.  It soon became clear these light were affixed to a craft, as they remained in the same relative position indicating they were affixed to a wing.  I remarked upon first sight that the maneuvers this craft was performing were not possible.  It would go from just hovering over ground level, and immediately climb, while spinning, to a couple thousand feet - almost like it was performing.  It then shot straight up and disappeared. About a minute later it reappeared directly in front of us, like two headlights.  It was traveling quite slowly, almost like a jetliner landing.  It was traveling west on the other side of the interstate at maybe 100 feet.  As it passed our lone car, its forward facing lights slowly rotated to point directly at the ground.  Its profile seemed negligable, almost like it was just a wing.  No sound.  After it passed our car and again acsended rapidly (like a few seconds) out of sight. At this point we were well freaked out and contemplating what to do. Maybe a minute later, I saw the same two lights in the rearview mirror following us east.  At this point my girlfriend started crying.  It slowly moved closer and again the lights rotated from a forward position to pointing at the ground.

Every fiber of my being tells me that my experiences were real.  I am not a ufo enthusiast by any means, and have always believed abduction stories, for the most part, are the result of an overactive imagination or mental/physical disorders.  Here is my story:  The first time I had the experience, I never experienced the actual abduction or saw any kind of spacecraft.  All of the sudden, myself and maybe four other humans were in some kind of adminstration building with windows all around, with a huge table in the middle of this stainless steel like atrium.  We were all terrified, and scattered to find a hiding place;  we had no idea how we got there, or who anyone else was.  We never saw the alien beings either!  Me and another human male hid in a closet.  There were no words spoken the entire time, not sure why.  All of the sudden, I wasn't afraid anymore, and ventured out into the atrium once again.  I walked to the big table in the center of the room, and some kind of a being or presence was showing me, telepathically, the secret to faster than light travel and their alphabet.  I was amazed, no longer afraid, just...awed!  Afterwards, I was lead, telepathically, outside of the atrium to their world.  It was beautiful beyond my ! imagination:  two suns; one brilliant blue sun on the horizon and another red sun on the other horizon.  The world around me had a desert coloring to it, but there were strange plants in the distance.  I was telepathically told that my time was up.  It is at this time that I woke up in my own bed, feeling like I had been blessed by god.  I was able to draw some of their alphabet, but had no idea what it meant.  I was also able to recreate the diagram for faster than light travel.  This experience has stuck with me throughout the years.  The second time I had this experience, I suddenly found myself looking at the beautiful horizon with the two beautiful suns.  I wasn't afraid at all, but so humbled and excited that I was back!  Once again, I never saw the alien(s), but was able to understand, and realize that there were several beings near me, that meant no harm.  It is like someone was speaking over a radio directly into my brain.  Once again, I am unable to speak with my voice, but these beings must have been able to read my thoughts and emotions, because I got a tour of this facility.  As I am walking through the atrium, I notice the ceilings are over 30 feet high, the walls curved and there were no straight lines.  It was all a stainless steel looking structure.  Very interesting!  I walked past glass window, where I saw hundreds of human bodies suspended in some kind of clear solution with one tube going into their abdomen.  The tube had a florescent liquid flowing into each human's stomach.  I was hor! rified.  The being told me, telepathically, not to worry.  These were just generic shells that they had created through genetic replication many years ago.  The human shells that they had were devoid of any soul or spirit that made us human, and had no awareness whatsoever.  The alien then told me not to be afraid once again, they have no intentions of harming any human being, only a fascination and a need to experiment.  The only time they deal with real live humans is in a controlled and friendly environment with no intent to harm or frighten.  All of the sudden, in my mind's eye, I saw a small town just like any here on earth.  There were humans, happily living out their lives in a place that was created by these beings.  Almost like a scientific zoo, but the humans were blissfully unaware of their situation.  These were genetic reproductions of actual humans from earth that they created to learn everything about the human race.  Once again, the being reiterated that not a single human was harmed, and that these humans were farmed there strictly for research, and were able to live their lives to entirety without any intervention from these beings; these brings were merely there to observe, not interfere.  Once again, I was suddenly outside of their facilities, gazing on the horizon, admiring their two beautiful suns.  I awoke, once again, in my own bed, with that same feeling of awe and being blessed with what I was able to experience.  I was astonished to have what seemed like a ""follow up"" visit, like these beings are making sure to take it slow, not to overwhelm, not to frighten, just to make contact with real earthly beings and share some of their culture.  I believe that the biggest thing these beings were trying to show me is that they are real, they have been making contact with humans for thousands of years, and were proud of their experiments.  Kind of like a ""hey, we are here, and there is no reason to fear us, let us show you!""  I have not had another experience since the second one, which occurred in 2010.  Nothing even close.  I am not afraid that it will happen again, and I hope I do experience it again.  To me, it is almost like seeing the benevolent face of god.  These are truly good and beautiful beings that are reaching out.  It has been a life changing experience, for the better.  I hope that my story helps others and that others have been able to visit these beings.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,43.1550415206858,-77.61785896384644

It was shaped like a cigar,,,,I thought it might be a blimp of some sort.

The cigar shaped object was moving very slow in the same direction of the first object....NORTH,,,  As I watched both objects the small bright object was clearly going to cross the path of the other.  Kinda curious I watched to see if they would cross each others path,,,thinking ,,,well Its just in line and looks like its going to hit it...  .Then just before it did ,,,,it slowed and entered into the cigar,,,just as soon as it did,,,another object shot out of this cigar thing and traveled very very fast out and along the same path the first object had traveled to enter the cigar. Only it was not bright and shiny and moving somewhat faster the! n the first one had traveled coming in......it was dark and small compared to the Cigar....When this happened I was shocked and just watched as the Second object shot across the skyline and was gone...then I noticed the cigar object was somewhat see through and I could clearly see about 4 or 5 dark shapes inside it,,,Like pea's in a pod would be.... At this point the road turned and I lost sight of the whole Eastern Skyline....I was not inclined to say anything to anyone?  Which is strange in itself?  So I didn't,,,but have thought about this much since it happened.... My best guess as to the size of the Cigar Object,,,would be about a foot ball field in length ,,,or two..and maybe 4 stories high...it seemed to be rounded on both ends...like a grain of rice... If not for the sun setting and lighting the Cigar Object I do not think I would of seen it as it was very opalescent ...almost cloud like..... Thats it....

It was still dark with a few scattered clouds. I was looking at the sky and saw a very bright object moving very fast and very high coming from the west heading north north-east.  I was wondering if it might be a satellite. The object looked very bright white and was too high for me to discern any shape other than a ball of bright white light; it looked similar to Venus on a clear night but much bigger. As the thought was going through my head as to whether it might be a satellite, the object suddenly stopped.  After about 2 seconds, it headed back South (towards my house) very slowly then stopped again. At that point I got very uncomfortable and went back inside the house with the dogs. It was as if this object was making me aware that it definitely was not a satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Tall evergreen trees lined both sides of the roadway (48deg 13min 31.73sec N;  122deg 29min 32.97sec W) and the partially lit object appeared to be positioned just above the tree tops ahead of them at an unknown distance.   The UAP had one or two red lights on its front end, a green light above,  and a white light underneath.  It remained in sight for between 15 and 30 seconds before slowly moving horizontally to the right to disappear behind heavy, thick trees.  The husband thought there were whitish panels or ""uneven"" surface details on the side of the object.   The husband first thought they had seen Navy jets that fly in the same area out of NAS Whidbey Island but discarded the idea when the UAP seemed to move so slowly.  There were several discrepancies between the two witnesses (e.g., whether the object’s lights flashed or were steady, the alleged presence of particular surface details).  Neither claimed to have been drinking before the event nor have ever seen anything unexplained before this.  The weather was clear and calm; the sky was still a little bright behind the object which contributed to seeing its outline shape.

I noticed that it was slow moving and not shaped like an airline's aircraft and it had no exhaust trail and made no noise.  I pointed this object out to my brother and both of us were dumbfounded by this event.  Hat was most fascinating to me about this object is that it seemed to run an odd path in the sky and the atmosphere surrounding the object appeared distorted such as the heat waves you would see radiating off of hot pavement.  It didn't distort in a heat-wave type pattern though.  It was more of a pulsating visual as though it were bending light rays from its form of propulsion. The object seemed to be a dull metallic disk, with a smaller disk stacked on top of it, and it moved in a smooth elliptical path heading north before slowly, and gradually, decreasing in size until it finally disappeared.

I had a camera in my hand to take some family photos.  I noticed what appeared to be a dark circular or oval shaped object moving from north to south above my home.  This object was not an airplane, did not emit any noise, and seemed to disappear as quickly as it came into sight. This happened just about the time when everyone was beginning their fireworks show. It was still somewhat daylight also.  I took as many photos as I could, my hands were so shaky after I saw this thing it was hard to stay stable.  I have witnessed objects before that I have never reported out of reluctance or fear to do so.  What was different this night is that more came as the night went on. Soon after the first one I noticed, I looked to the south of where I stood and I noticed a bright glowing object slowly moving in my direction.  Where I live I have! a ton of trees all around me so trying to photograph these things is difficult.  Behind and to the left of the first fireball looking object followed another one and another behind that one.  Then from behind the view of the trees one to the right of the first one appeared.  This is when I demanded attention from my 20 year old son who always blew me off as crazy, to witness this event with me.  I have to admit I was shaken up from this.  We continued to observe the objects and tried to take photos and videos.  They were moving across from right to left, left to right but I’d lose them because they would dim out or move out of view behind the trees.  Next thing I saw is a few of them coming from behind me again from north heading south (ish)  Because they’d dim out of view I couldn’t keep track of which one was doing what so I can’t tell you positively that there were any more in number than what I counted as being visible all at once which was 5.  There could have been more, or so! me of the five I saw that disappeared in my view could have be! en some of the same that came from behind me again.  It seemed as if they were on patrol. Moving over the area during the peak of the firework displays around the area I live in. They were all actively moving about as if floating and in no particular formation.  I saw one cross up and over in one direction while another one crossed its path in another direction while another one yet would come from out of nowhere on one of either side of me.

To the west of us, about 20-degrees from the horizon appeared a large orange sphere glowing brightly, at 9:44pm.  The object may have been 20 miles away.  An aircraft was seen nearby with its flashing lights.  The large orange sphere appeared larger than the aircraft.  My father and I both spotted it.  My mother saw it as well. The large orange sphere just glowed and hovered in place, maybe moving slightly to the right, north-easterly direction.  After one minute it blinked out.  The nearby aircraft moved on to the south-east. 10-minutes later at 09:55pm, the orange sphere appeared again in roughly the same location in the western sky. It hovered for around 2 minutes then blinked out again. 20-minutes later, at 10:20pm, the orange sphere appeared again in roughly the same location.  After about one-minute, it quickly faded out.  There were no clouds in the sky that night. There were many cars around us also waiting for the fireworks, but we did not talk to any of the other people around. The orange sphere was very similar to the one I spotted in Seattle, the 4th of July 2009 over Lake Union.  The glowing orange spheres, globes, balls seem to be appearing quite regularly around Washington State.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,46.2848,-120.2588

Nothing out there except a house on south/west corner, two story right on the corner.  Green light from source about 20 feet above second story beaming a trapezoid shape of same light down on back of house and back yard.  We could see the trees behind the house, the light waving off of the peak of the house like a mirage, or heat off the hood of a car.  I was staring into ""source"" that was around 30ft x 12ft. I was looking into the rectangle to see equipment, or anything but it was just pure lime green light, saw nothing. Also, we did not see a shape, lights, a craft, nothing.  Not even sound.  Then I got out of my car and by the time I looked back up it was gone, however the little street light that lit up the little 4 way stop was illuminating a/an ""exhaust cloud"", ""churned up atmosphere"", or what I call the ""Doughnut shaped cloud that the Road Runner leaves when he splits.""  This ""cloud"" was floating at a 45 degree angle and if the ""Road Runner"" just ""split"" the trajectory of the object was South/Southwest (If Calvine is true East/West).  We watched this ""cloud"" or ""vapor"" float for about 20 seconds before 2 fighter jets buzzed us from Mather Air Base.  Some seconds later or minutes, came the rumble of a C-130 or AWAX, something obviously bigger and slower than the fighter jets inbound on the same course as the fighter jets, eventually coming overhead and continuing Southeast. No other cars were at the intersection, not much traffic at all on the roads in that area at that time back then.  We got in my car and left, turned on the radio and heard DJ's saying people calling in from all over the Sacramento area with sightings. Next day evening news said, ""We looked into the sightings from last night and spoke to (Naval Command?) and confirmed that it was a test missile launch from the San Fransisco area.""  My friend's dad flew the (T-42?) trainer jet out of Mather, a side by side 2 seater jet for training new pilots.  He said to his dad that we had still not stopped talking about what we saw and after asking his dad what it was his reply was, ""I cannot tell you what it was, but what I can tell you is that it wasn't a missile launch from San Fransisco.""  Since then, I've studied Ufology, and seen almost every video, and read a pile of sighting stories and I still haven't read or seen anything I saw that night.  After years and years of study, and cutting away the media fat, smoke and mirrors and separating information from mis-information and dis-information I'm about 98% convinced that what we saw was either a multi-dimensional craft, or this realm/dimension simply opening up to the other side.

One was tall and slender dressed casually well turned out, neat and clean with an aura that illuminated the room.  He had short neat fair coloured hair and neat light coloured clothing.  He had a nordic appearance.  The light seemed to emanate from behind him and enabled me to see pictures on the wall in a room.  The room was normally pitch black at night with the blind pulled down.  On this beings right was a shorter less visible being who didn't have a aura and appeared unkempt, not sure because he was less visible.  They were talking to each other as they approached my bed.  As they reached the bed the taller well turned out, neat, clean being turned from the shorter being and spoke to me in calm voice and said, ""Where are the stairs?""   Thinking to myself, ""Where am I or why is there people walking here where I am laying down"".  I tried to assess the situation.  I gestured toward the bedroom door to my left with my left hand in response to his question.  They turned toward the door and walked through the closed door which as they walked through appeared open or see through in the aura light which made even the hallway and stairs visible to me.  They continued talking to each other and walked down the stairs and as they walked their foot steps and voices faded and the light faded until there was complete darkness and silence.  I was left wondering what just happened and wondering if I had left my downstairs house entrance unlocked.  I thought to myself, ""Of course I didn't leave it unlocked"" and I thought, ""I'm not going downstairs to follow them as I'm a little fearful as I don't know what these being were. During the encounter I didn't feel scared.  It was only in retropsect I started thinking about what just had happened I became a little spooked, but not enough to stop me from sleeping.  They seem nice not angry or mean. I had a similar encounter about a year before or after where one of these being came through the closed bedroom window again.  Again I think they wanted to know I think where the stairs were.  As they came through the window they moved they blind aside and popped their head in and looked at me and with recognition smiled and came in.  He approached the bed.  There was only one this time.

At approximately 5pm, I took a couple bags of trash outside and around the back of our duplex to the trash containers.  I placed the bags in the containers and then lit a cigarette.  The day was very clear and I was facing away from the house.  Behind our house was a driveway, a small drainage ditch, several trees and a small business office about 100 yards away. I felt as though someone was watching me, as I was not fond of the neighbor in the other half of the duplex. I looked around and saw no one.  I continued to smoke until I detected movement from the corner of my eye up to my right and in the trees about 25 feet away.  I looked up to the right and saw `something` upright and floating for a very brief time, it seemed to move away from behind one branch and go behind another.  It was large though, but less than 6 feet with the device.  There was a translucent globe where a head should be.  I smelled this awful smell that was worse than the dirty diapers in the trash! It hung in my nostrils and my throat.  It was so foul that it was almost chocking.It was obscured by the branches and just disappeared!   I was paralyzed with fear as I attempted to process what I saw.  I dropped the cigarrette and ran indoors to the master bedroom and retrieved a  handgun.   I was so terrified and confused that I was unable to look out the window for a few mi! nutes.  I didn`t say anything for a few days as I doubted what I think I saw. The only description I can think to explain it would be a being, though it certainly did not appear to be a man, with a device around it that enabled it to hover silently in an upright position.  This device was attached at the waist with some platform to stand on but it didn`t make sense to me.  It was not anything that I recognized. I served honorably in the Army and was required to master aircraft recognition as part of my air defense training. I had no idea what it was except that it was a being of some sort.  No eyes in the globe but `it` was watching me! I felt as though I was being watched or monitored.  I truly felt threatened. I am a family man and have several children that I am very protective of.  When I could no longer see it, I could smell a foul odor that was noticeably worse than the dirty diapers in the trash I was carrying.  I felt as though something was very wrong but couldn`t remember much of the details of it though I had frequent night terrors and horrible nightmares since.  I acknowledge that I have had a traumatic past and had been taking medication regularly prior to, during and after this event.  But I know I did see something, even if I mis-identified it, something was there.  It disturbed me so much that I missed Christmas with my family in 2007 and had recurrent panic attacks.  I began to do destructive things, totally out of character for me. I remained quiet about this event up until my wife told me something strange scared her very bad, right about the same time that I had my incident.  We do not go in depth about our experience to each other, though we are very close.  I find myself unable to describe this event clearly as it seems `backwards` or scrambled when I try to explain it.  I did lose track of an hour or so and my neck and my upper back muscles were locked in spasm, as if I had just got into a fight and stayed that way for hours, although I think it was all due to the adrenaline, my memory is blurry of the incident and it takes me awhile to piece it together. I work in retail loss prevention, and have to watch people closely all day.  I notice little things and non-verbal behavior.  Sometimes when I have to apprehend someone for stealing, it entails a chase and or altercation. I do not remember any aircraft at that point but remember the house vibrating later that night from helicopters flying overhead.  We lived near an ammunitions plant and an Air Force base.  We moved away from Blue Springs in 2008. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

He expressed concern over the cause of the incident, more detail of which seems to be coming back to him, in his memory of the event.  His wife also remembers portions of the occurrence, a fact that both of them just shared with one another.  PD))",2013-02-04T00:00:00,39.01482293577982,-94.28685825688073

This sighting differed somewhat, however, in location and the description of the objects and activity. Tonight (8/25) my husband was outside watching the stars. The sky is very clear and cool, with no cloud coverage.  Half-moon clearly visible. My husband came into the house and told me to come outside immediately. Here is what he/I saw: He witnessed a very large orb making no noise. He thought originally that it was a star but it gradually increased in size and became so bright that he had to shield his eyes. It appeared to be stationary and only became larger and brighter. The entire encounter occurred over the course of approximately one minute and the object began to dim until it totally disappeared. Its location was in the northern part of the sky close to the constellation of the Little Dipper. He continued to watch and about five minutes later, another object appeared out of nowhere, smaller in size but still quite bright and circular in shape. This object appeared in the northwest and did not make any noise. He came to the door and called for me. I went outside onto the back porch and I also so this object. It was headed southeast, very bright and larger than a plane. I heard no noise either. We watched it flying at what seemed to be a high rate of speed for about a minute and a half. I ran inside to get my cell phone in an attempt to capture the event but when I got back outside about 30 seconds later, it was gone. My husband said that it went from the bright white light we had both seen, to a dull red, and then it was gone. We both witnessed an airplane in the northwest a few minutes later, with obvious blinking and engine noise. So whatever he and I saw earlier was not a plane mistaken for something else, I don’t believe.

She has worked for the state previously, but now works at a daycare part time.  She would never fabricate a story intentionally and I have never heard her say anything else anywhere near as un-explained. UFO reported sighting in Lexington, SC June 2006 Sighted by ((female's name deleted)). Interviewed by ((husband's initials deleted)). This interview comes on account of a recent (in fact today) sighting by my wife.  Since she had seen a previous sighting some years before, I wanted to compile the two and submit them to the web.  This information below is about a sighting she had in the summer of 2006. Spooky, Near Earth Space Station  When my wife first told me about the sighting, she said, ""I think I saw the space station.  It was really weird!  I had no idea what to think back then, her description though fascinating, boggled my mind, so I basically ignored it.  Now I will document that sighting.  Today I interviewed her;  ""It looked like something you would see in a movie.  ""It was big.  I could see the ""person"" in it.""  If you stretched out your arms straight out at length, in front of you, you would have to spread the fingers about 16-20 inches to equal the apparent length of it. How far away was it?  It was close?   “It WAS close!  I didn't look at it long at all, I simply gasped in shock, and turned around and shut the  door behind me quickly.  All I can say is that it was close!  I saw a “person” with “spiky hair” in it. What direction did it move?  “It was just above the row of “red-tips” (an evergreen shrub of the south U.S.) and it was either hovering or moving slightly to my left. What time of day was it?  “It was midnight.”  What time of the year?  “It was about 2 months after we moved here.”  So that would make it June 2006?  “Yes that sounds right.”  What happened?  “I was on the phone with my friend Melissa.  I didn't want to wake anyone else, so I headed outside.  I opened the side (deck) door, stepped out and there it was.  I said 'Uh-oh!' and turned right around back inside.  I told my friend that I was going to bed and hung the phone up on her right there and then.  I went to bed.” 	“Some days later when I explained to my friend what happened, she said “sometimes you can see the space station.  Maybe that was what you saw.”  But she didn't realize this thing was so near that I could see a 'person' inside it.  But it made absolutely no noise at all.  What was it?!?”  Description:  	Based upon the witnesses description and testimony, the interviewers best guess at size would be approx 8 feet high by 20-25 feet long, rectangular about 2.5 to 3 times as long as it's height.  “It was white with two large windows directly facing me.”  (Based upon the drawing, these windows covered at least 50% of the exposed area.  There might be about 1.5 feet around the edges (and separating the two), all around the windows comprising the rest of the object.  There seemed to be two seating areas, and a “person with spiky hair” sat on the window to my left.""  What was ""he"" doing?  ""There was a control panel that 'he' was 'guiding' the craft with.  Any lights?  There was a “regular” yellowish light on inside it, with no lights on the outside.” What was on the other (right) side?  ""Nothing.  It looked the same as the left side, but no-one was there.  I just saw the one “person.”  Conclusion:  	Myself the interviewer (and husband) know that the story is either an apparition or completely true, but not a work of fiction.  My wife would never make something like this up.  So I wonder what would be the best cause for the sighting? The best match for a man made object would seem to be the cockpit of a large dirigible.  But Amanda saw NO dirigible along the top of the object, and this would have been a much larger portion of the object, but nothing like that was seen.  And the sited object was very low, and CLOSE and it made (she insisted time and again) absolutely NO noise.  Myself (and the family 3-4 years later) have witnessed the travels of a dirigible in the surrounding area about town, and that dirigible maintained at least 400-500 feet above the trees and moved very noisily at maybe 25-35 MPH.  It was flashing a red “billboard” advertisement.  I would have to estimate that the sited (UFO) object was only 200-250 feet above the ground, and only at most the same linear distance, as there was the view of a “person with spiky hair” at the “control panel.”  Unknown Flying Object. ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) Rectangle with two large portals and a figure at the controls up VERY close. This is an amendment or addition to a previous report I submitted about 3 days ago.  I searched tonight online and found a drawn depiction of a UFO sighting that very closely matches that sighting that my Wife saw midnight 6-1-2006.  My wife said ""Yeah!  That's it!  Except that I didn't see any of the back part.""   Here is the web-link to that photo:   http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tlidr95gRew/TU6GTm-CIMI/AAAAAAAABoY/UC36IOfPBV8/s1600/Chile%2BUFO%2B2008%2Bwith%2BHumanoids.jpg   So what my wife saw was a white object very similar to the forward rectangular shape of that picture with a single figure on the LEFT.   She said a yellowish light shone from within.   The sighting lasted only a few seconds, and she fled back inside the house. ((END ADDENDUM))",2012-05-13T00:00:00,33.9597712,-81.25034

It was just above the low lying scattered clouds.  It was like an enormously big shadow that hovered from east to west over the ocean.  While it floated above us, you could ""hear"" the silence, it was too quiet, it was like the noise of life stopped.

We all watched this object float away onto the horizon.  The object was about 400 ft wide and even longer in length, maybe 500-600 ft.  It was hard to see its actual shape because it was a shadow over the clouds, but I remember it being like a mammoth sized blimp-shaped object.

PD)) Strange Incident Near Conrad ICBM  Most Recent Sighting,  One of Many at Nuclear Bases  BY ROBERT HASTINGS    When I lecture on UFOs, I am often asked, ""When and where was the most recent UFO sighting at a nuclear weapons site?""  Given that these incidents are ongoing, it's entirely possible that such a sighting occurred at one missile facility or another very recently, perhaps even last night.  However, as far as I know, the last reported incidents apparently took place near Conrad, Montana, in December 2006. On December 12th, an indivi-dual, not identified, posted an intriguing sighting report on the National UFO Reporting Center website.  It seems that the previous night, while driving home, the anonymous source had sighted a UFO just east of Conrad, Montana.  Moreover, according to the post, he also had another sighting, four days earlier, at almost the same location.  Although there was no mention of nuclear missiles in this report, I knew that the town of Conrad is literally surrounded by Minuteman missile sites.   On a hunch, I contacted NUFORC's director, Peter Davenport, and requested the source's name and contact information.  Davenport then contacted Ryan Riewer, now a student at the University of Montana, who readily agreed to speak with me. In a telephone interview, Riewer told me,  ""I live on a farm nearly three miles east of Conrad.  On December 7, 2006, I was driving home from work at around 10:30 at night. I was on Sollid Road, probably a mile away from our house, when I saw this light out of the corner of my eye, coming from the southwest. It was the fastest thing I've ever seen. It came racing up almost to the road. It stopped dead for a moment, then took off at a 90-degree angle to where it came from. It went southeast, over a hill on the horizon. A couple of seconds later, it came racing back toward me. Then it began to slow down and descended toward the ground at an angle. When it was about fifty feet up, the light shut off. It looked like it landed about a half-mile, or maybe a mile, from our house. That was really, really weird.”  I asked Riewer if there was a missile site in the area where the UFO apparently landed. He seem somewhat surprised by this question but confirmed that was indeed the case. “Yes, there is a missile silo out in that direction. I saw it one time when I was hunting with my dad,” he said, “I would say that the distance between the missile site and where the object landed was about a mile.”  Riewer continued, “Four days later, on December 11th, I was driving home after work again when I saw an extremely bright light in the sky, dead east, directly in front of me. As soon as I got home, I looked at the light with binoculars. By then, it was southeast of us. I saw blue lights on top, a red light on the bottom, and a white light in the middle that kept moving around. I couldn't make out the shape of the object, just the lights on it. My mom looked through the binoculars too. The object remained stationary for half an hour or so.  I would estimate that it was two to three miles southeast of our house.  Then the lights shut off and I could no longer see them.  About five minutes later, I saw another bright light. It looked exactly the same as the other one.  The second object was the about the same distance away, but dead south of us.”  Riewer continued, “I put down the binoculars and called the sheriffs office.  The person I spoke with just said, 'Thanks for reporting this.' He acted like it was no big deal. There have been lots of reports of weird stuff going on around Conrad. He had probably heard other reports like mine, so he wasn't too excited about it. After I got off the phone, I looked at the object again. By then, it appeared as three red lights in a triangular pattern. After a few minutes, the bottom right light shut off. Then the bottom left light moved up to join the top light. All of this took place over a half an hour or so. Then these lights disappeared too. After a few moments, I noticed another object farther off in the distance, north of where I saw the first light. It was northeast of our house, but dimmer, and I couldn't see it too well. About a half an hour later, it was gone.”  After speaking with Riewer, I consulted my large, Air Force-issued map of Malmstrom's Minuteman missile sites and discovered that the Papa Launch Control Facility, designated P-0, is approximately 2 miles north by northwest of his family's farm.  I also found that the boundaries of three 564th Strategic Missile Squadron flights—Papa, Quebec, and Sierra—all converge nearby. According to the map, Launch Facility S-40 is approxi-mately 2.5 miles southeast of Riewer's house, and Launch Facility Q-15 is approximately 5 miles northeast of it. Riewer's estimate that the object southeast of his house on December 11th was “2 to 3 miles” distant seems to place it in the vicinity of S-40, while the dimmer object sighted northeast of his farm was conceivably near Q-15, although that is less certain. I asked Riewer if he had heard or seen military jets either near the objects or in the general area during either sighting. He said that he had not. I then asked if he had noticed any unusual Air Force activity on the ground immediately after either sighting. He responded that he had not. When asked if he had seen other unusual lights or objects in the sky on other occasions, Riewer  replied, “Yes, one night, maybe a year or so before my other sightings, my step-father and I heard what sounded like a helicopter flying really low. It was really loud. We went outside to see what was going on. We saw what looked like a helicopter, but really high up. That was puzzling because we expected it to be close to the ground. It was so high we could only see the lights on it. Then another helicopter came into view. The two met up and just stopped in the sky, really close to each other. Then the noise quit and both of them were silent! By then we figured they weren't helicopters. Then all of the lights slowly faded away, like they were going out. They just disappeared. Those two objects were southeast of the house, in the same general direction where I saw the other objects [on December 7 and 11] and about the same distance away.”  Riewer continued, “I mentioned my sightings at school and got laughed at, but one of my teachers backed me up and told us about his own UFO sighting, which happened while he was out hunting. After that, some other students got brave and told us about their sightings. So I'm not the only one around Conrad who has seen things. In his posting on the NUFORC website, Riewer had mentioned that a mutilated cow had been found on his grandparents farm at the end of October 2006. He told me, “My step-grandpa and grandma have a farm near us, five miles east of Conrad. About a month or so before my sightings, a neighboring rancher had his cows grazing on their land and one of them was found mutilated. Its genitals were missing and the skin on one side its face was peeled off. As far as I know, that was the last time that kind of thing was reported in the area, but cattle have been found that way [on other occasions] in the past.”  According to the Montana press, cattle mutilations were first reported on ranches around Conrad, and elsewhere in Pondera County, in the mid-1970s. Then, after a nearly-three-decade lull, more mutilated cows and steers began to be discovered in the county beginning in 2001. Robert Hastings, author of UFOs and Nukes, Extraordinary Encoun-ters at Nuclear Weapons Sites, is a researcher and lecturer who has interviewed nearly one hundred U.S. Air Force veterans involved in nuclear weapons related UFO incidents. Note: At the time of their experiences, the former or retired USAF sources who Hastings interviewed held positions ranging from nuclear missile launch and target-ing officers, to missile maintenance personnel, to missile security police. The incidents described and documented occurred between 1963 and 1996 at the following  Air Force bases: Malmstrom (Montana), Minot (North Dakota), F.E. Warren (Wyoming), Ellsworth, (South Dakota), Vandenberg (California), and Walker (New Mexico, aka: Roswell). Other sources were stationed at Wurtsmith (Michigan) and Loring (Maine), where B-52 nuclear bombers were based during the Cold War era. In 1966-67, when Hastings’ father was stationed at Malmstrom, and during the time of the reported UFO activity at the nearby Minuteman missile sites, he witnessed five UFOs being tracked on radar in the air traffic control tower (having befriending a radar technician). The incident led to his decades long project and documentation of UFO inci-dents related to nuclear weapons sites. A portion of that documen-tation includes reports from at least six former or retired USAF personnel—Minuteman missile launch officers stationed at Malmstrom in 1967 who divulged their knowledge of UFO involvement in two separate, large-scale missile shutdown incidents. Despite the testimony of missile launch officers, the United States Air Force formally denies UFO-involvement in the officially acknowledged missile shutdown incident at Malmstrom AFB. The official disavowal is found in the 341st Strategic Missile Wing’s “unit history.”  Significantly, according to Hastings, the unit historian, Dav! id Gamble, reported that while compiling material for the official history, he had learned of reports of UFO activity within Malmstrom’s missile fields. When he made inquiries, Gamble received “no cooperation” from those in-the-know. He further said that written changes regarding “the UFO aspect of the missile shutdown incident” had been made by superiors. The final version of the unit history states, “Rumors of Unidentified Flying Objects around the area of Echo Flight during the time of the fault were disproven.”  Hastings presents his findings to colleges and universities nationwide and encourages former and retired military personnel to contact him regarding UFO  incidents related to nuclear weapons launch or storage facilities (email: hastings444@ worldnet.att.net). For a more extensive presentation of Robert Hastings’ findings, including many eyewitness accounts by airmen stationed at Malmstrom Air Force Base and other bases that store or deploy nuclear weapons in the United States, see ufohastings .com.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,48.20419999999999,-111.8589

On April 26, 2007 at 11:55 a.m., my husband and I were traveling south in our 18-wheeler through the Nevada desert when a series of dramatic events took place!  We felt a ""concussion"" of some sort and everything became brighter.  We witnessed several meteorites hit the ground directly near us (some still showing a tail behind them as they hit), and many, many shadows passed over us.  One, in particular, was extremely large and made a loud ""whoosh"" sound as it passed overhead.  I looked forward and there was a large orange, brownish color meteorite heading directly toward us out of the heavens.  I said to my husband, ""it's gonna hit us,"" and braced for the impact.  While waiting for the impact, another one headed toward us in a swooping upward direction from the gully on the right side of the highway as if it had ricocheted off another rock or something. It became suspended in mid air right in front of me, four feet away from the windshield!  This one was round, the size of my fist! and looked like a molten ball of solid bubbling gold!  The larger one that I was bracing for must have missed us by inches, if that!  Since we were traveling at 70 m.p.h., we believe it was more likely wind force that then flung this second one to the right side of our truck where it landed on our air breather with a very loud crash and hissing noises. It then flipped back up onto the lower right hand corner of our windshield, spinning and chipping the windshield as it spun across to the center. It stopped or got “hung-up” right in front of us on the windshield for a brief moment as if it were frozen in time, and began screeching, hissing and sounding as if it were emitting electrical charges like it was going to explode or something. Then it flipped up underneath our visor bending the frame, and hit the sleeper. At that same instant, two other meteorites impacted with the top front of our trailer causing a momentum delay in our forward motion. The marks on our trailer are! approximately 4"" wide and 9"" wide, and the hits on the sleepe! r made a 2"" diameter paint chip and smudges of some sort. I forgot to mention that during this incident I saw what appeared to be black globules falling within a foot of my window along the side of the highway and collected some of this material for research.  We immediately contacted a meteorite laboratory (we will leave unnamed at this time). After hearing our story, examining our truck and taking photos, the lab representative told us that he knew of only one other instance of a meteorite striking a moving vehicle in this manner and that it was just a small stone that was never found.  He continued to agree that our incident is an extreme, very big story, and that he had connections to get the story out.  Since that date we have collected numerous rock specimens, including the items we came face to face with, along with photos and other strange material from our “fall” site. We have shown the meteorite lab many, many specimens and each time they come up with a different reason why these items are not involved in our fall, yet we are the eye-witnesses who were directly involved. They tell us the rock specimens are earthly ""basalt,"" or  “rocks with desert varnish,"" and things that do not make common sense about other items we have shown them. Nor would they explain why our fireball and meteorite report was not filed or even if anyone else had reported a fireball on that day.  I found a photo of a shiny golden meteorite that looked exactly like what we saw, and the lab representative appeared extremely shocked at what he was looking at. He turned green and threw himself back in his chair. Then he stated ""Oh, that's an achondrite - those are rare."" He then admitted that he would not even recognize one if he held it in his hand because they are too similar to earthly rocks and would have to be tested. We told him time and time again that what we saw was yellowish in color and he kept telling us to go look for a black one. It doesn't seem to matter how heavy or solid they are, the appearance of metal and possibly olivine and pyroxene materials inside of them, or the fact that magnets are attracted to them.  As of this date, our story has not been reported and/or told to the general public.  Although we could have easily been killed and were involved in such an extreme incident unlike has  happened before, we cannot even get scientific interest, documentation or recognition regarding this event.  We are only told ""no"" even without further investigation and/or examination.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,,

I noticed 3 red glowing spheres about the size of soccer balls floating 2 feet above the ground.  They were red/orange in color and were hoving, stationary, and making absolutely no noise.

I walked over the ditch seperating the field from the car and walked into the crops and stopped about 10 feet away from the closest object.

It was not ""floating"", it traveled with purpose.  It stopped and start on its way.  I hollered to my husband who was inside the house, to look out the window, by the time I went to knock on the window to get his attention it moved off towards the North East, until it disappeared behind tree line. Day 2 - Was a night time sighting.  First seen by my husband, then me, and then my daughter driving up the road from her work. We are in the country, no streetlights, so we saw it very clearly. It was the same object I had seen a month or so ago, (Day 1) but it was illuminated from within. No lights flickering, no blinking parts, no noise or sound.  It traveled slowly up and over the same tree line, then moved paralell to the tree line, and the illumination went off. We could not see or track it from then as it faded into the dark sky. Haven't seen it since. The object was the size and shape of the pilot cockpit of a hellicopter. Silver with copper strap down the middle of it.  It traveled with purpose and silent.  Was not a balloon or blimp. NAS Millington could not confirm nor deny seeing it on radar.  And basically made my husband feel like an idiot for calling with the information and sighting.

Its light was orange, and was larger than normal for an airplane.  The craft was flying slowly at a low altitude, so we initially thought it was a helicopter.  However, after two or three minutes, as it neared us, it appeared to be circular, approximately 25 ft in diameter with two lines of fire underneath, and as it passed silently overhead, I thought it was an FA-18 from Oceanna NAS that was in trouble.  It flew farther south for a couple of minutes when the fire appeared to flicker out as when you turn off the gas on a grill, and the craft, by then just a dot in the sky, accelerated away at high speed.

This one flew south, then slightly southeast toward the ocean, and dropped down in altitude below the line of sight.

I would say size was size of end of mans thumb if held out at arms length for the first ball, the second 2 were just a bit smaller. The first fireball was very bright, glowing orange with a tail and other colors were a definate green, greeny blue and white. There were ""sparks"" coming off it and I was aware of a hissing/fizzing sound although not loud.(Other reports say no sound but I did hear this). The 2 balls that followed were white with green/ blue colors travelling behind in the path of the first ball equally spaced at approx 1.5 inches using the estimated thumb size at arms length. A strong impression I got was that the first ball was burning up and the 2 behind were following but not ""burning up"". I watched them travel at a steady pace to the horizon which took about 2 minutes from 1st sight, then about 4 mins after that I was still outside and heard a distant low boom which made a neighbours chickens cluck and a dog bark, so they knew something was up. My inital thought was oh my it/they have crashed but there was no signs of fire/glow on the horizon and no reports the next day of a crash so I presume it was a sonic boom.

I saw an object, cigar or cucumber in shape, traveling in a South to Southeast direction passing over my house.  It appeared to be metallic, was shadowed on it's left (East-facing) side and was reddish/orange in color on it's right (West-facing) side which was illuminated by the afternoon sun. The object made absolutely no noise, had no visible wings, left no evidence of a vapor or exhaust trail, had no lights or landing gear.  It resembled a fuselage of a passenger jet sans any type of wing fore, mid or aft and travelled at a constant altitude, velocity and direction.  It was obviously being propelled through the air, pointed/narrow end first. I could not easily tell the altitude of the object with no point of reference, but in comparison to the sun's disk, I would estimate it to have been approximately one half (1/2) of it's diameter.  There was a ceiling of clouds which did not obscure the object and it seemed to me to be well below them. It's speed was impossible to judge based on the fact that I could not tell the objects altitude, but it passed from directly overhead through approximately 45° in roughly 6 seconds until it became obscured by the roof of my house.  At this point I ran inside to get to the South-facing bay window of my house to view the object along with my fiancee'.

Today’s Date: 9/24/2012  Date of sighting: 9/22/2012  Time: approximately 9:50pm  I was driving northbound on Frantz Rd. in Dublin Ohio and entered the left hand turning lane and stopped at the red light.  I was anticipating turning left, onto Metro Place North, and therefore looked to my left and noticed some red looking dots in the sky. I thought, ‘Wow, those look kind of odd. Must be helicopters?’   I then heard a three ‘thwump, thwump, thwumps’ of a helicopter blade that sounded every bit military.  These sounds however came from my right.   I looked out my front windshield and up and over toward the direction of old downtown Dublin and saw no helicopter, nor heard nothing more of blades.  Looking back to my left these red dots were now close enough to have a visible shape. In this stage they were red and rectangular. Like the shape of a slightly shortened domino.   As the first one went by, the red color parted as a sliding glass door would at a department store.  This exposed a red translucent keg barrel shaped sphere. There was no red, only night sky all around this.  I noticed some black horizontals and a vertical line as it passed.  I went on to look at the others that opened in the same manner.  These however had orange translucent keg barrel shaped interiors.  The horizontal and the vertical lines appeared in shades of gray. The shades of orange would also vary.  As these passed more would stream in from the distance and follow in fashion continually moving eastward, and towards the end southeast and up. I would say 20 or so total over the course of a few minutes.  Dots, then rectangular, then opening, then closing, then moving on.  Two in particular came very close above the 10 or so story buildings.  They appeared to be maybe a 100 feet above the buildings.  I watched as these two orange keg barrel shaped things seemed to position themselves for something.  The one on the left stopped. It stayed stationary. The one on the right approached the one on the left more hurriedly than the speed at what the others had moved. It was like ! it got to close in error and started to become a darker orange! and red streaks developed in a couple places before it stopped moving. At the same time the one on the left was becoming a very pale, almost clear orange, to the point where I saw the top fray as if to release something and regain its form all in about a second or two’s time. At this same time the one on the right was beginning to regress or move back. This is the only time I saw one reverse direction. It started to return to a more medium or stable orange. This is when I saw something, I don’t know. The one that went pale all of a sudden had a panel on its left as I faced it. The panel turned, expanded in width or thickness, and outward as well. It then immediately contracted, turned back, rippled and looked like night sky again. Then a panel on the bottom followed suit. At this point it turned back to red, as they all had done as they moved on, then it jettisoned or repositioned upward to the left in the sky. Then was followed by the remaining ones. I could see the hydraulics to ! whatever I was witnessed. The design. The movements. The stages. The last one to pass, like the first, was also red. If I can add anything else to this I will.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,40.108822448979595,-83.14292857142857

At approximatly 2:00pm myself and some of my neighbors spotted a strange formation of lights in the sky that were not high enough to be an airplane nor did it have a shape of any kind of airplane.   At first we all thought it was a kite that was clear in color with possiably stars on it. It looked like a cluster of stars in the daytime sky.  It was a very clear day without even a cloud in the sky.  We all watched this strange sight float from side to side and up and down.  It would disappear at times for a brief few seconds then reappear right around the same area with what looked like falling stars dropping from it at times.  While it changed in shape it never changed with any other colors.  It kept the appearance of a cluster of stars in the daytime sky.  Unfortunatly everyone was in shock and amazement at what we were all seeing and did not have enough time to get a video camera to capture any images.  Several of us tried to take a photo with our cellphones althou! gh our phone cameras could not capture the image of this unknown object.   We all saw the same image and myself and neighbors range in age from the youngest being 20 years old to the oldest being 77 years old.   Nobody was under any mind altering substances and we are all hard working people with professional jobs ranging from the 20 year old being a McDonalds manager to the 77 year old being a retired college professor.

My eleven-year old son was watching fireworks from our back deck when he called me (his mom) and dad outside because he saw some lights. I didn’t think much about it because it was the fourth of July; however, he pointed out four unusual red/orange lights that hovered in unison from the east to west direction.  Our back deck faces north. It was peculiar to see these lights drifting slowly from east to west against the night sky when there were plenty of fireworks.  The first three set of lights were in a triangle shape with the fourth trailing behind. We then called our oldest 17-year old son to see these lights and ask what he thought about them. Shortly after he came to see them we noticed that the first three set of lights in a triangle shape lost the first bottom left light, as it simply disappeared.  Our 17-year old also agreed how odd the lights appeared. We noticed some airplanes to the southeast of us, and we could slightly hear their engines.  The light! s hovered together and kept in the same distance for some time.  The lights began to trail behind a set of trees and as we moved to see if we could see them we noticed that the remaining two from the triangle disappeared, but the last trailing light remained. My eleven-year old son and I went further into the east section of our yard to see the light before it completely went behind the trees, but when we saw it it disappeared.  There was no noise or and sound with this object, and of course we could hear some loud booms from the fireworks in the sky.  My husband and I had not drunk any alcohol or anything like that and had just finished a cup of coffee when we saw this.  So we were very awake and aware of what was occurring. Later about 22:40, we saw something that looked like fireballs in the sky.  These “flames” looked like balls or firedrops hovering slowly in a circular pattern in the nightsky, which was interesting against the fireworks exploding in the sky. These lights a! ppeared to be observing. I went inside and grabbed my binocula! rs to lo ok at these objects. One in particular was unusually close and through the lens of the binoculars it still just looked like a firelight, but smaller?  We (my husband and I) carefully observed it to see whether it was a helicopter or an airplane of some sort take pictures of the fireworks. We are aware that aircraft taking pictures of fireworks is not unusual this time of year, yet we dismissed this possibility when they did not closely resemble aircraft.

After that you could expect to see them appear just about anywhere in the sky. If you let your imagination run a bit, it was like they were curious about all the fireworks going on as they often seemed to collect and completely stop above a specific location that had the most fireworks activity and artificial light.

I would like someone there to check this out & see what they can make of it, if you will. Myself as well as several others were here celebrating the 4th & happened to notice the full moon, one deciding to take some pictures with his fairly expensive camera.  Nothing incredible showed up at first glance, but then the photographer decided to zoom in & started getting different sized red, white, & blue lights appearing in the digital photographs, which were not apparently visible through the camera scope alone, nor to the naked eye. He showed a few others his pics, & upon seeing them I ran to get my telescope.  It is not much for a tele mind ya, but I couldn't see the objects with it either. We took turns looking through the tele as the photographer continued taking pictures, almost all of which captureded these mysterious lights, but in different locations each time, as if they were moving.  I messed with the digital images on my pc some, magnifying some pictures to try & gain a better understanding of exactly what we may be looking at.. but retained the originals as well as their filenames when saving magnified images. I'm not in a good situation financially at the moment, so mailing or 'ups'-ing may not be the best means for me at this time, but I have all the pictures both on my pc & on flashdrive here, if there is some way I can email or otherwise post them(?)   Also, only lately have I begun 'looking up' quite so much, as recent sightings while out with freinds have been recurring to the point it's almost impossible not to notice.. Awhile after dusk on June 10 2012, while finishing up a game of 21 (basketball) at the Lawrence township recreation park in Clearfield PA, one of the 5 adults & 5 children there at the time (I think it was Amber, my fiance') made a comment to the effect of ""wow, wtf is that?!"" & pointed to an extremely bright light in the sky. All of the adults & all but 1 of the children took immediate notice of the almost unnaturally bright light seemingly hovering motionlessly overhead, & in as little time as it took for me to think ""whoa that can't be venus because it just passed in front of the sun a few days ago & isn't out this early in the night this time of year"" the object suddenly decreased significantly in luminousity, then accellerated towards what I believe to be a south-eastern-ish direction. It continued it's direction of travel for several seconds while the light faded & brightened several times before apparently vanishing into thin air. About a week later, while saying our so-longs & such, a younger brother of one of the witnesses to the first sighting was preparing to leave my place when I noticed a very similar bright white light in the southern sky traveling at a fairly quick rate of speed in an eastern direction. I pointed it out to my freind, and he 'kept an eye on it' as I ran to get my telescope. But, of course, by the time I returned with it, according to my friend, it had also just disappeared. Those incedents may or may not be related in any way, but seeing as these are the first we've managed to actually photograph I would love for someone who has seen much more than I could hope to have a look and see what they think of it all..

July4th, 2009 Approx. - 9PM  Shavehead Lake, Union Michigan  Looking at the East sky from directly across the tip of the peninsula as we are on the West side of the lake. We were up at our lake house eagerly anticipating the 4th of July fireworks display that always proves to be pretty spectacular, when I noticed across the lake an unusually looking firework that appeared to be a slow moving glowing ball of fire that gently and gradually floated upward.  I told my friend look at that….that is different type of firework, something we both never seen.  As we both watched this ball of fire rise up almost until the human eye could not see it any more it veered off to the right and appeared to turn into a twinkling little white light almost star appearance?  The person who I was with, said “she has to look into what this new type of firework is so she could get some.   We both were mesmerized by this as we anticipated a big blast of some kind as normal fireworks displays usually have.  But to our surprise, there was no blast or load noise of any kind.  Then a few minutes later appearing in the same location across the night sky, and still before t! he fireworks display had started yet another one of these same strange appearing balls of fire started floating upward.  This one was spaced out were the last one was so it was in the same local but North from the first ball of fire?  Again, we watched this and were truly amazed by this gently floating glowing ball of something that veered off to the Right again and turned into a small looking star.  Well we forgot all about this, until we received our Shavehead Lake Wave newsletter in the mail.  Apparently, we were not the only ones who witnessed this event. As stated in the newsletter, “This year a STRANGE BALL OF FIRE moved slowly across the sky.  Was it a plane on fire?  Was it a comet? No one seems to know.”  August 6, 2011 Approx. 9PM- So here it is, 3 years later at the same above location totally forgetting this above event even took place, when myself, a friend of mine, my daughter and her friend were eagerly anticipating our fire that we were so enjoying when at the tip of the peninsula appeared to be a slow moving uprising ball of fire.  I was speechless, for a few moments and then shouted look you guys, OMG I have not seen this since a few years back on July 4th.   We were all amazed in watching this.  And again, this slow glowing ball of fire gradually moving upward until our eyes could not see it any more veered off to the South or Right and turned into what we thought a little white star or light.  Well this appeared spaced out evenly with 8 balls of fire.  You could only imagine the thrill for me to witness this event AGAIN.  Everyone I was with couldn’t wait to go home and look this up on the internet.  My friend looked up this on the net a few days later when we got home and told me! the same sightings were seen that same night…..in Michigan, by others directly East of Union, MI some 200-300 miles away ! I never told the others this, but later that night I had to walk my dog for one last time.  It was quite late already after our fire and the others were in the house getting ready for bed.  As I walked out towards the lake, I heard a very low sound and looked up above.  I said, out load to myself, OMG I hope this is not the mother ship and was very frightened to have just seen this very low, very large looking what appeared to be a plane or I didn’t even want to know cuz I was frightened and just stood in amazement as it glided over my head out into the East sky. I stood waiting to see if those red balls of fire were going to go to this thing.  But then I didn’t even want to know and went back into the house with my dog.

The crescent shape (rounded side flying forward) must have been flying at least a thousand miles per hour to achieve the speed it was going.  It was out of view within a second.

What I am writing is not for my personal satisfaction of pulling anyone's leg.  I do not like telling this story because not even my family would believe nor would the families of the other three witnesses believe them, as well as it was a chilling event.  I didn't report this for years simply because it had not crossed my mind however I am very interested in the unknown and believe in extraterrestrial existence.  I swear to this story being absolutely true as i payed attention to the details as it happened.  This, I imagine, is a very rare report. Three friends and I were driving through a very rural area in north east texas.  It was very late at night, probably 0330 as we were coming back from a party in a neighboring town.  None of us were hallucinating or in an abnormal state of mind.  We were listening to 99.5 the wolf, a country music station.  With no prompting, the data on the screen of the car's ""head unit"" changed to slashes and the audio coming out of the speakers changed...The following is the best way I can describe what came out of the speakers.  It was as if it was a recording of an interview with an astronaut.  The music stopped following by a very short pause then, what started playing was an older man (i would guess by voice) talking about being on a NASA mission outside of our earth's atmosphere.  During the said mission, the man recalled definately encountered what he referred to as alien aircraft (not UFOs) and that he and the others in his vessel could clearly see ""them"" out the window dogmatically.   This story the man was telling ""played"" for 5+ min.   As this was happening my three friends and I were silent at first, blankly looking at each other.  I was sitting in the back seat and wanted to make sure the two in the front were not playing a joke on me.  I leaned in the front seat and could see the Ipod in the car was clearly not plugged in nor was any other music or internet device.  Then my friend that was driving the car (the owner) pushed the power button on the ""head unit"" firm enough that it should have shut off and absolutely nothing happened.  Then he proceeded to turn the volume knob multiple turns in each direction and the volume did not change either. He repeated both power and volume actions again and still nothing happened.  The volume was still playing at a loud enough level we could clearly hear the details.   We sat in awe for the approximate five to near ten minutes that this was ""playing"" over o! ur radio in the car.  Nothing was around us as we were on a ro! ad surro unded by cut corn fields.  Suddenly the interruption stopped and was followed by the same one or two second pause that stopped the music and then the music started playing again (different song obviously as 5+ min. had passed.)  The three friends in the car with me were not sketchy friends for I had known them for approximately ten years and still know them all.  We have talked about the incident since and all have the exact same memory of the event.  I really hope you take this report seriously for it was the oddest thing that has ever happened to me.

A beautiful day about 12:00 pm.  Before I left, I opened all the windows and sunroof (forgot camera). At some point in the trip, I looked up thru the sunroof.  I noticed a small black object fairly high up; nearly overhead.  It appeared to be a small winged plane. About a half mile further down the interstate, I looked up and the object was at about the same position as before.  Concentrating on it; I saw the wings and tail fins more accurately and said to my self how odd they looked compared to any other plane I had ever seen.  I pulled over and stopped. Still looking at it overhead through the sunroof, I realized it was motionless!  I got out of my car to continue my observation of this black object (I was hoping some other motorist might stop to see what this guy was looking up at.) In the Navy, I was a 2nd Class Fire Control Technician; my action station was in the Fire Control Director at the controls and optics.  I had seen many planes in the sky and had a good feel for distance from my ship to them.  My thinking (at the time of the sighting) was that if this was the typical size of a fighter jet; it must have been about &gt;1500 feet straight up. I stared at it for about a minute; looked up and down the interstate; glanced up and it had disappeared. The front/back of the object had a more sharp point than the attached rendering. What stood out for me was that it was motionless and the stabilizers were the same width with the ends being parallel and in-line.

There were between 9-11 orange lights, bright enough to be very low flying aircraft, but they made no noise at all.  They were flying very slowly northwards (much too slowly to be an small aircraft), evenly spaced, in an arced line except for the last four, which formed a small square.  It looked a bit like the Little Dipper, with less of an arc. I called my husband outside and he saw the whole formation (assuming it wasn't larger before I noticed it) and, because it was moving out of view, we ran to our front yard where we saw our neighbors and told them to look up.  The lights began extinguishing one by one, and by the time our neighbors witnessed them, there were only three, but they were still bright and silent.

I saw that a local news station ran a story about folks seeing strange lights in the sky in the past few days, but no calls to the local Air Force Base or Federal Government have been returned.

I have not felt compelled to report this until now but it did happen.  During Military Police basic combat and advanced individual training at Fort Leonard Wood Missouri, myself and three other soldiers saw a UFO at around 0520. Our entire company was on the pt (physical fitness) field conducting warm ups. It amazes me that we didn’t have fifty witnesses, this could be due to the fact that we were physically engaged at the time and only my platoon was oriented in a manner that allowed me to witness the entire event. We were staying in rather large barracks nick-named “starships”. The PT field we were located at is positioned between Echo Co. 787th MP BN and Delta Co. 787th MP BN. The view on Google earth helps put my report in perspective. I was facing Delta Co. Barracks when I say the Triangle shaped craft slowly, silently and smoothly come over the Delta building in a way that I could tell it was only clearing the roof by 10-20 feet. So it was only 60-70ft above the ground and it took it no more than 8 seconds to fly over the building behind me, about a 465 ft distance on a heading of 356.92 degrees according to Google earth. I would estimate its speed at 50-52 statute miles per hour. Due to the light poles I could clearly see it was much thinner than it was wide and long. I would have to guess that someone human sized would have to have been lying down inside the craft. The surface looked smooth and dark but it was hard to tell with its movement and the lack of daylight. There w! ere five yellowish and dim lights on its bottom along the outside edges of the triangle.  The entire 22 weeks I was at Fort Leonard Wood there was only one day the A-10 Warthogs flew before daylight. This was that day, I could hear them flying all over the place about five minutes after the UFO flew over my formation. They flew around for maybe an hour and a half after I saw the UFO. After PT I asked everyone “Did you see that? If you saw what I saw you would know what I’m talking about.” Three other soldiers came up to me and we talked about what we saw. They all had the same descriptions, one thought it was an alien ship and the other two were convinced it was a new drone the military was testing.

It's footage of a dragster racing at 236 MPH.  As fast as that is, that isn't the interesting thing about this video.  What is interesting is at the end of the video is what appears to be a UFO flying very fast (perhaps faster than the human eye can see)into the upper right hand side of the frame.  I didn't notice this until a few months ago when I was reviewing this footage. If you slow it down you can see what appears to be some kind of glowing thrust.  It's at the end of the video about 28 seconds into it. Had I noticed this at the time I took the footage   I would've kept the camera rolling. Please let me know what you think.  I apologize for the F-bomb that I made just before the footage end.  It was aimed at just how fast this car was going and not at the UFO that I didn't know was there until now.

I was looking at what I thought was smoke coming from the refinery, but this smoke never disappeared into the air.  It seems like strings of light.  These strings were made up of the tiniest pieces of floating light, which some seemed to be astray from those grouped into strings.  They came together in a V-shape, sort of like how birds comes together.  I was totally freaked out but I watched them go across the entire sky until they were gone in the distance.

It had a spectacular view of the Appalachian Mountains facing Marion, NC from near Henredon Road in Spruce Pine.  While we were eating dinner, my friend asked his brother if he'd seen the UFOs lately.  I laughed, because I thought UFOs were stupid.  But his brother said not to laugh, that he had seen then EVERY NIGHT for TWO YEARS.  Sometimes, he said, the lights were so bright that his living room lit up.  I thought the man was insane.  But when it got dark, we went out on his porch with a $2,000 telescope.  For the first hour, we didn't see anything.  I was about to give up, when I saw a red dot appear over the mountain far in the distance.  It was probably a few miles away.  I looked closer, and saw it was too stable to be a jet or plane.  But it moved too much to be a tower.  Soon, another appeared.  In a time span of about 15 minutes, a total of 7 appeared.  They hovered together, and I looked throug! h the telescope at them.  They looked like prisms, flashing red and yellow.  Even through the telescope, they still looked very small, but much closer than the stars.  They changed colors about every second, but it was a gradual change, not a bright flash.  They were primarily red and yellow.  Then the scariest thing happened.  They formed a circle, and started spinning together counter clockwise.  Soon after that, they vanished, one by one.  I think the most interesting thing is that these can be seen every night.  I've since moved away, but I would love to know if these are a government project, an optical illusion, or real UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Driving through Memorial Park, coming home from my son's house after Labor Day, I looked up to see a huge triangular shaped object with various colored lights underneath. It was stationary.  I said to myself, ""What is that?...It must be some kind of light for one of the playing fields out in the park...but where is the pole to hold it up?""   There was no pole.  As I looked closer I said, ""That cannot be a UFO this close to downtown Houston!""  I was within about 3 miles of downtown.  The craft was facing downtown, which is east of the park.  Actually, they were pointing east southeast.  I was about the length of a city block inside the 610 Loop on Memorial.  They should have been visible from Loop 610 as well. A few other cars drove by, but none seemed to look up or notice them at all!  I looked around to see if the other cars were weaving or pulling over or pointing out the window.  (And no, I do not drink alcohol. I was totally sober, no drugs, either.)   I saw airplanes casually flying above all five of these UFOs and they were commercial craft...on their way to Hobby Airport.  This is how I knew the UFOs were pretty low in the sky.  The one nearest me was gigantic.  It was big enough that if I extended my arm full length from my body and held the hand flat, it would not have covered the craft completely!  I was on Memorial Drive, and there are no shoulders, but there was an unused left-turn cut out, (unused because it was night time and that part of the park was closed).  I pulled in there, cut the engine, and got out my cell phone to take a photo.  I noticed there were four others above the one larger one, therefore they looked smaller, but they were the same type of craft.  They were all facing downtown Houston, and seemed to be in formation. I rolled down my window to take a photo, and when that was done, the big one was gone.  I felt quite dizzy. I looked through my windshield and the big one had moved laterally to my right.  I felt confused, and then said aloud, ""Oh, they do not want their picture taken."" I sat there a minute, then I said, ""Well, there is nothing to be done here.""  And I drove home. When I got home, I sat down and watched TV and then went to bed.  It was not until later the next day I called anyone to tell them what I had seen, though I posted it on FB asking if anyone else had seen five large UFOs over Memorial Park the night before.  No response. About a month or two later, I called my friend, ((female name deleted)), and told her what happened.  I commented that it was so odd that I just went home and didn't tell anyone at first.  I never called the media or the police.  It just didn't occur to me. Niara is an abductee herself, has written about this kind of thing for the Durango Examiner, and she offered to hyphotize me (over the phone) to see what we could find out...if there were more that I was not remembering. So we scheduled something, and she took me into a light trance. There was more that I had not remembered, of course.  I was sucked up out of the car  window and taken away for 28 days, and then returned to my car a few seconds later. (They can traverse/manipulate time, apparently.)

I left my house at 0:40 and fired up my snowmobile warmed it up and took off it seemed just like always no problems at all.  I rode around my fields for about 10-15 minutes before setting off into the woods and I arrived at the gate to the next portion of my land. I got off of the snowmobile and took a picture of the snowmobile with my cellphone (picture taken at 1:01:23 01/24/11) before opening the gate and taking off.  I was riding about 30mph checking out the scenery when I noticed off in the distance (I was heading south) through the tree tops 2 bright white lights that where heading towards me and I towards it like 2 huge white eyes I could see through the trees. I crashed off the trail where it curved off to the right and dodged trees and brush and shot back up on the trail where I came to a 80-90 yard clearing where there is no tree cover then my snowmobiles voltage regulator went out and my head l! ight and tail light got really bright then burnt out. Then almost immediately after that my engine died completely. The object was now directly over me and I noticed it had an oval shaped outline I could just barely make out against the night sky. I became mesmerized at the object like a deer in the headlights. I stared up at the object for awhile and the object just hovered silently about 20 feet above the tree line. After some time it lifted up higher into the sky and hovered for a moment before shooting to the north in an instant. I soon started to  snap out of my daze and sat down on my sled to just think about what I had just seen. I sat for awhile before I started to feel fear and a panic seemed to set in. I could just feel my adrenaline flowing through out the whole experience but I really felt a big rush when this panic to get home kicked in. I pulled the starter on my sled so many times before I sat and looked at my phone and the time was now 3:47 according to my c! ell phone and I have a great sense of time. I cant explain whe! re the t ime went I know I was not out there for 3 hours.  It seemed like I only experienced this object very for maybe 40 minutes.  But back to the report. I tried pulling again and after many many pulls it started but it just backfired really bad and lacked power. It could barely speed up to 25mph before shutting off and having to pull it so many times until  it started again. I finally got home at around 5:00.  Still I cant explain the time.,2012-05-13T00:00:00,45.1781,-89.8336

The deck is situated on the north side of our home.  The night sky was between twilight and complete nightfall.  The street lights were on, which one of them is located on the curve of our street.  My back was facing this street light, my husband was talking to me and that is when he noticed something coming over tree top.  He said “what the hell is that?”  I then turned around and said “holy crap”.  My husband ran into the house to grab the camera.  The first thing I noticed was how huge the red lights were, but they were not blinding and the lights followed the curvature of the craft, but only, and I would say about ½ of the “round” shape.  I could not see the outline of the craft, but you could tell the shape because of the lights.  Also, there was also a row of white lights below the red o! nes (but not as many as the red or as big).  They were brilliant in color, but still did not blind us.  I also had noticed that there was absolutely no sound from this craft.  I took a couple of pictures, but my camera has a video capacity on it and had videoed about a minute and 22 seconds.  At this point in time, the craft had moved slowly in a wide curved motion (moving away from our point of view).  My video has only the “back” side of craft where the lights were blinking: Red (the dominate color) then changed to Blue.   But upon looking at the video footage, it seems that maybe there were two crafts, where the other one was much further away from “craft 1”, but I can only see the blue light.  There had been other aircrafts as well in the night sky that we all can recognize, and I know the difference between the two.  The craft had since disappeared into the distanced.  At that point in time, I had moved from my deck down to the end of my driveway – when it was gone, I ! turned around to go back to my deck to talk to my husband.  I ! had turn ed my head in the direction of where we had seen this craft and realized it was back in the same position where we originally had seen it (over the tree top).  I yelled at my husband and said “It’s back!  It’s back!” I also was amazed at how fast it was back because I literally turned around and walked a few steps before I looked over my shoulder.  I had since turned my camera off and tried to turn it back on so I could get a better video shot, but I could not.  This craft went around in a huge circumference three times and yet no sound at all.  You could hear the regular jets, but not this craft.  I tried taking pictures but the quality of my camera is not the best at night (old model).",2012-10-30T00:00:00,41.6887,-71.9091

The night was clear and many stars were visible as usual. We sat outside for twenty minutes or so to watch the skies.  I should note that in the past few weeks, I have witnessed some odd objects in the sky above my house, and thus we were looking for such.  The lights we have seen lately are usually red in color, round or triangle shaped, and move too quickly to be stars.  My companion and I noticed a couple of these, but as they have become so common, we were not particularly entranced.  However, as we gazed to the East, we both saw a very large, VERY bright, green ball of light, which quickly shot above the tree line, in an Easterly direction.  Once behind the tree line, the forest seemed to light up with a greenish glow for a couple seconds, then become dark again. The object appeared to be close, though I cannot say for sure, as I was not sure the size or speed.  Shortly after, we both heard the whir of what sounded like helicopters, though we did not see any.  My cell phone battery also drained shortly after. Prior to this event, a few weeks ago, I tried to film one of the red lights in the sky with my cell phone camera.  The quality is very bad, and all I seemed to film was a glowing rectangle that looked nothing like the red light.

My wife and mother-in-law were sitting with me in a large crowd prior to watching the City of Mount Vernon’s 4th of July fireworks display about 10:00 pm at Edgewater Park in West Mount Vernon, when I noticed a fairly large, pulsating-reddish-orange orb slowly approaching from the northeast.  I assumed it was just an airplane or helicopter, so I went back to watching the citizens of the area light off their personal fireworks prior to the main event and lost track of the object. A few minutes later, the three of us together noticed three more orbs, like the first one I had seen, in an uneven tandem formation approaching the area very slowly from the south.  I thought they might be helicopters because of the formation’s very slow speed, and so I continued to chat with my wife and mother-in-law while we watched the orbs.  After the formation slowed almost to a hover about a mile away, the lead object slowly turned right to the east while the other two remained approximately in place.  As the lead object slowly proceeded on its new trajectory, it gradually transitioned from a pulsating reddish-orange color to a smaller solid-whitish light until it seemed to disappear.  My wife said something about “UFOs,” and even someone in the crowd behind us remarked that they might be UFOs, but I still continued to think they HAD to be aircraft.  But, what puzzled me was the oversize pulsating reddish-orange color and the lack of a standard aircraft position lighti! ng scheme of small, solid red and green lights with a white strobe.  When the fireworks show began, our attention was transferred to the spectacular display and the orbs were forgotten. After taking my mother-in-law home, my wife and I were east-bound on Memorial Hwy (SR 536) driving back to our trailer in West Mount Vernon, when my wife noticed a single reddish-orange pulsating orb off to the south less than a mile away.  We pulled our car off to the side of the road and stopped to get out of our car and better observe the object’s behavior.  The soundless orb was slowly paralleling the road in a straight line about 500 feet in the air when it gradually morphed to a small point of white light before it went behind a tree that blocked our view.  We excitedly left for home after we were unable to find it again. When we got home, we searched the sky outside for about 10 minutes to see if we could observe any more of the objects, but we failed to see anything other than two separate aircraft (we could see their familiar outline) fly by with their trademark white strobe-light with red and green position-lights.

About 9:30PM last night two friends and I went up on my roof and sat in chairs facing West, giving us a sweeping view of Puget Sound, Vashon, Baimbridge and Blake islands and the Olympic mountains. It was twilight, and there were multiple fireworks going off both on our side of the Sound and across on the islands. Suddenly all three of us noticed two bright reddish orange lights flying southward, in tandem, down the Sound. I would estimate that they were at 5,000 feet altitude, flying slightly faster than a jet, maintaining equal distance from one another, and completely silent.  They were about the size of a large jet, but were just glowing lights, with no visible structure.  As they flew over the North tip of Vashon Island, they both appeared to slow down, and the one that was slightly ahead began to dim.  They continued on their course until we could no longer see them (behind some trees in my yard).  We were amazed and were discussing what they possibly could have been when another light, this time solo, followed the exact same path down the sound. At this point, I ran down to grab some high powered binoculars, and within a few minutes another light followed in the same path as the prior three.  This time I was able to get a much closer look, focusing in on it with the binoculars.  It l ooked like a fireball, with a red glow behind it.  This one too slowed and dimmed but never fully faded.  Over the course of the next half hour, five more of these lights came down the sound.  We saw one jet, flying Northwesterly from Seatac airport, clearly make a large turn to avoid the passing light. I cannot stress enough that these lights were no part of the fireworks displays.  They were much higher in the sky, and we had a clear view of each one for at least 30 seconds as it flew from North to South.  Even though the main firework event was going on 10 miles North of us over Lake Union in Seattle, Im sure there were thousands of people watching fireworks over Puget Sound and it would have been impossible to miss these lights traveling down the sound.

At first thought it was a helicopter, but had an orange/red glow and no navigation lights and no sound.  Then thought it might be an airplane at high elevation catching the sun.  It moved south and then disappeared; thought it may have gone into the shadow of the earth. Perhaps 10 minutes later saw two similar lights/objects moving from south to north and far to the south.  Very close together it seemed – and too close to each other to be airplanes.  They disappeared as they moved to the north.  Which seems odd if they were entering the earth’s shadow, as the first object disappeared as it moved south.  There may have been one or two lights/objects off to the east at this time. Then during the height of the Lake Union fireworks show about 15 minutes later there were numerous lights/objects (five?) far off to the east moving north to south, with two of the objects close together.   They disappeared as they moved slowly to the south, but did not disappear at the same time, and also did not disappear at the same latitude (so perhaps not due to the earth’s shadow).  All of the sightings lasted for perhaps 1 to 2 minutes before they would disappear.  Other than the two possible pairs of objects, they were not in any formation.

Silently and in the same direction (from the NW to the SE).  Each had the same speed: guessing about 10 mph?  All were also at the same altitude.  Each also just suddenly disappeared while watching. As noted, we have been mesmerized by this unique sighting for years and have posted UFO reports. Each year, however, we have only witnessed one over Bothell.  This year was exciting as we saw many. As always, we see these on the 4th of July. I can share we had a revelation this year as we experienced this orb up close and our understanding of what we have witnessed was changed.  A new ""firework"" was avaialble for purchase at our local shop called the Chinese Lantern.  We set 3 of these off ourselves: one red, one orange, and one pink.  Each had a fire actually in flame which raised this 2 ft long x 1 ft long paper lantern directly up. It moved SE as the wind came from the NW.  It floated quickly up and the higher it got the faster it moved. It was silent, of course.  It glowed ""orange"" from within.  Explaining that beautiful ""lit from within"" result we've witnessed over the years.  It glided steadily as we watched and the suddenly just went out.  It I took pictures of it with my 12x zoom level and compared it to the pictures of the orange orbs that moved over head.  They looked exactly the same. (I will include them with this report.)  All sightings moved SE with the wind direction, and all were at the same altitude ! and speed. This reports our personal sightings here in Bothell which always occur on the 4th of July.

It was raining with VERY low visibility.  The craft was powered by what sounded like a gasoline engine. The craft was triangle shaped with rear mounted engine / propeller.

There were three of them in total. What struck me was I know what a beacon light on an aircraft looks like, and what I saw was not like any beacon light I have ever seen in my life. The objects seemed very distant, and high up. They displayed a multicolored strobe effect producing a white flash (most frequent), a blue flash (displayed this color maybe three times), and a red flash (only one of the three objects flashed red).  On none of the objects was the flash timed. There was no beat so to speak. The lights flashed without rhythm. What struck me is that they appeared very far up and far away yet their flash was powerful.  One by one the objects disappeared except the last two seemed to stay stationary at one point, then too proceeded across the sky quickly.  They all moved across the sky and due to the great distance, I imagine were traveling very quickly.

It appeared to be flying at least 40K-50K feet high and from my vantage point it appeared to be about 4-5 inches long/wide.  There were approx 16-20 lights that were visible at all times. The most disturbing item to me and one that has caused me to submit this report is that the object look 'translucent'.  The only example I can give is the way you view a jellyfish in the ocean.  You see it, but not at first as it blends in as part of what is around it.  This particular object caught my attention from the left corner of my eye.  I was facing west, looking at Orion's Belt from my balcony.  The night sky today is crystal clear from my vantage.  When the object caught my eye, at first I thought it was a 'cluster of moving stars', which I thought was odd.  Then I realized the 'cluster' was actually moving in tandem and very smoothly.  As I watched what I thought was a cluster of stars go across the sky, I then saw that it wasn't stars at all; rather it was a large Diamond type craft.  I thought ""What.  What stars are in the shape of a huge Diamond?"".  As the object continued to move I was able to figure out that the cluster of 'stars' were actually some type of l! ights and were a part of a bigger object. As it came in from my left (south) it moved across my view of Orion's Belt and continued to go directly north (right).  I watched it until it was so far away that I could no longer see it.  It did not zig zag, speeed up, slow down or anything odd.  It just moved across the sky as would a plane. Everyone probably says 'please don't think I crazy', but I really don't want anyone to think I am crazy.  If I had to say what I saw in just a few words, it would be a Diamond Shaped object, flying at least 40K -50K feet high, moving across the sky no faster than an airplane, having 16-20 bright lights, being 5-6 inches (top to bottom, side to side) in the sky and 'masking' or 'hiding' itself with some type of translucent type film or cover.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,25.745045862068963,-80.27092034482759

The appearances lasted for an hour and the crafts seemed to be on a schedule one going this way one going another direction.  All eventually moving over us at the same point.

At 8:59 PM, Monday April 23rd I was working on my computer when my roommate called me outside to look at something. We live in the Spokane Valley and our back porch faces west towards the city of Spokane. My roommate who had been observing Venus and the crescent moon observed an object moving exactly from south to north at the speed of a light aircraft travelling at about 8-10,000 feet altitude. This was over 1 hour after local sunset so the skies were not quite black but nearly so. It took me twenty seconds to acquire the object. It was only visible from the reflected light of the city of Spokane. The object had no lights, was completely silent, and appeared to be tan or light brown in color. I noticed that it was heading directly towards Venus and amazingly in a few seconds it passed directly in front of Venus. It completely blocked out Venus for 1 second and I was able to get an impression of an elongated  (in the direction of travel)irregularly shaped cr! aft (something similar to a box-like “pixilated”appearance). The fact that this object was silent struck me as very weird. I ran to get my binocs and when I returned the object was quickly receding from view in part because of the severe light pollution in this location. From our location the object was 30 degrees above the western horizon when it passed in front of Venus. I estimate it had an angular diameter between 1/8 and ¼ degree.  I only saw the object for a total of  10-15 seconds but my roommate estimates it took 70-80 seconds from the time it appeared near the southern horizon to when it occulted Venus. I wish I could describe the craft in more detail but it was only visible from reflected light and my night vision was shot from looking at a computer screen. From my perspective it appeared to be larger than a Cessna would be at that altitude (5-10,000 feet).

Silver Ball viewed close up at low leval in the sky.,Colwyn Bay (UK/England),,2011-06-01T15:00:00,sphere,3 days,"Occurred : 6/1/2011 15:00  (Entered as : june 2011 15:00) Reported: 3/22/2012 9:13:35 PM 21:13 Posted: 5/13/2012 Location: Colwyn Bay (UK/England),  Shape: Sphere Duration:3 days",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87959.html,"Silver Ball viewed close up at low leval in the sky. Hello, this happened to me over the course of 3 to 14 days during mid summer time in 2011.  Some of what happened to me may be unconnected or parts of it mightbe.  I will try to be coherent in my time line. OK first,I live in the UK, wales,even thou this happened nearly one year ago it has been on my mind now and again,I have tried to say to myself somethings could be connected other times I dismiss it as myself getting to imaginative.I myself am not 100% sure if I am just putting nonsequential events together when they are not connected at all, but some things over the course of 2 weeks were not usual occurrences around where I live, I have lived in the same area for 40 years I know it very well. Ok, I was at my house on a sunday afternoon, i cannot recall the month but it was summer 2011, I know it was sunday because I was going to have a sunday meal.ok. I walked outside the back of the house and looked to the south at about 3 house heights up over the next door house was a silver ball/sphere it was the size of a beachball,maybe one metre diameter I,d estimate, it loooked a solid object, the colour was like stainless steel or a bright steel, and it was reflecting sunlight,it was a bright sunny clear summers day.This silver ball was hovering making no sound.It had what looked like a band going around the center which looked the same material as the rest of the ball.It was just hovering but stationary in the air for the short time I looked at it.I looked at it for about 1 minute then I kinda thought this is not a normal object, so I went back into the house for safety.I did not go back outside,I told no one in my family. OK,that was my sighting, it was a close up sighting, defo not a balloon or anything like a remote controlled plane or helicopter, it was a defined silver large ball that looked like it was made out of a metal,shiny steel etc,no sound.Not anything I have ever seen before or since in person.I have seen similar descriptions from people on UFO websites.I belive they are called Telemetre Balls?? ( I cound be wrong about this name ) I recall within a day or two I was at the same house I had only woken up and the dooor bell rang,I did look like I had just woken up, unshaven hair a mess etc. I answered the door, two men were standing there, one facing me at about 5 feet away, the other person was at my rightside about 2 feet from me.This person would have stood out to anyone.Ok, both ""Men"" were immaculatley dressed in dark suits, and I mean immaculate, saville row type looking suits, expensive. Both ""Men"" said nothing,when I opened the door,the man facing me who I looked at first gave a small grin out the left side of his mouth,I guessed this was because I looked like I had just woken up,which I had.This was all this man did, he looked about 35 to 40 years of age,dark to black hair,short haircut,clean shaven,just like a high flying excecutive would look like,very polished look.Looked like a normal man in the face. OK, the other ""Man"" was different to the man who was facing me,first his suit was black,with I think a light coloured shirt,still very smart.I cannot remember his hair colour but I think it was also a short haircut.As soon as I opened the door and right after I looked at the man facing me the man to my right handed me a leaflet,and this is the strange bit, as I looked down towards his hand as I put out my arm & hand to take the leaflet from this ""Man"" I noticed his skin was Extremely pale nearly as white as white,there was no pink pigment look to the skin like most white men have,This persons hand skin was very very pale,his hand had 5 fingers.This really cought my attention.Also he was wearing the black ""Blue Brothers"" type sun glasses, like Dan Ackroyd wore in the Blues Brothers film.ok. I could not see his eyes,but his face skin was also very very pale, no normal pink skin tone at all,just very pale almost paper white in colour,why this ""Man"" out of the 2 was wearing the black sunglasses so I could not see the eyes but the other man who looked normal did not wear sunglasses has puzzled me since. The leaflet handed to me was about Jesus,a ""WatchTower"" leaflet, I guess these ""Men"" must both have been american? because of the WatchTower leaflet,I said to myself after they must be Johovah Witnesses.Neither men said anything.I took the leaflet and said somethin like ""thanks"" and closed the door.I did not go back to see where they both walked to.OK. The man facing me after thinking about it afterwards seemed a normal man to me,nothing out of place about him, just a very smartly dressed man.But the other person would have looked out of place to mostly anyone, if I had seen him close up again I defo would have been aware of how different his skin colour was and also I got the idea he was more than different than just his skin colour, there was something more going on with this person,I keep putting this thought/feeling down to my imagination when ever I think about it like now when I am typing this report. Maybe nothing maybe something, I guess you have to be there to really know. OK, the next day at night time about 21:00 hours, I,d guess within 3 days of seeing the silver ball in the sky,I was walking up to the local shop up on the hill on the otherside of a small mountain where I live near,as I was walking up the road that goes anti clockwise around the small mountain I saw a helicopter at low leval less than 100 feet flying above the houses that are all around the base of this small mountain where I live.This helicopter had an open bubble canopy and I could make out a man in the left side of the cabin looking down and around at the houses below.I have never ever seen a helicopter like this before or since flying around the area where I live, from the looks of it I think it was searching around the area where I live for something.OK, this first helicopter was at low level, there was also another helicopter much higher up flying a grid patter it would fly in one direction then turn back the way it had just flown.This helicopter looked like the local! police helicopter, I have seen this helicopter many times flying around as the police use it to follow cars or search for people,but it usually has a very powerful search light on,this time it did not,but I know it has infra red heat search capabilities.OK,Even higher up in the sky were two jets flying also back and forth in a type of grid search.There is a jet training base near me and I see the jets regularly so it is nothing new to see 2 jets,But! I know the jets usual flight pattern,but these 2 jets were flying a totally different flight pattern to what they have always flown before or since I saw these 2 helicopters and the jets altogether.I had never seen before or since a bubble open canopy helicopter flying very low level and the police helicopter at mid height then 2 fast jets flying very high leval before or since this particular night,within 3 days of seeing this silver ball hovering in the sky at close range.It looked to me they were looking for something. After this during the next 2 weeks at the same house where I saw the silver ball in the sky and the 2 ""Strange"" ""Men"" who called round, I had ""Johovah Witnesses"" call round every other day for about 2 weeks, it was bizzare to say the least.Sometimes it was 2 normal young men in their early twenties who would call round or 2 normal young girls who also looked in their early twenties.I also had a very old women and a middleage man call round asking me if I belived in Jesus etc etc and tying to hand me leaflets just like the first ""Strange"" ""Men"". I was always polite, but it seemed very strange to me why so many were calling at my house,almost as if they had been told that I was a very possible convert or that I had an interest in their religion or something, or possible unknown even to them apart from the very first two ""Men"" these others were unwitting tools for another reason they knew nothing about. The mind can run away with ideas at times,but I had never had this many jehovah witness people ever call before or since at my house,it was only after seeing the silver ball in the sky, ( Maybe the first two people were men in black??). OK now if you think what I have typed so far is bizzaro there is an even more strange things that happened to me during the 2 weeks the religous peple were calling at my house. I was in bed around 7am I woke up and from my bedroom window,s direction but, it sounded like inside my bedroom I heard a distinct clear female voice speaking a bible verse or something  like a bible verse,I took it to have a religous meaning because God was mention.This is all I will say about this as it was extremely weird!! I have never heard voices before or after this happened and I have no mental health history.Just so everyone who reads this is clear, I donot hear voices in my head ok. But what was strange is the bible verse this ""female voice"" spoke was the same bible verse a jehovah witness spoke to me at the door of my house within afew hours of hearing this female voice when I had just woken up. The door bell rang I opened the door and there were two young women there, one was holding an open bible, and she started reciting to me a bible verse which was exactly the same as the earler female voice I heard recited also.THis was getting all to much for me so when the yoing women who was at my door stopped speaking and asked me if I had anything to say I just closed the house door, it was all too weird. These two young women did not call back which was a wise choice on their parts because I was beginning to lose patience with these people calling at my house all the time, 2 weeks was beginning to make me unhappy with them,but they stopped calling in the end. I donot know if any of the events with the people calling at my house or the 2 helicopters and the jets were linked with the silver ball I saw in the sky or even if the 2 ""Men"" who called the first time with the man with the very pale skin was connected with the silver ball I saw, I have no idea this is just what happened during this 2 week time period after I saw this distinct quite big silver ball hovering/floating above the houses near to my house, it did nor look like something man had made,it was out of place just hovering in the sky. Thanks for reading my report it is an honest appraisal of events that happened to me.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I quickly ran outside and saw what appeared to be a face with an arrow in front of it, sort of like an ancient carving or something.  I captured video of this whole event.  The storm proceeded with zero rain at first, but a near touchdown of an apparent tornado which I captured on video. Since then I've had what can best be described as demonic oppression symptoms.  I decided to go over the footage again, as this general date was the time I started to have unexplained symptoms.  To my shock, i captured 1 fast moving rod shaped UFO, a shocking cloud of obvious faces in a cumulonimbus cloud that spawned a 'funnel', a craft appearing out of the funnel, an object shooting upward in the foreground skyward into the clouds, reptile faces and shapes in the sti! ll photos, and weird centipede-shaped organisms or beings.  The crafts can best be seen when the hue is inverted in the video. It is obvious with sharp edges and landing gear style legs that appear.  It seems to change shape at will.

I have not reported this sighting to date because I was certain that I was simply missing something that was obvious but I cannot let it go and when I heard Mr. Peter Davenport's comment on the importance of not sitting on unreporting sightings on a recent Coast to Coast AM broadcase, I decided to finally pass my account. My home is in Rolla, Missouri and at about 8 pm on July 4, 2011 (being July 4 is the first reason I dismissed what I saw), I was in my front yard shooting off fireworks with my children.  It was betting dusky but still quite light and the sky was overcast.  I am not certain what the visible ceiling was but below the cloud layer I noticed a bright light almost directly over my head.  I do not think that the light was very high as the clouds seemed quite low in the sky but I cannot speak to their elevation.   My wife also noted the light and asked me what it was.  I commented that it must be a firework perhaps on a parachute.  There was no noise at all so I  doubted it was a helicopter or airplane given the light could not be too high given the low-lying clouds.  It was moving towards the west slowly on a straight line.  My wife lost interest in the light but I continued to watch it expecting it to descend as I presumed it was a firework on a chute.   Also, the light did not ap! pear to be a spotlight as it shimmered as if it was burning.  Once again, no sound of an engine was audible.   I glanced off to the south and discovered another light parallel to the first as far as I could determine.  It appeared to be a match to the one I had first noticed immediately overhead.  Both lights continued on their westward path until they disappeared beyond the treeline.  I was able to observe them for more than 5 minutes and there was no sign they ever descended.  Thus I cannot believe they were fireworks and there were no running lights beyond the single burning ball of light makes me doubt they were aircraft.  As I really would like to see an UFO of extraterrestial origin, I am thus intentionally skeptical but my recollections are as dispassionate and accurate as I can make them.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,37.92709285714285,-91.77891428571428

If I had thought to check this site then, I would have reported sooner. UFO's aren't my thing but this was darned odd. I am a technology professional. I don't have time for UFO's and little green men.  About 45 minutes before fireworks were due to begin, my wife, my two kids and I were out in the front yard playing and waiting for darkness to fall so we could watch the fireworks our town puts on every year. Our yard has a spacious view of the skies to the north and west. As my infant son played in the bed of my pickup truck, I was intrigued when I noticed a single, bright ball of light moving very slowly southward from the distance in the northern sky. It took several minutes for the light to reach our position but slightly west of us. As it came closer, it almost seemed as if it was made of fire, like a campfire moving through sky?! Since there were no clouds, I was unable to determine any kind of altitude. As I watched it continue to move southward, it seemed to slowly fade out and disappear completely. I could see the lights and vapor trails of airplanes higher up but not this object.  As fascinating as that object was, I was completely astounded when I witnessed five more objects, traveling nearly the same trajectory, one by one in succession, cross the evening sky in the same general direction, that is, north to south. The last object traveled out of the north, moving directly south and ended up to the east of our position. They all took approximately 5 to 7 minutes to traverse the sky.  My first thought was that these were some kind of rocket tests as we are near Crane Naval Weapons Station. But I never found any news articles stating that there would be tests. I eliminated the possibility of chinese lanterns simply because of their trajectory. I didn't have a video capture device at the time so I was unable to get footage.  One idea I had was to look back and see what the wind patterns were on that night, but I am unable to find any data on this.

It was about ten times the size of a plane and was low right above the trees.   It was hovering for a while and then slowly turned and lowered.  It was soundless.  It looked as if it was landing and the two front lights looked about 6-10 inches apart.  The ship looked somewhat transparent in spots.   After the craft dissapeared we noticed two other planes that looked like human planes flying near it.  We don't know if those planes saw the aircraft.

I also have only mentioned this to a handful of people and 50 percent of the ones I mentioned this to would be very skeptical.  There were 5 witnesses to this incident, me and my 2 siblings and my grandparents that are now deceased. On October 15 1967 I was a 7 year old child, and my brother and sister were picked up at a friend of my grandparents  that kept us after school until my grandparents who owned a small business closed up shop and could take us home. That night my grandparents dropped off groceries at the house before coming to get us and on the way back in the car, I heard my grandfather say "" I wish I could see that strange light again that I saw on the way to get the kids.. I am not sure what it was. Maybe a helicopter or something"" A few minutes later as we were turning off the main road and onto a dirt road going to the house, my grandfather said ""there it is again!""  He slowed the car down and suddenly a reddish orange disk moved slowly at a little above tree top level and heading over the car. My grandfather stopped and said ""I want to see this!"" and my grandmother told him to keep going. I remember vividly the disk was rotating and looked as if was glowing red hot like a stove burner on high. Also, the disk would have bits of flame or sparks that would fly off the leading edges of the disk. The strangest thing about it was that even though it was very bright it gave off no light anywhere. I asked my grandmother what it was and she didn't want to disturb us anymore and said, ""Oh it is probably a flare set off by the Coast Guard.""   As a child I believed this because we lived near the Atlantic Ocean.  We went home and she fed us and put us to bed.  The next morning my mother, who was working the all night shift came home at about 7 a.m.  As I was getting up to go to school, I overheard my grandmother telling my mother about the incident and she was very concerned, a total 180 from the ""Coast Guard story,"" that she told us kids.  I realized that something strange had indeed occurred. A few years later when I was older I asked my grandmother about it and she said of course it was something unexplainable and peculiar but she didn't want us children to be scared.  And said I will never know what it was.  Also, a couple of years after the incident, me and a friend were walking through the woods near where the incident occurred and found a spot in the woods that was a perfect circle about 2 feet in diameter that nothing would grow in.  We found that to be strange and my friend used to refer to it as the ""UFO spot"" our favorite place to hang out. I went back about a year ago to see if the spot was still there but there are houses developed there now and I could not find it.  I may go to the place and look again. I have reported this as best as I can and remember.  The incident still remains quite vivid in my mind.  This  is a true and accurate account of what we witnessed on October 15, 1967.",,34.4568,-77.6691

I was the only one to witness this first light and described it to my family, who promptly dismissed it.   However, within minutes, another light appeared somewhat closer this time, which all four of us witnessed.  Within one second and immediately next to it, another light appeared at the same time.   Then, a THIRD light appeared and created a row of lights exactly the same, in a straight line.  At this point, we were witnessing 5 lights in the sky;  the 3 lights then extinguished, and the original 2 followed.  This all happened within 5-10 seconds.

They did not all appear at the same time, but within milliseconds of each other, glowed together and at once for about half a second, and then disappeared the same way (millisecond sequence extinguishing). I attempted to capture some of this on my iPhone video, which I realized was likely futile, but I did get a speck of light to show up. We recognized that we are in close proximity to several military bases, and several minutes later we did hear faint sounds of jets flying overhead.  However, this light phenomenon was like nothing any of us had ever witnessed (and we are regular stargazers).

It stayed there for about 2 minutes and then banked off for about 2 or 3 seconds before just disappearing. I've always wondered about it and tell the story once in a while. I recently told it to my 8 year old grandson. When he asked me what it was doing there, I said, ""Good question, I've always wondered that.""

This light did not disperse and instead traveled from North to South as we faced West.  This was about 10:30 pm and it continued south until it disappeared.  After putting the kids to bed, we went back outside to continue to watch the surrounding firework displays.  This time we were on our patio facing East.  About 11:00 pm all of a sudden a bright glowing object came up over our home from that easterly direction (from where the moon was rising).  It was if something was on fire, it glowed with an orange to red color tone, but so bright.  From where I was sitting it was as large as my thumb.  Its shape was like a standing oval.  It was quite large and there was no sound at all.  As we were studying this, another came up right behind it.  It seemed to following the same travel patte! rn.  Then these two objects switched direction from coming towards us (west) to then moving south.  During this specific time of watching the two bright shining objects travel now to the south, we did have an aircraft fly overhead south to north and it was loud.  This reinforced to me that whatever these were had no sound.  These objects kept traveling south until they were the size of a distant star then disappeared as the first did earlier.  As I was getting ready to go back inside in the same spot (south eastern) where the two objects had disappeared a short time before, a glow again appeared traveling now north, back towards me.  It got bright and large  then switched directions and disappeared again going south.  As a side note, we have had air traffic above our home for the last few years, either commercial airlines which travel at a much higher altitude moving from south to north, or air traffic coming from Joint Fort Lewis McCord, which usually travels from an easterly to westerly direction.  The aircrafts that usually come from Joint Fort Lewis McCord are so loud and close that they shake the house windows.  Whatever was in the sky, seemed more like it was floating, at times looking like it was stationary, kinda like an air balloon.  It glowed as if on fire, changing colors from bright yellow, to orange to red.  It made no sound and had to be traveling quite fast to have the mass of half the moon, to in just a minute or two a small distant star.

It was around 3:33a.m. in the morning after falling to sleep watching television.  Ancient Aliens on the History Channel was the last show of this sort of interest that I remember watching around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. that night. I get exited about ufos and once it's is on the air of television I can't put my fork down. lol   I woke up out of a dream (can't really remember exactly what it pertained to but, I, at the time was really back infatuated with the paranormal events that were occuring accross America. I got off of my sofa and kept thinking about what it would be like walking on a battlefield where the U.S. would be in a sort of intense battle with E.T.s in spaceships you would see maybe in a dream or vision. I walked to the spacious ground area which was about 1 acre or so in length and 3/4 of a football field wide. My imagination is vivid and wide most of the time so I felt ok to see landed spaceships and pretend thing were flying in the night sky.  Don't know for sure if I really saw something around there but it definitly was capturing and frightening. I got a little too scared so I said I'm going back inside. Didn't look back at all into the sky until I got up the stairs by my apartment and felt something in my atmosphere. [Thank God I just got an extension on this computer] I sort of felt curious so I.....started using suggestions...to see if I could get whatever I was sensing to reveal itself to me. I knew it wasn't a spirit so I'm not sitting up in my little leaky, dark, and lonely apartment by myself without being sure I would be at least absolutely safe.   Well, the moment got intense and once again that definite....feeling of unsurety hit me. Harder than my first encounter. I looked at the dish network sattelite, looked behind it into the sky, something told me to turn my entire body to the right and look up above the apt. building accross from me and quietly; w/ a syncronized....effort we connected with one another. 3 ! immensely, sleek, yet most emormous...floating like...with no ! gravitat ional pull and it took so long to disappear I took a comfortable position of facing it just to see what it was doing or going to do. It was in a formation of three; two side by side in the front of the formation and in the middle between the front two yet behind. In formation like a Navy division in ranks marching.  The formation came up to a huge cloud big enough to cover all three objects. The front of the formation vanished behind the clouds like expected because I don't think ufos or extraterrestials want to...really be seen but expecting the unexpected the last one....IT NEVER DISAPPEARED. It's intense,.....BLINDING light shined through this dark gray early a.m. cloud like it never traveled behind anything and stayed there.  I was soooo scared to where I was gonna go inside at this point in time in fear of some sort of (God forgive me for saying) possible undetectable attack.  Still I waited. It sat behind the gray cloudfor about 30 seconds. And then it disappeared.  Like i! t was never there and all I could do is stand there in awe and fright. I got this ufo website out of Dr. Lynne D. Kitei's book ""The Phoenix Lights"" and used it in hopes of getting in contact with her or someone who is employed with connection to this website who is experienced with people have post effects from close encounters on any kind.

Before we turned south, we both looked up in the sky in front of us and saw a bright orange glowing object.  My dad was a pilot for years and I have always watched traffic in the skies but this was like nothing I’ve ever seen.  It made no noise and didn’t appear to be moving. I felt that it was relatively low in the sky which is what got my attention, if it had been a plane, I would think it would have been too low to be over the city. There were no other lights or colors, only the round bright glow of orange. My husband, immediately made a U-Turn on the road and parked so that we could get a better look. In most cases, if I see something he just keeps driving but this time his U-Turn was without hesitation. I immediately got out of the car and tried to take a picture with my cell phone but before I could get ready to take a picture, the bright orange glow disappeared, like a candle being put out… the light was gone, but we were both certain that we could still see a round shadow of the object. Within seconds of its light going out, we both watched it move straight up into the sky in a squiggly line until it disappeared, all in a matter of seconds. Both of us know that we saw something that was not human in any way. After searching on the internet for explanation, I’ve found other stories and some videos that describe the same thing we saw with pictures of exactly what we saw. I had no way to describe what we saw until I saw them described as orange orbs… I’ve never, in 50 some years, used the word ‘orb’ to describe something but it is the best word and the only way I can explain our event.

We moved to the north side of the city just about 5 to 6 miles south of what became Houston Intercontinental Airport now named Bush.    When I was about 18 or 19, I can’t remember the exact date but I believe the summer of 1973 or 74 a high school buddy and myself were out in the drive way at my next door neighbor looking up at the stars it was a clear night.  It was about an hour or maybe two after sundown.  We took note of a bright light about the size of a star.  Noting that there were no strobes, we figure it to be a satellite.  The house we were at is north of downtown Houston off US 59 at E. Mt Houston east about 2 miles from the 59.  We at first thought it to be Skylab, but noting it was moving from the south heading north and the news media said Skylab would be in a east west travel we figured it a weather satellite.  That worked for us up until it speeded up greatly.  It then went into about 4 or 5 loops then back and forth through the loops it just made and straight up and disappeared into the blackness of space.

As it was doing its maneuvers it would go bright to dim giving me the impression of a shape like a coin flashing in the bright sun light.

MN. single very slow moving black triagle, 2 min visible In midsummer 1978 I was in tenth grade, about to start eleventh grade.  I had bought a small motorcycle (250 Kawasaki) to get around by  myself and have a little freedom. I worked a few nights a week as a dishwasher at a high end Chinese restaurant called Howard Wongs.  Another dishwasher and I got off work about 01:00.  She needed a ride home and she was very cute so I volunteered.  She lived with her mother in an apartment building directly across the (North to South)street from a large grocery store.  The Grocery store (Byerly's) and the apartment building were both on the south side of and east west interstate that runs between Edina and Minneapolis.  I am sighting these details to give you the exact address, and also give you an idea that the area is very well lit, and in the urban/suburban category, almost directly on an interstate. She and I were talking for a few minutes as we were leaning on my motorcycle in the parking lot of the apartment building.  For some reason I looked up at the sky that was mostly clear but had a very few mid-level clouds approximately 1200 ft.  I know this because my father was a pilot, and I had spent nearly every weekend (like thousands of hours) of my young life in a small engine airplane, literally since I was born. Something caught my eye as I looked up.  I could see several stars, but the streetlights prevented seeing all of them.  The clouds above were slightly illuminated from the city lights, but there were only a very few clouds, and most crystal clear skies.  But nearly directly above us, and a little to the west, toward the Byerly lot, I could see that there was a very slow moving completely black triangle!  It appeared to be quite low, maybe about 300-400 feet altitude.  Once I spotted it, I immediately thought that I would here the sound of the engine of some idiot flying without tower cleareance, without lights, in an ultralight aircraft.  But to my astonishment there was absolutely no sound, completely silent.  I also was in astonishment that there were no lights or beacons on the aircraft, and that it was absolutely black, absolutely black as pitch.  The only way I could tell its shape was that it was so very slow moving, and I could clearly see its shape against the stars and few distant clouds as it passed them.   There was no wind that night. As the object moved in what appeared to be a directly North direction, I could clearly also observe that its velocity did absolutely not change.  I was observing its speed because the only other plausible explanation was that it was some freaking idiot in a hang glider. I excluded the midnight hang glider because the speed and direction and altitude did not change at all. Also, there are no hills in Edina, and nobody hang glides in the twin cities, but I had run out of any explanations.  The object was visible to me for at least two minutes as it moved steadily North at what I thought might be 20-30 miles per hour. Since the object was only very slightly visible at all, my calculation of size, and speed and altitude could be off, but not by much as I had 20-15 vision at the time, and was eyeballing aircraft my whole life. My dishwasher friend said she saw it, but if she really did, I thought later that she would be dropping her jaw like I was, and she just didn't react like she was seeing a UFO.  So I really don't think she saw it, but that's OK because it was dang tough to catch. Years have gone by now, and after the advent of the internet I finally, after 34 years, see that many others out there have seen, and are seeing, very slow moving, absolutely silent and jet black triangles.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,,

The game was not that interesting so I sat back and enjoyed all the stars and as I looked at about 11 o'clock angle I saw this one ""falling"" star only it didn't fall, more like floated down. As I watched, it reminded me more of a spark from a professional fireworks display.  The color was a blue white, much like an LED flashlight.  I kept my eye on it as it floated down.  I tried to gage it's size but there was nothing to compare it with. It stopped about the height of field lights that were on.  I realized it was over the field and it wasn't very big. I heard no sound. It was like it was watching the game.  As I kept my eyes on it, I heard a small plane coming across the lake and flying to the airport west of town and close enough to view the game going on.  The light was not bothered by the plane and continued to hover above the field. After about 20 min or so it was attracted to one of the trains that haul pulp wood to a plant in another town.  As I watched, it floated at a good clip across the lake, about 1/2 a mile across at that point, reflecting on the water.  It dropped down a little, maybe about 50 or 60 ft above the water and though for the distance, it kept it's brightness. It easily caught up with the train, staying one car back from the engine, floating about 6 to 10 ft. above the front of the second car.  I watched it as long as I could, until the train and light disappeared behind the trees.

I was a passenger in a car with my brother and parents when i looked out to the north and saw this light.  It was very distinct and only a few hundred yards away.  It was right over the tallest buildings in St. Cloud.  It looked exactly like the planet Saturn.  It was a perfect sphere with a ring around the center.  The ring was also very distinct.  It was the color orange like molten metal.  Although i could see no structure on it,  it was obviously rotating.  If you looked down at it from the top,  it was spinning counter-clockwise.  As it was rotating, (about 1 rev. per second) the whole thing would tilt 90 degrees toward me,  hold for about 2 seconds and then tilt back to the upright position.  Then it would tilt 90 degrees away from me,  hold for about 2 seconds and then tilt back upright again.  After righting itself,  it tilted to the left, back up again,  and then 90 degrees to the right.  Once it righted itself,  the whole tilting process started ov! er again,  tilting toward me.  When it was tilted away or toward me,  counting the diameter of the ring,  it was the size of a full moon.  I don't know what the size was.  The tallest buildings in town are 6 stories which is i think 60 feet.  This object was about 2 to 3 times higher than the buildings were.

However, despite being brief the sheer clarity of the sighting (my only one to date) has stuck with me, and I hope that it helps add another tiny piece of the UFO enigma. I was playing in the garden of my childhood home, which was no more than a mile from one of the largest military bases in the UK, and less than ten miles from both the defence research establishment and Farnborough airport, home of the UK's most famous air show.  As a result I grew up seeing low flying aircraft ranging from Westland Wessex helicopters doing search and rescue exercises over Brookwood Cemetary (which was at the bottom of my garden) to jets flying almost at roof level, weird experimental craft being displayed and tested out of Farnborough, and commercial traffic from the nearby Heathrow and Gatwick international airports, and Fairoaks aerodrome.  Like all boys of the time, I had a keen interest in all things military, and became quite the expert at aircraft identification. The event occurred at around 2-3pm on a Sunday in early June of 1980 (the date I quoted is my best guess).  Despite being located between a road and railway track, being a Sunday it was extremely quiet, and one of those rare halcyon British summer's days when there was not one single whisp of cloud in the sky - nor were there any contrails in evidence.  For some reason I felt compelled to look up - there was no sound, but maybe it was just a serendipitous urge - and saw a clearly defined silver egg shaped craft travelling at no more than 100-200 knots in a north to south direction at an altitude of around 500-1000'.  My estimate of size was in the order of a VW Transporter (bug bus) at most, a VW Beetle at the least.  Given my position, I had less than a minute to observe it before is disappeared over the tree line, BT in that time made a couple of key observations:   1/  The craft was totally silent. 2/  The surface of the object was perfectly smooth.  Whilst we have made numerous aircraft with a refelctive polished aluminium outer skin, it's never perfectly smooth - there are always small imperfections around rivets, obvious seams, and ripples in the surface where it has been worked.  This object was like a drop of mercury, and reflected the ground beneath it. 3/  The craft did not at any time change direction, altitude, or speed as far as I could ascertain. 5/ for me, the most startling aspect was that as it passed almost directly overhead, I felt a very hard to describe sensation. At this stage I had no concept of this object was, so I felt no fear, yet I became aware of a sort of shiver that went through me, and that my hair seemed to stand up. It only lasted as long as the craft was overhead, and faded in and then out as it passed. My description sounds fairly prosaic, but I can assure you that ive never felt anything quite like it before or since; I just can't quite find the words to adequately describe it. There maybe some parallels to the way in which you feel infrasound rather than hear it - as if the signal hits you on a cellular level. 4/  The craft was flying into the wind, which was very very light anyway. As an aside, when I was totally clear in my own mind that what I had seen could not be explained by anything I'd seen before, I rushed into the house in order to tell  my mother what I'd seen.  ""It was probably Telstar,"" she informed me dismissively, and that explanaition sufficed for a while until my teacher, to whom I later recounted the sighting, told me that satellites orbit WAY higher than what I'd seen. I've never seen a ghost, have seen the Surrey Puma (our local anomalous big cat), and never seen anything else in the sky I couldn't rationalise.  However, this event has stuck with me for over thirty years, and rarely go more than a few weeks without it popping into my head. For the record, I'm now a professional photojournalist, and have even leant my talents in image analysis to various publications and groups in respect of various paranormal subjects.  I'm also not prone to flights of fantasy, and have an IQ which would put me in the genius category. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2012-12-20T00:00:00,,

CA. This sighting was of a VERY large, slow moving meteor at an altitude WELL below 5,000 feet, probably below 2,000 feet.  Depending on the actual altitude (without a point of reference, judging size and distance is difficult on an object), its size could have been as small as a very large cargo truck or cabin-sized house to a medium to large two-storey house.  It was travelling on an almost level track (west to east), at an approximate speed of 45-60 mph.  There was no trail of any sort. I could clearly see the distinct cragginess in detail.  The coloration varied from an earthy brown to black with lighter splotches of tan to white.  I could clearly see scorch marks along the leading surface, trailing back about 1/4-1/3 the length of the cuboidal shape. There were three distinct jets of green fire. One from the edge between the face facing me and the face oriented toward the ground. The second appeared to come from the edge between the face away from me and the face oriented toward the ground. The third came from the upper face, perhaps along the edge of the face away from me. The three jets were all the same size. The first was in the front third, while the other two were almost all the way to the back. The jet facing me sputtered violently, while the others were more of a flicker. The length of flame was probably about 12 - 18 inches, and perhaps 3 - 5 inches in diameter. As the meteor travelled from left to right it rocked back and forth along all three axes. I was traveling north on US 101 between Arcata and Mckinleyville, CA. I was approaching the Mad River bridge about 15 - 20 minutes before sundown on a Sunday in Feb or Mar of 1981 (I know it was Sunday because I was on my way to church). The Coastal Range was to my immediate right, the ridge about 1,000 - 2,000 feet above the highway. When I saw the meteor out over the ocean, I rolled down my window to try and hear it, and couldn't. When It passed over the trees out of sight (still ahead of me slightly), I tried to see and hear if there was interaction with the trees along the ridge. Again, I couldn't hear anything, and there was no visible indication of fire or explosion.  I interpretted this to mean it had passed at least a couple of hundred feet above the closest foliage, or else the radiant heat would have probably caused a fire.  On my return trip an hour-and-a-half later, there was no sign of disturbance.  I assumed it struck the ground on the east side of the Central Valley opposite the Redding, CA area, perhaps striking the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Range. I watched the papers, and listened to the radio for other reports of this meteor.  Although I told a number of friends in the area, I never reported the sighting, primarily because I didn't know to whom or where to make the report.  Even this is not truly the best place to report this, but it is the only one that I know of at this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Hello, before discarding this report('tis a bit on the crazy side) know that this was in a dream, which was so realistic, the shock of the ending made me wake up, which also makes me doubt the 'dreamstate' I was in. Ok. So I was having a dream and was nearing the end of the dream, when suddenly an Unidentified Flying Object was visible in the sky. There was only a split-second before I and my companions who were travelling with me were all surrounded by a beam of some sort, of which I do not know, and the ground began to tremble, as if an earthquake had just begun. Then, we all began to float upward. The light emitting from the beam was blinding; I wasn't able to see anything outside the beam. As we neared the Unidentified Flying Object, I began convulsing without control, which I believe was a seizure, and was so strong it woke me up. The seizure also carried into when I woke up(about for a second) and I do not have any medical conditions related to seizures. Everything beyond this point is purely speculation, and is an opinion, and entirely non-fact based. Ok. I believe my dream from point of 'abduction'(Abducton - An act of being taken from a point without your consent or free will)to point of seizure was real, due to the vividness of the dream, I almost also could not tell when I crossed a reality threshold of having the seizure and being in my bed. It was like I was just suddenly there. I've never believed in extra-terrestrial existence, but I do now. I was completely skeptical and made aliens look completely impossible in the eyes of my friends, but it happened just an hour or two ago, and forgive my franticness, but I'm afraid I will forget or something. I do not know. I believe it could have been a device which would invert the gravitational pull of a living being from the Earth's gravitational pull to a gravitational push. In essence, a functioning tractor beam to only pick up living beings. The power needed to pull off such an extraordinary feat would require, in my belief, the equivilancy of a 100-Megaton Nuclear Bomb(Using our conventional technology).I've been skeptical of aliens all my life. I do not know if it was 'aliens'. It could have been a government test or something. I have no idea. But this was easily the most radical thing I've witnessed in my entire life.

Last night, Monday August 27 at 8:25 pm I had a sighting here in San Diego, California.  I was about 2 miles southeast of the intersection of Interstate freeways 5 and 8.  This sighting started out with a solid yellow-orange light coming towards me from the north towards the south.  I was looking north.  There were no collision lights like a normal plane or jet would have.  Many jets and planes are seen down here as this area is along the landing path for the San Diego airport.  Jets that are flying south will head south along the 5 freeway and then turn east over the 8 freeway in preparation of landing at the San Diego airport.  I am very familiar with seeing these jets and planes.  And these aircraft have collision lights, and in this sighting, there were no collision lights on this yellow-orange light.  Anyway, this yellow-orange light was moving slowing towards me.  It was almost as large as the front light seen on an approaching jet, which is larger tha! n a star in the sky.  After viewing this Yellow-orange light for about 30 seconds, it slowing turned off.  Nothing.  I kept watching the area where the light had disappeared and about 2 minutes later, but much higher in the sky, the light, or a light, powered back on and quickly flew west to east.  This time, the light was mostly white, but looked a duller color than the stars.  It was not moving slowly, but faster than a jet would move at that higher elevation.  I lost track of it after about 30 seconds as it was too far away.  Then about 15 to 20 minutes later, maybe about 8:45pm, I saw a white light power-up directly north of me again; but this time lower than the first 2 lights described above.  This last time the light was as low as the jets coming in for their landing descent.  The light was not directly in the jets path, but somewhat more north.  It was slowing moving south to north and slow.  I did not see this last light very long, maybe 15 seconds and then it slow! ly turned off or powered down.  I say powered down, because th! at's the impression I got when I saw it turn off.  Again, no collision lights.  It was just gone.  I don't know if this was 1 craft or 2 or 3 separate crafts.

My first reaction was that they were fireworks because of how they looked.  However, we realized very quickly that none of these objects were moving.   They were completely stationary. At this point our view was blocked by buildings so I pulled the car around the block to try and see if we could get another glimpse.  We were able to pull behind a vacant building with an adjacent field and parked. At this point the lights had seemed to move more into the distance.  My guess is somewhere over Brentwood anywhere from Brentwood High School or the WSM Tower. Also the number of lights had grown to around 50.  These lights did move this time but in almost figure eight motions, some even seemed to come together.   They started from around tree height up to cloud level which the clouds were low because of a thunderstorm earlier. My girlfriend was able to get picture and video of this event.  Also, while we were there about 20 other people came to view this as well. After about 15 minutes the lights in no particular order very quickly disappeared.  Some seemed to do a quick flash before they would disappear.  It was maybe 30-45 seconds before they were gone once they started. At this point my girlfriend and I got in my car to try to ride over to where we thought the lights were over.  To do this we had to go over a large hill.  Once over the hill at a red light we witnessed what I would guess was a Black Hawk helicopter just hovering right above the tree line pointing in the direction of the lights.

We were flying over the USA and I’m not sure exactly what state we were over at the time, but my brother and I were casually looking out the window on the left hand side of the plane when we were at quite a high altitude and spotted a foreign object quite a bit away in the distance, towards the right hand side. I cannot remember the shape exactly but it was a dark colour, possibly black.  I had originally assumed it was another plane however, it had quite a jerky motion.  It puzzled me a bit, but then I saw something very astonishing: It had a beam.  It was a dark coloured shadow type of beam and it was changing direction quite rapidly.  The angle of the beam kept alternating, moving towards the left at an almost 180 degree angle and then straight away moving to the right hand side at an almost 180 degree angle. It kept this up for about 20 seconds, and then the object zoomed across the sky till it was opposite the centre of my window, and then continued to move in a direction away from us.

It sped in from the sky (down and from the east)--looked white/yellowish and moved like a shooting star, then began moving horizontally at a much slower speed and turned green.   Object moved at a regular, even velocity in a westward direction until it disappeared about 7 seconds later.  It was truly the strangest thing I have ever seen.  My boyfriend was driving the car and I was passenger.  I was in the middle of a sentence and just stopped speaking and pointed. My boyfriend noticed right around the time I did (and he was driving--that's how noticeable this object was).   As soon as the object disappeared, we both turned to each other and said, ""Did you just see that?"" During the observation, we were both so stunned by what we were seeing that neither of us could speak.  It looked so out of place and unlike anything else either of us had ever seen. I wish I had seen more.  Please let me know if you know anyone I can speak with who is familiar with these objects, and with ufos in general.  I have many questions and am very concerned that what I have seen is not of this planet.  I want to know why it seems like the government is hiding information from the public on this issue.

I was driving in the dark around curves and as I leaned forward to sneeze I looked up and through the wind shield I saw sparkling fire projectile out of a craft almost like it was making fun of my sneezing motion or like ""vomiting"" sparks in the sky.  I thought it may be fireworks of some kind, but didn't see a trail.   We continued down the road a few miles when I saw it off this time to the right up in the sky but this time there were two objects in the sky. they were like pinwheels in the sky. flying off sparks and spinning. this time was 18:45 and I pulled over to try to get pictures I wasn't parked very well and was concerned so I didn't stay very long.  I struggled with my cell phone, but as soon as I got it out to record the craft disappeared.  It was a golden color.  Disappointed I got back in my vehicle with my son, and we continued on our way. I noted the name of a creek on the highway called field creek.  We didn't see the craft again until we reached Thayer Missouri, where I noticed the off to the right side of town again.  Myself and My son pulled over to the side of the road and watched as the fireballs/crafts danced around each other like a yin/yang then once again when I got my phone out to record they disappeared.  My son noticed that their were very small dots in the sky which blinked on and off, remained perfectly aligned vertically and moved quickly from one side of the sky to the other blinking on and off much like pac-man dots.  They avoided going directly over the town but instead made sure to go over rural areas.  That last time we saw them was at 19:11.

The two on the sides moved very straight.  The one in the middle kept zig zagging from one to the other.  The two on the side kept moving east.  The one in the middle slowed down and started to circle above me.  It kept making wide circles above me.  The circular patterns became smaller and smaller until it stopped in the middle right above  me.  That is when I started talking to it and it started talking to me telepathically.  I have the message.  I need to talk to someone who can help us.  This is not a joke. I have told many people but none take me seriously.  I don`t know what else to do.  I am afraid it may be to late or impossible to change our fate.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,40.5982,-83.1425

On or about the 19th day of April, 2002 I was patrolling the South parking lot of Barona Casino when I looked to the West, over a nearby hill.  At the top of my peripheral vision, I saw movement.  When I looked up, I noticed some of the stars in the night sky were winking out of existence, as if blocked by something overhead.  My view was initially obscured by a parking lot lamp, so I jogged down the isle a little way, to get a better view. What I observed was a massive, triangular shaped object floating silently over the mountain, moving slowly towards the Northwest.  The object had no visible lights and I could only (initially) discern its shape by the stars that it blocked, which came back into existence as the object passed by.  There were a couple of quiet vehicles traveling in the area, but I could clearly discern absolutely no sound coming from the sky.  There was a slight breeze (can't remember the direction), but nothing strong or abnormal. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I began to see a dim reflection of the light from the parking lot, indicating the object was approximately 300 to 500 feet above (just high enough to clear the nearby hill it was floating over).  I thought I could see some features of the object, but the reflected light was far too dim to be certain of any detail. Using the estimated height, the casino and the hill as guides, I estimated the visible surface area to be approximately 36,450 square feet (about 100 yards to a side).  Bigger than any aircraft I had ever seen, except in science fiction.  Gauging by the disappearance and re-appearance of the stars, I figured it was traveling at approximately 50-75 miles per hour, much too slow to be lift-driven, like tradiitonal aircraft. As I watched, the object changed direction, moving to the West and flew slowly over the hill and out of sight, revealing all of the stars it had previously blocked. After the object left my sight, a guest (Caucasian, mid-forties, clean-shaven with light-brown hair) drove up to me in his sedan and exclaimed, ""What the hell was that?!"" I replied, ""I don't know what you mean, sir,"" because I did not know if he was talking about the same object I saw, and I did not want one of ours guests to think I was a nut-job. The man then said, ""That ""thing"" in the sky!   What the hell was it? !"" I replied, ""I don't know, sir.  I've never seen anything like it.""  The man then said, ""Did you hear it make any sound?  I didn't hear anything."" I told the man I did not hear any sound either.  He then drove away. I spoke with several co-workers, but none of them saw the object, neither did they hear anything overhead. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Hello. SO, I am NOT reporting a sighting, but rather a phenomena which I think is also UFO based. Believe me I would love to see and report a UFO. It just hasn't happened to me.  But this phenomena did and it was unique and unexpected enough that I am now reporting it, after 8 years of sitting on it. Basically I was sitting home one night alone, with no music or distractions, when what I can only describe as a vast scanner beam from above, moved across the area of my house and yard, and the wilderness around us.  Through my house and eventually through me as it passed.  It caught my attention just moments before reaching me, I physically turned my head towards it as part of the realization that something was approaching.  I was hit with an immediate adrenalin rush, before it got to me, the hairs on my skin were alerted, and I had the immediate instinct to get my back against a wall and freeze as if it were something I could hide form.  Which I did, though I was sitting. It passed over the house, through the house and walls, and over and through me,  then continued on until it was gone.  It seemed to take no notice of me at all. It didn't stop or change in any way as it went over/through me. The whole even took less than 10 seconds.  I waited without moving, but it did not retu! rn.  I stayed alerted to it's possible return, for days. This was a unique and strange occurrence.  I swear to you, I don't typically (not ever) cling to a wall to hide from a mysterious energy force scanning the area and when I do (this one time) it is because it is something real enough that I feel the need to take action. I am a pretty open person to subtle energy and I was in a pretty remote place alone at night, and in a pretty open state of awareness at that point in my life, living alone, working from home, and communicating through letters and emails way more than verbally for many days at a time. I think without this state of mind, I might have missed this even all together. But it was stunning how clearly this “beam” became a clear and visible event in my awareness. It felt telepathic, and though I could not see it with my eyes. I could tell where it was in the yard, watch it literally hit the walls and floor and pass over me. It had a yellow leading edge and yellow wherever it intersected with anything, and left a greenish yellow trail as it passed, which seemed to waggle a bit like looking down a hot street.  It passed at an extremely constant machine like velocity, with a speed akin to just slower than a shadow of a cloud passing you at the beach, that same vast angle feeling, but! with an extremely accurate edge. Maybe even more like the beam from a lighthouse in it's constancy, is the best way to describe it, but the leading edge of the beam definitely ran for a few acres and originated from an point far up into the sky. The beam ran from north to south. And it swept from west to east.  It's leading edge was what felt like a beam but it could also be described as a field. And its shape, originating from a distant point, farther north than I was, and far up in the sky gave it the feeling of having a vast area. I was facing north as it passed. And the final distinct detail of the event was that not only was my mind opened up to receiving this clear visual image of the beam, as the beam passed (an otherwise invisible and soundless event), but as it passed I was also able to visualize and make out two entities, at the source of the beam, though larger in my minds eye, who were clearly monitoring the beam, and discussing that what they were looking for was not found.  They seemed distracted by this goal and through this distraction I feel is the reason that I could get a mental image of their conversation while avoiding that type of mental connection being made back to me. And yes, they were large dark eyed, and gray and looked like the sketches you typically see. Am I influenced by other stories?  Am I filling in the details with imagery from previous sightings? Could this have been a strange radio signal from a nearby tower that happened to be particularly strong this evening? All good questions I have asked my self. But I was sober and had not eaten any bad bread. And I am describing what I witnessed, and I am curious if there are other stories of anything similar.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,42.0707,-72.044

I was walking with a group of 5 friends and noticed a bright, primarily white light in the North Eastern sky. I pointed to the object and the others believed it to be a star.  The bright light kept getting bigger and soon was accompanied by a low wurring sound much like a blimp.  Soon the object was about 20-30 feet above us moving at an amazingly slow speed.   What happened next is not a hoax or a prank. A bright light from what appeared to be some type of spotlight came on and when it came on it was immediately focusing on one of my friends.  It did not search around until it found something like you would expect from a normal ""spotlight,"" it literally turned on and was shining on him at the exact same moment.   I turned around and began to run back up the lane and briefly turned to watch my friend dive behind a pile of gravel.  The object continued to move slowly North East over my farmland property on the outskirts of Freeport.  We reassembled and did not know what had just happened. We looked out onto the horizon and saw 4-5 other lights that looked identical to the object we had first observed when we thought it was a star and each of these objects were traveling in other directions. -Thanks",2012-12-20T00:00:00,42.3238,-89.6218

Good evening Sir or Ma'am  I have a UFO sighting I’d like to share with you.  First I’d like to establish my credibility.  I’ve been a military Air Traffic Controller for over 24 years. I’ve held a secret security clearance during this entire time.  I have an immense amount of experience controlling general aviation, air carrier and military aircraft.  I am very familiar with the capabilities and flight characteristics of many different types of aircraft but especially high performance military aircraft.  There are very few aircraft that I cannot identify; in fact I can identify most aircraft just by their sound.  I am an expert at evaluating three dimensional spatial orientation as well as calculating altitude, distance and speed with the naked eye. Between 2005 and 2008 I was working as an expeditionary and combat Air Traffic Controller responsible for setting up temporary landing zones in hostile areas as well as a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC).  Most people know us as Combat Air Controllers or Forward Air Controllers.  We designate enemy targets by eye or other acquisition equipment and then direct aircraft to drop or fire ordinance on said targets. Until the day of this event, I had never seen a UFO but I’ve always kept an open mind.  I believe that there is too much evidence and too many credible people whose stories collaborate for UFO’s to be a hoax.  I also believe that it would be very naive and possibly dangerous for us to believe that we are the only intelligent life form in the universe.  It’s too immense for this to be true. The events which I’m about to share with you happened about 6 years ago.  During this time since, I’ve been looking for ways to share my story. I do not remember the exact date of this event but it was around the end of June in 2006.  It took place in the desert, in the vicinity of Navy target range B17, located approximately 30 miles south-east of Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon (KNFL) in Nevada.   This range sits south of highway 50 and is just west of Fairview Peak, which has an elevation of about 14,000 feet.   It was approximately 1500 local time.  It was a bright and very clear day – not a cloud in the sky.  On this day my team and I were acting as the Direct Air Support Center (DASC).  Our job was to accept, stack and hold the aircraft (F-18 Hornets) to the north of the target area until the SEAL JTAC Students were ready to accept a handoff from us and direct them onto their targets.  NAS Fallon is the home of the Navy SEALs JTAC School and they conduct most of their JTAC training at this location.  I want to go on record as saying that I am not a Navy SEAL.  I had my team there training for a deployment the following year where we would support one of the Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU). On this day the JTACs were using type 1 control.  This means the JTAC has to visually acquire both the target and the aircraft before the JTAC can clear the aircraft ""HOT,"" meaning the pilot is cleared to release his ordnance or fire his weapon.  Because of the bright sun, lack of cloud cover and the direction from which the aircraft were making the final attack run, it was often difficult to visually acquire aircraft.  During one such attack run, we had an especially hard time seeing the F-18.  Many were shading their eyes against the sun or using a technique that I like to do where you extend your arm and use your palm to block the sun and then look for the aircraft in the gap created between your thumb and index finger.  As I was doing this, the pilot reported he was on his final attack heading but we still couldn’t see him because we were looking almost directly at the sun.  At this time something to my left caught my eye. At first I thought it was the F-18 that we were looking for and I almost commented that the pilot was way off course.  But before the words escaped my mouth I immediately knew that this was nothing like I had ever seen before. What I saw was a very large chrome sphere.  The word silver does not describe it well enough.  It was really like a chrome or even a mirrored sphere.  I could see the desert floor reflected on its underside and the sky reflected on its top. It was larger than any cargo aircraft I’ve ever seen.  It was at approximately 10,000 feet, moving west to east at a very high rate of speed.  It passed the mountain range in a dip just south of Fairview peak.  I had sight of the craft for at least 7 seconds.  It took the craft 5 seconds to cover the distance from where I saw it to the dip south of Fairview Peak.  This distance it covered was approximately 5 miles.  That means the craft was traveling at approximately 3600 miles per hour or 3128 knots or Mach 4.6.  Last I checked, short of maybe the SR-71, we do not have any aircraft that can travel at that speed and if we do, where was the sonic boom.  The craft made no sound.  I’d like to add that while this was happening, the F-18 pilot reported “off target, no drop” and we saw him heading northbound and away from this craft.  So, I am 100% certain that what I saw was not the F-18 that we were looking for. I asked the other members of my team if they had seen what I had but they had not.  I was afraid that I was the only one who had witnessed something truly incredible.  But, several minutes later, the SEALs were laughing and giving a hard time to a couple of their teammates.  After talking to them I found out that 2 of the SEALs had also seen the sphere. We did not use the range at all the following day but we did go back the following night around midnight to do some night work.  While we were setting up our equipment we noticed an orange light at ground level in the target area.  It looked almost like a large camp fire.  I was not the only one to see this light. Everyone who was with us could see it.  This gave us some concern because in less than an hour military aircraft would be dropping live ordnance at that exact location.  I asked if there had been a change in the schedule where the range had been used that day and maybe there was fire still out there and I was told “no”, the range had not been used at all that day.  At this time we used a laser ranger finder to get a good position on the light and found that it was 2176 meters (1.3 miles) from our observation point.  As soon as we pinged the target next to the light with the laser, the light disappeared and then immediately reappeared approximately a mile north of it original position.  It had moved a mile in the blink of an eye.  The light remained for another 15 minutes and then disappeared and we never saw it again.  The entire event lasted about 30 minutes. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.  I must apologize for being so long-winded, but this is only the second time I’ve been able to share my story and the years are long and my memory is slow.  If you have any questions I would be more than happy to speak with you or anyone of you staff members. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

In this area, I just happened to be looking South when I seen what looked like stars, but they weren't in the sky, they were hovering a little higher than the bridge about an eighth of a mile away from my location and heading south at a VERY slow speed.   My first thought was an airplane, so I opened my window to hear the engines and didn't hear anything.  After I didn't hear anything, I pulled over (like you're not supposed to on the bridge) and just sat and watched the lights with my windows down.  It took me a second to realize that they weren't just lights, because the space in between the lights was blocking out lights behind it.  Other cars started slowing down and stopping to watch the phen! omena with me.  The so-called ""craft"" or ""glowing lights"" spun around to where the point of the triangle the lights formed were heading kind of south east and it proceeded to pick up speed.  I got back on the road heading south trying to catch up to it because I knew it would eventually go right over the express way.  Every car I passed seemed to have people inside looking up and pointing at the same thing I was watching.

Several small planes were making approaches from the north to land at Metropolitan Airport, two miles to the southwest.  While watching these planes, I noticed something about three times higher in the air.  It was the shape of a lightbulb, if the aluminum-wrapped lower base section were cut off.  It glowed gold-ish lime green.  It was moving from east to west very slowly. I went indoors and got my binoculars and watched the object through them.  A few times, it left its east-west course and veered in a northerly direction.  Then, it would go west for awhile, then, veer south before continuing westward. Initially, I thought this might be a Mylar balloon, but it did not look like one.  Also, they tend to be highly reflective.  This, instead, seemed to be glowing from within, a greenish gold color, not shiny or reflective. Then, I wondered if it were a bundle of helium balloons, but with the binoculars, I could not see any irregularity in the shape, or space between balloons where they would separate from one another.  It looked like one cohesive whole.  Its shape did not change. When it was overhead, it began moving in a more distinctly northerly direction, still going westward.  From this angle, it looked as if it had a red elongated vertical light in the very center of it, the shape of a candle wick.  This “wick” looked as if it extended about 2/3 of the height of the object.  It still glowed greenish gold around this long red central “wick.”  Also, when it got to the west of me, I thought perhaps it would not appear to be glowing (if its appearance were a matter of simply reflecting sunlight), since I would be on the side of the object that sunlight was not striking.  This was not the case, however, and the object did appear to be emitting the greenish gold color on the east side (away from the sun) as well. I watched this object for about 25 minutes.  There was quite a bit of air traffic to Metropolitan Airport (2 miles southwest) and to Denver International Airport, much further east.

My husband and I attended a baptismal party for our friend’s 4 year old daughter.  We arrived late in the evening from about 10:00pm to 11:00pm.   The party was on acreage, far from the city and this property bordered on the jungle with no other buildings or houses in sight.  It was very dark that night, Christmas lights were strung around the yard, lighting up the area - tables were set up and about 30 out of 300 people still in attendance -it was a beautiful atmosphere.   The party was pretty much over most guests had been there all day but a group of us who arrived late ate cake and watched the children and adults dancing in the open field.  During this time I was playing “peek a boo” with a delightful little 2 year old boy.  At the same time my husband was talking with the boy’s father as the little one ran around the table popping up in front of me and then running away.  I happened! to glance up and saw 3 very bright lights in the jungle above the trees that I had not noticed before.  I was puzzled because I knew there were no buildings in that direction and what I thought I was looking at was the top floor of an apartment building with 3 apartment windows lit up from within.  I could have easily walked to it-it was maybe a football field away, it was very close, and the object very large.  Before I continue I will state that I do not drink alcohol, nor use any mind altering substances so I wasn’t “seeing things”.    I glanced down for a few seconds to continue my game with little boy and looked back towards the object I saw the lights changed somewhat.  The light on the left was yellow, the middle light was orange tinged and the third light was whiter.   The lights were not equidistance the light on the right was close to the edge of the object and the other two lights more closely grouped.  I stared for a few seconds puzzled and something very stran! ge started to happen.  The left side of the object began to ge! t fuzzy; blurry like it was fading away it was very very strange.  I couldn’t believe my eyes and I had a very strange feeling come over me.  I kept playing with the little boy my husband was in a deep discussion so I didn’t interrupt him, thinking back now I wish I did.  The next time I looked up at this object it was gone, totally gone!  I kind of shook my head and wondered what the heck was that?  Very puzzled everything running through my head, it clearly wasn’t an airplane, it wasn’t a helicopter, it certainly wasn’t balloons and it wasn’t Chinese lanterns.  I didn't really need to go through the list of what it wasn't because it was so obviously something solid, not moving, not making any noise and I kept thinking over and over OMG what was that?  Now here is the strangest part of the whole experience.   I looked back up at the area that this object was and there was the full moon!  I was stunned, and a thought popped into my head, “it’s the moon, that’s what I saw – it was on! ly the moon!”   What struck me at that point was that the idea that it was the moon  was “planted” in my head!  Again I kind of shook my head and said no way- what the hell – that wasn’t the moon I saw.  Keep in mind I am still playing this game with the little boy.  When I looked up again the full moon was completely gone!  No object, no moon, no more thoughts, gone completely gone.  The whole sighting lasted maybe 4-5 minutes; I am guessing the object to be about 100 feet long and about 25 feet from the ground just above tree top level.  I just can’t get this event out of my head, the disappearing, shimmering, fuzzy morphing weirdness just doesn't make sense.  The fact that I felt someone or something made me think what I saw was the moon, even though that wasn't the case. Then the moon itself disappearing!  It was the strangest experience I have ever had.  Since returning home I have scoured the internet looking for something that came close to what I saw and after 3 mon! ths I finally found an object that was almost exactly what I s! aw.  It was in a UFO clip I found on the internet and I copied then cropped the picture to give you an idea of what I saw from my perspective.  I listen to you on Jeff Rense and you always say to report what you see so that is what I wanted to do.  Very very strange.  I attempted to include my  picture but wasn't able to, not sure why though.  Anyways Thanks for your great work.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,,

In 20+ years I have become familiar with an assortment of craft sharing our LI skies. I can recognize the difference between the Yaphank and South Hampton US military equipment performing maneuvers(usually during late evenings) and know where their insallations are located vs passenger liners en route to and from Islip Int'l Airport, JFK and LaGuardia airports by  regulated identification marker lights.  I know the distinctive nightime sounds of chopper blade rotation and winged craft props, jet exhaust rumbling, etc. operated by NY Suffolk County Police and various NEWS choppers, instantly, when vectoring over my ""area"".  So, I have become unimpressed by their appearance due to familiarity. On Jan. 4, 2012 at approximately 7:30 pm EST I became aware of the unusual amount of aircraft traffic flying in unfamiliar patterns over Western LI . I was alarmed by the number of visible craft flying in a seemingly congested space at various altitudes and unusual patterns ranging from N-S, W-E, W-N, NE-S.  During the next few hours, I watched multiple craft flying varying directions in distances of 1 mile to 5 miles(ed. guess)from my location. The patterns, criss-crossing pilot maneuvers, low altitude banking and deliberate circling about kept my attention and was unsettling. Description of moving craft ""lights"" varied from single solid amber to solitary white strobe, some( I think they may have been choppers) strobed white AND red flashers. There were low flying, fast-moving craft outfitted with huge double tiered solid red lights positioned aft. It was hard to distinguish which craft made which sound. On Jan. 5,2012 (night #2) I again witnessed multiple white and amber lights in the W-S/W sky at approximately 7:30 pm.  I am aware that Venus was low in the evening sky at similar location.  This was not Venus......unless Venus can somehow switch from her familiar bright, head spotlight look into an upturned, spinning triangular shape with the ability to hover over the same area. Many craft were ""scrambling"" in all directions, again.  Why?  I have no idea. I blogged News12 on Jan. 6, 2012 asking if I was alone in my sighting - if someone could tell me what was that??  I continue to watch multiple craft (I think military) in the sky from dusk 'till 2:00 am EST.  After that, its quiet.

They hung in the air and upon closer inspection I could see them moving across the sky in a relatively equidistant triangular pattern.   After about three minutes they seemed to get very far away or dim quickly (it was hard to tell) and winked out. This is driving me crazy because I am skeptical about these things and my first instinct was that these were some type of weather balloons or chinese lanterns due to the appearance of them floating and being a fire-y red/orange but there was something very strange about them that I couldn't put my finger on that made me continue to watch until they disappeared.

It was very loud, seemed to resonate  all thru the area and I found it very hard to pin-point...Lasted about 30 secs or so..I went a few blocks ahead and looked up in the eastern sky and saw FRESH CONTRAILS approx 50 degrees off the horizon, there were two of them and the more visable one was having the ""EYELASHES FORM"" from it and drop down, I looked again and the contrails seemed to arc from the south horizon out to east going along the Jersey Coast out to LONG ISLAND. It was also at an extremely high altitude  for me to see it.. The other smaller contrail hung there for a while but  faded out.The thicker contrail had the FALLING EYELASH Effect for about 15-20 mins after the tremendous roar.. IMO  this was  the AURORA  type craft coming or going from the area with an escort craft with it..it was partly cloudy y out, about 72 degrees in temp , Don't know if this would classify as a UFO sighting but the tremendous roar and wierd contrail would  make it  classification for the mystery noises all aroundnthe country...OUR AUROURA???  A UFO  going into orbit???? You decide...thanks........",2012-10-30T00:00:00,40.5525,-74.2915

We often focus on these things, in hopes, to one day see a UFO for ourselves.  As the light moved closer towards us from the south east, the object took a shape.  To our astonishment, the object was pyramid shaped.  The light that was on the vehicle was set at the base of the pyramid.  This light did not have beam like qualities, but it seemed to be spotting.  The craft would stop, rotate the light around the body, stop the light to observe something, then continue on it's path.  We watched as the object moved closer and closer.  After about 2 minutes the object was probably 2 miles away from us at the most.  It was BIG!  There also seemed to be some kind of ""Heat-wave"" aura around it, like heat waves you see coming off of the hot streets in the summer.  There were no sounds that we could hear from the object.  At its closest point to us, estimating about 2 miles, the object turned towards the South west.  Before the craft disappeared behind the trees, it had sort of morphed into a more oval/oblong shape.

But there was something in the sky that caught my son’s eyes.  My wife and kids, son and daughter, were observing the object and while they couldn’t quite get a handle on what it was, I decided to look.  There was a bright red light moving in our direction, almost like a helicopter light searching the ground.  At first I thought that is what it was, looking for people lighting off fireworks during a ban.  Having a fire 50 miles away, a change in the wind had pushed smoke into our area and I thought the light was tinted because of this.  However, it was when it got over us that I dismissed that conclusion.  As I waited for the normal sound of aircraft flying overhead, I kept my eyes on the craft.  No noise could be heard as this object zoomed through the sky above us.  Following the object the whole time, I started to see a basic shape of the object.  When I finally nailed ! down the shape, the shape of an egg, the object started to shimmer in the sky.  Going back to the helicopter theory, I thought; if that was a propeller, there would be a reflection off the bottom of the blades, and a sort of flicker.  There was no flicker; this was more like the moons reflection in a lake with a gentle wave in the water.  It stayed like this for about a few seconds and then disappeared.  During all this time, for the rate of speed this object was moving through the sky, there was not one sound in the sky.  No rumble of an engine, no swooping of a craft cutting through the air; just silence.   This object was void of all normal crafts lighting. No red light on the undercarriage of the craft, no lights around the rudder, no flashing lights around the wings.

My husband, son and I were outside watching nearby fireworks at 10:35pm CST and from the SSE we saw a brilliant orange hovering object heading to the NNW.   We thought it was a local helicopter but as the craft approached it was silent and brilliant in color, like a burning ember.   It was not close enough to discern a clear shape, but seemed almost circular.  It flew in a very controlled manner at a consistent altitude and speed.   The speed was like that of a helicopter also.  The altitude seemed to be somewhere between 8,000 and 15,000 feet.  Difficult to really estimate the altitude because of our uncertainty of the nature of the craft.   After it had passed over us and was almost out of our vision field we noticed that the brilliance seemed to weaken just a bit, but then reappeared as it continued on its path to the NNW.   The duration of our siting was probably 1 minute, or slightly more.   We are certain it was not an airplane, nor a helicopter, nor a satell! ite or slow burning shooting star or firework.  We have never seen a flying object like this.   We do not consume alcohol, nor drugs and have excellent vision and judgement.   We are sincere in submitting this report.   Thank you. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is a supplemental report to my initial report, per Peter Davenport's request.    We called the local National Weather Service to obtain wind direction at the time of our siting last evening.   At 10:00pm CST the ground wind direction was approx 150-degrees or SE heading NW.    The balloon was flown at 7pm CST for higher elevation wind at 3,000 feet and it was reported at 160-degrees or SE, almost a bit SSE, heading NW.    Also, I failed to submit in my initial report that I called a local news channel this morning to see if others may have sited or reported the same thing we saw.  They said yes, they received one phone call reporting this same object at the same time we saw it.   Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM))",2012-08-05T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

They were ‘falling’ vertically, as if they were meteorites.  However, I have seen several meteorites (3 over 3 years) while living here, and these were slightly different as I did not immediately identify them as such.  We both saw them, and did not have an immediate explanation. One was slightly larger, primarily white with orange around the edges (no streaking tail) and the other showed up almost simultaneously a short distance down and left of the original structure.  This one was slightly more orange, also with no tail.  They fell through the sky for a short second and disappeared.  They were ill-defined, as if glowing, whereas most meteorites I have seen have clearly defined margins.  I have never seen 2 simultaneously, and all others I have seen have a streaking tail as they fall through the sky. I am not sure if we saw meteorites or not, but I was intrigued when I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast speaking of increased fireball sightings- otherwise I would not have thought twice about it.  I am a graduate student and my friend is a veterinarian working on her PhD- we are both educated people, and educated observers.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

My wife and I were getting into the car to go looking at Christmas lights when we both noticed some unusual lights in the southern sky.  At first we thought they were planes because we get a lot of air traffic over us.  After watching these two crafts for about a minute we both realized they were not planes. The front craft appeared as a blinking light.  The second which was following close behind was two solid lights with a blinking one in front making a rather squashed triangular shape.  At first we assumed the second craft was a plane with wingtip lights.  But there was no sound, and it appeared to be flying very high.  For it to be a plane it would had to have been much larger than any planes we currently use.  The second craft appeared to be chasing the front one.  The front craft was keeping a steady pace towards the west, whereas the second craft would slow to a complete stop in mid air before resuming and getting right back to the same distance from the first.  This is what stood out at first. After a few minutes of this behavior the second craft came to a complete stop once again, but this time it turned in the air about 45 degrees.  Watching the lights on what I’ll call the wingtips and the flashing light in front we could clearly see it turning while stopped.  It did this a few times, turning south then back to the west before turning south finally and slowly flying off and disappearing before it reached the horizon. As this was occurring the first craft continued west but at a slower pace.  Once the second craft was gone the first craft’s light stopped blinking and became a very bright solid light.  This solid light would last for about 10 seconds before it would dim back to the blinking light. It did this about 2 times before another aircraft came into view from the west, at which point the first craft started to turn back towards the east.  It did the solid light to blinking light one more time then disappeared from view as the aircraft from the west got close to it. This took place over the course of about 10 minutes, on 12/18/12, at 7:15PM.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,37.6422,-93.3996

I saw an orange light in the sky  traveling from left to right.  Then the clouds  cleared up a little, and as the clouds were  blowing away I saw many blue lights in the same  shape as the first orange one.  They were shaped  like dragonflies.  They were all traveling  towards the same general direction.  Finally the  clouds cleared  completely back and the sky was  full of these blue and orange lights up way too  high to be a plane, more up where the stars  were, traveling a little faster than a plane  would up.  They were in the shape of  dragonflies. I thought to myself why would so  many planes be flying so close together in the  same direction. Some were higher some lower but  all seemed to be going the same way. They got  close but never touched each other but kept a  distance apart.  After a few minutes they  disapeared.  Nobody was near me the exact time  it happened but I stood there for about 20  minutes afterwards and nothing else happened.  I  don't know how nobody else saw these lights. I'm sure there were other people out there at  the time, in and out of the store on their cell  phones with carts full of groceries and kids,  no one looking at the sky too absorbed in their  own worlds getting there groceries and getting  back home as fast as possible.  Nobody even  glancing up except to give me a funny look for  just standing there by myself looking up at the  sky.

It was during the month of July, 2009 when this happened.  Although I'm unsure of the exact day, I do know this is the exact month because I was driving to Tullahoma, Tennessee to pick up my aunt for a late viewing of the Ice Age 3 movie at the local theater. I was driving on I-24W toward Nashville; I took exit 111 into Manchester to drive onto Tullahoma.  After one exits 111, to get to this destination, there is another left, then straight drive into Tullahoma.  Right after I made the left turn, I saw a hovering pyramid above the treetops. I didn't have a camera, nor a cell phone that would've taken a good enough picture, but I am an artist and I made sure to get a good look at the flying object so that I could draw it later on. The object was a three-sided pyramid.  It was a metallic, shiny black color.  On the first side I saw, there were 10 circular white lights, stacked in rows (4, 3, 2, 1).  The best way I can describe these lights is to compare them to the lights that overlook a baseball game.  On the next side, I looked back to see three small lights near its top, each different colors- red, green, and blue.  I was topping a hill when I first saw it and after crossing it, I could see underneath the craft; it was hollow. The craft was hovering just above the treetops, I'd say about six to eight feet above the leaves.  On the opposite side of the median/road, cars were pulling over.  On my side of the road, all of us were slamming our brakes and two cars ahead of me, there was nearly a wreck.  This was proof to me that I wasn't the only one witnessing this. The craft was about 20ft wide and was a proportional triangle on each side, so perhaps about 20ft tall as well.  As I've said, the craft was hollow. I will provide an illustration as I saw it.

I am not sure exactly what the date was, but am sure that it was prior to Christmas 2009.  Potentially a week or so before.  She picked me up at my residence on East Main Street in Norton, MA around 9 or 10 PM, as she was sent home early from her evening shift due to the snow storm. The snow at the time was heavy, wet and about six inches, it accumulated very quickly.  She even got her car stuck in the snow and my friends had to help her get back on the road by pushing the car...it was so slick out that her tires just spun.  It took about 6 adult males to get the car back in the street. Both she and I were 30 at the time.  We are both college educated.  Her father is a retired FBI agent, her brother an active agent.  My father was the CEO of a major international company for a while and at that time the CEO of a start-up.  Both my girlfriend at the time and I were completely sober.  I know that I and she had not taken any alcohol or substance for months, as our relationship was based around staying clean. After she picked me up and my friends helped push the car back on the road, we headed South West East Main Street in Norton past Wheaton College toward downtown Norton.  Wheaton College was only 1/4 a mile from my residence.  We were in the car for only about 3 mins, sliding all over the road, when we saw an object that appeared to be glowing green come shooting from the sky down to earth.  The object was not a refection on the falling snow, believe me.  It was very clear through the storm due to how bright it was. We we heading on East Main Street (Rt 123) heading South West when we saw the object appear from seemingly no where, it was very bright and was glowing green and falling at the speed of a jet.  The object was falling from the Southwest, but more west than south.  So we were coming towards rte 123 and 140 in Norton towards Norton Center and if you had norton center as south, the object fell at the west.  I am not sure of the shape, as it was falling too fast and the green light around it had yellow, red and white on it...  I thought and still think it was a meteor and in fact reported it to an online meteor sight. The object was very very clear, snow or no snow, there was no obstruction, it was big and bright and moving extremely fast as though falling out of the sky.  The last I saw it was to heading about 5 miles west of Norton Center (where we were heading) and it disappeared below the tree line.  The object was in the sky long enough for me to point it out to my then girlfriend who said something like holy s#@t what is that and, because she was driving so slow due to the snowstorm and since no one was on the road (it was a really really bad storm), she was easily able to see it to. It’s hard to say what it was, it could have been a meteor, a ufo. It could have been a rectangle, square or round, I don’t know.  It appeared round because it was falling and had a greenish, yellowish, whitish orb and tail around it. 100% if was not flying across the sky, I have seen many a shooting star and this was close, in our atmosphere and crashed somewhere probably near the Norton, Attleboro line.

There is a small regional airport in Norwood, MA, it was not a plane, you would not have been able to see a plane in that storm and this object was very clear and broke through the clouds at a speed that small planes cannot get to.  It also very clearly hit the ground, we saw it go below the trees...no fireball, nothing like that, not plane crashes reported. What I want to know is did anyone else see this object, this bright glowing object falling to the ground in Norton, MA on December of 2009 during the snowstorm.  My then girlfriend and I saw it. Both of us had never seen a UFO before.  I assume all UFO’s are government crafts, don’t really believe in aliens, but I’ve been proven wrong before.  All I know is that we had clear minds, were in the act of falling in love and both audibly were shocked by the object that we saw crash to earth. We both said well, that must be a meteor, but who knows.  It was soooooo bright someone, someone, a plow driver, someone must have seen it too.

I thought that maybe the sun was reflecting from something, except I had not seen anything for it to reflect off of.  Then I thought may be a drop of something may be on the camara lens.  The #2 photo had the same light but it was to the right of the photo because I had shot the view more to the left.  It proved to me that the light was not caused from anything on the lens.

This is just info as to where we were and why we were there at the time of sighting. It was late on Friday the 13th in august about 21:30 eastern time, my girlfriend her friend and myself went up the road to use a cell phone to make a long distance call.  I live in a very northern area so there is no cell service where I live, so we went to the top of the road in my car to get service about 2 miles north of my house.  My girlfriend’s friend was calling her boyfriend who was on his way up from downstate, as the phone was ringing I heard a very loud sound coming from outside of my car.  I asked my girlfriend “do you hear that” and she said “yea it sounds like a jet”, I said” there’s no way thats a jet it’s way too loud”. I got out of the car because this sound was so loud that if it was a jet, it would have been landing right near us the sound was thunderous.  When I stepped out of the car, I looked up and coming directly over us was a craft with lights going all the way around making a full circle. The lights on it were yellowish white red and green alternating around the whole craft, and at the back of the craft (based on the direction of travel I assumed it was the back) it was slightly flat across the back.  It also had a light in the center of the craft there was a dome light that was yellowish white like a low wattage conventional light bulb.  I was so shocked I started yelling at the other two passengers in the car “ get out of the f@#$ing car you guys got to see this?""  I yelled that until they were out of the car and they got out and saw it too. The craft was coming from a southwestern direction and moving towards the northeast, it moved at a fairly slow rate and must not have been more than 500-1000 feet high (made this estimate based on how large the object appeared to be) when it was directly above my car it had to be about three times wider than my car.  We watched the craft continue on a northwestern coarse it tok about five minates before it was pretty far away and the lights were getting smaller.  I noticed that the shape of the craft changed like it was leaning sideways, it started to turn around made a very wide turn and came back towards us.  When it got back closer to us it headed to the southwest towards the lake behind my house, we drove down the road to follow the object and ended up stopping at the boat landing.  We could see it for about another five minutes and continued past the lake directly towards Mt. Katahdin. We lost sight of it the whole sighting must have been 20-25 minutes, after the craft was no longer in sight we stayed there for a few minutes.  After we lost visual sight of it we started to see many planes in the sky(could tel they were planes because of FAA lights) after 5-10 minutes of losing visual of the craft there were numerous planes in the sky.  There were so many planes going back and forth like they were going in a grid pattern at one point we all tried to count the planes and could count 15 in our sight at one time.  This went on for about a half hour, before we left and it seemed clear to me that these planes were looking for something. (very unusual to see more than two planes in the sky above this very rural area) I watch the sky’s very often out here because I have seen strange objects in the sky few times before, one time a craft came over our house that looked similar and resulted in a total power loss of our neighborhood once the object was far power came ba! ck on. This sighting for us was crystal clear, the object was very low and the lights showed the shape of the craft it was a circle with a flat back, it had a decently large yellowish dome light right in the center of the craft, and the smaller lights going all the way around the craft yellowish red and green in that order alternating.  We are certain as to what we saw my girlfriend still describes it in the same way over two years later.  The sighting was so spectacular that if I were alone by now I would have doubted what I saw if I didn’t have someone to confirm what we saw.  Since that sighting I have seen a couple other unidentifiable objects, but none as low or close as this particular one.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,47.0314,-68.642

We saw two objects in the sky to the South-East of our location.  The objects appeared to be orange lights.  They were travelling away from us (S.E.) at approx. 1000 feet above ground, and approx. 100-150 mph.  The 2 objects travelled in the same direction, in a straight line formation.  The second trailed the other by 100-200 feet.  At this point they were quite far off, such that we did not get a detailed look at them.  The objects left our field of vision in the distance to the South-East of us.  Then about 10-15 seconds later we observed what appeared to be the same orange objects, however this time the objects were to the North-East of us, travelling South-East.  They were much closer this time, passing our longitude at a few hundred feet to the North of our location.  At this point we observed the objects in greater detail.  Both objects were travelling in the same trajectory as previously observed, with the same approx. altitude and velocity, travelling the same approx. distance apart.  Their speed, altitude, and trajectory remained constant.  The orange objects, now at a much closer distance to our position, appeared to be comprised of two sections, upper and lower.  The upper section of the object appeared to be spherical in shape, with a light emitting a ‘glowing’ effect, rather than a ‘shining’ effect.  The lower section was a shining orange light, and appeared to be swaying back and forth in relation to the upper part.  These observed qualities led us to thi! nk that these were balloons, with a glowing globe, and an under-basket emitting a orange flame which illuminated the upper globe portion. 	 However a few questions remain unanswered.  One, the objects appeared to be about the size of a small 4-person propeller plane.  The orange globe appeared to be too similar in size to the orange light underneath for it to be the parachute of a balloon.  Two, the objects travelled at a velocity much faster than a typical balloon.  Three, how did the two objects move so quickly from the SE of us to the NE of us in a matter of seconds, or were there in fact 4 glowing objects in the sky?  About the Observers: I am a 22 year old Music Instructor, recently graduated from Under-grad. My friend is 23 years old, on break from school, working as a restaurant server.  We are house-mates and close friends. We both observed the same objects, agreeing on the physical characteristics, and details of the event, to the best of our knowledge.  Neither of us were able to identify these objects, although our closest guess was some sort of balloon.  We were intrigued by them and looked online with the intent to find some explanation of what they were.  In our search we stumbled upon this reporting site and decided to write a report.  We found that our observations match those of many of the other entries depicting a ""red/orange fireball or Orb"".  The above three paragraphs contain my personal account of the events which took place, recorded to the best of my knowledge.  My friend recorded a short video-clip of the objects using his iPhone.  But he went to bed, so I am unable to upload that at this time.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

It was bright enough of a light to pick –up in the photos  I had hoped to have some good pictures taken of this light object witnessed. Now I just wonder why ?  This goes on later that day to another daylight sighting much closer  At about 2:00pm I was on the other side of the building where our parking lot is located. I stepped outside and look up and about Noticing instantly a strange brilliant white colored flickering square shaped object.  I then yelled for a coworker to come out and see this thing As the coworker reach me outside. He also could see it due to being so low and close The witness said O- that’s a kite. I explained to him that it moved over our parking lot heading to the north. Not a kite ! As he watched on with me for another minute He then concluded  it’s not a kite He was now not so sure to confirm what it could be ?  It’s altitude was quite low at maybe five- hundred feet above. The sighting lasted about two minutes to when I first witnessed it ! Unfortunately I did not have my camera on me As I just remained watching it’s movements and shape being almost square like flickering Maybe some type of probe ?  I’m now at a point of what’s next if I continue to look up.  The timing to looking for unknowns have been certainly uncanny *  You will found the bright white UFO if you zoom top left on the picture.  Again really odd in witnessing all these UFO sightings day and night * Very busy in our skies showing a sign of a presence  THANKS ONCE AGAIN FOR YOU INTEREST AS I FEEL THIS ‘ MUST ‘ BE SHARED.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,43.77102833099579,-79.24512173913044

I went and grabbed my binoculars and to my amazement I saw a literal saucer shaped UFO.  I am 16 years old and this looked like something of a movie. It had a single pulsating red light on top. a green light on one side and red light on other side. Similar to airplane but not an airplane. I am an airplane enthusiast and know exactly what a plane or helicopter looks like. It was not a blimp either. It seemed low to the ground maybe no more than 2,000 feet in the air. It was hovering in certain area. It would go farther away and appear to be a tiny spec of a star. Then it would come back a little closer and I could see the lights on it. When it was closer I could use my high powered binoculars to see the very distinct shape of a saucer. I could not believe my eyes. It was hove! ring and slowly moving in what seemed to be a particular patter. Farther away then coming back and slowly going left and right. After watching it for about 1 hour. I when inside my house to the downstairs and talked to my mom and old her what I saw. I actually drew a picture of exactly what I saw. After about 15 minutes I came back up on my roof to see if it was still there. And when i went out I couldn't believe my eyes, it had somehow moved from what seemed to be over 50-100 miles away to less that 10-20 miles away. It moved from the eastern sky to northern  sky and still remained very low to the ground. I could really see it with the binoculars and called one of my brothers friend who was in my backyard to come on the roof and see it. He saw it and didn't know what it was. From the point when I first came back onto the roof and saw how far it moved, it was slowly moving the the West and disappeared from my eyesight possibly over the ocean. I can;t believe anybody else di! d not report it. It was so real and distinct and I knew that I! was loo king at something from out of this world. Please believe me. I called news stations and they wanted video proof. I did not have a camera and my cell phone camera would have not picked it up. This was real and it was over the entire Los Angeles area.

I had observed a few interesting lights which I interpreted as aircraft during the evening and twice saw satellites pass directly overhead in low earth orbit.  I'm mentioning this as I know the difference between aircraft, satellites and astronomical bodies in the sky.  The light that caught my attention was like a flare of plasma or when a gas (like methane) ignites.  It was bright and reddish white colour to it. What was interesting is that this plasma looked to have flames only at the edges.  At this stage the object was very high and my first reaction was that it was a meteorite entering the atmosphere. I realised pretty fast that this was not the case as I heard no tell tale sonic booms or streaking tail of an object burning up on entry.  Instead the object ""drifted"" like a leaf down and to my left, paused in this position briefly ( causing another ""flare"") then ! drifted down further to the right, paused again (another ""flare"") and drifted down and to the left again.  Whilst falling in this manner the object became more visible as a disc and glowing like hot metal out of a furnace.  The glow from this heat  like effect was making the object stand out nicely against the dark night sky.  It had descended about 25km in altitude to roughly a kilometre above the ground.  At this stage it stopped the falling motion and moved in an arc towards the west where I was standing observing it (arc went towards the north ending with the object moving westwards right towards my position).  It continued to move towards me until it passed directly overhead. At this stage it was about 800m above my head and had a diameter of 80 to 100 meters.  This plasma flare with fire at the edges would occasionally occur (mainly when the object changed direction or hight). It remained looking like hot metal the entire time I observed it not changing colour at all.  Having observed military and civilian helicopters fly over during t! he course of the evening I KNEW that this object is NOT a helicopter. It made NO HELICOPTER RELATED SOUNDS. It was NOT A FIXED WING LIGHT OR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. IT MADE NO AUDIBLE PROPELLER OR JET ENGINE SOUNDS. Furthermore it HAD NO NAVIGATION LIGHTS ( RED,GREEN,WHITE LIGHTS THAT ALL AIRCRAFT ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO HAVE ON AT NIGHT). It took about 3 minutes for entire sighting from beginning to end and ended with the object moving westwards at LOW altitude IN COMPLETE SILENCE WAS NOT OF ANY TECHNOLOGY I KNOW OF. IT WAS TOO BIG TO BE A TERRESTRIAL AIRCRAFT. IT DISPLAYED NO CHARACTERISTICS OR DESIGN FEATURES OF ANY KNOWN MAN MADE CRAFT. IT WAS COMPLETELY SILENT AND ENTERED SA AIRSPACE FROM A LOW EARTH ORBIT HEIGHT TO ABOUT 800M ABOVE MY HEAD WITH RELATIVE EASE. The object was witnessed by myself and 2 friends that both work for the government at local and national advisor levels. Both of them failed to understand what we had just seen, what was even more upsetting is the fact that ! hey both refuse to talk about the event AT ALL and have remained silent to the present. I know what I saw, i can draw this object and show its flight path accurately if needed. It was a disc-like craft, 80 to 100 meters in diameter and passed 800m above my head in ABSOLUTE silence emitting no light except for the glow of ""heat of the metal exterior"" marking its presence. I will testify to these facts IN ANY COURT.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,,

I am not sure of the exact date, but it was around the first week of February 2012. I was out fishing in my boat and it was approximately 1:30 am .The temperature was around 38 degrees with a clear sky. I like going out on cool nights because I have such a great view of the sky and often see quite a few meteors every time I go out. Fishing, something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. Coming in from the NW part of the sky was a seemingly very unusual meteor traveling in a SE direction. It was seemingly very, very big, was traveling in what i thought was an unusual trajectory and was moving extremely slow for a meteor. If I held my arm out at full length, my thumb would have just covered it up. I didn't at the time, but it seemed as though I could have counted to 5 easily as I watched it and it was coming in at maybe around a 15-20 degree angle. It looked like a perfectly round shaped ball that was a very bright white color, but instead of fading out as the myriad of meteors have that I have ever seen, this seemed to get brighter as it got closer. I would guess now it just seemed brighter because it was getting closer ? I would imagine it was much further off than it seemed, but when it was seemingly over the town of Estill Springs, it looked like it exploded into a thousand bright pieces,! but the pieces did not fade away or dim, they were just there, then they weren't. I honestly thought I had just watched a nuclear missile coming in on an EMP burst. I waited for all of the lights to go out but nothing happened. I sat there for a good 5 minutes wondering if I had maybe just watched a plane crash etc. Now looking at the, about 5 minutes after the first one, a 2nd one started coming in on what seemed like the same trajectory and path. Again it moved very slow, was the same size and repeated exactly what the 1st one did - seemingly over the town of Estill Springs exploding. Okay I thought, the first emp blast failed and this was the 2nd attempt. Again the lights stayed on and i had all kinds of things going on in my head trying to figure out what i was witnessing. It just seemed so strange for a meteor, unlike anything I had ever witnessed. After about 20 minutes with everything seeming normal, I went back to fishing. About 10 minutes later, keeping an eye on the sky, I saw a third bright round ""ball"" coming in from the same part of the sky only this one seemed much higher up. Again moving ""slowly"" like the others, it traveled in a south easterly direction only this one went much further south. If I had not seen the first 2 I probably would not have been able to understand the ""explosion"" as it was much further away. I came home the next morning and told everyone I knew that I had seen the strangest ""meteors"" in the sky. Maybe a month ago, reading Coast to Coast news, I saw an article about a ""flaming fireball"" over Georgia on I believe February 14th I believe. Apparently a woman saw something very similar to what I had seen over a small town in Georgia. The scientists said what she had seen was a very unusual meteor that came from the meteor belt and described it as a ""rare"" event. It made me wonder if that was what I had seen because the time could have been right and the 3rd ""ball of light"" seemed to me like it would have been in that general direction. So it was probably the ""flaming meteor"", only it was described as rare and I saw 3 of them in about a 40 minute time span, 2 of them seeming to take the exact same path with the 3rd traveling further south east. I was in the army on tanks and have seen my share of missiles and rockets (peace time warrior, a section sgt in a calvary platoon) and i would have to say whatever it was, it was the coolest thing i have ever seen. Just seemed to travel soooooo slow for a meteor plus if anything, instead of dimming it got brighter as it came in. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I think I live on a flight path, because just about any time you wish, you can go out and look in the east sky and see planes.  Most travel west, but sometimes there are planes that go east on a similar path, but possibly a mile or so south west of the east to west path.  On this particular night, I had been out for maybe a min or two, I spotted a flying craft and it immediately caught my eye.  I was shocked because of how low to the ground it was flying, MUCH MUCH lower than all planes I had ever seen. It came from the North West and traveled more quickly than any other plane I had seen.  The closer I got, it seemed to move slower, but still faster than my mind expected to see a plane flying. I noticed that it had lights in a triangle figure (one in front, and two in rear).  When it came closer, I could see the lights were not on wings, and the one in front was not looking ahead, they were all three facing down. I kept waiting to hear this craft but it had approached with no sound, and then seemed to slow way down to what I would consider a “hovering forward motion”.  It passed over top of me, and seemed to be slightly higher than the tree line, and maybe twice as high as the homes it was passing over.  The craft looked black, but it was dark outside so if it wasn’t black, it was a dark shade close to black. It stayed level the whole time, and while over me, the lights gave it a triangle appearance.  I could not see any hard edges or sides to the object, but judging by the length of dull, non shiny material between lights, I would guess it was about 40 ft long. And about 30 ft from left rear to the right rear light.   I watched it as long as I could, and it didn’t seem to speed up, but it was gaining altitude. Within 30 seconds of passing me, it was gone!  It sped up so fast that it was almost instantly out of sight.  I have nothing to compare the speed to what so ever.  I have never been so baffled before and honestly was too embarrassed to tell most people.  My one friend I did tell, said it sounds like what others have seen also, and instructed me to report it, even though it’s embarrassing.  I don’t want people to think I am a quack, but I know that whatever I saw was like nothing I have seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My son and I were driving to Roadhouse to pick up something for dinner; we were about to turn right on to Country Club; we were sitting at the stop sign by Boren Elementary School and my son blurted out, ""What is that?” (He is 15)…  To our right in the sky line, not too far up was a sight I had never seen before…. Something really large with many vertical and horizontal white lights was flying slowly….  As it turned, we noticed that one side had many lights and the other side did not.  If you live in a flight zone, which we do, (this was not in the flight zone) you see planes flying over relatively low).  That aircraft was flying even lower than that?""  We could not hear any sound coming from the craft.  When I saw it, I immediately rolled down my window…. It made a sharp turn and began to move towards the East, towards Matlock Drive, so we pursued.. It did not turn like a commercial aircraft would, moving in a slow bank, it just turned on a dime and began moving in the other direction..  It continued toward the East so we pulled over in an area where we could continue watching.  It was then that we saw something unbelievable!   As the object continued moving away from us but still very visible, one of the lights on the aircraft shot straight up into the air, which turned out to be a smaller aircraft.  It was much smaller of course and it began to circle around in a large circle around the larger aircraft that it took off from.  As it was following the larger aircraft, the next unbelievable thing happened.  Another very large aircraft just like the first one we saw, appeared in the same airspace as the other two, coming from the Northwest and it caught up with the other two flying objects 2 very large objects and one small one.

It was about 9:30pm. I caught two of them on camera. My Description: They were not lanterns, they were moving across the sky at a high rate of speed and they were clearly in the stratosphere.  They were bright orange and much larger than any airplane light or weather balloon.  They actually shimmered like balls of flame.  We could see them from the horizon as we turned the corner onto our street.   We watched for ten minutes as one by one they moved across the sky until they went past and then we couldn't see their light any longer. We turned off both our cars in the driveway so we could hear if their was any sound emanating from the objects and they were totally silent. There were three teenagers across the street watching the same thing.  I've never seen anything like it.  They moved irregularly, but fast.  They did not glow of a normal light.  They were more like glowing embers with a red core that you could see more clearly as the orange/yellow would fade, until finally when they were just past ""overhead"", they disappeared.

It was relatively high in the sky but appeared to be very close to my position and yet I couldn't make out an object associated with the light it was as if it were on fire but there was no flickering nor smoke nor was anything falling from the object.  I was completely floored by the sight of it mostly because this was a relatively large size light, about half the size of my thumb at arms length and larger vertically than horizontally and yet no sound could be heard, no flickering of light such as all aircraft I have seen in the sky display and so I couldn't figure out what it was.  For a moment I entertained the possiblility it was a meteorite and hoped that if it were one it would drop some material that I could retreive.  As I watched this light proceed in a north to south direction I noticed , again to my right, a q! uick movement and looking that direction I saw another light that seemed to swoop (for want of better way to explain how it appeared to fly) into view coming from a north to south direction and immediately to a east west direction and then again to the same apparent direction as the other light.  It assumed the same height and speed of the other light and this light was also orange and appeared to be on fire but with no flickering.  This object, although seeming to be the same apparent size of the first object was more of a tear-drop shape than the other one and it had a rather spiky appearance to its light.  These objects were entirely composed of light from my view of them I could not make out any features. I was thinking someone else must be able to see these objects, people were out shooting off fireworks and so the chance that someone was looking up at the sky were pretty good --I felt very excited seeing these objects because I've never seen anything like them before and I felt I was seeing a rare sight but by no means did I think I was the only one who could see them.  The big dipper was in the north/northwest sky and was setting..these objects were approximately half-way up the dipper or about half way up the sky in my estimation, about the same height a small aircraft would fly and lower than a jet.  I have seen loads of aircraft in the skies from my backyard and none have ever had lights as large as these two were, not even a helicopter close in the sky would have that type of light. The two lights, the second light having moved closer to the first light, continued to move steadily and at the same height in a southerly direction and I watched them looking from one to the other when I noticed the first light I had seen appeared to turn to the west and began to get smaller as if fading out or even burning out?   I watched it completely disappear in less than a minute.  I looked back to the other light and it too turned and began to fade from sight appearing to be going west directly away from me straight ahead of my orientation.  I did not take my eyes off of this one and watched until it appeared to become a tiny white circle such as a star would appear and seemingly to be very far away.  And then it too disappeared.  I watched for another hour on this clear night with a full moon behind me for anything even vaguely resembling what I saw but did not see any further objects. I have never seen anything like this before, could these have been some kind of firework?",2012-08-05T00:00:00,44.073170796460175,-122.93638849557522

The first time we saw it was about 10 minutes after the fireworks display had ended.  There were still people launching fireworks from houses nearby but this was not any kind of firework.  We were outside on a friends deck when I noticed a glowing flickering orb parallel to our position at a 45 degree angle. The object appeared to be about a 1/2 mile away at the time moving maybe 5-10mph and appeared to hover at altitude twice as it moved south.  I pointed it out to several friends and they all witnessed it too.  The object as best as I can describe was round, glowing and flickering almost fire like and as far as we could tell silent.  At its closest point to us there was a second smaller object very dim following slightly behind it and off to one side.  It was hard to judge ! the distance of the second object to the first although it did cross it's path more than once.  This area of downtown Seattle is in the flight path for the airport so there are planes in the sky constantly.  Along the flight path of the object a plane did cross a couple of miles behind and above it.  My point is that we're all familiar with the lights on the aircraft flying around the sky most evenings and this had a much warmer non blinking glow and was traveling much to slowly for a commercial airliner or private plane.  After about 5 minutes it had traveled pretty far south and we lost sight of it.  The second sighting was about 20 minutes later waiting in traffic on Dexter Ave.  The object appeared east of the previous location on the other side of the lake.  This time it shot up from behind a large hill at about a 45 degree angle then leveled off at what appeared to be the same altitude as before and headed slowly north until it was out of our sight.  This sighting lasted abou! t 2 minutes no second object was seen.  Somebody asked me if I ! thought it was a lantern.  I don't think so, as it appeared to be under powered flight and moving in a controlled manner. It also appeared far too large for a lantern. There was no significant breeze at the time and without power not sure how it would have later showed up moving in the opposite direction. There is a video posted on Youtube this morning along with comments from other witnesses in the area. The video is NOT mine an is not very well shot, it also does not get across the warmth and orange hue of the object as we saw it.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0JM1SFszE   I'm not suggesting this was E.T. :) but it was most certainly an unidentified flying object.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Living close to NASA and ELINGTON FIELD, I was used to seeing odd lights and aircraft.  I mentioned seeing something odd and as soon as I did, 2 additional orbs appeared creating a triangular shape.  I told my friend what I was seeing, he had doubts as did I.  A strand of 3 lights appeared to the left.  They rose quickly in a perfect line, and also took shape as a triangle.  The orbs in total were 6, brilliant and amber/orange in color.  They slowly turned and faced the south where they disappeared through the tree line.     I was in shock. I ran inside and woke my wife to tell her what I had seen.  I involuntarily frightened her, but asked her to come see with me. She decided to stay in bed, but I wanted to see more.  Still on the phone, I went back out and continued watching the tree linew in the same southern direction.  A total of 3 more times, orbs rose in the sky forming two large pyramid shapes. In all, I saw 24 orbs this morning.     I tried to record what I saw with my phone, but after coming inside, I realized my camera phone was facing the wrong way, so there was just darkness and the sound of my voice in the video. I'll never forgive myself. I know what I saw though and it was not candles or balloons in the sky. The patterns were too precise. The distance from me was 10 miles at most, and the orbs size and position only helped confirm the enormous size of each triangle that formed in the sky.     I will be sitting at my back door with a camera facing the right direction, precisely at 2 o'clock tomorrow morning for another once in a lifetime chance to catch what I saw hovering quietly in the night.      I hope that others thinking they saw something this night won't feel alone.

Jokingly, we talked about an aircraft landing on the highway.   As we drew closer, the line of lights made me certain that these were no landing lights of any aircraft I have encountered.  As we traveled ever closer the lights formed into somewhat of a cross/disc shape with a bright light in each corner.  A single unflashing red light accompanied the center light.  The craft was angelic in its movements and seemed to hover at a speed at which no aircraft could maintain flight.  I would estimate its altitude at 200 feet.  I could make out the feint curvature of a hull between the lights. No sound was heard when I rolled down my windows.  At this point my passenger and I couldn't comprehend what we had just seen.

We live in the woods where there is little to no external light. We have seen several light phenomena's in the past during the late spring that consisted of bright white flashes of light for several hours from approximately 2300 - 0200, but nothing like this. There were first 4-5 bright glowing orbs travelling relatively the same trajectory path, and they passed for several minutes, continuuing NW. I have recorded what I could with my cell phone.  Moments after seeing the first group of light, three more came passing by, nearly following the path of Hwy 5.  They were relatively low, with no sounds as that which an aircraft would make. We did call our local police dispatch number to see if there were other reports of sightings, checking to see if the! re was a military operation going on, or something similar. The dispatcher basically dismissed my call.  My friend and neighbor both saw the lights I saw. I have a background in Aviation as well as majored in Environmental Science with a focus on Climatology/Paleo-Climatology.

I am not sure what to think. We often have low flying helicopters fly over, following that path as well as planes, but these things were not either planes nor helicopters.  There was a very slight breeze, and I don't believe them to be the floating lanterns which have become popular, as the trajectory path was consistent, low, and moving NW, against the SSE Winds.

Sometime in July, 2011, I had gone throughout the entire day with the unshakable feeling that I was going to witness something, or that something was going to happen.  The feeling was vague associated with the sky, and since I had been watching the sky closely since a strange sighting in 2002, I was filled with much anticipation.  However, as the day wore on into night, I experienced absolutely nothing. At approximately 2330 hours (11:30 p.m.) I approached my bedroom window (which faces South) and observed a bright, orange orb rising between the tree tops, on the other side of my apartment complex.  The orb pulsated, as if it consisted of flame, but I did not see flames.  The orb rose steadily until it was above the height of the trees -- approximately sixty feet up -- before coming to a complete stop.  The orb hovered completely still for a few minutes before slowly moving to the Northwest.  When it passed out of sight, I ran outside and saw it was coming over the dog-runs we have at the West end of the complex. After a while, it again stopped and hovered for several minutes.  The area was very quiet, aside from some distance sounds of passing cars on the freeway about a half-mile away.  The orb made no discernible sound. I ran inside, to get my video camera, but when I tried to get the orb on film, it was too dark for my camera to detect it.   When I tried to zoom in, the orb appeared on the camera's screen, but the image was too blurry to have any discernible likeness.  The orb then moved farther Northwest, towards the hill behind the dog-runs.  It again stopped and hovered, for a couple of minutes, right over the house behind the dog-runs. The orb then moved downwards and landed on the hill, just to the North of the house, coming to rest between a couple of trees. Using the trees as a guide, I was able to estimate the size of the orb to have the same approximately diameter as a Volkswagen Beatle is long. There was no light on the hill, except for a floodlight on the East side of the house (facing East) and the light from the orb.  I thought, for a moment, that I could see something moving to the left (South) of the orb, but I still could not see any details.  Attempting to use my camcorder again had the same results as before. While I considered trespassing on someone else's private property to get a closer look at the thing, there was a very loud popping sound, similar to what happens when one steps on a light-bulb, and then darkness and silence.  I continued to stare at the area for several minutes, and again considered trespassing, but I could not see anything well enough to determine if there was anything still on the side of the hill, where the orb had been. I examined the area (from the dog-runs) early the next morning, but I saw no indication that anything had ever been resting on the hill, the night before.

It was a mostly-clear night, if memory serves. I was looking across the lake at the sky above Vedder Mountain and saw a shape that looked like a satellite, moving up and left from my point of view.  At first, I thought is was a satellite, or even a fighter jet. But it was moving WAY to fast to be both.  Suddenly, it made a sharp turn, to the right, too sharp for a jet or satellite, and disappeared.  The magnitude was about the same as that of a distant plane/very bright star. I don't know what I saw, but it was definitely odd. And I've seen satellites move, and they do not move like this. Or any type of plane.

The Imperial County Municipal Airport is immediately to the N/W of the intersection.  The weather was clear and there were light streaks of clouds in the sky highlighted by the moonlight.

The amber portion was much larger than the multiple colored lights.  The multiple colored lights seemed disconnected to the amber object and were all evenly spaced from one another.  The entire group appeared to be at least 500 feet from end to end, again, it did not appear to be solid, but instead, segmented.

All of the multi-colored lights were rectangular and solid.  There was no display of any sort of blinking night-time aviation flight lights. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of at least 3,000 feet, although it was hard to discern because it was night time.  It appeared to be stationary.  After about 10 seconds, it suddenly disappeared and you could see slight cloud streaks and stars in the background where it had been.  It was not like a solid object that merely blacked out but was still there, in which case it would block out any objects behind it.  Instead, it was completely gone.  About one second later, another object, or possibly the same one, just suddenly appeared from nowhere, about 3 miles further north, probably in the vicinity of SR-86 and Keystone Road., and about 1/4 east of that intersection.  This time, it appeared to be in the form of a giant Ferris wheel in the sky:  the same individual multi-colored lights were in a wheel shape that was vertically turned on its axes and at about a 45 degree angle.  I could not discern whether the center was solid as that portion of it was too dull.  The entire object was surrounded by a very soft white aura or haze.  This too was completely stationary, not moving or rotating.  The entire object was much larger than the previous one that first appeared to the south.  It too was at least 500 feet in diameter.  This stayed in view for at least 15 seconds, and then faded away to a very bright, small amber glowing cigar shaped object that remained stationary.  After about 10 seconds, it suddenly disappeared.!   I remained in the vicinity for at least 15 minutes to see if it, or they might reappear, but there was no further activity.  I am very familiar with the area and the activity in and around the airport.  This certainly had nothing to do with airport activity or any sort of night time crop dusting activities.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,32.8685,-115.6505

Date/Time: My best time estimate is around 7:43pm on Wednesday February 15, 2012. Although I didn’t note the time in my car, I called my wife on her cell phone when I was stopped at Bourdeaux Pl about a couple of minutes after the initial sighting. Her call log indicates 7:45pm for this call. The sighting was on the route of my daily commute since August 2002. Duration: At least a few minutes. I was driving at the time. There was one car very close behind – probably because I had slowed down considerably. I was frustrated by the proximity of this car which forced me to continue out of the line of sight of the object (now behind me), down a hill and up the other side of the valley. It was probably close to a mile later when I was able to safely pull over into a right turn lane for Bourdeaux Place (probably about 2 minutes later) – see map (UFO_sighting_location_Feb_15_2012_1.PNG). At this location I could look across. I could still see the object. Description: Appearance: Apparently triangular with closely-spaced twin red and green lights (one set at each apex). The lights spanned Goshen Rd. The central light appeared somewhat higher than the ones to the right (East) and the left (West). The lights were not strobed and appeared similar in separation from my viewpoint. When I first saw the object I was at the STOP at Warfield Rd, traveling North on Goshen Road. The object was to the North of me. For a brief moment I thought it was a commercial airliner at a frighteningly low altitude, but immediately afterward it appeared like the triangular object was floating and seemed to be canting slowly. I could not make out for sure if there was matter between the three twinned light sources because it was very dark. I got a good idea of the distance between the three light sources because within a few hundred feet, just after passing Lochaven drive, I had passed underneath the object and all three points were behind me. The central apex lig! hts passed right overhead. The lights on the other apeces were perhaps over the houses on each side of the road. Reconstruction (from memory): Unfortunately I do not have a photo or video. However, I have used an image of the approximate initial viewpoint of the object in front of me from Google Maps. The daytime view of the location would be approximately like this:  SEE E-MAILED IMAGE scene_Goshen_and_Lochaven-day.PNG  I have tried to sketch what I saw (and the scale) by using the above daytime Google Maps image and inking out the sky. It was a very clear (cloudless) night, but dark – no moonlight I think. The object then looked something like that shown below: (I cannot be sure if the green was on the left or the right of the red and the lights may have been slightly closer together and more aligned in a fixed direction than I have indicated. Also this reconstruction shows definite sky between the points, whereas in reality I could not make out any sky between the points - only blackness – but the illustration gives an idea of what I saw). SEE E-MAILED IMAGE: approx_reconstruction_UFO.PNG  Scale: From the fact that I had passed underneath all three points of light within a few hundred feet at low speed, I could tell that these lights were at low altitude, perhaps 100 to 150 ft up and that the object spanned perhaps 150 to 200 feet on one edge. Sound: I did not have any windows open but detected no sound at all. Action taken immediately afterwards: The first place I was able to safely pull over with a line of sight to the original location of the sighting was in a right turn-only lane dedicated to a residential street (Bourdeaux Place, just West of Route 124). At this location, I got out and walked a little East to gain a sight around some trees. I could see the tree line on the other side of the valley and the three points of light just above the tree line, but now planar (horizontal). It seemed like the object had moved somewhat East and was no longer tilted up. Looking at the Google map later, and the orientation of Bourdeaux Drive relative to the initial location, I would say that this assumption was accurate. I got on my cell phone and called my wife to tell her that something weird was going on and asked her to put on the local news to see if anything had been reported. I then got back into my car and continued home. At little later (on Howard Chapel Rd - the Montgomery County part) I again pulled over to look ba! ck across towards Gaitherburg but didn’t see anything unusual. Action taken on Thursday February 16, 2012 I decided that I would take no further action until I returned on my morning commute the next day in daylight. This would take me on the exact reverse route through the location of the sighting. There was nothing visible that could possibly explain what I saw the previous night and everything appeared normal. Once at the office I decided to call the Airport Manager at: Montgomery County Airpark 7940 Airpark Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20879 Phone: (301) 963-7100 An answering machine kicked in so I had to leave a message for the manager. I tried to describe what I saw in a way that wouldn’t be instantly dismissed as a “crackpot call”. I left my name and my NIST office number and requested that they call be if they could explain what I might have seen. As of today I have not been contacted. I also told a colleague, who happens to live on Lochaven Drive, about my experience.  She and her family were at home but had not seen or heard anything.  She said she would ask neighbors who walk their dogs at about that time. I am guessing that perhaps dozens of others may have seen what I saw on that stretch of road at that time, so I have checked the internet periodically to see if there are any similar reports.  So far I have not seen any but I want to log my experience.  Who knows? Maybe someone else saw this and either dismissed it or failed to report it.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,39.14072038404727,-77.20584416543575

Me and a friend of mine stayed in a suite with a balcony facing towards the MGM / Luxor hotel. At night the Luxor shines a very bright beam of light into the sky, which originates at the tip of its pyramid structure and goes straight up. We were preparing to go out into the Vegas nightlife. I stood on the balcony and at about 9:35pm I noticed unusual glowing dots in the Luxor light beam at an estimated hight of max. 400-500 meters, maybe closer to ground. There was a shining 3-light and a 4-light formation. They were „dancing“ around each other in the light beam, always keeping some formation. When they moved out of the light beam a few times they were still visible, but barley. Those motions went back and forth into and out of the light beam. Always in a pattern and always in an unnatural movement – up, down, even standing in mid-air, which I with my knowledge only can call unidentifiable. It was a very clear night, no clouds, stars were bright, airplanes and helicopters clearly visible and distinguishable. Yes, there was air traffic from the nearby airport – but by its motion airplanes, helicopters, birds reflecting light, remote-controlled toys like octocopters etc. can be exempt.

I have become obsessed over it, as I hope for a logical explanation beyond my understanding. It started as I was getting my children up for school, early in the morning before the sun rises. I am a smoker, but we do not smoke in the house. I was looking up at the stars, watching them, when out of the corner of my eye,a bright one suddenly began to move across the sky. It was small, and it looked like a regular bright star, but the way it moved gave me shivers of fear. It didn't blink, It wasn't a shooting star moving as fast as they move. Every other plane we see in the sky blinks multiple colors of white, red and blue or a combination, or just red. This one did not. This one seemed to mimic a star, then it just... left.It was extremely high, but I still do not know what it was. As I told my wife, she laughed, saying it was probably a shooting star. But it was not, I have seen plenty of those. I challenged her the next few days to get up with me and star-gaze, in prayer to see it again. A few days afterward we saw many planes in the sky, skywriters, jets, passenger airplanes, military cargo jets. And my wife gave up saying she believed me, it was a u.f.o., an object I could not identify. Depressed, I woke up every morning with my girls for school, between 6:00 a.m. and 6:30 am, watching the sky until they went to school. Then finally I saw the object again. I believe it was on a Wednesday or a Thursday morning. The dawn was rising, but the stars  still shined through some light cloud in the sky. I fixated my eyes on one, watching the clouds move in front of it, and I watched it leave its position in the sky. Almost like a night watchman. Excitedly I opened the door behind me and screamed at the children to get over here and look, but only my oldest ! daughter made it out, but the object had vanished in plain sight. They had just missed it, but she said that she believed me and left for school. I told my wife, and she of course said o.k., but I could see the disbelief in her eyes. Convinced I was not crazy, and determined because I saw the object again, I cannot stop watching the skies. About three weeks ago, my wife and I was smoking in the front yard, and I was watching towards Orion's Belt, when from my position to the right I was watching a cluster of stars. My wife noticed how pretty and bright they were as well, when we Both witnessed the object in the cluster move right, faster than usual, then grow extremely bright and vanish. I screamed at her ""Told you so!"" She was shocked by what she saw, and she could not explain what she seen, but she left it at, ""That is amazing, you should see if anyone else ever see's this."" Since then, about a week and a half ago, I had the family in my truck and we have a sunroof, we went to dinner at a local buffet, and as we were driving back to our neighborhood, the stars were gorgeous yet again. I laughed and told them I want to see  ""the star that moves again"" and they all said we want to see it too. I pulled into my driveway, and my wife and I and all the children sat looking out at the sky, when directly above us, it did it again. I screamed out there it is, and the children rushed out as well as my wife. It moved across other stars, to the left and in the direction of the ocean. Bright, fast, but not a falling star and not blinking one bit. The children were excited to see what I was talking about, and my wife said, ""That is cool, but the last time was cooler."" I have moved as of a week ago, but I still find myself watching for stars that just... leave their nightly position in space. What is this object, and does anyone else see it in South Carolina?",2012-05-13T00:00:00,33.0313964028777,-80.18812302158273

I opened my window to get a better look while I slowly began to pass them.  They looked like small (~2 ft diameter) Chinese lanterns. Light emitted from an orb-like mass in the middle of each lantern; the outter cylinder-shaped body seemed to be lit by this orb. I could tell neither the orbs nor the lanterns were made-up of no ordinary light because they were radiant yet soft, dense hi-def but misty. Hard to explain. They gently floated along and shifted positions (in relation to each other). Then I saw one lantern float into the other, merging into 1 cylinder (which maintained its  size). I continued to keep my eye on them/it (and the road...) but eventually the rubbernecking reached an uncomfortable angle. I turned off at the next exit and flipped around, but they/it were/was gone. The reason why I'm not sure if they were amber or red is because I remember them being both of those colors (together, i.e. they matched) yet I have no recollection of noticing them change; one second they were amber and the next they were red, and I have no idea how they pulled off that fast one. They were pretty. Seemed to have an air of intelligence about them. Just got that kind of vibe.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

I spotted the object and it appeared to be bouncing (going up and down and back and forth) above the mature trees. It was moving quite fast, going above and at times, below the tree line.  It was a bright blue luminous oval object with a smaller red oval attached to the left side of the blue object.  The lights were not flashing or pulsing, but very bright and steady.

It had 3 lights in a triangular formation, all white.  And in the center had a small white light that seemed to be projecting different colors out of it a bit, reds, blues, greens, yellows.  It kept on changing.   Now the weirdest part about it that makes me know it wasn't an airplane, it looked as if it was only about less than a mile away. It was extremely close, but it was moving extremely slow.  It was barely moving at all.  It took it a full 2 minutes at least to travel what seemed to be me 2000 feet.  It was heading my direction, almost straight at me(heading southwest).   Then out of nowhere it spontaneously changed direction and began to head north and higher up into the sky.    About 20 seconds after it changed direction, it just vanished.  I haven't really been sure what to make of it since.

The objects started to ascend into the atmosphere in the same order they appeared.  My only camera was my cell phone. You have to move the screen around and enlarge it to see the photos I got.  In one shot as you enlarge it the object appears to be linear in shape but with the naked eye my best description is fireballs.  I have been reluctant to report for fear of being ridiculed if my name was revealed but I’m so intrigued I had to share.  We watched the news that night and the next day, and read the paper, and as best we can tell, no one else reported.

It was bright, like the size of Venus on an early spring morning, but orange in hue.  With a full moon tonight, the clouds were illuminated, and this object was flying beneath them.  It was out of sight within 15 seconds, miles and miles away, but we still heard that biplane somewhere, so we know that the object was something else entirely.   The object was never obscured by houses or trees at any point. It either disappeared, or was simply so fast it was hundreds of miles away in mere seconds.  I am a very logical thinker, and I cannot imagine what, in my index of known objects, this was.   Moments after, a commercial plane flew in from another direction.

However, since the dogs kept barking, I decided to call my son (in the next room) on his cell phone to see if he would get up and go with me to go investigate.  He didn’t answer the phone.

I've sifted through the archives in this site and have found that although there have been reports seemingly describing what I and a few others have seen down at Wrightsville Beach, none of them offer contact information and so they're, regrettably, somewhat more prone to be dismissed. However, I'm too moved to want to show people what's been going on down there to just let that slip on by, so I'll add a few of my tales as well, beginning with last night's most recent event. Now, since my first encounter at Wrightsville Beach (will describe later), I have come back a few times with a few different groups of people to show them what I refer to as the ""Dancing Star."" It's a large, yellowish light (sometimes seemingly blinking different colors) that will distinguish itself from its counterparts by moving in swirling, zig-zagging patterns back and fourth, though it still mostly remains true to its general area or ""zone."" Upon several inspections of the thing, I realized that right before it moves, you can faintly catch a tiny pinprick of light near it flash before the main star moves towards it. I called the motion ""kiting,"" since it seemed that the small pinpricks would determine where the star moved to. It appears in random areas of the sky, sometimes even switching positions throughout the night. As a hobby, my friends and I go check it out. Anyway, last night I was in a particular mood and wanted to go see if we could find it again. I was with my friend who agreed it would probably be a good night to just go relax for a bit: the moon was full (or at least close), and there was a lightning storm off in the distance (this time, to the opposite of the shore). We usually hang out in the area of Wrightsville that's all the way to the right where you park by the gazebo. From there, we walk down to the left for a bit until we reach the breaker in the water and usually plop down there. Well, tonight was no different: he decided to lay down on the sand and star gaze while I, a bit further up and closer to the water, squatted down and began singing to myself. It's what I do here. About fifteen minutes had passed with me singing and my friend taking a nap close by. I had my back turned to the ocean and was singing in the direction of the lightning storm, since it was particularly gorgeous, when I suddenly felt compelled to turn around to face the ocean again and I saw it once more: hanging low to the ocean and very bright, it seemed to slowly appear as if out of mist or fog. This time there were two lights, one on top of the other. Both much more yellow and brighter than the neighboring stars. There were no clouds from the direction where they appeared, but like I described, they seemed to just sort of swim into view. The top, dimmer ""star"" stayed stationary in its movement towards us, while the lower star seemed to swing while it moved, like a pendulum suspended from the top one. Both moved together, though, and were recognizable as one. They got closer and stayed there. I didn't freak out since I'd seen a similar situation last year around! this same time (around June-July), so I just kept watching it and singing to myself. In between songs, it would move to the right at a fairly quick speed. As soon as I'd begin again, though, it'd move back left and lock itself into a place in ""front"" of me on the horizon line. I also tried talking at it, unsuccessfully. There were flashes of what seemed to be ""heat lightning"" coming from around it, even though the actual storm was still far off in the opposite direction and there were no clouds to speak of near the thing. But the first time I saw this thing manifest, there was also such ""heat lightning."" It stayed there the whole time we were there watching it all, though it didn't do much except move back and forth and fluctuate its brightness.  Mind you, not twinkling like planets, but it would get noticeably brighter, like a yellow-orange flashlight in the sky and then dim down super dim and then return to a nice, healthy medium-strength glow. As the glow of morning began to rise in a blue hue, I told it ""Good morning"" in a tone of more so a ""goodbye"" and when I looked up above me (just to see if there was anything else interesting going on; I'm always looking everywhere at that place), I saw a pale white light form, brighten, and dart away -- too slow to be a shooting star and too fast to be anything else. We both agreed it was time to go, then. The two ""star-forms"" it took stayed there in the sky, though when my friend pulled up his star map ap on his phone, they didn't register as anything.   +_+_+_+_+_+  Now this same situation happened last year around this time and with the same company, and again at around three thirty a.m. til sunrise. We were down at the same spot and I was, again, singing while watching a lightning storm (this time, this one was over the water far along the horizon). I kept finding it kind of weird how the bolts of lighting that were visible from the storm kept seemingly striking the same spot, but I dismissed that. Then, a bright, yellow star emerged from among the storm clouds, became very bright and yellow, and began to ""dance"" around. It zig zagged and looped. I thought it was a plane at first. It did, however, get closer to us in the sky and when it did it seemed to have a slight trail/tail -- could have been the light, though. I wasn't blinking very much when watching it. It ended up sticking around for about a good two hours, moving about in the same fashion, before it stopped, dimmed, and something else happened:  Close to us, appearing (again, almost as if from mist) along the shore line was this boomerang like sliver of red light. It was swaying back and fourth like a lantern at around the same speed as one would carried by someone with a bit of a limp. It kept getting closer. Mind you, I was a bit scared at this point. My friend, even, was about to bolt if need be, but we decided to brave it and see what it was (though we didn't move). Eventually, the thing stretched itself out further into a crescent and looked almost feather like. The swinging slowed down. It was quite a few feet far away from us -- I'm pretty sure it just looked closer than it actually was, but compared to the rest of the actual celestial bodies, it was noticeably closer, y'know? It gave the impression of hovering over the water, though it cast no reflection. Then became brighter and yellow until it looked like a crescent moon. This night was a New Moon night. I remember it was the reason I went to the beach. I ! figured I could see the stars perfectly on a night like that. Well, it took the shape of a moon and hovered there for about a minute and then began moving quickly to the right along the sky line. Then it would stop for about thirty seconds and then move slightly slower backward. It moved as if someone was pulling a lure through water. Fast and smooth at first then slowing and easing into its stops. No trails. It was very strange. So we kept watching it in fascination all night until dawn came. Then, again, I saw what I thought was a shooting star dart off near it and the thing stopped moving and kind of ""dissolved.""  Also, on some nights when its been active, a low, loud humming note can be heard. Other than that, though, the objects make no noises. I don't know if its related or not. I didn't take pictures because I initially figured it might scare it away and I wanted to absorb all I could from the moment. Next time, however, I may just have to take an adequate video.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,34.23837495219885,-77.87846768642447

The only problem we have is how far away it was, as it was slightly foggy.  One says it was about 30 yards in front of us, and heading directly into a field near us, and another says that it was more up in the sky, like closer up with the stars and heading somewhere off in the distance. Obviously this is a big difference, and we might even think it was an asteroid or something burning up in the gravity and friction. When we were near Watertown, SD, still on highway 20, I saw another one, but only caught a glimpse of it, and it appeared to be duller, but still the same color was definitely lower than the first, and slower, but more on earth, like not so much in the stars.

The object(s) kept on gliding in a straight line for about 35 minutes when it suddenly disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky since I could still see all the stars surrounding it.  It had a totally different glow than stars, and it was much stronger than theirs too.

Half of them rotated, as if they were pivoting on the center light, and the other half pivoted the other way, pivoting on the center light.  The lights quickly changed from a straight line to almost a letter V, but not perfect like you would expect from military.

After having re-visited the site a couple of months after, I have revised my original account some. A friend and I were camping in the upper Big Hole Valley, 20 miles west of Jackson, Montana.  We were camped 1 mile upstream of Lower Minor Lake, 10 miles east of the Montana/Idaho border.  It is a remote area. Visibility was unlimited.  My account is: My friend had retired for the evening to his camper and it was probably a half hour after total darkness.  I had been checking out the stars with my binoculars, I lowered them and was looking toward the North Star.  An extremely bright yellow light, many times larger than the Space Station and a hundred times brighter, exploded in the sky.  Out of this coalesced an oval, silvery, luminescent spacecraft. And that is what it was, a spacecraft.  This craft dropped out of the sky at, I estimate, a steep 75 degree angle, heading south, almost right above me.  The craft decelerated quickly and getting larger and easier to see what it was.  The position of the ship was perpendicular to the earth’s surface when it entered our atmosphere, keeping in this position until it very smoothly, automatically it seemed, rotated to a “right side up” position and leveled out, just as it disappeared in the darkness.  The spacecraft seemed like it was pulsating when it first appeared and it did go behind some sparse tall tree tops.  No external lights were visible and it was totally silent.  The craft continued flying south, paralleling just to the east of the Bitterroot Mountains and the Montana/Idaho border.  Speed by then was probably in the hundreds of miles per hour.  This seemed like it happened very fast, but it must have been 5-6 seconds or more. I had my best view when I was looking at the top portion of the spacecraft as it was rotating level.  Around its perimeter, it was plated, armored, fit together in a definite angled radius of the ship’s oval shape.  In the center was a raised half circle section, shaped in a radius in front and open in the rear, much like a game horse shoe. It was very sleek looking and was totally silent.  The spacecraft’s size; when I hold my arm out, the space between my thumb and finger would be about 1 to 1 ½.  I have short arms.  Thinking about it on where I was, the mountains surrounding me being some miles away, I think when it was at its closest, it was 2-3 miles and making the calculations, I believe it would be 100-200 feet long, 40-60 feet wide and thin, although I am not sure how thick it was.  When the craft entered the earth’s atmosphere or appeared, I feel it was 25,000’ to 50,000’ in elevation, probably higher than that. After this was over, I immediately went to the cab of my truck and wrote down the time and what happened. I then went over to my friend’s camper and asked him if he had seen anything and with it being totally silent, he hadn’t.  I then elaborated what I had just witnessed. On November 18th, I was able to stop back by, having to walk in this time of the year a mile in due to the snow to where we had camped and I saw the spacecraft.  It is one thing to have seen something and another to put it down on paper.  I wanted to go back to take some photos and get a better descriptive narrative in my own mind of what I saw.  The craft did come down higher than I originally thought, my original thought was 12,000’ to 15,000’.  It is still my biggest unknown.  Those who have seen the Space Station flying thru the sky, gleaming brightly due to the sun’s reflection on it’s silvery surface, then only to disappear when the reflection is lost, will know what I mean.  Knowing this, this craft had to still be in the suns rays when it appeared and it was dropping rapidly and decelerating.  I also lowered the space between my finger and my thumb when I held my arm out to gauge its size, I originally had down 1 ½” to 2” and 200’ to 400’ long. Why did this alien craft choose this location to enter the earth’s atmosphere?  After reflecting on this for a bit, I think that with the upper Big Hole Valley, west of Jackson, Montana, being a very remote location, is why this area was chosen.   We were 10 miles east of the Montana/Idaho border.  Jackson residents would be able to see the initial explosion of re-entry, but only a silhouette after, if that, as they would be seeing the “dark side” of the disc, as I was seeing the lit up side where I was.  The residents in the Salmon, Idaho area would be farther away and possibly see the explosion and briefly a “falling star”, until it disappeared behind the mountains.  I feel that is why the craft comes in perpendicular to the earth’s surface.  Its visibility is limited to the people to the east, where it is most in view.  Just before the craft rotated level, it lost the suns rays and disappeared.  I suppose the area should be checked to see if there were any reports of sighting! s or such that night.  There were a few more people camped out in the area, but not close to us.  Most people would be in their camps or trailers that time of the evening. It was an extraordinary event that I witnessed, especially the detail that I saw it in.  I do plan on having a drawing made up after I post this.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,45.3123,-113.3593

I was on the tennis court, practicing my serve.  When I tossed the ball in the air I saw a flash almost directly above me. My first thought was that it was a plane but quickly realized that it wasn’t. The object appeared as a long rectangle, like a steel beam used to build sky scrapers. It’s hard to know the exact length but I would guess 25 to 35 feet.  It was shiny silver in color. When I first noticed the object it was around 1000 feet and by the time the object had descended to 200/300 feet it had moved much closer in my direction.  Then the object stopped moving and just hung there.  I began back stepping and briefly looked to the ground and by the time I looked up again to the object it had changed form to a machine looking object made of silver balls. I drew a diagram of the flight pattern from when I spotted the object and I drew two different angles of the object.  The drawings are drawn from the best of my memory and resemble the object very well.....but not exactly. I had binoculars in my car and was able to see the object up close. I did take 3 pictures with my close to useless camera on my cell phone.  The pictures don’t show the object very well. I was awe struck viewing through the binoculars and by the time I had thought of taking pictures the object had traveled a good distance from me.  There are other reasons why I couldn’t take pictures earlier but it doesn’t matter. It is what it is. You have to zoom in on the photos and the object will come into view.  This object was awesome yet very creepy and spooky. It shined like the shiniest chrome ever. It was completely quiet. There was a black mist or haze surrounding the object that was not highly visible. I’m guessing that the haze served as camouflage, blocking some of the shine from the object. Traveling speed was 10 to 15 mph. The object would move a few hundred feet to the north and stop for a few minutes. Then move west a few hundred feet then stop. Then north, then south and so on. Until it disappeared in the western sky. Total viewing time of sighting was 15 to 20 minutes.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,33.57603490701001,-112.19439241773964

We were just past Blythe, CA and I noticed several lights in the sky south of the Interstate.  The lights were very bright and at first I thought they were some type of flares because of the way they were illuminating. It looked as if a plane was dropping them but as I was looking at that set of lights I noticed a second set to the west of the first set that was in an inverted circular shape.  I would say there were about six or seven of them.  I didn’t notice if they were rotating or not as I was still driving and I only caught a glimpse of them, but they appeared to be still.  I don’t believe a plane could have dropped flares to make that kind of formation.  The first set of lights was very bright and white and orange in color.  The circular set of lights was a bright white and lasted about five to ten seconds and then disappeared. The other set ! of lights that looked as if they were flares appeared multiple times.  These were the first lights that I noticed because of the way they appeared but they didn’t really light up the sky and its surroundings like a flare would.  Don’t get me wrong, they were very bright and noticeable but I don’t believe they acted as if a flare would.  My wife grabbed the camera as quick as she could after I noticed the lights and she was able to start recording the lights.  I pulled over as soon as I could and she handed me the camera since I had a better view.  The spot that I pulled over was about two miles east of Copa Ditch which is just past exit 201.  We later pulled off there after the lights disappeared to see if we could see anything else, but we didn’t see the lights again from that point. After doing some research of the area using Google Maps today, I would put the lights between Interstate 10 and Brawley, CA just over the Chuckwalla Mountains Wilderness Area.   I talked to th! e California Highway Patrol Dispatch in Indio, CA today and th! ey didn’ t know of any reports in that area that night.  I also called the Dispatch Office in El Centro, CA and they also didn’t have any reports.  They were a little short with me though as if they weren’t going to tell me even if they did have reports.  The video that we took shows how the lights formed and then disappear but what was unique was the way they seemed to go in a downward circular motion as if it was following the ridge of a craft.  I didn’t notice any navigational lights as aircraft would usually have at all in the sky until several miles down the road which I could clearly make out as a plane.  After the lights disappeared and as we were heading to Exit 201 we noticed a Police car pulled over on the eastbound side of the Interstate with its lights on.  It had another car in front of it and it looked like an unmarked Police car.  The Officer appeared to be looking at the lights as well.  After we pulled off at Exit 201 and didn’t see anything more, we then continued d! riving west on Interstate 10.  As we came up to a sign with the name “Tex Wash” just like Copa Ditch I noticed three white lights in the sky between the ridges of the mountain.  I saw the three lights and then two of them disappeared leaving one light.  They looked to be in a triangular formation at first.  Just as quick as they appeared they disappeared.  I would say they lasted about three to five seconds.  While driving home from California on Sunday the 2nd of September I noticed several towers in the area these three lights were so I am not certain that they were extraterrestrial in nature or not.  I know this whole account seems a little odd but I have over twelve years in the service and I have never seen anything like this before.  This was a very strange sighting.  I kept referring to flares in the video but that was the only thing that I could compare it to.  I do not believe they were flares, though.  I hope someone else has a similar story or sighting, I know th! ere were a lot of people driving on that road at the same time! I was t hat night that must have seen this as well.

I then saw that there were 6 more of these lights, all making a constellation-like formation, including these two in the middle (Total of 8 lights).  The lights were reddish-orange, with their inner light source, being a type of energy that seemed fluid-like within (molten might fit as a better description).  They were moving west at approximately 40mph to 45mph.  The lights were approximately 300 or so feet from the ground and looked fairly close.  While I was observing them, they did not drop nor travel any higher than their constant altitude.  They appeared to be between the 202 and Germann Rd. area.   I took the off ramp at Alma School Rd. and headed south to Germann Rd. where I then headed west for two miles, to see where they had gone.  All the lights were gone, except for one.

Once as a kid I thought maybe I taken a picture of one, but the picture was in fact a bead of water on my camera lens. I say that because I have also seen the fireballs that were previously talked about on the 18, same characteristics and everything.  Where I live, to be vague, is about an hour and a half from where the other group saw the same UFO's. Heading from the West towards the East, the first fireball came from the corner of my eye and looked as if it were a plane on fire, I freaked out thinking a plane was going down but there was no sound. I questioned what I saw.  Like the other group I thought chinese fire lamp, but this was to high for the brightness, then the second appeared.  Same direction the second ball of light came, the thought of a plane still was going, maybe a plane in half but again no sound. I got online and researched 'red light over wisconsin'.

At Approx. 4:30PM on December 22nd 2012 just before sunset my friend and I spotted something very unusual forming in the sky. I spotted the object in the South South-Western sky over Roseland Golf Course in South Windsor, Ontario, Canada.  My friend was further northeast of my location between Tecumseh Rd. E and Seminole St. and saw the same contrail left behind.  When I observed it moving I could not see the actual object as it was behind the tree in our front yard and it was fairly far off in the distance. All I saw was the contrail it left immediately in its wake which started at a lower elevation and climbed to a much higher elevation.  As it climbed, it swayed from side to side slowing down every time the object curved as if it was some sort of rocket or plane that was completely out of control.  Then just as it started, the contrail stopped for no reason and the object making it was long gone only a few seconds later when I moved to a better vantage point away from the tree.  The entire event lasted about 15 seconds but the contrail lasted for a few minutes after the object creating it disappeared! and that is when I took a photo. The picture shows the path of the contrail and was taken less than a minute after the event occurred. As I said above, it appeared that the object came out of nowhere and started making a contrail in a zigzag fashion moving up in elevation then it suddenly stopped making the contrail and from my original vantage point I could not see an object moving away from the contrail after it stopped. I did not see the contrail when it first formed so perhaps it came from the cloud deck at the bottom, but I definitely saw the contrail all of the sudden stop way up in the air for no reason. The contrail left behind stood out over most of the city and was very easy to spot so there must be more witnesses Canadian and American. If most of the city saw this then it may have been as far away as the Detroit River at Grosse Ile or further into the United States which is where there is an airport so perhaps it came from there.

After taking this shot I saw the object flash off – it then disappeared from view) Total duration perhaps 10-15 seconds. Location: Elevation Café’s Deck on Scenic Drive, Waitakere City, Auckland New Zealand. I was meeting a land agent to view a few local sections and we had arranged to meet at Elevation Café’ on Scenic Drive in Auckland’s Waitakere City at 3.30pm. I arrived around 3.15pm and decided to have a coffee out on the deck which offered one of Auckland’s best views from high up on the Western ranges (Waitakere Ranges) looking back over West Auckland in an Easterly direction to Auckland city. The day was bright and sunny though I’d noticed that today Auckland (unusually) had a haze over it. I had just taken a couple of pictures of the surrounds and was enjoying my coffee when I felt compelled to look skywards, I noticed an airborne object which was a darkish saucer shape and it was hovering a couple of Km’s off into the distance, (The distance is relatively hard to judge) though given that it was appearing past the line formed by the ranges means the object was quite large and must have also been quite a considerable distance away from my vantage point. To my naked eye the object was relatively small and had a darker bottom section and shinier (?Metallic) top portion. I’d characterise the object as being a “large bug size” from where I was standing and it appeared in the sky at about the height of a low flying aeroplane. There it sat wobbling and occasionally glinting light (which I assumed was a reflection from the sun) this was only for a very short while in the sky over the Henderson Valley. (I’m not certain about the exact point over which it was hovering)  I couldn’t identify what the object was though knew it was something of interest that I hadn’t seen before so quickly grabbed my camera and took a shot. I lowered my camera and managed to see the object for a brief moment, it appeared to have vapours beneath it. It then ”flashed” and disappeared off to the left vertically on an angle perhaps 65-70 Degrees. After this it was completely gone from sight. There were no other objects in the sky at the same time as this sighting. Looking at the picture through my camera’s small rear screen the object didn’t look all that impressive so I waited till I got home and connected my camera to my HDTV. Two other patrons (a couple) were dining though they didn’t see the object and it being a matter of only a couple of seconds before it left after taking the photo I didn’t have time to alert them before it disappeared. It all happening so quickly and me not being certain of what had just happened I thought it wise not to appear like someone delusional in front of two complete strangers.   I have spent days trying to debunk this sighting myself, …. Perhaps it’s a blimp… perhaps a large cicada with wings on the downbeat…though it is too far off to be a cicada or any type of bird. The object was metallic and saucer shaped, it also disappeared in a flash!!  As a trained scientist I always use a methodical and analytical approach to problem solving, this time I have come up with no good answer as to what it is I witnessed over West Auckland- perhaps then this constitutes a UFO?",2012-05-13T00:00:00,,

I wish I reported this sooner, but I didn't wanna make a big deal out of it considering no one would believe me even if I told them. The date was Monday, March 12th, 2012 around 7:45 P.M. to 7:50 P.M.. The sun had set and it was dark out, but not quite pitch black. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and you could see the stars and the moon easily. It was one of the nicer evenings. I was driving down Robinson Canyon in Ellensburg, Washington, on my way back from my step sister's house headed home to my house about 3 miles from where I was. I was listening to the radio at the time, and remember checking my watch at around 7:45 P.M. to make sure I would be home by 8:00 P.M., when my mother wanted me home. I looked up from the watch, and looked up into the distance. There were 3 bright, white/yellow lights in a triangle formation above and to the left of the long, straight road I was driving on. It looked as if it was traveling towards me. I continued to drive a little further. As I approached the aircraft, I looked around and there were no other cars on the road, so I stopped my car, turned off the radio and got out of the vehicle to see if I could hear any noise from the aircraft, there was literally no noise at all.  No sound of a propeller, no sound of a jet engine..nothing.  The night was completely silent.  The only thing I heard was the noise from my car engine (which isn’t very loud anyway), and I figured that if it was something with an engine, I would be able to hear it over my car’s engine considering how low it was.  Judging from my experiences flying through the valley, it was probably at about 3,000, 3,500 feet AGL.  It was moving so slow that I could only tell that it was moving from references on the ground, but it was not hovering. I stood there on the road next to my car watching it for about 4 or 5 minutes, until it was directly under where I was stopped on the road. I looked up at it and could barely make out the shape of the aircraft. It was in a triangle shape. There was one red, flashing light underneath and in the center the aircraft, and 3 white/yellow lights on each tip. The white/yellow lights were not flashing. I sat there for another 2-3 minutes watching it, when a car started approaching me from the distance on the road. I decided to leave. I thought maybe it was just an aircraft from the local military base, doing a test flight of some sort, so I decided to not to think much of it.  I got back in the car and drove off, about thirty seconds after I started driving, I looked back in my rear view mirror to see if I could see it, and it wasn’t there.  I looked behind me, it was gone.  I stuck my head out the window to see if it was behind my car, and not in my line of sight, I still couldn’t see! anything. The night sky was completely clear. It literally had disappeared.  The lights were gone, (I thought maybe the operators turned off the lights because they knew I was watching or something) and I could not even see the shape of the aircraft anymore, I couldn’t see the aircraft at all.  I do not know what this thing was.  I assumed it came from the Yakima Training Center, most likely a test aircraft of some sort.  But I, being the believer that I am, strongly believe that it was something “not from this world”.  That night when I got home, I told my siblings and mom what I had saw.  Of course they didn’t believe me. I decided to just keep it to myself. Also, at the time the thought never occurred to me to take a picture.  After I got home that night, I deeply regretted that I didn't.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,46.979,-120.4703

On Saturday, September 29th, 2012, my wife and I went to her parents’ house in West Bloomfield, Michigan to work on replacing their rotted front steps.  After working all day, and nearing sunset, it was discovered that we were lacking a few supplies so my wife volunteered to run to the local big box store while my father-in-law and I stayed back to keep working.  My wife pulled out of the driveway sometime between 7:00 to 7:30 PM EST.  The day was a perfect autumn day: crisp temperatures, beautiful sunny skies with large fluffy clouds and as the evening progressed the clouds appeared ominously dark in contrast to the gorgeous sunset. It was still light enough to see, but the sun was definitely starting to set.  I happened to step back from working for a second to stretch my back and as I looked up above my head there was a large circular object.  The object appeared to be a bright orange sphere that looked almost like it was on fire.  It pulsated slightly and appeared to have energy waves around it.  At times there were even hints of yellowish-orange around the edges, and it almost seemed to faintly change shape.  At this point my Father-in-law was working with me.  My Mother-in-law and Brother-in-law had just come out of the house to see the progress on the steps.  Upon spotting the object I immediately alerted everyone.  They turned to see the object and the same question seemed to echo between us all, ""What the hell is that?""  The ""Burning"" sphere was like a glowing orange ember from a bonfire, intensely bright and beautiful.  It seemed to be flying high in the sky, but then strangely it passed under the clouds which seemed to be somewhere around Cessna altitude range (5000 to 9000 ft.).  The object also appeared to be traveling fairly fast (about as fast as a military jet), and made absolutely no sound what-so-ever. My Brother-in-law made some comment that it was probably just one of those floating Chinese lanterns that had finally caught on fire, but as I said to him, ""There wasn’t a visible fire, it was just glowing an intense orange color, and Chinese lanterns don’t fly that fast!""   I watched the object for about 10 minutes until it appeared to disappear.  We all talked about the sighting later trying to come up with what it possibly could be and agreed that   Whatever it was, it was definitely glowing like an ember, it was not just a reflection from the sun; and it was moving very fast and without a sound.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,42.56757908163265,-83.38085408163265

My location was on Queen Anne, near Fremont Bridge facing east over Lake Union, Lake Washington and the Cascades.  Clear night, moon was approx 20deg up from horizon (google sky map ""time travel"" feature could give more accurate detail).  Was about to mount my motorcycle, stopped, took helmet off and stood in driveway.  First sighting was a fairly bright orange/somewhat red light passing visually just below the moon heading south.  I tried to rationalize the sight, looking for a 'tail' of a comet, asteroid, blinking strobes of an airplane.  Nothing made sense, no modulation of light, no strobes, no other color lights and it was nearly as bright and big as the red 'strobes' on the I5 bridge.  Speed was about a palm width every two seconds.. also strangely fast.  As soon as the light had traveled about 4 palm widths at arms length across the sky, another showed up on the same exact path, same speed, same brightness.  My view of where the lights had o! riginated from was obscured by a large apartment building across the street.   The original light continued on its path, followed by the other, quite a distance (maybe another four or five palm widths).  By this time, with the exact same spacing and speed, another light had appeared just left and below the moon.  There were three visible at this moment.   The original light became dim, flickered and within a palm width distance was gone.  I made a couple of phone calls, of which my neighbor answered and was walking down Dexter Ave and into the driveway at that moment.  He and I watched a remaining four or five, as a total of 8 lights traveled the same path, the same speed and with the same exact spacing across the sky, flickering and disappearing at the same exactly spot in the sky (except the last one).  The last light made a path, arcing visually 'higher' than the others and flickered out at the same timing/distance as the others.   I wish I could have seen it from my bal! cony, as I'm sure by the intensity of light, and how mathemati! cally sp aced and accurate they appeared, they would have created a chain of lights throughout the horizon.  I work in IT as a programmer, have been a military aircraft enthusiast since a very early age, and for whatever reason didn't think to use my phone for video.  To note:  There were other aircraft in the sky throughout the sighting, commercial airliners and a small prop plane.  I could hear the prop plane clearly, but nothing else out of the ordinary.  Every airplane in the sky had distinct red/green/white strobes, and were of 'normal' speed.  The flight path of commercial airliners normally fly west towards my apartment, then bank close enough that in most cases I can make out the branding/logo on the planes (in daylight).  After this sighting, throughout the night all of the commercial airliners were making their turns towards seatac much further away (east) than usual.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

However let me start by saying  the original object I observed has been in the sky for months. I first spotted it in March, looks like a bright star, only its strobing and blinking different colors. I grabbed my friends cheap telescope,  got it in view, and once the object was in focus, I was shocked to see it was 4 lights in a straight line, evenly spaced(also nothing was flashing, as appose to out of focus). I was very surprised and exited, as I’m very into this type of thing, and always wanted to personally witness something. This got me very interested in this “star” , and anytime I’d be outside at night I’d look for it. As said, I’ve observed it for months now parked in the same spot moving across the sky with the rest of the stars, like nothing irregular(other than the strobing lights) and was there the whole time until yesterday.  Sorry for the little pre -story but I felt it was necessary  	So last night around 8:15 I started walking to my buddy’s house to hang out, and as always when I’m walking, I look for my star. I take a look at it in the gaps between trees and houses.  As I’m nearing my friends house I see there’s now 2 of the strobing stars next to each other.  This other one hasn’t been there any other time I look. As I get to another gap where I can see the objects again, I notice they are now spaced farther apart. I’m all worked up now, and go sprinting to my friends house, I really didn’t want to be the only one to see this.  My friend wasn’t home right then so I grabbed his neighbor to come out.  Now there were three of these lights, flashing and pulsating an orangish reddish glow, all in a misshapen triangle form, with another one of the lights drifting up from the horizon to join the other three.  Then there was a smaller triangular formation that looked almost identical in formation just smaller, slowly drift up from the horizon.  At this point it was! me, my friends neighbor, and his wife and daughter. 	Just then  my friend pulled in his house, and my other friend who lives up the street came down, and then we had my 2 friends, and my friends mom and sister come look. At this point is when the objects started slowly dissipating. The lower, smaller triangle formation all dimmed slowly until they were gone, then what was left was the larger triangle formation. However now they were equidistant from each other, in a symmetrical  triangle until they all slowly dimmed out. What I thought was interesting, was the fact that atleast the one light, I’ve observed for months, and the fact that last night I just watched this happen and now that light is gone, it‘s truly an awesome experience. A few details I forgot to put in, was that it was quite cloudy, and no stars we’re visible, these were the only visible lights in the sky. And the movement of the objects was all very slow, they slowly came up and they slowly disappeared. Hoping that others have seen this, maybe even got video, I! know my friends mom and nieghbor got a few pictures  towards the end of it all, but a video would really be nice.

This time we could see the first formation slow down and speed up, while the second formation mimicked the first group as if it was avoiding crashing into it.  This slowing down and speeding up happened at least five times as the flight of these two formations seemed to take approximately five minutes.  These two formations then disappeared into the cloud cover as did the first solo object.  My best friend then left our location at 21:30 and he went home.

I noticed the usual stars that I see every time I walk the dogs along with the moon but tonight I noticed a very bright round light in the sky near the moon along with two dimmer round lights.  All three formed what looked like a triangle formation.  Now what caught my eye was the bigger/brighter light started flickering or pulsing, then the light darkened and I could no longer see it.   After this happened I noticed the smaller one on the left started moving away and eventually went out of view.  The third dim light at that point to me just looked like a distant star that never went away. Now take note that as this was going on I noticed the normal jets flying high in the sky and these lights appeared to me to be higher than the jets.  Being the type of person who likes to find an explanation for everything I checked to see where the space station was currently located and it was flying over the south pole at the time of the sighting.

It wasn't till early October that I saw them getting waaaay closer (orange fireball-esk balls flying around, flickering on and off, etc.) to the point where they appear at tree top level.   I have yet to see the crafts themselves but these lights are typically orange but change to a deep red and also light up to a blinding white. Another thing I've noticed is that you'll see 1 of the lights sitting there and then another one will appear out of nowhere, fly towards the other light and combine with it.  Also, I've seen every once in a while you'll see one of the main lights(I say main light because it's lit up from sunset till when I wake up in the morning) move a little bit and all of these different lights will suddenly light up around the main light and be several different colors(red, white, and orange, all shimmering) and in the blink of an eye will just disappear.

I'm writing of an experience on the eastern plains of Colorado about 4:45 this morning.  Still very dark and I had been driving for about a half hour, taking over for Don, my partner, who was asleep in the passenger seat.  The land is flat and I can see for miles ahead and behind as I drive on I-70 near Limon.  I come up behind an 18-wheeler truck still several car lengths ahead of me.  I look in the rear view mirror just to make sure there are no other cars coming as I prepared to pass the truck, (almost as an after thought because there have been no other cars for miles).   Wow!  There must be a huge truck behind me all of a sudden. The two headlights are higher and wider apart than even most big trucks and very close to my car, as if they are sitting on my trunk.  And there are no other lights lining the cab or decorating the doors or bumpers like most big rigs.  No noise. It was there so suddenly. I thought, ""Well, he certainly wants to get around both me and the truck ahead of me, so I'll just let him pass,""  but he didn't.  So, I get in the left hand lane and so do the two big lights behind me, simultaneously with my movement, keeping the same distance.   I pass the truck in front, move over to the right to let Mr. Big Lights by and there is nothing except the truck I passed and me for miles. No exits, nothing stopped on the side.  The lights just disappeared as they were behind me in the left lane.  I kept blinking my eyes, looking in the rear view mirror...nothing.

Start of night shift.  Sun had just set.

I continued observing, at first thinking it was a helicopter, however after some time I ruled out that as a possibility when the movement and character of the flashes became bizarre. The lights would jolt horizontally from one position to the next with an astounding speed.  All the while the lights would gain and loose intensity.  The flash pattern also changed frequently and had no regularity that is often associated with normal aircraft. The next sequence of events are what I feel sets this sighting into the category of a UFO.  The lights faded out completely and re-appeared a good deal of distance away instantaneously.  The intensity of the lights grew almost 10 fold.  The lights then split into two separate formations going from a bright white to incandescent red/orange gradually increasing and decreasing in intensity at about .5 cycles per second .  The two formations traveled away from each other horizontally to a point then began moving in the same direction.

I have recently purchased a new camera and was on my deck taking pictures of the blue moon.  I was experimenting with different settings and using a remote control.  I must have taken 500 plus pictures that night. Around 2300 I decided to call it a night and come inside.  It was starting to get cloudy and they were calling for rain. I got out my laptop and started taking a look at some of the pictures.  I was deleting the ones that were blurry or too dark or too small. I ran across a sequence of pictures that had the moon with an object that was producing a contrail. I thought I got a picture of an airplane or something.  I did not recall seeing a plane in the sky that night and the Nashville airport was landing planes from the north.  The object I captured in the photos appeared to be traveling west to east although it is hard to say. The moon was in the south eastern sky that night.  I know the report states a! period of 10 seconds. That is because I did not see it but that is the time stamps on the pictures.  In most of the pictures you can see the contrail and when you enlarge the object it is a long cigar shape object.  I have had several friends look at it and no one seems to know what it might be.,2012-09-24T00:00:00,35.7174,-86.8926

I considered if they were airplanes, but no blinking lights. The lights were, in fact, very different from airplane lights. First of all, they were much larger and they had a yellow light around the red light that made them appear rather “cartoon-ish” to me. I was shocked at how obvious these lights were and thought that anyone outside at the time couldn’t miss them. Soon after I started watching the lights, one of them ventured off in another direction away from the others and disappeared.  I stood in my yard and continued to watch the other 2.

It had no flashing lights but illuminated greens and blues for a while before it changed and included reds. It danced around the sky, with no direction, going fast at some points and slow with others.  The strangest of the movement was when it changed direction; there seemed to be no lag time for it to swhich- it was one fluid motion that went against the laws of physics.

My friend and I were driving from Mesa, AZ back to Tempe, AZ.  My buddy (who is driving, I am in the front seat) randomly notices some strange lights in the sky on the left side in relation to where the car was.  When I turned to look what I saw at first was two red blinking lights; one was higher than the other and on a slant from the other as well.  We kept driving for a minute and observing the lights.  Then we start to notice that at first the lights were moving right, and now all of a sudden they were moving left.  At first we thought we were just seeing things, but then at this point the lights were actually close enough to perfectly determine that the object was traveling LEFT RIGHT UP and DOWN.  We are still driving, and this is only about 2 minutes into the sighting (or at least when my friend first realized it)...and now another GREEN light is being omitted.  The green light was only on very briefly as the other two red lights continued to blink.  ! Now my friend and I were 100 percent convinced and immediately pulled the car over to attempt a shot at getting a better video.  Now we are about 10 minutes into the sighting.  When we observed the two blinking red lights from the sidewalk of the street it was clearly evident that the object was moving in all directions as if it was hovering or was in-decisive of where it wanted to go.  This is where my mind was completely blown...there was now a BLUE light as well, which only appeared for a short time just like the green light did earlier.  The two red lights constantly blink'd and seemed to fly in sync with one another although as I mentioned earlier, one was higher and on a slant from the other.  Another note that I'd like to make is that when the other colored lights such as the GREEN and BLUE appeared for their brief moment, a WHITE light was also somewhat evident but not as radiant as the colored lights.  Unfortunately our best video was actually taken in the car whil! e driving, as the lights moved further and further away.  It w! as weird When we were driving it seemed like they were so close to us, and like I said earlier, after little observation...we were like ""that fucking thing is hovering.  It keeps flying right, then left.""  Once we decided to pull over, the lights just got further and further.  We attempted to hop back in the car and chase it for a few minutes until we realized it was a hopeless cause.  Both my friend and I felt though that when it did begin to start moving away quickly, it would make incredible travel time between the blinks of the two red lights.  My friend has the video on his phone.  I'll upload it to youtube as UFO sighting in AZ when I get a chance, or when he does.  Hope you enjoyed what we saw and my description. I have to say I've seem some questionable lights in the sky before such as weird blinking white lights, but never anything like what we saw today.

I made a joke also, and then we agreed that we wouldn’t make any more jokes, and that if we really ever see one, we would be able to know if the other was truthful or not?

As they moved over the marina and out over the lake they spread out a little and each one moved staight up through the thin cloud layer and disappeared out of sight.

In my original submission to UK UFO sightings I put the 29/9/2012 but as it was 12:30am it was actually the 30/9/2012. My apologies but the story is still the same. Our house is located on the top of a hill in a residential area and our garden faces northeast London.   At about or around 12:30am my son was outside having a cigarette when he came rushing into the house demanding that my wife and myself come outside and see these lights in the sky.  My wife got up went I reluctantly took my time.  Apparently my wife along with my son witnessed dots in the horizon of the night sky that appeared to be multiple orangey-red dots in an imperfect triangle like shape.  By the time I got to see where they were pointing; just above the roof tops between a gap in the distant houses the shape had changed formation.   However the dots where still there spread out horizontally in a cluster that spanned across the rooftops of about four(4) or five(5) houses.  Some of dots momentarily disappeared then reappeared as they moved eastward across the sky. Just before the first cluster disappeared altogether another formation was moving up in the background travell! ing in the same direction.  Just as we've all in life joked about an alien invasion we found ourselves making the same jokes.  However the formation looked impressive and purposeful. These specs of light did as I’ve read in other articles of other alleged sighting raise the apprehension of an alien armada travelling through the night sky. (I can\'t believe I\'m actually saying that but its the only rational thought that sprang to mind when we witnessed it) Astonished by what we were seeing. I ran in the house and went to the first floor window which overlooks the garden to see if I could see things any better and I could. I called out to my son in the garden through the window to come and take a look from my vantage point, he did. Shortly afterward my wife came to calling for our late teenage daughter to join us which she also did. From the window we all witnessed the cluster or orangey-red specs bobbing up and down slightly moving across the night sky in an eastward directi! on.  An estimation of the first cluster of specs of light we s! aw was a bout twenty(20)  The second lot we saw was about  30-40. The following link shows a couple of images that is almost an exact duplicate of what we witnessed. If you look at the first image and consider it as attached to the second image that\'s what we all saw and watched for about two(2) - three(3) minutes. The biggest mistake was mine by announcing that I  was going to jump in the car and head in the direction of he lights to try and get a better look. Everyone announced that they wanted to come too. Unfortunately as I stated we live on a hill and everywhere we went to try and see was below our house lever so we couldn't see up in the nights sky distance. By the time we did find a high vantage point there was nothing to be seen. We returned home and it was the same thing everything had gone. My son did try to video it on his iphone 4s but the specs were so small in the distant night sky it could not pick them up as the glare from the street lights at rooftop level obscured t! he specs. He deleted the video. Now I know everyone\'s first sceptical opinion going to be \'Chinese lanterns\' but in order for a Chinese lantern to be seen as a spec the size of the first image some 2-3 miles away with the naked eye it would have to be at least the size if not greater than an hot air balloon on fire not a candle.  This is my honest account of what we saw on the night of the 29/09/2012 at about 12:30am make of it what you will but the story remains the same...we saw what we all saw. The image of multiple specs of orangey-red lights travelling eastward across the night sky before shortly disappearing with another cluster coming up behind them travelling in the same direction. And it looked exactly like the link images if you joined the first image with the second as a single photo. I\'m not asking anyone to believe me but I just wanted to say what we saw.

Sept. 29, 2012 when we notice a number of people in the parking lot looking up at the night sky and some were apparently attempting to video what the saw on their phone cameras.  When I looked up with my son, I could see about 6 small (although apparently distant) light orange (color of a lighter flame maybe slightly darker) colored round or sperical objects at an attitude of about 10-11 o'clock looking West to East.  As there were Royal palm trees in the parking lot as well as light inh my vision was a time obstructed although I could hear other people saying the saw as many as eight or more lights.  Personally,  I only could see at most six lights at one point and at times as few as only two as the others were obstructed by palms, etc.  They did not move together in any sort of pattern but appeared rather to move in all different seemingly random directions! ...sometimes fast and at other times slow...sometimes closer together and at other times moving away from each other.  Saw a group of two at one point move off together but then split in radically different directions.  Considered maybe they could be jet afterburners at first (seen at a distance) but the irratic movement, time of night, and the more orange color just didn't seem to fit.  Objects appeared small but distant so I do not believe any accurate estimate of actual size can be given. As to speed...well that would depend on size and distance which I could not attempt to estimate but I would guess it was faster than a one engine plane at all times.  As our viewing locating was less than one mile from the Atlantic Ocean coast, the objects could have been traveling immediately above the coastline, in general. Due to the late hour, my son and I left the scene and when into Appleby's Restaurant so we did not spend more than five minutes viewing the event.  As far as I know! , the event continued as the objects were not moving in any on! e direct ion at any constant speed...other spectators continued to watch.  Did not see anything in the news or in response to internet search, so I decided to post and see if it would act as a catalyst for other people to report the event.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,26.455547430830038,-80.11589308300395

Two friends and I were using a small boat to cross the sound between Emerald Island and the mainland to camp on a small island over night. We set out right near sunset, and arrived on the island right as it was getting dark. We were located on the unnamed island just north east of Lovett Island on the southernmost shore. We started to set up camp in a hurry, as it was getting dark fast. As we were setting up the tent, my two friends started to look up at the sky and told me to do so. Over the main land, what seemed to be quite some distance away, was a glowing red orb slowly moving through the sky. It looked as if it was passing the auxiliary landing field for the local military base from the North, heading northeast. It looked as if it may have been traveling at the same speed as a helicopter, but we could hear no noise. It continued moving down the inland shore until we could no longer see it in the distance. We discussed what it may have been, but could not come to a conclusion. We haven’t seen anything like it before. A few hours later is when an even more astounding sighting occurred after we set up camp and settled in. About two hours after settling in we ingested 25i-nbome, a legal hallucinogen. I know this might diminish the credibility of my witness for the following sighting, but I wish to report it either way. Might I also add that I could tell a difference between what was real and what was a hallucination. We were now sitting on a blanket looking at the stars facing south, southeast. One of my friends was in the tent having an argument on the phone. My friend again, with a surprised voice told me to look up. We both saw the same thing. There were three glowing red orbs, just like the one from earlier, heading in the same direction, this time over Emerald Island. Again, they were heading northeast towards Morehead city. From our perspective they were in the shape of a triangle with one UFO in front and the other two following. They kept this formation for around 40 seconds before the lead UFO broke off ahead of the others. Its glow began to dim before finally disappearing.  The other two were still bright and slowly moving down the coast. One orb seemed to drop three smaller colored orbs out of its bottom which fell quickly to the ground. This detail, however, I am unsure of because of its similarity to a hallucination. The three UFOs were very clear however.Suddenly a fourth red orb appeared coming from the ground (or ocean on the other side of the island). It rose in an arc shape before reaching the altitude of the other two. They moved in small increments with the trailing craft mimicking the same movement from behind as if it were being tugged by the leading two craft.  They moved down the coast like this as well before fading out of sight. Again the only detail that I believe may have been a hallucination was the orbs falling from one of the UFOs to the ground. Our third friend did not witness! this sighting because he refused to leave the tent. After this, the night was relatively calm with no more activity.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,34.7766,-76.8867

FIRST ENCOUNTER: During the night before Christmas Eve - December 2012, I was driving down Branders Bridge Road and came to a stop at the Lakeview Avenue intersection.  I distinctly remember looking at the time on my cellular phone about five minutes earlier and it was 12:21 AM.  While approaching the stop sign, I spotted three large triangular objects hovering over the field of trees at the northwest corner of the intersection.  The three bright red glowing triangles were huge in size and were hovering very low to the tree lines.  It seemed as if I could literally reach out and grab them.  I then noticed the three objects begin moving at a steady buy slow pace north on Branders Bridge Road toward Swift Creek. Amazed at the whole situation, I began following the objects in my car down Branders Bridge Road.  As I am traveling northward up the road, the red triangular objects disappeared in and outside of the tree lines.  This section of Branders Bridge is curvy and heavily wooded.  As I approached the Swift Creek Bridge, I saw the red flying triangles hovering above Swift Creek and then ""In a Blink of an Eye"" they disappeared faster than light.  Puzzled, I drove further north up Branders Bridge Road and later cruised through the Sherwood Hills neighborhood in hopes of locating the red flying objects again.  To no avail, I did not locate these strange flying objects again.  I live a mere five minutes from the initial sighting location and the whole incident, including the long cruise, might account for 30 minutes tops; however, it was exactly 2:22 AM upon pulling into my driveway!   SECOND ENCOUNTER: About two weeks ago, I was driving down Branders Bridge Road in the late hours around 2:30 AM.  There is a railroad track on Branders Bridge Road.  As usual, I always come to a complete stop before crossing any RR tracks.  When s! topping at the railroad crossing that night I saw the SAME thr! ee brigh t lava red triangular objects hovering yet very gradually moving north toward Chester.  The three triangular objects were hovering at a higher level above the trees (wooded area).  I quickly noticed another car on the opposite side of the tracks at an intersection just a quarter mile up.  The driver was obviously witnessing the same phenomena as me.  I drove toward the car and as I got closer they quickly took off toward Colonial Heights on the opposite side of the RR tracks and then stopped again.  All I wanted to do was roll my window down and ask them to confirm what I was witnessing.  I then noticed that the red triangular objects disappeared.  A bad feeling came over me and I immediately drove home and spent hours trying to rationalize the events; which had taken place.  I never notified 911 dispatch in fear of being laughed at and not taken seriously.

My husband asked if I thought it had stopped and for about 2 seconds it seemed to be stationery. Then it suddenly developed a large red halo around it.  The fireball was no longer visible just the halo. It moved directly back from the way it came (from north to south and back toward us).  As it moved at a very fast pace the halo seemed to change in color from the bright red it started as to an orangish tint and then to a cream color.  It moved in a matter of less than 10 seconds from the north to our southern horizon with the halo growing large as it moved closer.

I was in a second floor condo on the North end of Myrtle Beach, SC that is oceanfront on a beach that faces to the SE.  I was starting to doze but I awoke at about 9:20 pm because my ears were ringing loudly.  I had an urge to go outside on the balcony and look at the sky.  The water was calm like glass and it was eerily quiet. It was a clear, dark night with Jupiter and stars of Orion’s belt shining brightly to the E.  (Sirius had not yet risen and moonrise was after midnight.)  So I called my friend, B out to see them.  We both saw a sudden flash of bright pinkish-red, dime-size round light SE at about 2 finger widths above and closer than the horizon over the ocean.  The center was the darker pink-red and the perimeter was a red-orange.  I am guessing it was closer than a mile as the visibility was 10 miles at the time.   It blinked out then flashed on and off again.  She kept asking, ""What is that?"" and I grabbed her arm.  In about 30 seconds it flashed on from a greater distance for about 3 seconds.  Then it blinked off for a second.  Then further away there was another red light that separated into two side by side lights about one finger width apart, then rejoined as one (or one was in front of the other).   Then I saw another one higher and more towards the SSE.  (At some point my friend went inside for a few seconds to get a coat.  Unfortunately we did not have our cameras at the ready.)  A larger/closer red flash to the SSE stayed on a little longer so I could see a grayish area with the red light in its center, with all outlined in a blackish ring.  One of the red lights traveled SE to ESE parallel to the shoreline.  Then we started seeing small pinpoints of white light (10 or more of them) between that one (to our left) and the others and a little higher altitude.  They blinked on and off but the light from some of them was so bright that we could feel it on our eyes (like tiny flashbulbs).  Some seemed to be getting closer to us.  Some turned red but stayed small.  Two more flashes of red light appeared and rotated or orbited around each other.  Then two small red lights flashed briefly and at differing spacing from each other (as two separate objects).  They stayed lit, rose and headed off to the SSW.  We went out the front door but the height and lighting of the other buildings prevented us from seeing them.  We saw no more of these lights but saw the white, red and green blinking lights of an approaching small plane.  The plane was coming up the beach offshore probably having taken off from the airport at the south end of Myrtle Beach.  We could hear the faint sounds from the plane.  Otherwise, we heard NO sounds other than the gentle wave sound.  At 9:45 pm we came inside and each independently wrote down what we had just experienced.

We watched for about 15! minutes, nothing else was happening but these balls were still in the sky.  We left, they were still present. It's difficult to say how large or how far away they were, probably 1 to 2 miles away and larger than a hot air balloon.

On the 8th around 10:45PM my husband and I were carrying in groceries into his parents home, as we walked back outside to get another arm load to carry in we saw a bright blue flash in the sky, it looked like a police light it lasted only a few seconds.  It was in the south east sky over the tree tops in my in-laws yard around where the sun rises in the morning. Also I have been seeing different lights several times since then. On the 12th my husband and our daughter were driving home from my parents house around 10:30PM EST on Rt. 60, and the car just stopped and engine died.  We couldn't figure out what was going on about 15 seconds later we saw 7 bright lights move across the sky in a V formation, my husband estimated that it was about 1000 feet above us it moved from the north west to the south east and it took about 2 minutes for it to pass over head.  As soon as the lights were gone are car started right up with no problem. The 13th I was walking to my car after work around 4:30PM and I saw something shiny in the sky, I thought it was just an air plane or something like that but there was no noise.  I looked at it again and realized it wasn't moving, it was hovering there for a good 30-40 seconds and then it was gone. The 17th I was loading up my car at Wal-Mart in Fayetteville around 10:00PM and I glanced up and it was really really cloudy out and I saw a bright light in the sky that was changing colors from blue, to white, green and red and some purples.  There were some other people around me that noticed it as well and were just watching it, which is another thing that caught my attention. After I finished loading up my car I sat in my car and watched it for about 5 minutes then it was just vanished. Tonight 11/19/12 around 7:00PM I was walking back to my house after a Thirty One party at my neighbor's house with my neighbor's daughter who is babysitting for me tonight while I go Christmas shopping tonight and saw the 7 reddish orange lights again.

I couldn’t immediately see the source of the light because the frequency of the blinking was not regular.  Two to three seconds passed and then it blinked again.  The object had moved above 6-8 inches (measured from my extended arm).  The intensity and size of the light was about equal to the average star.  A few seconds later it blinked again, moving about the same distance, and in a straight line moving towards the North East.  This time the intensity of the light was greater, about equal to the light of Venus, which also gave the impression that it was larger or moving downward.  A few more seconds passed and the light blinked again, much fainter (fainter than the first blink), and the object had moved in a Northern direction (up from its previous direction), and the distance was about 2-3 inches (measured from my extended arm).  I followed that! trajectory, anticipating the next blink.  As I scanned the area about 5 seconds later, I saw a faint streak of light moving from the last location of the object (approximately) and moving in an Easterly direction (slightly south of east).  I scanned the sky for several more minutes but saw nothing else.  The length of the entire incident was approximately 30 seconds.  And the object was located approximately 65 - 75 degrees above the horizon, as I was looking toward the North.  There was no sound.  There were no obstructions in my field of vision.

Traveling east bound on Hwy. 65 looking due south at appx. 20:15 hrs just passing Sunset Blvd. Still looking south just behind William Jessup College observed two single lighted aircraft rising from horizon level into the night sky to an altitude of appx. 100 to 150 feet. Both aircraft seperated in formation to begin areial manouvers of independent origin.  At first these manouvers seemed to be something that could only be achieved by a smaller remote control aircraft, tight and close quarter turns, loops and various synchronized aerobatics. As I was traveling at a rate of sixty-five miles an hour, I had to concentrate on driving while still trying to observe the aircrafts. Leaving the boundries of Rocklin and heading east towards Lincoln, I turned right onto Sterling Parkway and made the first right into a stripmall parking lot with a fairly unobstructed view to the southeast where I could observe the crafts. I watched as the aircraft which only appeared as ! a single color of white then turning to red was joined by a third craft now engaging ib the same acrobatic flight patterns as the other two.  Other observerers pulled into the stripmall parking areas but observed from different vantage points.  Another vehichle pulled up by my car and we observed the air-ballet together. We both noted that crafts each only had a single light that changed colors at intermitten intervals. ( Which were compared to other aircraft  that would randomly pass overhead  with traditional blinking red and white lights found on todays aircraft. We noted we did not know of anytype of aircraft that could make those sort of manouvers short of an Apache or AH-6 Littlebird yet even though they were at a guesstimated five miles or further away, no sounds were heard. After twenty minutes observing the crafts, they dropped below the horizon not to be seen again. After waiting a short period to see if they would return, they did not and the woman and her daughter! said they were returning to their home in Paradise to watch t! he late news to see of any reportings as I said I would also do.

Between noon and 2:00 p.m. on March 17, 2012, I went outside to get something from my son's car and noticed smoke that seemed to be streaming from a bush in the front yard on the East Side of the house that is directly across the street from my house.  There are two bushes in the front yard of the house.  One on the East side.  One on the West Side.  The entire yard is surrounded by a fence. The smoke traveled four to five feet from the bush to the rear of an SUV which is about eight feet from the fence that surrounds the house and the bush.  First I thought the bush was on fire but I didn't smell smoke, so I just felt some mischevous guys were hiding behind the bush smoking, or trying to break in the house. I walked across the street to the bush but no one was there, just smoke, with no smell, which was strange.  The bush was opened and the stems seemed old.  Because I had never seen them open like that in the fourteen years I lived here, which was also strange, I hurredly walked back to my house and stood on the steps and remained there because I was a little puzzled by all this. The smoke disappeared. Suddenly a lot of little flies or knats like the ones that gather in the middle of air appeared over the bush that the smoke seemed to be coming out the bottom.  Then a cylinder looking thing, not of this world appeared from no where on top of the bush and started spinning at a high rate of speed.  It was the color of a rainbow, translucent, with no top, or bottom (hollow inside).  It was the size of the middle of a wooden wine barrell. After the translucent, bubble like, bubble colored, rainbow colored cylinder hovered and spun over the bush about a minute or two, smoke started coming out of the center of the cylinder, seemingly from the middle of the bush. Strangely, the birds and pheasants eating grass seeds in the lot adjacent to the house appeared unscathed and did not fly away.  The bush did not burn, the smoke did not smell like smoke, or fire. Next, several of the little flies appeared on top of the bush on the West side of the house.  The cylinder started to sail to the bush on the West. The knats were still flying over the bush on the East where the cylinder was at first, but half of them seemed to be gone.  When the cylinder reached the bush on the West side of the house it hovered on top, still spinning at an out of this world speed.  Smoke came out of the middle of that bush which was not smoking at first, and did not burn.  It hovered there a couple minutes (the cylinder like thing).  Next the cylinder floated up, spinning all the time, to about the height of the light post in front of the house.  Smoke then flowed from the bush on the West, through the center of the cylinder.  In an instant, the bubble thing disappeared.  Next the smoke dissipated. My girlfriend called about this time.  I told her what I saw.  She asked if it was on my property.   I said no.  She asked if I looked down in the bushes.  I said no, and told her she should come over to look down in the bushes. I told her that I noticed several (about ten) thin, translucent lines, like spider webs, the same rainbow color of the bubble like cyliner, in front of my house.  The web like strings were in mid air and extended straight, from the West to the East in about 20 feet from the no parking sign by my house to nowhere. They were affected a little by the wind, but strangely, just floated straight across in a parallel line without falling.  The spider web things did not appear to be attached to the cylinder- bubble, but also, were not of anything I've ever seen on Earth, or could imagine.  They were the identical color.  I probably walked through them when I went across the street but the did not break, or fall. My girlfriend said run in the house, slam the door, and pull down the shades.  For some reason I was not scared but I did go in the house, close the door, and close the blinds. I peeked outside and saw the smoke again on the ground by the bushes but I had seen enough and do not know if anything else happened because about this time I began to feel a little leary and would not go, or look outside. Another strange thing happened.  The next day when my girlfriend came over to see.  She asked if I ever looked in the bushes.  I told her the bushes did not go anywhere for her to go look. Even though she wasn't going to look inside the bushes, the strangest thing happened.  When we looked across the street at the bushes, the bushes had closed all the way up, and were full, like they normally are.  The way they were opened when the cylinder appeared, it would be impossible for the bushes to close back to normal in one day, or a year. I told a couple other people and asked a couple farmers if fruit flies made these type of cylinders.    Then, I stopped becausethe people I told, and the farmers did not seem to believe I had seen something like that. However,I turned on the radio late one night.  Coast to Coast was on. The UFO man was a guest and left his number.  I called him and he said he didn't want to hear my story, I had to write it down. I didn't write it down because what I saw did not appear to be a UFO. Today I googled UFO and read some of the sightings.  One of them was identical to what I saw.  For this reason I have written this story.  Perhaps it can help others.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,42.368854674403615,-83.11026847195357

The ""V"" body of the object was strictly a ""V"" shape as stars and the contrasting darkness of space behind it was observable between the legs of the ""V""  where a known Bomber or other flying wing shaped aircraft would support a fuselage in this area. The Object surface was not clearly discernible due to altitude and light conditions, but the overall outline was immediately defined as its lighter grey appearance passed across a darker black night sky. It's color was almost that of a finger of cloud work in the night sky, but due to the maintenance of it's highly geometric shape/angle during its straight line flight path from horizon to horizon, as well as the speed in which it was travelling, there is no way for it to be mistaken for a cloud formation. The Legs of it may have been segmented but joined due to a slight bubble leading edge observed as though scalloped.

This happened in Otis Orchards, in the Spokane valley, in July or August, and was witnessed by my sister and me, our mom and dad and grandmother, as well as the family we visited that day which would include 4 or 5 others.  My family was getting ready to visit friends who lived nearby.  My mom saw my dad sitting in a lawn chair in the back yard looking up in the sky and asked him if he was ready to leave.  He replied “No, I’m just going to sit here and watch this flying saucer.”  Of course we all looked up and then saw a bright white sphere in the southern part of the sky, over Mica Peak and a little to the southeast, seemingly very high up.  The weather was beautiful: no clouds, very clear sky, no wind.  We watched for some time, and the object was unmoving, just sitting there in the sky.  We finally got in the car and, watching the ufo all the way, drove a few miles to our friends’ house, where they continued to watch with us for a while.  Finally someone decided to report this, and called Fairchild Airforce Base.  Soon 3 jets approached the object, and when they got close, the object took off at high speed towards the southeast, straight and very fast.  The jets did not pursue it, turned  and went back in the direction of Fairchild Air Force Base to the west.  My sister thinks that there was an article in the Spokane Daily Chronicle about this incident, but I have been unable to locate it using online search tools.

My dad always told me to take this story with a grain of salt. One day the Colonel (whom my dad never named) came back to the vehicle 'roaring drunk'.  He then told my dad a story he never knew whether to believe or not.   The colonel had gone to a UFO crash site.  Apparently he said that radar had tracked 'something' that had come from the vicinity of Venus.  When it hit the atmosphere, it did so at speed.  There was a hole in the craft about six inches in diameter, and the insides were burned by reentry heat.  Speculation was that it had been hit by a meteoroid sometime during the trip.  Three bodies were found, charred beyond recognition.  Pieces of the craft were everywhere, including a metal sphere with a peculiar characteristic.  When spun, even by hand, it became extremely difficult to move it.   My dad couldn't tell me if that meant move as in gyroscopic motion or an inability to take it from place to place while in motion. He told me the story because of my interest in antigravity, so if there were other details, I was never told. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My UFO encounter happened in South Jersey (""1956"") when I was in second grade. It was dark outside, I was about 8 years old, we just started a late supper when dad said; ""What's that funny noise?"" Mom was standing next to the kitchen table dishing out food, we cut a look at each other in disbelief (cause dad's hearing was never good) how did he hear something we didn't?   Dad enthusiastically said; ""Come on, let's go outside. Let's see what it is. Not me, I was hungry & kept eating.  Dad rushed back in the to get me, saying; ""come on, come on, come on, you don't want to miss this!""  Reluctantly, I got up (& for some unknown reason) turned directly around to note the exact time ... 8:32 PM on a school house clock. (Dad continued to coax me outside.)   When I got outside dad was pointing to this dark spot in the night sky, it was terribly overcast with just a few stars here & there. Dad had put the yard light on (making it difficult to see) I couldn't make out a shape, just a darker spot in the sky.  He pointed saying; ""Look at the funny lights! See-em? See-em, right there."" I was looking but I didn't see any funny lights, just a very dark spot. I decided to walk further away from the yard light. Mom & dad walked a few steps away too. I was about 25' to 30' further down the yard than them when I decided I was going to concentrate (with all my might) to make out a shape. Boom, that was it, the next thing I knew, I was waking up. Mom & dad were asleep standing the yard with their mouths open, & that's when I realized my legs were aching like I ran a marathon. I looked in the direction they were looking but it wasn't were, it seemed to be further away, slightly higher, and left. (All three of us were in slightly different positions than we were.)   I cleared my throat out loud and sheepishly said; ""Ah, dad ... dad?"" he woke up as my mom did a second later, they both put their heads down & walked directly in the house. I said; ""There it is right there! Look!"" they paid no attention. The next thing I knew, that thing was much lower, easier to see, I walked under a tree, & closer to get a better view. More than anything, I was extremely angry, I could now see the UFO with 5 of them staring at me. (About 150' away, it was no more that 25' off the ground at this point.) (They had rounder bald heads than the grays, the best I can tell, there was like a hazy fog around their ship.)  I remember thinking ... you lousy bastards, you mess with us, then sit there watching what we do? Thinking about that P.O.ed me even more!  I found a rock and threw it at them, I looked for another but only found a dirt clod so I threw that feeling I showed them how I felt about them. (Although they didn't physically react, I did get a minor feeling they were somewhat surprised I did that.) I turned then stomped in the house. I heard dad walking up the stairs, while mom keep repeating; ""Would you look at the time? What happened to the time? Where'd the time go?"" (About 3 times over.) Don't know if I would have noticed if she hadn't pointed it out. Shocked, it was now 9:40 (an hour & eight minutes later in time). Mom suddenly declared; ""I'm going to bed right now!"" With me still staring at the clock, & with a burst of determination she quickly went around behind me and shot upstairs. (???)  My mom, as long as I knew her Never Ever went to bed before 12. I was dumbfounded knowing that ... I had lots of questions, I tried processing the events but could not figure out how this happened, it made no sense. (With no answers, I remember thinking, I'll have to figure it out later, and went to bed.)  The next morning food & dishes were still on the kitchen table, mom was having a fit, shoving a dish right in my face saying; ""Nobody finished supper, we left the food on the table all night, I cooked supper for nothing ... "" & etc. I went to school that day, waiting until supper (to kind of re-create the moment) when I questioned them both. They completely ignored me at first, I mean I had one heck of a time getting their attention. I asked dad again & again; ""Dad, remember you said you heard those funny sounds last night?"" after 3 times he finally turned with the most blurry, blood shot, dead eyes, and said; ""Uh-huh."" I said; ""Dad, dad remember you saw those funny lights?"" I repeated it over & over until he turned to me again & said; ""Uh-huh.""  That's it?  I turned to my mom saying; Remember when you said; ""Look at the time? What happened to the time? Where'd the time go?"" I repeated it several times until she finally turned to me with bleary, welled up, blood shot eyes, and said; ""Uh-huh.""  Nothing! Ahhhhh!!!  Mom & dad started talking about something else, and me, I put my head down realizing they didn't remember anything, they were no help at all. I thought, here's my father one of the most brilliant & talented people I know he was a pilot, an inventor, RCA copied the long range TV antenna after his model, he was smarter than any of my teachers. He had an amazing memory, quoted Shakespeare, could add a full shopping cart of groceries before the checker could finish punching in the prices, he had ESP & could read minds, telling me (word for word) what someone was going to say before they said a thing, he told me my future (things that were 40 years out) & yet, he didn't have chance against them, he can't remember anything, they're more powerful than he is. I felt very alone & with no one to protect me from those rotten bastards.  I felt hopeless thinking ... what chance do I have?  In third grade, I was home (by myself) when I saw a UFO account on broadcast TV (it involved story after story about crashed military aircraft, including a passenger airliner that had supposedly been downed by UFO craft in the ""1950's"". (I was amazed) it showed UFO's darting a crossed a clear blue sky, & told how the military had made a decision to not attempt to shoot at them because of too many lost lives & equipment losses. After watching that film I was excited & asked just about everybody. I told my parents, believing I'd soon have answers & find the real truth ... sorry to say, that was it, no one I knew saw it, & nothing ever became of it. (I've looked on line to find that same broadcast ... but nothing except for a tiny segment you can see on a Disney broadcast.) ""Disney UFO Documentary: 'Alien Encounters'""  In sixth grade my class had the most wonderful teacher, Mrs. Mixner (we all loved her) one day she asked if anyone had seen a UFO. Feeling brave I raised my hand & told her & the class the whole story, it was the first time I opened up about what happened. Classmate, Mary Anne Catalano volunteered that she & her parents had seen a strange light in the sky (I was hoping for more) Mrs. Mixner asked her several questions, but she didn't remember anything else, that was it? (Ahhh ... !!!)  As teen, and as an adult, I would sometimes bring the subject up to dad ... he would just freeze up. I do remember a few times when he'd say; ""You know there are UFO's and E.T.s out there, anybody who believes we're the only species in this universe is stupid!"" I would always say, yes dad, I KNOW we're not the only ones. Through the years I read whatever I could find on the subject, told my friends, coworkers, two wives, & my kids, but I never had anyone tell me of any experiences. It always ends the same way, no one ever makes a comment after I tell my story. One of the last times I talked to my dad (he called from Florida) he was especially up beat & cheerful telling me all the stuff he was doing, fishing, the green house he made, & so I decided to slip in our UFO incident. Oh man ... I've felt horrible for doing that ever since. I waited. He didn't say Uh-huh that day ... it was just this very long pause (dad was always worried about the phone bill & with him not saying anything it was highly unusual) finally I asked if he was still there, he said; ""Yes."" I only talked to him one more time after that, I killed his spirit of joy, and that call ended abruptly. Dad died in ""1991""  I decided to move to Florida staying with my mom for a little while.  I told her the whole UFO story, carefully detailing every part, what everybody said, & what my thoughts were, just hoping she'd remember or say something helpful. Mom didn't say a word during the story, she just listened. (I seriously doubted she would even respond after all those years of nothing.) Big surprise (as soon as I finished) mom immediately shocked me by going into a story about the time she was pregnant when I was little. She said; ""You probably don't remember this ... ""  I said; ""Oh yes do (I recounted) I remember the day dad asked if I wanted a little brother or a sister. I was standing by the grape arbor eating grapes when he came out and asked me, he had this bounce in his step, filled with joy, and as happy as I'd ever see him."" Then Mom said; ""You know, your dad could never figure it out what happened ... it just went away.""  Ohhhhh ... noooo, alarm bells went off with my knowing about that hybrid program the E.T. were doing, ahhhhh!  Could I have a 1/2 alien brother or sister out there ... ??? ... oh no!  Okay, occasionally a fetus can be absorbed back into the mother's body, but under the circumstances, considering the time line being so close to that same time (I have NO proof) but I do have some serious concerns as to what could have happened. Mom died in 2005 and I must say I'm grateful for having had the opportunity to relate that story to her, and more than a little spooked to learn what she had to say in return. I'm still searching for answers …",,39.5317,-75.4376

During the evening of July 6 2012, I witnessed a bright, noiseless object descend from approximately 5-thousand feet in a tight, half circle pattern, to approximately 4500 feet.  This sighting took place due south of Kingston, Ontario Canada.  It lasted 5-seconds. When I asked several potential witnesses standing in close proximity to me if they had seen the object, they said they had not as they were chatting.  I also suspect some of the group would have had their view blocked by an overhanging canopy from the entrance of the commercial establishment.  I was sitting on a knee wall at the outer perimeter of the canopy. The object, while descending, went from a starlight intensity (over the course of a second or so) to extremely bright (for 3 seconds or so) then back to its original intensity and blinked out. This occurred as the object arced through a half circle pattern away from my location, and seemingly on a 45 degree angle downward. The best I can describe the object would be several times larger than Venus and many times its brightness.  I failed to call out to anyone in close proximity to me simply because I was utterly spellbound by the object. The sky, where the object appeared, was cloudless.  I could see several stars behind where the light had been once it blinked out. The distance south to Lake Ontario from my location has since been calculated to be a mile. The object appeared at a 1 O'clock position (about 70 degrees) from my point of observation. I believe the object was midpoint between myself and the lake.

Friday morning we left to go to a concert and I was responsible fro driving us back, from Ocotillo, CA to Phoenix, AZ and back.  The concert ended shortly before midnight and we started our way back home.  Nothing unusual happened most of the way until we reached the last border check point about 20 or so miles east of El Centro.  The odd thing about it was that there was no one stationed at the checkpoint, I slowed down then just drove away since no one was around it.  The vehicle behind me stayed. 5-10 miles passed it I ended up being pulled over by California Border Patrol (Very common government force in the area for obvious reasons) as a normal routine.  Nothing out of the ordinary. Then about a few more miles in a slightly vehicle populated freeway.  I noticed something what looked like a plane was going to land in the distance because it had a slowly flashing red and white light.  I  was a little surprised considering there was no airports for over 40 miles.  What happened next, blew me away. It turned on two front light sources, like a standard car and followed the path of a small bridge we were going to pass under.  It's common that roads go over highways so a small bridge is formed.  I thought at first it was just a car and the plane probably went behind it and out of view.  However, this was not the case.  Whatever was flying the craft, imitated a vehicle on the road.  I turned into disbelief as soon as I saw the ""headlight"" that was at the front of the craft started to roll leftwards and rightwards in about 60 degree angles at fast paces.  it went passed the bridge and flew over the small pasture. I pointed it out to my sleepy friends and noticed a small faint light was glowing in and out.  It honestly looked like it fainted into the sky but it then turned around and started flying low, headlights turned back on and it was literally 2 feet off the ground.  I was traveling 80mph and this thing accelerated real fast.  For a moment there, it looked like we wer! e both going to collide.  Before it hit the freeway it turned its headlights off(headlights kind of dimmed out) and flew up and over the freeway. Saw the red and white light underneath it. As it was flying away I noticed a small hole at the back of it that looked yellow, similar to a jet engine but probably no bigger than a steering wheel. It was about the length of a car, gray, no taller than 3 feet, elongated. Then I drove under the bridge, trying to keep an eye on it. Literally right after the bridge there was a bright light to the right of us that shined on us for a split second like a camera flash.  The vehicle did not make any noise at all.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,32.77397551020408,-115.60140204081631

We had observed the moon in perfect clarity at about 6pm. Cold...35-40 degrees.  Wife and the kids and I were sitting in our bed watching TV.  There was a flash of red light outside so bright it lit up far bedroom wall.  Kids didnt notice and continued to watch TV. Wife and I immediately looked out the window towards the city (about 200 feet off the 1500 Harbor Boulevard Pier) and saw something moving extremely fast from the sky down to the water (whole event was maybe 2 seconds after the flash).  It had a bright red light on it (not like fire....like a beacon).  Size is difficult to determine.  It seemed large considering it was about 600 feet away from our window.  Maybe the size of a helicopter but made up of a much simpler design like two large iron girders (as seen when building a sky scraper) attached at a 45 degree angle with red light on one end of one of the girders.  Angle of descent was pretty much straight down (90 degrees). Seemed way to fast to just b! e something falling from a plane.  Seemed propelled.   I braced for an explosion.  I thought maybe a helicopter was crashing but there was zero sound.  Even if the object hit water, it would have HAD to make a loud boom with it's size and at the speed it was moving. At first wife thought it was a projectile (missile?). We ruled out fireworks because of the downward nature and lack of sound. I initially thought it might have been a piece of a plane....but no sound???....and its speed made it look propelled. Immediately afterward, we ran to window and scanned sky and NYC skyline.  I saw a plane high above moving Northwesterly almost right above us.   About 2 minutes afterward, I saw a ferry boat on the NY side of the river heading south towards us.  Went downstairs for different perspective.  Might have seen people on a boat at the marina. The boat slip was all the way at the end of the pier on the river. I saw lights on the boat but couldn't tell if there were people outside of it. It! was very cold so it seemed unlikely.  If there were people, th! ey would have HAD to seen it.  It would have only been a few hundred feet from them. We were very frightened by the event.  My hands actually were shaking a little.  I considered reporting it to the non-emergency police number as a possible aircraft crash, but decided not to due to the lack of crash sounds and subsequent lack of visual confirmation of a crash.  On morning of 12/24/12 (8am), we went in separate rooms and drew what we had seen.  Daughter didn't witness the object but drew based on our descriptions the night before.  When we compared, we were frightened at how they are almost identical depictions. 12/24/12 @ 1:00am  Same night.  Kids sleeping in our bed. Woken by wife bringing son to kids bathroom. I went into master bath to go to the bathroom.  No lights on in room or bathroom. Bathroom dark and has no windows.  Went to bathroom and upon exiting, noticed a green glow coming from jacuzzi bathtub.  I took a closer look and confirmed something underneath the plastic of the jacuzzi was glowing green (very similar to texture?/color of a green aurora borealis). It looked soft.  I could see it through the plastic and the glow was unmistakable.  The strangest thing is that it didn't seem to alarm or scare me.  I was very calm even though now it seems insane.  I looked at it for about 5 seconds and then walked calmly to wife in the other bedroom to tell her to come see it.  We slowly walked back to the bathroom (total elapsed time about 10-15 seconds) and looked in bathtub. Now I was shocked. The light was gone and the contrast of it now being dark and not glowing seemed to frighten me. It was like I wo! ke up to the realization that the light that was there before was completely unnatural. I knew that, unless there were indeed green lights under the plastic tub, that were somehow turned on for that short period of time, this should not have happened. I have no explanation for this event. I don't even have a hunch as to possibilities of what it was.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,40.7696,-74.0204

Looking back along the side our house and and through part of a neighbor's tree in the back which had few leaves on it, we both noticed two roundish, perfectly-fixed, large orange/amber lights in the sky. The lights were in a southerly direction behind our house, and positioned at about a 45 degree angle, a good distance apart.  They looked nothing like airplanes and were (4-5x) bigger than stars, almost the size of the street lights we have on the poles here but more orange.  The light from the objects were not surrounded by a container as were the street lights. It was purer and steadier.  NO pulsing or twinkling of any type was noticed.  Their size, color and smooth output made them highly unusual. The lights were so peculiar, as I stopped the car I immediately jumped out and ran to the back of the house to try to get a better look.  I got to the left-side of our swing set and could see the highest light, but the lower light  to the right was partially blocked by an evergreen tree in another neighbor's yard behind us.  I moved around to the other side of the swing set to see them better.  I had the impression the two lights may have drifted _very_ slightly to the right, but observed they had kept that same, exact 45 degree angle and distance apart, as though they were connected together. About that time, a plane flew underneath what I was watching. I could see the plane and its blinking lights clearly.  It in no-way resembled the orange lights.  Nothing on it was even close to the same color or size, and the lights I was watching appeared further away than that plane.  Additionally, those lights were _much_ larger than anything flashing on the plane or any of the stars in view.   After that the lights disappeared and my wife and I went inside.   I went out a minute later to take another look, walked around the outside of the house, but they were still gone.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,40.7228,-73.517

I saw a solid white/orb flying pass at low altitudes coming from northwest to southeast very casually then disappeared.  This ufo was passing the skies like if it was in a hurry but moving casually and smooth.  I knew it wasnt a plane or balloon because it was just a white solid glowing object moving pretty quickly without making any type of noise.  I was amazed to see something like this again because this wasn't the first time i see this object passing by.

Since oct 19th or so during haileys comets dust trails..(shooting stars).  I happened to be able (along with many others i'm sure) to witness that event.  So since then i've been tuned in more to whats above us...so I started bringing out the ole telescope, pad, pen & digital video camera.... The setting of which my ""claim"" took place is a balcony on the top (3rd) floor...On any clear night you'll see the moon & stars with no problem.... I've also taken in the consideration of that this location is near a amry/airforce base which has plenty of air traffic along with the normal planes you see as well.., also took in consideration of the fact that the Leonid meteor shower is roughly from nov 13-21 peaking around the 19th/20th I reckon. What happened was, I was out on the balcony with my camera & notepad same as almost every night checking out the stars as usual ..Then I see what appears to be a star but it dissapears a second later it flashed again but in a different spot this went on for almost a minute then I grabbed my HDcamcorder... Which took a few seconds to focus on the sky but, I see no ""blink"" Bout 17 seconds into the video I look down at the porch (balcony floor) to make sure the camera was working ok. As I aim back towards the sky It flashes again  multiple times..I lost sight with the camera bout 23 seconds later...it finally blinked, then it was higher blinked again even higher ..as I back against the railing around the balcony watching this ""ufo"" I see it's very high now .(normally in this area the military planes are very low)  It continued this same pattern across the sky..then vanished......The pattern of this ""ufo""..which appeared to be in guise of a star..moved in directions unlike any thing i have ever seen when i re-watch the footage it sends chills....in a good but eerie way....I waited exactly a month to report this...(except to some people I know)  Its a sad day dec_14th due to the conn. school shooting ..was weird to me is its a month later from this 'thing "" I saw...... So hopefully I'm able to send the footage your way or who evers...& hopefully it gets analyzed..so I know something...Because I truly believe it was other worldly..either way ..I just want the piece of mind.…",2012-12-20T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

On the night's of 11/15/2012 and 11/16/2012, I as well as numerous other neighbors and friends ( and multiple children) were witness to multiple UFO's. Starting around dusk multiple sphere shaped objects moved into my neighborhood at the level just above the houses. It was clear and still those nights so these objects were clear,close, and unmistakable.  There was no wind so it was also completely silent early am as human activities slowed so all was audible. Also at 5:24 am on the 16th one cigar shaped object slowly drifted over causing another  witness  phone to freeze on this exact minute.	  These round orb like objects were glowing in a pulsating manor alternating red,blue. They more so drifted in slowly from the west in groups of anywhere from five to two and sometimes single. A group would move from west to east a certain distance then stop just hovering sometimes switching spots with each other in the group in a playful manor.  Then the next group would move to a different spot in the sky but would stop also at the same place the others stopped . After several groups did this over hours some groups continued on east going so far then stopping waiting for the next group ect. Several stayed visible from my yard over the entirety of both nights.  Some were higher up than others looking more like stars yet making groups and playfully changing places with eachother in the group or seemingly playing tag moving nearer each other then backing up.  Some single orbs would slowly drift across the sky ten or twenty feet then stopping, or moving up and down.  Some were seen to ""power up"" getting increasingly bright till 5 times brighter than the moon then zooming straight up and to the right and would vanish.  Some groups would move into formations of triangles and once one triangle formation moved slowly to meet another triangle connecting to form two triangles that were a  mirror image of each other but one next to the other touching at one corner. At the time they were closest to me i was watching in the yard with a friend. It was about five am on the 16th, clear sky and no wind or traffic. It was about 45 degrees outside or so.  Many orbs were lower to the ground seeming to be just above  the level of my garage and maybe ten feet ahead of us.  They would slowly move individually from west to east stopping randomly to hover. When they moved it resembeld how jellyfish move when they swim.  A light came from underneath as they went up in the jellyfish like movement.  The orb part was glowing in a pulsating manor red,blue.  They made no sound.  (A constant jet like sound remained in the distance the entirety of both nights)   At one point one seemed to move over right above my friends head maybe twenty feet up.  I noticed a feeling of overwhelming anxiety which was odd as at this point I has acclaimated to the situation at hand.  At 5:24 from the east moving west came a very large silver cigar shaped object  that also moved silently across the sky up as high as my two story house.  It moved at a steady pace slower than a plane but almost as fast. It had no wings or tail.  It seemed to be made of a seamless metal and a dim light was emitted as exhaust from the rear. It always kept an even altitude.  It just kept heading west till out of sight.  I was called in the am by my friend who awoke to find her cell phone was frozen at that exact time.  She had to remove the battery to get any response from the phone. Over the summer I had noticed some single orbs moving in funny ways and odd glowing stars as well as the constant jet like noise on many occasions so now i am always looking up. Witnesses-   I am 32 years old a Registered Nurse, Charge Nurse of Critical Care and a mother of three all of whom saw.  My husband 35 a computer IT specialist.  My neighbor, a women in her 50's is a CNA, and her son who is early 30's. A mother also a CNA whose husband works installation for our local phone company. My friend early twenties with a high school education.  Not sense these two nights have I nor my neighbors seen anything similar and every night i check.  I have done much research on astronomy and stars and sky watch often using my Google sky app to help in identification as well as a pro flight tracker showing real time airtraffic.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,42.4488,-94.2254
