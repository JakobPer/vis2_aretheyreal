I then had an odd thought that they were aware of each other and weirdly I fe! lt connected. Very strange feeling . They continued along a direct collision course and at the moment they reached each other they very quickly (literally in a moment) looped around each other in extremely close proximity as if they were playing and then each white dot preceded back in the opposite direction that it came from.

It was twilight. I was a, 9 year old, who loved to ride around on our Murray riding mower around on our hill in the middle of Benton since I was now big enough to get it started & pretend mow.  We had about 7 acres in the middle of town which was a large hill with about 5 acres of field behind it that I rode my little dirk bike around in.  This night I was on the front side of our property facing the electric company while pretending to mow the hill.  I will remember this moment for the rest of my life as it seemed to be the beginning of a series of regularly occurring events that have plagued me, and my family since. 	Like I stated earlier, I was mowing the upper side of the hill to the south west of our ranch style house . The riding mower suddenly just died.  I tried to restart it, but nothing. Like it had a completely dead battery.  My mother had come out to get me because it was getting dark, and she wanted me to stop & come inside.  When she called my name from about 50’ up the hill next to our house, I looked towards her.  That is when fear & panic encompassed every fiber of my being. Behind her over our field behind a pear tree, clear as day, hovering about 20 feet above the ground was a cigar shaped UFO with lights only around the center of it that seemed to go back & forth from the ends to center & back, quickly & smoothly.  I was so scared that I left the mower right there.  I ran up to my mother, grabbed her by the hand, & forcefully pulled her into our house through the kitchen door, which was on the east side of the middle of our house. I remember I kept looking at it, never once looking where I was going backwards because I was too afraid to stop looking at it. Once I got her pulled into the kitchen through the door, I locked the door, & started to panic & cry. I told my mom to sit on the couch & not move.  I grabbed my 4 year older brother who was in the floor of the living room watching tv, & I told him to do the same & to not move. I ran to my bedroom, & I grabbed my BB gun, thinking that this was somehow going to save us.  I stood at the kitchen door with my BB gun trained on the door, too afraid to move away from it.  My mom & brother came to see what I was doing & why I was so terrified.  I tried to explain, & my mother seemed to get it right away, as I think she took the gun & told me & my brother to stay right there.  I don't remember seeing my dogs inside of the house. I can’t remember anything past that. About a month later, we were going to the Calvert City Drive-In to watch a movie & eat. I was sitting in the rear driver’s side where I always sat staring out the window.  We passed a field to our left, & I saw it again.  Tucked away behind the tree line.  It could only have been only 80 feet away.  The exact same thing. Ever since I have noticed that I have severe insomnia & anxiety, & monthly I experience new places on my body that look like small scars, puncture marks, weirdly geometric shaped “freckles”, & small masses that disappear after a year or so.  When I told my mother about what exactly I saw that night years later at around 16 years old, she told me about when she was growing up in the house that this happened in, she would have little people coming to her window all of the time.  She remembers it going all the way back till she was in a crib. Now that I have my own child, a three year old daughter, that I have noticed events similar to what I experienced happening to my daughter & possibly my wife, as changes in mood, & my daughter’s newly found fear of sleeping alone again as well as the dark.  I fear that the cycle has started with her as she has mentioned “scary kids at night”, along with night terrors.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,36.8596,-88.3367

I teach surf lessons on the North Shore  of Oahu in Haleiwa Hawaii daily since 2010 at Chuns  Reef and Puaena point and live between the surf breaks in a private rich neighbor .  I have witness Triangles in the sky and clouds for years .  The triangles are dark , white , or clear almost .  The sizes vary . I feel that the objects know I am observing them and will Hover  and then pop in and out of the clouds .  When the triangle crafts do this , it creates pockets of blue sky in the shape of the triangle and as I continue to watch this happen the clouds will shift to cover the straight lines produced .  Sometimes the triangles will instantly vanish , however I believe my observations are what are more desirable than constantly being unseen .  I see these triangles almost daily . I have seen them over the moon and sun as well .  As well as over the ocean at Sunset Beach one day a few years ago where three appeared like the pyramids of Giza with a little star or orb above each right over the ocean toward the horizon around the time before the sun would set .  I got confirmation about the triangle crafts , being yes invisible except when near clouds and that they are originating in Kapolei Barbers Point air Hangers owned and operated by Lockheed Martin .  My observations from the past years where confirmed by an Aero Space Engineer in September 2019 , who was flying into Honolulu on a United flight plane with me and confirmed my experiences .   I watch the triangles daily from my yard . I also have witnessed the floating fire balls that seemed to move extremely slowly up against gravity and disappeared over the mountains . I watch the floating blue, green or red lights as well . I noticed the regular helicopters will approach sometimes during my sightings almost to cover or distract my attention from the US Secret military technology that is fueled not by any conventional known ways humans use to fly or transport . The triangles operate on the quantum level .  I have since met three other NASA / Aerospace Engineers on the north sh! ore who randomly appeared in the surfing parks and would speak to me Following September 2019 confirmation .  I am sharing this because another surf instructor also sees the triangles in the sky . He said , “I’m the only other person (adult) who sees them , other than children . He confirmed children’s seeing the triangles as well .  After my confirmation of the Triangles in the clouds  I asked about it to a high ranking person in the pentagon , when Trump announces the Space Force .  The response was that the this individual spoke with the Commander of the Space Force  and He knew nothing of the triangles .  I then sent a photo . Later my message disappeared from my phone .  After that I text a “?” To this secret specialist and received back the Military Interbang “!?“. Then the virus erupted to reprogram the human race .  Please watch the sky’s and yes the triangles are very active , I believe they maybe operating with the sacred geometric grid lines of the earth and universe .  Aloha and please Keep Your Frequency Positive .",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

Maybe one or two degrees above, and halfway of the boom, there was a bright white dot against a blue sky.

The dot moved slowly with respect to our location on the ground, and moved from two degrees above the boom to maybe near 20 degrees. It made gradual loops as it transitioned higher and higher in reference to the original location.

I live out in the country so little light pollution and you can see thousands of stars, even the galactic arm in the summer with your naked eye. As I'm headed towards my storage building I see the movement in the sky. There were a long line of bright, non-blinking lights moving across it. ,They appeared to be very high and moving slowly from 212 degrees SW to 41 degrees NE (using my compass app). There must have been in excess of 50 judging by their separation and how long they were appearing and moving beyond my line of sight due to trees. They line covered the entire sky from the point where they were appearing to the point where the were out of sight. They were going in line, but not straight rather, staggered but not in any kind of formation or pattern. It eventually slowed down to where they were appearing from the same point but every 10 seconds or so and then slowed further to where only a couple could be seen in the sky at a time. Those stragglers were not going the same direction though, they were appearing from the same point, traveling across the same line as previously but climbing and eventually disappearing overhead, they just got smaller and smaller until could not be seen directly overhead, which is why I deduct they were climbing. It would take them about a minute or so to go across the sky, so these were not shooting stars, moving too slow, very bright steady white light. A few other also appeared to the west at about 280 degrees but were moving from about 9 degrees N to about 175 S. Really weird. Never seen anything like it. I""m retired USAF and an aircraft aficionado, these did not look like planes. Just bright white, non-blinking lights.

At first I thought it was a bird, but saw no indication of wing movement or change of direction.  The object passed in front of the cumulus clouds. If I had to scale the object, it appeared compact like a dot, but in the same size grouping as a bird.  Still, no detail like wings or change of course.  What got my attention was the lack of any ""organic"" variation in its movement. Just constant speed and linear track. Everything else in the sky (like birds) had variations. Later as I saw large birds against a similar set of clouds, it was quite easy to see their wings and variations in movement. Had the object passed behind the clouds, I would have dismissed it as a plane.  I started estimating angles, based upon a 90 degree relationship between the gulf and directly overhead. Bisecting that angle, it appeared that the object was in the 35-40 degrees above the horizon. As for the time I could see it (1 - 2 minutes), I would estimate that it covered a field of 45 - 90 degrees, as it moved right to left (assuming I'm perpendicular to the gulf facing west).  I didn't have my phone with me during the sighting, but walked back to the car within the hour. I took a few pictures of similar clouds if  I need to get a better estimate on distance and angles. Further, I took video of birds flying just to demonstrate to myself that wings and organic flight behavior are obviously different than what I saw.  Was it a drone monitoring crowds on the beach? Possibly. But it seemed too far away. Drones are often closer, and usually show more variation in movement.  I've been interested in UFO's since a child. Although I've had unexplained life experiences, I don't recall any remarkable UFO sightings. While the sighting today was oddly out of place, it was certainly not ""sensational"". I think it will only have meaning if others report similar events en masse.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,26.19318196994992,-81.73703021702838

The rumbling was significant and my wife and I ran out into the front yard. It is time to tell the story, now approximately 10 years later.  It was late in the evening, probably 10 or 11 o’clock, and the fall of 2010 or 11 on the Oregon coast, North Bend Oregon.  The kids were just about in bed and there were two sonic blooms that shook our house along with the rumble in between the two booms, each maybe five or six seconds apart.  The rumbling was significant in my wife and I ran out into the front yard. Looking almost straight up above us, maybe a tiny bit towards the southern sky where the front of our house was pointed, was what appeared to be just a bright white what I would describe is very similar to a comet with a tail coming right down towards us. This was much brighter and larger than usual and there was clearly a rumbling from the house, but the object did not appear to be making any sound.  Our house was vibrating and The kids came out.   The object completely stopped and was silent, and the rumbling in the house stopped.  From the sides of this object two red lights shot out made their own complete arc down from the object and then met together at some unknown distance opposite from where they started.  My wife says they came around complete mirror images and then joined up at the same start position more like a figure 8 or an infinity sign.  This is really the only place our story differs . It then glowed bright white, paused there for quite some time (4-5 seconds?), then shot off directly south with incredible speed and disappeared in the distance.  This acceleration I believe rumbled the house again, thought glass might break.  The woods around us were completely silent . Never saw anything like it or any other bizarre sighting ever.  I’m a skeptic.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,43.4836,-124.16330000000002

I was playing soccer at a holiday residence near the town of M'Diq, in northern Morocco. While I was having a quick break, I spotted a black spot about 10 nautical miles away from my position, at an altitude of approx. 5000 feet and below the horizon. I was an aviation enthusiast at the time and it was clear to me that it wasn't a common aircraft. I also knew that the airspace where I spotted the object was restricted due to the King's property below it (T-VFR AREA E) and no aircraft were allowed to fly through it (except the Moroccan Air Force I believe).  While I was trying to make myself believe what my eyes were registering, a bunch of guys spotted it as well, confirming that it wasn't just my imagination. The black cigar-shaped object moved steadily on an eastbound direction towards the Mediterranean Sea and with no signs of acceleration or abrupt movement disappeared. It felt like a very well done fade out filming transition. Nobody said nothing and we kept playing soccer like it never happened.  I'm currently a commercial pilot and I can, even more, confirm than the shape and directional movement of the craft was something that I have never seen. Weirdly enough I tend to forget this incident. I remember times where the UFO subject popped up on conversations and I couldn't remember nor share the incident. It feels like my brain tries to erase and hide this incident as if it was a traumatic experience...  Another thing that I wanted to add is that that area of Morocco, between the cities of Tangier, Tetouan, and Ceuta is known for UAPs sightings. Since I was a kid I heard my elders sharing stories of 'stars moving rapidly' or 'stars dividing into little stars' and steady floating lights at night. I was always very skeptical and I always thought that they may have spotted military aircraft from the nearby USAF and RAF bases of Rota and Gibraltar, but after my own experience, my perception changed radically.  As I mentioned, I'm very skeptical and the UFO matter, even with my experience, is still something that I find a hard time to believe and support. I remember judging colleagues at my air operation sharing their sightings experiences thinking that they are crazy, and that might be the reason why my brain just wants to eliminate that memory, to probably protect me from judgment and to be seen as a crazy person. I feel weird/scared to write this down and share it but I want to help people that believe and fight for the truth about this matter. Good luck",2020-07-23T00:00:00,,

On the way home, we walked through another nearby housing estate. I noticed in the sky that there was a white, circular object flying slowly through the air, shining bright enough to be noticed but not so bright that if I'd told my friend ""look at that"" she'd see it instantly. It was a clear, starry night so I doubted she'd see it in time.  I said nothing. It didn't fly steadily like a plane or helicopter.  It was ebbing and flowing ever so slightly, coming from the right to the left.  It went across the sky before disappearing in the most unusual way. Imagine a clock, with the hands both at twelve.  In the space of two or three seconds, both hands went around the circle in a clockwise motion, with each section disappearing into black.  The hands got to three, and so from twelve to three was black, and then they went to six, so from twelve to six was black.  Once the hands got back to twelve the entire circle of light that had clumsily flown through the air had vanished, almost like boiled water turning into steam.

All of a sudden a bright light appeared over this house and began flickering randomly as if someone bottled up a lightning storm.  I can't explain it.  At first I thought it was from lightning because there was a lightning storm on the northern border of Oklahoma well over 150 miles away.  Anyways the light then turned solid and it immediately moved over by a large tree, circled around the tree.  Then it moved up into the air about 20 feet and then move away from the tree about another 20 feet and came to a complete stop.  Then it immediately shot straight up into the air. It was small, about the size of a Chevrolet Spark to give an idea of the size.  It was circular like the shape of a pill and it was metallic.

Early morning of March 1st, 2020, about 4am to 6am I had a sighting of a slow moving … something in the eastern sky.  It was a bright object. Facing east, it was just a couple of seconds to see, with my own eyes, that it's just not all stars, in that clear night sky.  I detected an unusual phenomenon through the left side window.  A moving star-like object.  It was a plane, I thought at first. However, this object was not blinking and no colour.  It was moving north eastward-ish.  I though that that plane is pretty low for that “Chicago – UK” flight path!  And I am realizing that it is, also, going too, too slow comparing to the other planes that have been regularly passing by. This shiny object seemed to stop, and not reached to most left side of the window frame. It is still very visible, high in the sky and at a big distance from me. It is clearly above the tree-line and hilltops, from my perspective. A couple of seconds of pause, then there was a slight movement: It was reversing! Very slowly, it was going back, southward on the line it was on. It did not much go up and down. It was not bouncy. Eventually this object moved up higher in the sky, as to reach the top edge of my left-side window. To keep viewing this thing, I had to ""quietly"" move my chair, nearly 2 feet closer toward the window.  Now I, possibly, am gazing some other things, like few small reddish pulses descending and ascending as if dropping and returning to that bright object. After a short break from my watching post, I resumed viewing and studying that bright object. It was still visible! Now, I am thinking that it will be daylight soon. So after another short length of time I waited for this thing to zoom away. I wanted it to zoom away. It did not. It seemed too busy at what ""its/they're"" doing. Now being thoroughly exhausted I, finally, left my post.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,46.2,-82.0833

It stayed very close to or within clouds that surrounded it, possibly resulting in the appearance of being translucent, however exposed portions still seemed to have observable characteristics of cloaking or some other technology to conceal it to some degree. It maintained shape as it was very rigid.  It did not transform or alter form like the surrounding clouds. It was completely silent and has no apparent means of propulsion, lift, or other modern flight characteristics.

At approximately 530 in the morning I was driving to work at a hotel in the Teton Village. As I was driving down Moose Wilson road I noticed two huge round cloud formations floating over the Teton mountains.  This caught my eye for two reasons, the first being the fact that the sky was clear, 360 degrees around and the second was the fact that the second formation was emitting a vapor trail.  I rushed to the parking lot, jumped out of my car and began to search for these clouds.  Interestingly enough, the two clouds were now just one. The single cloud began to morph into a flattened shape and break into two more clouds as it moved to the north over the Jackson airport at an approximated altitude of 3000 feet above ground level.  At that time two small black disks traveled out of the cloud backwards in my direction and morphed into two more clouds.  I ran into the hotel and grabbed the front desk manager telling him to come outside to witness my claim.  We watched! for 5 minutes as these clouds again emitted six more disks, each becoming its own cloud.  At that time a guest came outside and asked why we were watching those clouds when he himself also saw the clouds change shape and emit two more disks.  Both witnesses exclaimed: what the hell is that.  The clouds floated further to the north until they were no longer close to our proximity.  I am a private pilot and have been flying for over 20 years and never have I witnessed anything like this that defies logic.

When I got home that evening from work, the power was out. I called the power company and to my surprise heard a long, growling noise. I hung up and tried again a few times. Each time that was the only sound that was heard. No person available to speak to. Now a few days later I sit down to relax and look back at my pictures. After looking at that one again more closely, I noticed about 8 flying objects. They look like black disks and dots flying around in the sky, some close to each other, some far apart. All of the instances that happened within the 24 hours around the storm are just all too coincidental and now seeing this picture with the black objects in it...

UFO sighting over Cloverdale California Tuesday August 4th 12:23am. History of observer: •	56 years of age male,  Senior Optical Engineer  •	Designer of high resolution astronomical imaging systems  •	Amateur astronomer and Astrophotographer for 41 years. Planetary observation session was interrupted by an object that was not easy to dismiss as an aircraft, satellite, meteor or man-made space debris. Observed was a -5 magnitude star-like object traveling from SE to NW at a speed slightly faster than the a typical fly over of the International Space Station.  First spotted SE of the Sturgeon full moon passing and travel NW exactly between the moon and Saturn. It rose higher into the sky traveling at a constant velocity to an altitude of 38º to 42º above the ""due south"" horizon before its startling disappearance. What was unusual about this object:   •	Just before it disappeared from the sky it rapidly accelerated for 500 to 600 milliseconds. •	The rate of its extinguishing light after the rapid acceleration was startling.  Not at all like a typical satellite darkening into the earth's shadow or tumbling in sunlight. •	Sighting occurred just after midnight and a satellite could not have been illumined by the sun. •	Color was white to slightly yellow and had a slight haze surrounding its star-like appearance. •	Westerly orbiting satellites are very unusual. •	To verify it was not local aircraft out of Santa Rosa or San Francisco a flight tracker app was checked within seconds of the sighting.  No aircraft were in the air between SFO and the Oregon border. He notified his sister with a text to verify time, location and document the event.  This was only the second object the observer could not identify over his observing history.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,38.7827,-122.9232

I do not know if that was because their illumination was so soft, or if they literally had just appeared in the southwest sky, to disappear in the northeast sky. If they were jets they had to have been fighters. Regular commercial aircraft would not have been so close in echelon, and, in fact, one of the echelon formations shifted positions as they passed overhead. (It really struck me that someone had taken their eye off the ball and had allowed their craft to swing from left rear to even on the right with the leading light. It did not seem to be a smooth maneuver.) No idea as to altitude but the objects were the size of stars and that is why I thought it was something going on with Orion’s belt. While looking at the first two I briefly wondered if they were some sort of satellite but it rapidly became obvious that the objects were not in outer space but in the atmosphere. There was a clear sky, temperatures in the upper 20’s, no moon, stars could be clearly seen. No wind. I estimate the time of sighting lasted two minutes, when I went in the house after the last one flew over it was 5:39. My location is on the east coast flyway so I see a lot of aircraft overhead both day and night. Sometimes the commercial aircraft can be heard even when very high up, other times no sound is heard. This is a rural area; the night sky is very vivid. I often look up to see the stars or watch an aircraft in the night sky. The objects I saw do not fit anything I have seen before, there were no navigation lights. Also, while we have military aircraft go over now and then, I have never seen a long line formation such as I witnessed tonight. And Orion was not in the sky at that point, I had made a mistake when looking up as the objects at first looked like Orion’s belt and with the one’s in echelon I thought for a second I was seeing two belts. I was completely sober and not on any medical drugs when the sighting occurred. I was out at such an unusual hour as I had not been able to sleep so went to complete grocery shopping at the 24-hour Walmart up the road.

On Sunday, May 24, 2020, I was out running in the early morning in a rural area of Southern Indiana.  It was a clear, crisp morning with bright blue, cloudless skies.  At approximately 7:30 a.m., I witnessed an object with a small drone like body flash across the sky from west to east at missile like speed.  The drone like body was whitish in color with an electric blue to aqua colored “headlight- like” light in the front.  I thought this was unusual as I would normally expect a power source of something flying so fast to be in the rear of the object and not in the front, if in fact it was the power source.  The overall size of the object was surprisingly small with the bluish light by far being more visible than the body.  I estimate the angle of elevation to have been approximately 45 – 50 degrees.  The object was flying at a surprisingly low level in the sky.  It was easy to see this because additionally there were two cargo or passenger planes flying much, much higher in the sky.  I was extremely taken with the speed at which the object was moving as well.  I estimate that it was only in my eyesight for 2 to 3 seconds.  I had never seen anything move that fast and it made me want to check on the news to see if anything had happened as well as file this report.

Considering it was almost pitch black it would be strange to not have the lights on at 9:05 pm.  I also noticed there were two white lights on each side of the vehicle that didn’t blink.

The speed was too fast for an airplane at its altitude, even the fighter jets we watch due to luke air base.  This was not a meteorite as it was too slow and the light was not correct, leaving no ""tail"".  The trajectory was flat, not varying in height.  There was also no variance in speed.  The ""ball of light"" dimmed after approximately 30 seconds then blinked out well before reaching the horizon.

All were in a circular configuration and at times a triangular formation.  The objects at times seemed to come close to each other. Objects could possibly be drones but this close to the airport is highly doubtful. Video by cell phone captured the objects as well as pictures. The night was partly cloudy. Objects were at cloud level.  Objects were also viewed through night vision Gen2. No discernible solid craft shape evident other than the light configuration.  Pulled up Tar/flight simulator and noticed 2 small military planes circulating the parameters of the airport...the other objects were not shown on radar, not MIL or COM.  And they were not identify.  Once the clouds started clearing...one object started strobing at a high rate...and shot north at a high rate of speed.  The other objects slowly turned off or went out of sight due West over the airport.  Approximate sighting last 15-20 minutes.

I convinced her to come outside to see it before the clouds obscured the view.  When we both stepped outside, I noticed it had moved slightly and found that to be very odd, so we both stepped further out to get a completely unobstructed view of it and noticed that it was becoming brighter by the second.  This is when I realized that the clouds had been obscuring the view and we were about to get a real good view of it.  Within a few seconds it was as bright as a white light bulb and I quickly realized that this was NO comet but something in our atmosphere and above the clouds.  As the clouds kept moving away, the bright light kept coming into full view and appeared to be a very long cylindrical light resembling a “fluorescent tube“.  Based on the landmarks on the mountain range it was above, I estimated it to be about a mile long.  It was in a horizontal position pointing to the northwest on the left and Southeast on the right.

Once it was pointed to the Northeast, it continued its movement towards the Northeast until it was out of sight.  The unobstructed view lasted about seven to nine seconds.

Just yesterday only I DOWNLOADED the picture of the ufo design made public on the internet (un-classified) by the dod o! r not sure which federal agency.

In the early morning hours on Friday, August 7th of 2020, I witnessed something truly amazing.   Approximately 4:30am, I awoke from falling asleep on the couch as I often do from working late hours.  I got up and went over to the dining room window to close it when I looked up and noticed a bright light in the sky.  I thought to myself, is that the comet?  But I quickly realized it was an aircraft as I noticed it’s lights flashing and I could hear it’s familiar sound.  As the plane flew over and disappeared, I looked up to the left and to my utter amazement and surprise, I saw a huge object appear.  The sky was still dark but was starting to get that early morning glow just before the sun starts to rise. 	I said to myself, what the hell is that?  With my cell phone in hand I quickly went out to the balcony and tried to take a video of the slowly moving object, but in my haste of trying to blow up the craft’s image, I very regrettably kept losing it in my camera view.  I went back inside to the dining room window and tried to capture it there but it went behind a huge tree.  It was then that I noticed my boyfriend, standing behind me and he stated, “Honey, what are you doing?”  “I’m looking at this thing in the sky,” I replied. 	This large craft finally made its way out from behind the tree, and we were able to witness what I was seeing.  I just stared at it in utter amazement, wondering what in the world it could be.  It was gigantic, long and cigar shaped.  This craft had a silver like appearance.  There were no lights.  It made no sound, whatsoever.  We just stood there in silence as this incredible thing glided across the sky for about 2-3 minutes, until it went behind a large hazy cloud.  We both turned to each other and exclaimed, “I think we just saw a UFO!” 	I have always been very interested in the paranormal, UFO’s, the unexplained phenomena that lingers all around us since a very young age after having several experiences myself that continue to happen to this day.  My boyfriend enthusiastically shares my interest and we watch countless programs on these subjects.  But I never had a UFO encounter before and I often wondered what it would be like and how I would feel at that moment, always believing that I would be shaking with terror.  Well, I finally got my moment and I can honestly say that I was not scared in the least.  I was extremely calm and awestruck, and I had a big smile on my face knowing deep in my soul that what we just witnessed was true and very real.  We saw a UFO.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,45.8002,-122.9735

At 4:39 am, I was walking around the paved trail in Riverfront Park on 23rd St in Hermiston, Oregon. It was still mostly dark but dawn was coloring the eastern horizon.  I was rounding the extreme north side of the park trail, and happened to look up between the trees which framed the sky. My view into the sky at this point is facing west, northwest. The weather was clear, mid fifties and almost still wind.  I saw a long lighted cigar shape floating silently from the west moving toward the east, northeast. It was completely silent. I could hear traffic from the freeways that the craft would have passed directly over.  The long side of the cigar shape had lights running the length. These appeared to be square shaped, and for a moment I thought they may be windows. As it passed by, I noted that the lights changed, some brightness running up or down the length. I could not see any fixed interval. The lights were all white.  I saw no bulges or projections either top or bottom of the lights. There was a darkish metal greyish silver cast to the edges of the cigar. I was hoping that as it passed by toward the increasing brightness of the dawn, that jt would silouette the shape. But as it passed toward the east, the leading end of the cigar angled away from me and the lights were no longer visible. The end view as it floated away was of something greyish matte metal color about the size of the end of a round broom handle.  The object appeared to be floating. The object had no visible means of propulsion. The object left no trail and there was no distortion visible around it.

A family outside of town had a strange craft hover over their house near the same time. My cosin and I were both 7. We were playing in a small field behind our Great grand mother's ,on the north edge of town. I don't remember exactly when but we both became aware of a silver metal object in the field. I remember thinking it was a metal pig hut because my older brother showed me one in the woods and told me that the pigs had gone feral and they would kill me if I went in the woods. I guess that was his attempt to protect me! Anyway, the object seemed to shimmer with heat waves and at some point we saw that it was a disc about twice as tall as a car and 3 times as long. I seem to remember that I could see under it like it was hovering close to the ground. We were not afraid at that time and decided to run up to it. we were about 50 feet away when it shot up on an angle to the right and appeared to be the size of a nickle , barely paused then shot up again on an angle to the left till at appeaed the size of a small pea then shot up to the right and disappeared. I !don't remember leaving the field but I remember running into my gramma's house and being very excited. My cousin moved to Washington state in the 70's. In 1983 he came to our grampa's funeral and I asked if he remembered it. He did. My mother did not believe us until we went on about it for several days. When she finally looked there was a series of coffee can sized holes near where the object was. A woman who lived 2 miles north of town told that at about that same time she and her kids (around my age) were watching TV at night when they heard sound like roof shingles slapping and the kids ran and looked out the windows. The kids claimed there was something hovering over the house with colored lights but the mother wouldn't look because she was afraid. I as female and my cousin is male.

Observed object in southern sky.  Actually heard propulsion system activate before ship moved at a terrific speed to the north and west of sighting position.  Too dark and no moonlight to visualize true shape of craft.  The night was very clear and cold. On way to county seat viewed an array of white lights in southern sky. Traveling south on Highway 71 toward county seat, Maryville.  I was 19 at the time.  The other two individuals, men, were slightly older.  We noted a group of lights, in the sky to our right, paralleling our movement to the south and east on the highway.  The driver of the car pulled off onto a side road and the three of us stood outside of the car and observed the lights.  Upon first viewing the object it appeared to have 4-5 white lights on the bottom side it.  In the middle of this array was a pulsating light that would gradually change colors from red to orange to yellow to a bluish cast never actually going completely out.  The object was approximately 1/2 mile to our right and was moving to the east slowly.  Elevation was approximately 1/4 mile.  The object kept moving closer, in the air, and then came to a complete stop.  After stopping, in the sky, there was still no sound.  There were no other competing lights or phenomena so there was no distraction.  The highway was exceptionally quiet, no traffic.  As I gazed at the object and was observing the pulsating of the central light I heard an almost imperceptible sound.  Rather like a low pitched moan which seemed to be emitted from the object in the sky.  The object then moved from the point just to the east of us at a terrific speed and was out of sight in a matter of 2-3 seconds.  There was the almost inaudible hum and then the thing moved from a dead stop to the north and west and was gone.  I went into the Air Force the next year and served a year and one day in Vietnam, 70-71.  I have seen many types of jet aircraft and observed them in flight and have never seen such an array of lights, so closely together and the pulsating ability of the one cente one.  I have a college degree in business/technology and a separate technical school degree in electronics and am well read.  I have never anyone else who has seen or observed anything similar to this craft.  There was no sonic boom, when it took off or anything.  I did have corroborating discussio! ns from two other college aged people from two different places that night, though.  One to the south and east noted the same actual light array but, from a farther distance.  The other was from the north and west and noted a similar object hovering in a pasture area near the town of Elmo.  This event has haunted me since.  No one believes me, trully but, I know what I saw.  One of the two other men is now dead.  He drowned and the other guy still lives in the area but, I never see him.  I work for the State of Missouri and have a job of importance and responsibility.  I just thought that I would pass on my story.  I hope that this may dovetail with some other accounts.  Thank you.",,,

Object led us in a circle then passed below us. Four of us (3 pilots) just had landed at the Gogebic County Airport, and while taxing back toward the hanger noticed a flashing yellow light about 2 miles southwest of the airport.   We took off again on runway 27 and headed straight at the object.  It continued to flash a yellowish white light in no particular sequence.   As we approached it, it headed east (our left).  We turned to follow it, but it kept staying off our left wingtip.  It led us in a complete 360 degree turn.   It then headed east along a range of hills.  It entered the landing pattern for the airport at 800 ft above ground level.  We followed it.  It completed the downwind pattern, but after turning onto the dogleg, instead of entering final approach, it veered at a 45 degree angle and passed underneath us.  We were at 800 feet above the ground at the time, in the downwind leg of the landing pattern.   When we finally got turned around, the object had disappeared.  Witnesses on the ground with whom we were in !radio contact with claimed the object passed above us, then just zoomed upward at a steep angle and disappeared.  We knew the object passed beneath us.   The object appeared to be a yellowish-white light about 5 feet in diameter.  When it passed below us, it did not appear any larger and there was no sign that it may have possibly been larger.   Three of us in the plane were licensed pilots, one a commercial airline pilot.  Witnesses on the ground included the airport manager, a local government official and two other pilots.   This encounter was reported to the University of Colorado UFO study which was the offical reporting place at the time.  I received a letter from the project coordinator, Mr. Robert J. Low, on March 8, 1968.  He stated that the report would be included in the their active file.   I was informed a few days later by the airport manager, that he had received a telephone call from the University of Colorado asking for more details about the sighting, which he pro!vided.   He was also asked about us, were we creditable witnesses, etc.  He stated that he told them that we all were good honest witnesses.   I never heard anything more about this other than a small article in the local newspaper.   I was wondering if you have ever had any reports similar to this one.

I live in Jersey City, NJ on the 8th floor of a building. My large windows face west with minimal obstruction from buildings or trees.  The other witness spotted a bright light in the sky and told me to look at it (I’m a sky gazer and am familiar with the typical star layout – which isn’t much since we’re so close to NYC).  I walked to the window to check it out, and it looked exactly like a bright star.  But it was red and has also never been there before. I grabbed my binoculars, which are high powered, to take a look on the balcony.  The red light had about 5 or 6 smaller lights above it in a circular or possibly a hexagonal pattern, which were not visible to the naked eye.  The large light almost looked like it was jiggling a bit as if it was like a ball of jello.  Newark airport is nearby and I regularly watch the planes take off and land.  I have a real-time app on my phone to track all of the planes in the area since I find it interesting.  This object was not on the radar. After a few minutes of watching, it was clear that this wasn’t an aircraft that the average person is familiar with by any means.  Both the main bright light and the smaller lights above/surrounding it changed colors several times.  They were usually red and green, but sometimes white. The smaller lights above the main large light initially were stationary but then would start spinning in a bizarre manner as the “UFO” started moving or changing directions.  Left, right, forward, backward, ascending, descending.  All directions.  The object landed on the ground in the distance behind a building. I’m not sure how far away it was though.  It went straight down to the ground and straight back up on two occasions. I tried to capture a video with my iPhone while also looking through the binoculars because I couldn’t take my eyes off of it, but the iPhone video does no justice.  Although, in the video you can see the general movement of the light in the sky as well as the larger light changing in color. I have a few iPhone videos about 60-90 seconds long. In one of the videos there is a 2nd green light that looks almost orb-like that jumps around on its own and moves across the screen – I’m not sure if it’s related or not, but my phone was steady and the light moved around in an odd manner.

I went out to pee while it was still quite dark (small crescent moon) but cloudless, and noticed what I first thought was the most unusual straight line of stars that I'd ever seen.  In a matter of seconds I went from thinking it was a string of bright stars across the sky; then I thought they were moving; then I KNEW they were all moving in a straight path from south to north at an unknown altitude. If they had not been moving, they would have appeared to be just like a very straight line of bright stars in the sky. I could not see too far to the north in the direction they were traveling because of trees, but when I looked to the south, I could see where they were originating from. It was as if they were appearing out of something, but I could see nothing and there was no sound at all. It looked like they were just appearing or entering out of nowhere. They were mostly pretty equidistant from each other, but a few would appear more closely spaced than others. I'd guess that I could see about 15 degrees of the sky (out of 180) from where they originated to where I could no longer see them behind the trees. It took them less than 10 seconds to cover that! distance - again, altitude unknown.  I guess it could have been a stationary military craft emitting munitions with tracers, but there was absolutely no sound on a very quiet and still night. Furthermore, the objects did not seem to be traveling in an arc for the distance that I could see them and there were no trails. They just looked like bright stars that were moving across the sky. Coolest thing I've ever seen in the night sky, that's for sure. I thought of going back inside my RV to get my phone for pictures, but nothing I ever try to photograph at night can be seen, I didn't want to miss ""the show"".  If you find out that there were military exercises in the area or any other information, I would like to hear about it. By the way, I do not drink or do drugs, nor am I on any medications.

I describe it as a fireball because the part that was moving and the tail both had a strong orange tinge. My friend pointed it out to me and our other friend sitting in the back seat. All 3 of us observed the orange ""fireball"" moving quickly through the night sky with a noticeable but not very long tail behind it approximately 3-4x longer than the actual object itself. My friend recorded a short video at this point.  We were trying to figure out what it could be when approximately 2-3 minutes later, the ""fireball"" ceased all motion.

He became deathly serious, and told me that if I did not look, I would regret it forever. His tone scared me, so I looked.Up in the 3 am sky was a smoothly moving object. It was the size of my right thumbnail on my outstretched hand.The object was perfectly silent, a rounded, smoothly contoured equal edged triangle. It appeared to have either a dome shaped hollow or protrusion in the middle bottom. There were no lights, seams, markings, or details whatsoever.It appeared as though cast of one solid piece of material. It was the grey of stone, and was visible by virtue of the reflected glow of city streetlights upon it. It moved in a perfectly straight line, with no 'point' of the triangle facing the direction of travel exactly. Near the zenith of our view, it suddenly altered direction without curving or slowing down.One second it was going one way, the next instant it was moving about 35 degrees or so another way. It contined on this slow, smoothand straight new path, until it was lost to sight behind trucks parked near us. I saw the object go past telephon and power lines, it was above and behind them.My friend and I decided not to speak about it, but instead to immediately go inside the house, and seperately draw and describe the event on paper, then exchange the papers.We though this would let us know that what we saw was 'real'. Our reports to each other, when finished, were identical, except for one difference.I had thought the dome on the bottom was a 'hollow', not unlike the 'dimple' in red blood cells, while he thought the dome protruded outwards from the rounded shape. I ascribe this to the difficulty of percieving an unfamiliar contoured shape in reflected light from distance.The event lasted approximately 4 minutes in total, from the time I started looking, to the time the object glided silently beyond our vision.During the event I measured the object with my thumb, and closed my eyes briefely to see if it would still be there when I opened them, it was.The sky was perfectly clear, and the stars shone brightly. Our shared yard was surrounded on all sides by large trucks, houses, a fence, and trees, making for a perfect viewing environment,with no directly visible light sources to spoil our view. I was 13 years old at the time, my friend was 14.I have never forgotten this sight. It was utterly unique. I have no feeling or impression whatsoever about what the object actually was. It could have been anything from ship to lifeform to paradimentionalprotrusion to shared, perfect hallucination. Any of these explanations are equally fantastic. It simply...was. Featureless, solid, grey, and oblivious tothe way objects are supposed to move.I have not seen anything else, since. I have certainly seen nothing else like it.It taught me a few things: one, that during a genuine sighting it is utterly impossible to hope to realistically describe thesize of a UFO, as there is no yardstick by which to measure it, save one's own arm, or a nearby object. Against the starry sky,such a thing could have been any size (within reason) and almost any distance away. There is litterally no way to tell.Therefore I discount the tales of folks who claim to know the distance and size of an utterly unfamiliar object.Lastly, I feel a little cheated. In the years that followed this event, I have heard many tales of UFO sightings, all with fancy lights,weird sounds, strange feelings, and so forth. My sighting was not so spectacular, just a blank, seamless impossibility,moving silently. It did at least move in an impossible manner, which is at least something!I cannot remember my friends name after all these years, alas. I hope that this report may cause him to contact me,so that I can reminisce about this event.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,43.2779,-112.5627

I was standing topside watch aboard the USS Will Rogers (SSBN 659) with another petty officer named Duncan (can't remember last name). We witnessed a VERY fast brilliant object moving across the sky behind the lights of Portsmouth, NH and head out to sea (the Atlantic). Within two or three minutes after the sighting, we witnessed a flight of four F-15's take off from Pease AFB on full AB. They proceeded in the same direction of the object. Thinking this was significant, we made a note in the topside log and notified Pease AFB operations that we could confirm the sighting. The next morning the ship's XO called us in and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to play games with the Air Force and were then ordered to ammend our logbook entry. We were used to seeing F-15's take off from Pease during day and night. The object was many times faster than an F-15. It also did not in any way fit the profile of an F-15's afterburners. All we saw was a point of light moving very fast out to sea. This incident has remained a question in my mind because of the reverberations it caused in the Navy and Air Force chains of command.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,43.1153,-70.7051

No lights, no sound, just a monstrous huge black vehicle.  My impression was it was like a rectangle.  We only new it was there because it was blocking out the stars (there were no clouds that night), that is what drew our attention to it, blocking out a large section of the sky and it's movement.  I have no idea how high it might have been although it was at least above 3500 feet.  Myself and my associates were all standing together talking when one of the guys said what is that coming from the ""North?""  We all looked and then could make it out, it was awsome.  We were all ""on duty police officers"" taking a break in our favorite spot where the ambient lights of the city didn't block the stars.

We were all veteran cops as well as military veterans.  I was a combat air-defense control officer in the military and have somewhat of a good idea of what anything man made can accomplish in the air.  This was not anything that we could possibly have built.  I don't know why I thought it was a rectangle, but I just had that feeling about it.

My father was sitting in our kitchen watching the birds outside.  I heard him yell for me to come see something.   I went into the kitchen and sat next to my Dad.  He then pointed out thewindow, up into the sky.  ""Watch that silver disc up there,"" he said.  The objectI looked at was not exactly round, it was kind of a cross between round and oval.  It was really high up but you could still see it clearly.  The color of it was silver, not unlike the way some jets look today.    As I watched the silver disc, it slowly moved to the right and stopped.  Next it moved slowly down and stopped.  Now it moved directly left and stopped.  And the last move it made was up and stopped.   At the time, I don’t remember being really amazed by it, I just thought it was""kinda neat"" is how I think I put it then! (chuckle).   As we watched the silver disc just hover in the one spot, it suddenly shot really fast diagonally up and was gone!  Later that night, after I had gone to bed, something woke me up.  I didn’tknow what, but I had this strange sensation (not unlike dreaming).  I was being drawn to the back of the house.  So I walked slowly to our back door and pulled the shade on the window.  Normally what I would see is the silhoutte of our backyard trees against the streetlamp.  What I saw instead was a hugh, bright, white, light!   The light was so bright it was blinding!

My first thought is that it might have been a drone (I’m an FAA Certified Part 107 drone pilot), but I’ve never seen a drone with lights like that.  Attached is a picture and a video I shot from my backyard.  This was taken in Goodyear, Arizona, and it appears to be within Goodyear airspace, which is restricted due to the nearby Air Force base (F-16 and F-35 training base) and several airports including the Goodyear Airport.  It was not moving at all, though the video was shaky because I was trying to get closer and the camera was unstable.  When I saw it, it was hovering there steadily.  After about a minute of doing so, the lights shut off like someone flipped a switch.  It didn't turn direction, it didn't descend or ascend, the lights just went out.  My mom saw it on a separate occasion, about 10 minutes earlier that same night. Her experience was different than mine. She saw it hovering and not moving at all.

After the show the neighbors continued to set of their own displays, so I proceed to go out front to my driveway to watch. At 10:44pm I saw an orange sphere approaching from the NNE at a slow speed, too high and silent to be a drone I reached for my iPhone and began to video the object. It was headed south in the direction at which I was standing then proceeded to pause and dim then reappearing several times.  The object continued this for several minutes then continued off to the northwest.  I have video and photos of the event. 	I also contacted you on a previous occasion on August 11th of 2018.

She quickly asked me what the **** is that. I looked and said I did not know. I then picked up my phone and took pictures of the craft. I tried to take a video, but as soon as I tried to change the settings it let off a spectacular flash of red light and sped off back to the west at what was an impossible speed. It was out of sight within a manner of at least a second. 	Thirdly, my first sighting in Obetz occurred around 3:00am in 2016. My son 18 at the time and I were setting out back with my telescope trying waiting for Saturn to come into view.

It had a sphere rotating in and out of the structure at the rear of the object in the middle of the v portion of the boomerang. It had no windows and was upright each point of the tips one pointing toward the sky the other toward the ground.

I estimated it about 400 yards away at about a 45-degree angle from where we sat and from top to bottom around 75ft front to back about 20ft.

With some fireworks still going off, my first thought was it had to be related.  But within seconds I could tell it was coming straight towards us, moving South.  When another fire ball came up behind it, and then another, with a total of 7 round fire lights.  Orange, reddish in color. Coming straight at us. The first one is right over our heads now; we are looking straight up.  The fire ball light was gone. We could only see the bottom of a vehicle; it was in a tear drop shape . NO lights and NO sound . It was a full moon that night so we could see the bottom of this flying thing.  I would say it was traveling about the height of a helicopter flying in a city maybe 200 or 300 yards up.  It was moving at about 20 miles per hour.  A total of 5 vehicles past over us.  The last 2 turned to the East before they reach us.

On the night of 4th of July 2020, my two other buddies and I (all of us friends for 20+ years since high school) were backpacking in the trinity Alps north of Weaverville, Ca.  We had been backpacking 9 miles on the Caribou lake trail into deep wilderness that day.  It was a perfectly clear night, 10:30pm.  We all were talking, sitting by a fire when I saw a bright white light appear over a nearby mountain ridge, stationary, hovering at Upper Caribou Lake.  It hovered for roughly 3 minutes.  It took me by surprise as I thought (at first) it was a planet but it started to slowly move upward, very slowly.  I yelled OMG, UFO.  My two other friends jumped up and by the time we all reached the edge of the lake (away from the treeline) it was gone.  I was the only one that saw this first sighting. Later that night around 11:30pm as we stayed up and moved away from the fire and sat at the lakes edge, one of my friends was alarmed at a series of odd blinking lights straight above are heads.  We all looked up and the lights continued to blink in a random pattern far away from each other, too far apart to be a passing plane.  Weird colors amber, red, then bright white. At one point we saw a streak of light continue into more blinking lights that seemed unattached to any know plane or craft of known origin.  All three of us confirmed the sighting as it happened.  I remember the last set of blinking lights being very intense with a super bright amber light flashing quickly a fair distance away from the other flashing lights we had just witnessed.  This second sighting of the night lasted about two minutes and crossed half way over the visible sky from are vantage point.  We've seen many planes flying at night and this string of flashing lights didn't match up to anything we've ever seen. I will note there was no bangs, or typical sounds related to any fireworks.  Plus, we were in the deep wilderness far away from any nearby town. Lastly, about 30 minutes after the blinking light event, I was standing near one of my friends while the third friend was walking behind us (again near the lakes edge)  The friend closest to me and I felt a strange since of missing time as it felt our third friend had vanished or was suddenly placed sitting on a nearby rock.  The friend sitting on the rock said he was sitting there the whole time.  Granted it was late and we all were very tired at this point, but the fact my buddy closest to me and I felt the same experience caught us by surprise.  We both immediately confirmed the experience and talked about it. These events were odd, as my two friends and I have been backpacking many times in the wilderness and have witnessed several times over the years odd lights in the sky.  But, only when all three of us are together on these hiking trips.  We feel there is some kind of pull towards us being more receptive to these experiences.  Very strange. I could go into more detail about our other sightings over the years but I will keep this short as to be more relevant with this current sighting. Thank you for reading this count. I'm an illustrator/ digital artist and could illustrate the light event if needed for more documentation. Best to you!",2020-07-23T00:00:00,40.7438,-122.9362

The last orb was identical in every way but was bright red. Their size could be compared to about twice the size of Venus on its brightest nights (a few hours before and after sunset).

Background will mildly rolling with numerous houses and apartments visable.  Object was at time below the horizon in a slight valley just to the west of the Bel-ford theater on IL RT 20 which runs between Rockford and Belvidere.  This object was extremely large and seemed massive-heavy but suspended in the air and wobbling slowly like when you spin a frisbee on a string. spin it slowly and then strike one side.  At the time I told Hynek's secretary that I thought that the windows measured about 20' x 70"". 20 wide - 70 high.  In retrospect, I underestimated these dimensions.  Probably more like 50 by 300.  At that time John Anderson from Rockford was running for president.  Haven't heard much about him lately. He lost as a third party candidate.   I am 49 years old now but it is still vivid in our memories.  Most people look us strangely when we mention it.  Neither of us have seen anything similar since.  We also called the Rockford Airport the next day and they said they had seen nothing unusual on rader the night before.  They said it was probably an advertising plane pulling a lighted banner.  Yea, right!  I have never seen an ad plane that makes no sound, flying around at midnight with a lighted sign the size of Commisky Park.  I just gave up trying to convince peiople.  I guess it doesn't really matter anyway.  Sooner or later everyone will see these.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,42.27738134206219,-89.04477790507364

It wasn't a disk but rather toroid in shape and metallic silver.  It was tumbling as it moved north.  In diameter I would say it was approximately 100-200 feet.

I watched this bright orange round light that sat on the horizon over the santa cruz side of Monterey Bay for 20 ish minutes. It was still most of that time. Finally it began slowly pulsing in brightness,  getting so bright that at one point, it turned my binoculars from regular mode to infrared mode by itself. Then it began to move slowly north. Horizontally, along the horizon. It moved slowly away until it was behind the peninsula that is Capitola, yet I could still watch its progress because bright orange rays of light shining up from behind the land gave away its position as it went. Eventually I couldn't see it anymore.  I've been trying to find anyone else who witnessed this. Nothing y! et ... but it was SO bright other people had to have seen it too.

On December 20, 1989 I and two co-workers were on our way to Aspen,CO. We were driving a 24Ft. rental truck loaded with items for our employer's winter home.We were approximately 60-70 miles north-east of Las Vegas when we heard cargo in the rear of the truck shift. I pulled over to check the cargo and found everything secure. We all took this opportunity to stretch our legs and while facing away from the highway and looking in a southerly direction,I noticed six pairs of strobing red lights. They were located on a east-west plane and seemed to be evenly spaced. A large mountain stood in the distance andI later learned that it was Virgin Peak. What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished. This all took place within a matter of seconds, and the pursuing fighters had no chance what so ever to catch these objects. This was truly a hair-raising experience for all of us and we did not waste any time in exiting the area.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

His bark was the bark as if he didn't want to leave the porch but wanted to summon someone in the family.  I went to investigate. Initially I saw nothing.  Then a rectangular craft flew by very slowly. The craft was divided into thirds.  Each third lit up sequentially with a red light.  The object made  no noise whatsover. In addition to the above information there is more to add that is very interesting.  One week later a friend of mine from high school, telephoned me in a panicked state.  Apparently he had seen the same object in the city of Sierra Madre, while on a night hike into Bailey Canyon.  He had stopped to tie his shoe lace while the others continued on the hike.  He stated that the object appeared to lose control and looked as though it were going to crash into the property of Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center.  This is a Catholic retreat center run by the Passionist Fathers. The thing that through us for a loop about this is this.... My friend who had witnessed this event, a week after I had, had gone to the whole life expo in Pasadena,Ca. of that year.  He left the convention being ""paranoid"" of ufo's and aliens.  I was a ""doubting Thomas"".  I suggested that he go and see a psychiatrist.  Nothing more was said about the ufo subject untill the sightings that we  had It was that we had conversed, and realized that we had seen the same craft at two different places and times that there must be connection.  It was almost like as if some intelligence did something to get my dog to bark that night, to get me out of bed to investigate so that I would see this craft. Like I said...I never went to the whole life expo....but It was like as if some intellegent being heard me tell my friend Tony that I thought he was a quack.  And to make it even more believable to us it revealed itself to us...that well we never had many people believe our story except one of the priests at the retreat center with whom we were friends with.I didn't think it necessary to record the dates of the sightings, I didn't anyone  would believe us.

We saw about 5 or 6 bright lights coming up from the ground behind the tree line they were so bright they looked like spotlights shining straight up into the air. I was freaking out telling her to stop so we could see what that was so we slowed down considerebly then these lights started to turn in a complete circle all at the same time. We were both going Oh my God what the hell is that?!!! Then the lights just started crisscrossing over one another very fast. I was still begging her to stop so we could watch them but she was afraid of getting in trouble for being late for curfew already so we just drove off. I believe this was a ufo on the ground there are no buildings or houses around where this happened only fields and trees a fairly rural area. This is one of the strangest things I have ever seen. I don't remember the exact date I only remember it was late spring or early summer in 1989 My friend Kristie VanBrunt and myself were driving westbound on highway 51 to her house we were going to be late for curfew and she didnt want to get in trouble. We were just driving along talking and all of a sudden out of the corner of my right eye I see these incredibly bright white lights shining straight up into the sky there were about 5 or 6 of them and they were arranged in a circle the lights were behind the tree line coming up from the ground. I was like WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!! and told my friend to stop the truck so we could see she wouldn't stop partly out of fear of her parents and the fact she did not know what we were seeing but we did slow down to about 10 miles per hour there were no cars in either direction as far as we could see which was unusual. The lights started to turn around in a big circle  they stayed in their posistion but the whole thing was turning slowly at first then very fast. Then the lights just started going crazy criss crossing each other and we were both just staring with our jaws wide open in disbelief at what we were seeing I started screaming  to stop but she wouldn't.

Video shown on 2 different episodes of ""Unsolved Mysteries"". In 1992, 4 of us were able to capture on video some of the maneuvers of the ""Area 51"" object.  It shows the craft hovering, then moving down the ridge line until it disappears.   Also on video, the morning sequence which showed the craft pulsate and become brighter.  This is the segment used on Unsolved Mysteries.  Once it became totally dark it was nearly impossible to capture all of the maneuvers on video.  This thing could go from horizon to horizon in just seconds.  It would fly just like a meteor, stop on a dime, then go in a completely different direction.  We all saw the craft become brighter,almost as if it were gaining energy, then shoot across the sky.  After doing several maneuvers, the light would become dim, then go out.  The other 3 said,""it just disappeared"", but I was looking thru binoculars and saw what appeared to be an egg shape craft with the slightest pearlescent green glow. I watchedit go out of range.  The craft would be gone for approx. 45 minutes, then at the exact same time, all 4 of us heared a high pitch frequency ""inside"" our heads.  Then instantly, the object would appear.  I saw thru the binos what appeared to be some sort of docking with a larger ship.  There were several smaller ships throughout the evening which appeared to me as if they were helicopters observing from a distance.  I am a private pilot and a former Marine.  I've spent alot of time around planes and helo's.  This main craft was definitely not one of those.   Finally, what seemed to bother all of us the most was toward dawn, the craft came to a stop, and almost appeared to mimic a star.  It stayed in rotation with the rest of the stars 'till dawn.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,,

Dear Mr. Davenport, I was driving home, East, on Ohio SR 32, and I know that it was 8:41 pm when the incident began because I have a clock in the center of my dashboard.  It is important to note for you, sir, that this area was about 50 miles south by south-east of Wright-Patterson AFB as the crow flies.  I was driving under clear, blue skies with the sun in my rear view still 5-10 degrees above the western horizon.  Off to the East, some 30-40 miles directly in front of me, the entire eastern sky was filled with a storm front of continuous, towering, thunderheads of bright white clouds, highly illuminated by the bright sun in the clear sky behind me.  Myself, having flown for business numerous times via commercial airlines, I could see that these thunderheads extended up several thousand feet for which I believe an airplane would have needed to fly at about 38,000 feet to remain in the clear as from my own past experiences flying through and above these type storms.  Slightly south of due East, one thunderhead significantly exceeded all the others in its altitude because there appeared to be a significant and massive disturbance within this particular cloud.  I can only estimate, but to the best of my ability, I truly believe that this disturbance measured at its center and in its rotation to be some 15-20 miles in diameter.  And this disturbance also extended itself to the very top and center of this cloud, as the cloud seemed to be ejecting a thin, circular translucent vapor in a smaller circle, perfectly center above the main disturbance beneath and no more than one-fourth to one-sixth the diameter of the main disturbance.  And it did not appear to be any natural air or storm-front rotation from wind shear as the rotation was to perfect to be completely natural. Nor did it seem to be generated by the storm front itself as the rest of the front and the other thunderheads were moving in a smooth pattern toward the East by East-Southeast.  The swirling cloud genuinely appeared to outline the form of a massive, disc shaped object which seemed to use the trailing edge to conceal itself just in front of the opaque whiteness of the concealing cloud cover.  This swirling continued with this thunderhead for at least 15-18 miles as I now chased after this leading storm.  I was driving right at 70 MPH attempting to close in on the disturbance.  I cannot say exactly why, but I was certain that I was about to see something significant or perhaps even spectacular emerging from this cloud of concealment.  And then I saw it!  Not the 15-20 mile diameter object I had hoped to witness, but instead a flat-grey disc above the storm front, but just to the right of the smaller, upper disturbance.  This disc had climbed out of the main disturbance and wa! s climbing very slowly at about 30 degrees above horizontal.  The disc was not perfectly parallel to the horizontal, but if one were to draw a straight line through the disc, from edge to edge, I would estimate that the straight line would be almost exactly 30 degrees to the horizontal.  And then, the disc leveled off, and seemed to be moving with the cloud in the same relative position and direction, but now out of its concealment.  Also, Mr. Davenport, as I stated previously, I had several encounters with disc-shaped objects in the skies when I was younger, the last time being when I was only 17.  I am 55 now, and in all those previous encounters, the disc was bright silver in coloration, as though it were made of polished stainless steel or bright, new, silver aluminum.  This disc, however, is the first I have ever seen which appeared to be flat grey, what I might call automotive, primer grey.  And even though it was not the 15-20 mile disc I had hoped to see, this disc ! was nonetheless, at least five times the size in diameter as c! ompared to any jetliner I have ever seen.  I grew up here and have lived here my entire life about 65 miles south by southeast of Wright-Patterson AFB.  I have attended the Dayton, Ohio airshows numerous times, and I have had a fascination with the skies since I can remember.  As a child it was not uncommon to count 12-14 jetliners in the visible skies here in southern Ohio at any one time on a clear day.  And I have also witness those same planes flying over and above similar clouds, given me a relative perspective I can easily recall from memory.  So, when I state the relative size, I speak with some confidence.  The time I witnessed the actual, flat-grey disc was for no more than 3-4 minutes.  I was trying to get to an are about 2-3 miles east of Winchester, Ohio, where I might exit my car and video it with my camera, unobstructed from trees and power lines.  Unfortunately, as easily as the disc emerged from the cloud and from concealment, remaining perfectly horizontal now, it m! oved back into the cloud cover.  This whole time, the larger disturbance too, had also continued, just in front of the trailing edge of the cloud.  I think I also need to note here that the cloud was bright white when I first noticed the disturbance, but as time went by, this massive cloud changed color from bright white, to light orange, to amber, to red, to lavender and finally to the dark grey of an active storm front.  I could so no lights through the cloud, nor did I see any lights on the flat-grey disc at any time during the encounter.  I can only attribute, by logic and reason, the change in coloration of the cloud to the setting sun behind me.  Now, this disturbance also slowly dissipated until the trailing edge was just as smooth as the other clouds beside it within the storm front.  I shall attempt to draw up an illustration of my experience while it is still fresh in my memory, but it may take me a few days or up to week to get it to you, sir, as I have a full wo! rk load at this time.  Thank you for recording my ramblings, a! nd good luck in your quest for truth!",2020-07-23T00:00:00,,

I was standing out on my 4th story balcony taking videos of the lightening (we had a severe thunderstorm warning). After a few minutes of recording, I saw from my North East point of view what looked like a huge deep orange fireball moving way faster than an aircraft.  It was not blinking. It was flying super fast in a Western direction. I estimate around 800 mph high in the atmosphere--as it was moving much faster than the (normal red, white, and blue) blinking airplanes headed towards the Orlando International Airport. I at first thought it was a meteor in the atmosphere that came too close, or maybe the international space station, or even a lantern someone let off, but realized it wasn't any of those things. This fireball orb also had a faint white glow around the orange on the exterior. It's brightness fluctuated. It kept its path but seemed to slow down and speed up as it went...It then got smaller, darted, and completely disappeared into thin air.  About 1-2 minutes later another identical looking fireball darted from the exact same direction and headed in the same direction at the same speed, also before completely vanishing around the same area. Before the 2nd fireball orb vanished, it remained in the same place in the sky. I actually took a video of these first 2 that I will email.  The 3rd glowing fireball was much further to my north peaking in and out of the trees (you could tell it was much further away), getting brighter and fainter repetitively until it too, vanished. (this 3rd one was too distant to get on camera but I witnessed it).  I have footage of the first 2 glowing orb fireballs on my iPhone.

I will edit my footage so that you can see those parts in slow-motion.  The space launch sight (Cape Canaveral) is more to my South-East and I see the launches. I saw the historical launch today. While the rockets look orange in the dark, they have a super specific trajectory and are far more distant. There were also no other launches today. These fireballs were pretty sizable, much closer, and flying then disappearing. I know what I saw and it was nothing like the rocket launches, didn't look like any of the airplanes, and these glowing orb fireballs looked like nothing I had ever seen before.

I could see the ""airplane""better at this point and I suspected that it was a helicopter because of the slow speed.

I've seen helicopters do this in my capacity as a Police Officer, and I was worried that someone might have been badly injured in my neighborhood.

We decided to go there because it was very dark and it was basically a large field in which we could park our pickup.  We had binoculars and a mid-size telescope with us.  As we were watching the meteor shower, we all noticed moving, starlike points which changed color from white to red.  There were 3 such objects, and they appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (at least where commercial aircraft would fly).  They were mostly directly above us or at least 3/4 up from the horizon.  We were not certain of their altitude since there were no reference points.  Through binoculars the objects appeared to be executing extremely high-speed maneuvers (looping and passing close to one another) and they could accelerate or turn VERY quickly.  The telescope was impossible to use while viewing the objects because of their speed.  There is no way these were planes, helicopters, meteors, or flyin!g insects like fireflies (there are no fireflies that change color or live west of the Rockies).  I have no clue about what they were.  I would like it if someone e-mailed me regarding this, if it's possible.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,,

While on active duty and attached to NAS Fallon, NV, I witnessed 3 strange lights cross the field during the spring of 94'.  I don't remember the exact date but I do remember the day and time.  It was a Saturday evening minutes after 18:00, the field had just closed.   I stepped outside of the ""old"" tower, which houses the weather office and flight filing services,to observe the twilight.  It was very quiet as was typical for a Saturday evening after the field closes, no planes, no engines, no cars, you could hear a pin drop (almost).  I was facing east looking at the mountains which are about 35 miles away.  The objects or lights caught my eye to the south and I turned my head to view them.  I saw three ""solid"" coloredlights traveling abreast, moving north, at a relatively high rate of speed, they appeared to be about 2500' AGL and about 10 miles south.  The two on the outside were red and the one in the middle was white (unfourtunately I am colored blind and cannot be 100% sure of the colors but two were definately dark and one was light).   The objects wers solid colored and appeared to be ""lit"" or illuminated rather than reflected light.  I observed no strobes or marker lights of the kind you would expect to see on conventional aircraft and they were silent.  I could not discern any particular shape or other features of any kind, they just appeared to be circular or oval.    About ten seconds into the sighting the red or ""outside""objects seemed to jet or rocket forward at a tremendous rate of speed for 3-4 seconds then, just as abrubtly, resume their previous rate of speed.  At the same instant that the red ones slowed down the white one, which had been in the center duplicated the maneuver, catching up and resuming it's previous position in the center.   This happened two more times and by this time the craft were to my north and heading out of site.  When they were abreast or directly to my east, they seemed to be about 5-7 miles away.  At this particular site you can see about 75 miles to the south and about 100 miles to the north.   The three things that struck me as strange were: 1)  The solid colored lighting with no detectable conventionalmarkings or lighting.  2)  The strange and abrubt maneuvering.  3)  The sound, there wasn't any.  At the time I was a USN trained weather observer/forecaster with 10 years of experience.  I had been working at this particular location for a little over two years and was used to identifing military and commercial aircraft of all types.   I later asked a local resident, a former WWII Army Air Corp veteran who still flew privately, if he had ever seen anything unusual in this area.  He said yes, but would not elaborate.  I've thought that maybe they were something from Dreamland or Area 51, which is reportedly just to the south of this location, approximately halfway to Nellis AFB.   But who knows, I may have imagined the whole thing.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,39.503644,-118.30940000000001

I initially thought it was a planet or star, but it was slowly moving towards the North and getting larger, which appeared to me as seeming to get closer. I watched as it slowly continued to move, until it stopped, almost as if directly in front of my view. It was about the same size as might a pea be if held at arm’s length.  I got my cell phone camera out and started recording video. It was stopped for about 10 seconds, then it doubled in size (like a dime at arm’s length) without moving.  It then slowly moved in a straight line to the right (north), stopped again, and then got as large as a nickel at arm’s length. The size changes were like a balloon quickly being blown up by a helium tank, not instantaneous. It then started to slowly move North as it gradually got smaller.  It was at this time that I ! ran in the house and got my girlfriend out of the shower to come see it.  When she came out, it had moved a lot further to the North, but it was still visible to her.  While we watched it slowly faded out as if going behind clouds or something, but it appeared to be a clear night.

It was at that time that I observed a band of 5 lights which moved in an approximate west to east path. The lights moved in unison and I first believed them to be lights along a\the wings and underside of a small plane.  As I live in relative proximity to an airport, small planes are a common occurrence. As the lights moved closer, I found that I could not make out any tail lights, nor could I hear any engine noise. I observed that the lights continued their course until passing directly overhead. Even as the lights were in a “High Noon” position directly above, I still could not discern any tail lights or sound. There can be traffic noise from the nearby highway at times, but did not notice any at the time, allowing for the realization of the absence of engine noise.  The lights continued their course until finally passing out of sight over the roof of the building. As near as I can remember, all of the lights were of a white colour, or absent of any other colour. I can not approximate the height of the lights, but they were too low to have come from or to be heading to the airport unless they had just taken off or were coming in to land, but as the lights were not heading towards/away from the airport, but rather in a parallel direction, that did not seem to be the case. Also, at the height that they were flying, I feel that engine noise and/or presence of a tail light should have been apparent.  The weather on the night in question was seasonably pleasant and dry with some noticeable light wind at times. At the time of the sighting, it had not yet reached a point of full dark, but the sun had already gone down some time before. A few stars were visible, I do not remember the stage that the moon was at at the time.The parking lot area where I was standing is quite well lit and the sky was extremely clear providing good visibility.  Although I was unable to clearly make out the outline or shape surrounding the lights, they were in a straight line and left the impression of a wing or set of wings. The lights moved in unison as if affixed to a wing, traveling parallel to each other and not led by one light, with the other lights following.  Normally I would ascribe a sighting like this to a plane as, as I have said, they are common and usually readily recognizable. In this case however, the above mentioned anomalies have left me with the impression that this was somehow different and that impression has been nagging and constant ever since.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,42.8915,-71.2787

As we finished our walk and were returning to our driveway around 8:15 PM, I am enjoying the view of the stars for the first time in weeks, as there has been terrible smoke cover for over a month due to the wildfires.  As I'm looking south at the stars, I noticed one of these stars is moving across the sky.  It looked JUST like a star, very bright, white light; however, it was 4-5x larger than a star typically looks.  We observed carefully as it tracked overhead for 2-3 minutes; there were definitely no flashing lights or any changes in the brightness; however, it did appear to veer from side to side changing course several times (although this could have been imagined, I don't know for sure).  About 75% accross the sky towards the opposite horizon, the light begins to shimmer into more of a reflection, and slowly vanishes in clear view, long before reaching the horizon.  While! I am not saying that this was 100% a UFO, I am confident it was NOT an aircraft, missile, or satellite. It had no flashing lights, red or white; it made no noise, and was WAY too high to be a helicopter. It was dead quiet out, and if it was a plane, we can always hear their engines several seconds late. I will say that I do have a personal interest in UFOs, so it may be a confirmation bias; but at the same time, it was a very strange light that I've never seen anything like before, and did look very similar to other videos I've seen that made a strong case for being a true unidentified flying object.  When checking off Characteristis below, this triggered a memory; about 2 minutes before seeing this light, i noticed an airplane with solid, yellow lights on the bottom in a triangular shape. I made note of this to my wife as it seemed odd to see a plane in flight with solid illumination lights on the bottom like this, in addition to their flashing red/white traffic lights. I am not sure if this is related or not but figured I should mention. It was travelling in the same direction as the ball of light, about 1-2 minutes before the ball of light was seen. This plane did not make a noise either (I guess we can hear planes if they are low enough/increasing elevataion? Must've been at cruising altitude but strange to see it close enough to make out these details and not hear it).",2020-11-05T00:00:00,37.90372453531598,-122.05358215613383

On the night of August 8, 2020 I decided to sleep on my back deck (for the first time ever) to look at the stars and perhaps the Milky Way if visible.  I had just entered my sleeping bag when I noticed what I thought was possibly a satellite moving across the sky.  It looked like the size of a planet, larger than a star.  Then I noticed another moving ""star"" directly behind the first moving object.  It was not as brilliant but was in a direct line behind the first---at quite a distance away.  I waited to see if it would overtake the leading object, but it never varied in distance. Both ""stars"" moved without sound and at a very slow, deliberate pace, almost like a zeppelin.   They moved t! oo slow to be a airplane.  As it moved forward, North by Northeast, the front ""star"" seemed to fade as if going into a cloud or haze.  However, neither of these conditions were evident. Meanwhile the trailing ""star"" seemed to fade as well but took on a red dim glow.  It did not flash,blink or strobe.  (The front ""star"" never change color). At one point both ""stars"" nearly disappeared only to momentarily become brilliant and then again fade.  All this while, they maintained the same exact distance in an exact straight line.  I looked to see if any surrounding stars were blocked out to reveal a shape between the two ""stars"".  I noted no shape what so ever.  However, if this was some sort of ""airship"", it would have been huge in length.  I gazed at the ""stars"" until they left my range of view.  No change in direction or sudden velocity variances.  Just a slow and deliberate cruise.  It was also very high in ! altitude.

We were outside laying in the grass, we live in a rural farming country area. We have soybean crops in our fields. We were outside only about 20ish mins when I had seen my first perseid. Then immediately after looking towards the big Dipper I saw a flash of light slowly dissipate. I thought it was odd and it stuck in my mind for a lil bit but then I forgot about it as we laid there talking and staring up.  About 15 mins and 2 perseids later, at the same time, we both witnessed what looked like a very very dim star but it was moving, FAST. It was not blinking. It was circular and dim lit. We watched it go from one end of the sky to the other is a super quick succession. And I thought why wasn't it blinking like a plane. I chalked it up to be too far away but as it got closer to the treeline if the northwest sky, some clouds came and and the object had to have been right above the clouds becau! se we suddenly saw a spotlight on the clouds that was coming from the object. But the object was still sooooo dim and you couldn't see the light coming from the craft but u could see it on the clouds. Like it was some form of ultraviolet light my eyes couldn't see but illuminated on the clouds. Then we saw two of the lights over the clouds hovering then disappeared. We were trying to debunk the entire thing and forget what we saw because we couldn't believe it. So we focused back in the sky. A few mins later looking up southwest directly above me , while I was staring up, a dim lit ""star"" that was suspended not moving suddenly flashed sooooo incredibly bright then went dim and I o served the same kind of object moving extremely fast through the sky and it went all the way north till it was near the clouds again and I witnessed the ""spotlight"" in the clouds again. It was then I remembered the first flash of light by the big Dipper and I realized this was ! weird. I The objects had no contrails or anything. But I'm gonna be honest, either the multiple crafts we witnessed were communicating through the flashes or I felt like , in some weird way, which I know this crazy, but I felt like they almost noticed that we noticed them. I have no idea how. It was so strange. Everything got extremely eerie so we decided to go in. That was a little after 2300hrs. I couldn't sleep last night and this is all I keep thinking of and I'm scared. So I found this website to report it and get it off my chest.  But I keep thinking how they are out there.

He is shouting LOOK LOOK!  Finally I see what appears to be an aircraft. If I had to say what it actually appeared like I would say it reminded me of a Lear jet shape. It left no vapor trails like jets typically leave. To judge its speed I will use what a person typically sees from a jet trail. This craft went 10 to15 times as fast in a Northern direction and then suddenly turned to the East and disappeared. The sky was without clouds.  If I had to judge altitude I would say it was near the same altitudes that jet liners fly.  The craft shimmered from the sunlight but looked the same as what an airliner would look like.  At the time of the si! ghting it was hard to envision the actual speed of the craft.  After the encounter I thought about the amount of sky that this craft covered ...  The speed can only be gauged from a reference of the normal trails of jetliners.  This craft covered in five seconds time what you would see an aircraft cover in 30 to 50 seconds.  It was only after the encounter did I realize what I saw! A lso there were no other aircraft vapor trails in the sky this evening.,2020-06-25T00:00:00,45.1116,-91.1206

He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it's true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it's the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters don;t leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can't stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don't care who says they don't.

This event occured a little over two years ago while my then fiancee and I were camping in one of my favorite and extremely remote locations just north of Wupatki National Monument in Arizona.  We both witnessed the event for its duration and had both worked as National Park Rangers prior to this sighting.  I havn't reported this officially until now because I thought we were probably the only ones to see such a thing, and that few would believe us.  Recent news reports of sightings in that exact area promted me to write this in the case it could be helpful.  My fiance and I split up not too long after this event and havn't spoken since.  She could be contacted for independent verification, if someone wanted to do so.  She was really frightened by what happened and hence missed some of what I saw, but I think she saw the majority of what I am about to report.  The incidident:  I drove out cross-country to my favorite area in my 4Runner and parked it facing East, about 100 ya!rds from the edge of a long, low mesa extending North and South.  The landscape dropped off to the East towards the Little Colorado River and the Navajo Res.  We built a campfire near my lowered tailgate and began to enjoy the evening.  At one point, I was sitting on the tailgate facing West while my fiance was tending the fire.  I looked straight up at the sky, and in my peripheral vision caught sight of a blinking light.  At first, I just thought it was an airplane, but I noticed it wasn't moving at all.  Then, I noticed from 5-7 other blinking lights in the same general quadrant of the sky--and outstretched hand would probably ""capture"" the space they all occupied.  I think they were whitish blue, but they may have been light red (I'm sorry, I really can't recall exactly) and were not blinking in unison.  None were moveing at all.  This is why I kept watching them and told my fiance to look at them.  Then, we saw a lazer-like pulse of light shoot from one to another.  I thi!nk I saw this happen 2, maybe 3 times.  Then we noticed a whitish yellow light--much like a distant headlight--travelling near the ground in the distance ahead (East) of us.  At first I thought it was a car or motorcyle--but I've never seen any other person out as far as I went, and certainly never at night... About the time I was beginning to worry that it was someone travelling toward I light, it went up and then back down a few degrees offf the horizen.  It continued to repeat this as it travellied along.  Most of the terrain there is fairly level, so I started doubting it was a car.  I put out the fire and had my fieance turn off her headlamp (she was too scared to do so).  When I looked back at the whitish light, it was apparently moving in our direction--but I couldn't tell how far away it was...at one point I thought for certain it was only 50 yards in front of us.  But there was no sound at all, so I figured I must be wrong.  Then we looked back up to the sky to see if!the other lights were still there; they were.  But when we looked out to the East for the whitish light, it was gone.  Then I noticed the same bluish or reddish (I think blue) lights blinking in the NW sky!  They had moved from the SE to the NW.  And then, to the N, we saw the whitish light travelling along the ground again...going up and down periodically like no car or earthbound vehicle could have done.  I t was almost as if it was searching for something.  Then it disappeared and the lights in the NW sky were gone too.  We slept in the back of my truck and had a restless night's sleep.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen (though we both did sight one UFO each when much younger).  I always wondered if the military was conducting some advanced lazer weaponry by sattelites--but this never does quite explain the white object hovering near the ground.....The next day, oberservations of the terrain in the directions we saw the white light made it even more clear that it!could not have been a vehicle.  Background information:  I was 33 at the time, and my fiance 29.  We both have bachelors degrees and some other training.  We were very healthy and didn't do any drugs or drink alcohol, etc.  We had each worked as National Park Rangers, and I was/am more of a skeptic than anything else.  I used to love to read the Skeptical Inquirerer!  Now I am more open to various possibilities, but I still thing it could have been some type of military operation.  I sure would like to know!

I'm starting to wonder if we were looking at something that , maybe..droped us off?I know how that sounds. This is gut feeling purely. First, this is all in retrospect, accuacy would require meeting with ex-girlfriend due to my lack of memory regarding anything prior to that sight.Sholl Canyon Park, top of Glenoaks Blvd, in Glendale, CA. A park is there where we would go to spend time  together, ie, the view..a couple thing. I recall being in the middle of the street with her, walking uphill, it seems we both recognized it at the same time.  Three points of lights (all red) forming a triangle shape.  We were walking up hill maybe eastbound  facing the mountains, Mt Wilson to be more accurate.  What got our attention was my saying, ""shsss, I can't hear anything""  Approx; (3) other white lights were in it's immediate vacinity. I say approx, because the Burbank Glendale skies are always lit up considering the Burbanks airport. My closest comparison would be this description. I though maybe it was three different helicopters flying in a triangle formation.  Being that the lights were lower that the top of Mt wilson, that tells me it was very close ( a few miles if that) Only no blinking lights that usually gives us a human identification. I don't know if yo!u could see through the center   because it was the same color as the backround mountains, which is black. Anyway we both stood like dazed children, lost in the middle of the street. And watched it move slowly north untill it looked like it vanish behind Burbanks city lights. not once did we here anything we could associate with what we know is in our skies.  And for some reason I dismissed it and labled it three helicopters., because if it wasn't three different light sources generating that triangular or greater than sign "" < ""  tilt that about 90 degrees, so that the bottom light is where the rear propeller would be a single craft. If it wasn't 3 choppers, then it was truly massive in my eyes. No sound what so ever, no wind no traffic, no nothing but us talking and saying ""look at that!"" ""what is that""? ""shhh, let me listen"" In retrospect, I wonder, is it a valid possibility, ...ok, hear it go..that we were looking at something that dropped us off?..I'm not mental or at lea!st no ones labled me that, yet. I say this because, we simply did not have the excitement that I feel now. It's like remembering a faint dream, or just residue of a dream.

I just found this web page, and when I saw the report logs, I excitedly went to June 1995. There is a report of an object seen on the 7th in another state that is remarkably similar to what I observed on June  1995. The other witnesses, who were my co-workers did not report this event, as we did not know how to go about doing so. The following is an account of what we saw. The details are not hazy in my memory, as they are burned into my mind- they could never be forgotten.I work at a Bungee jump tower in Golden CO. I am the supervisor of five employees that run the jump tower each day. At 6pm, one of my employees remarked how the clouds in the sky, when observed from the ground with the backdrop of the tower, made the tower appear to move.(the wind was blowing the clouds) I looked up, along with another employee, and noticed that this was true. Gazing at the sky behind the tower, something caught my eye. At first I thought it was an airplane, as it appeared to be at the same altitude as a plane taking off from DIA would. But then it abruptly changed directions. I pointed this out to the other employees. We then observed the object for about ten or fifteen minutes. The object was reflecting the sunlight, and therefore was flashing in the daytime sun. After five minutes or so, it appeared that the object was getting closer. We could then tell that the object appeared to be a metallic shaft with two round ends, like a barbell. The flashing was cau!sed by the object rotating irratically, and wobbling back and forth. I suggested that it was simply two mylar balloons caught in the wind, but then we noticed the same clouds previously mentioned, and the object was moving opposite these wind blown clouds, ruling out the balloon idea. Then, after approximately seven minutes of observation the object changed directions and headed back the opposite direction. The object did not seem to be getting closer at this point, but we then noticed a faint greyish foggy halo surrounding the object. At this point two customers came to the jump, and inquired as to what we were gaping at. They observed the object as well. After a maximum of fifteen tense minutes of observing this anomoly, the object changed course abruptly, went behind a small, thin, transparent cloud, and dissapeared. I would appreciate any information regarding this sitghting, i.e. whether the similar sighting in your log is of similar circumstances. Since 1995 I have been w!rithing to get this reported, and am very grateful for this service.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,39.74054676258993,-105.26999208633094

I’m showing off my astronomy skills so my girlfriend asks “what is that star?” I look at it and it’s really really high up to be a plane or a helicopter. It was whiteish with seemingly red flashes. I must have been staring at it for ten straight minutes and it begins dancing in the sky! It still look like a star at this point but the movements were totally unnatural, up, down, left, sideways, diaganol, and the speeds it must have been moving at weren’t possible.  That’s when it happened. As we’re staring at the first UFO, a second UFO appears hovering maybe two streets behind our house, at a height of a 4 story building. We got an incredible view of it because it has flown so close. My best description would be that it looked Roomba (robot vacuum cleaner) hovering in the air. It was too dark to accurately report a color. Looked darker and metallic maybe. It was circular and seemingly to totally flat! on top and bottom. I would guesstimate that it wasn’t very large, maybe the size of a small circular coffee table.  It wasn’t rotating at all. I could tell because it had this bright blinking red light like a security camera and some dimmer white lights built in, but the lights weren’t spinning and the red flashing light was aimed right at us the entire time. This creeped us out because it almost looked like it knew we were looking and was looking back at us. Moving so so slow through the sky. At first I thought a neighbor kid might have a drone, but as it did a fly by, I quickly realized no drone would look like that. There were no propellor, a very light whooshhhhhhhhh sound was made, and it glided through the air but so so slowly. Felt like 5 mph. This part of the experience last 2 minutes or so, but it was enough to scare us to go inside.

It glides by quickly and silently, then disappears My husband and I had just finished dinner at the restaurant at our Honeymoon Resort when we decided to walk along the beach back to our rooms. Most of the resort guests were at a barbeque on the nearby (50 yards away) island called Kokomo, so the resort was fairly quiet and we were alone, except for maybe an employee now and then. We decided to stop and enjoy the stars. We were both silently enjoying the view when I noticed a huge black object. ( I cannot however, determine how far away it was) it cast a slight reflection on the underneath side of it, as if the moon were glowing on it. The only way to describe the shape is to say it looked like a large stingray without a tail sailing through the sky. It did not make a sound, and it lasted only seconds. I could not figure out what I had seen, I hesitated, and then asked my husband if he had seen it too. He said yes, and said he was glad I had seen it because he though it was his imagination. We tried to explain it to ourselve!s, but the only thing we could come up with was that maybe it was a large black bird gliding over the water. But the only birds we had ever seen near the bay were totally white. The bird would have also had to have been within 5 feet in front of us to appear so large. We would have seen the bird clearly because the resort had small lamps that lit the nearby walkways, and we were able to view a gazebo that stretched out in front of us about 25 feet away. We tried unsuccessfully to see the object again, and finally gave up after about 15 minutes. I don't really recall the exact moment of the sighting, because it happened over a year ago, but we did immediately tell our family about in when we returned home.

Parked on a pullout near the top of the ridgetop. Saw red-green halo light moving across opposite ridgetop where no road existed.  Traversed ridge at medium speed then stopped, shot up to higher altitude, performed some unusual aerial manuevers before parking in the sky to the SE. It was soon joined by another identical light which also became stationary.  A large, flat, silent dark perfect triangular craft came down between the two lights and proceeded directly by them up the valley. It flew below the top of the ridge and was clearly visible for 30 seconds to a minute before it passed out of sight. The two lights remained where they were and were visible even after daylight. ""Dunn sighting"" two. The brothers were hunting near Highland Springs and were again sitting in their truck parked in a pullout near the ridgetop facing east, looking out over the valley between them and the opposite ridge.  It was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. Suddenly a light appeared to the NE over the opposite ridge.  They both thought it was a vehicle at first but having hunted the ridge they knew there was no road there only brush.  At brushtop height and as large as a truck the light progressed along the ridge.  Viewing it with a 20power spotting scope they describe it as a redish-green pulsing light with a clear white light in the middle.they didn't know what it was but were able to follow it in the scope,(on a tripod), until it reached the end of the ridge to the SE. There it 'jumped' back and forth in the sky for a number of minutes. They were unable to keep it in the viewfinder during these 'jumps'.  It then became stationary in the sky.  After a while, from the SE and much further away, a second identical light appeared and flew toward the first one, joining it slightly further to the west but also stationary.  The two lights never moved again.  About 04:30 a large flat, dark and perfectly triangular craft came from between the two lights.  At first they thought it was a plane but it came directly down the canyon they were looking out over, from SE to NW, and lower than the opposite ridge.  It flew at a steady crusing speed and made no sound except for the sound of air being pushed, like a hissing breeze. There was a slight haloed gaseous effect coming from the craft that made it difficult to observe with !the scope but didn't affect the nnaked eye.  A single spotting clear light shone out ahead from the middle underside of the craft.  What appeared to be windows also were apparent.  They both felt that if they could see it, it could see them and they felt like sitting ducks!  However they were not as frightened as the first time they witnessed a sighting. The way it cruised by reminded them of tourists driving through town.  They estimated it at approximately 25 yards wide.  As it passed two red lights, like taillights shone out from the back of the craft.  They waited for the noise but none came.  They stayed at the spot until dawn, viewing the two original bright lights.  These lights remained in exactly the same location and were so bright they could still be observed after daylight.  They finally got tired of watching and drove home.  Two interesting questions are posed by their two sightings in different wilderness locations.  Either they are simply fortunate to have been !in the direct paths, away from civilization, of these vehicles and their sightings are mere coincidences, or the crafts flew by them purposely.  In both cass they were entirely visible to any vehicle at a higher altitude from great distances away.  Also it seems outlandishly coincidental that they just happened on the particular routes of these crafts, when miles of alternative wilderness areas exist. It may also indicate a similar flight pattern of wilderness routing though it seems odd that if this routing exists to decrease sightings, no attempt was made to hide themselves from these two entirely visible observers.  The Dunn's are totally reputable men, from midland farm families, as down to earth as you can get!  They never even considered the possibility of what they witnessed until it was before them.  they still exhibit some fear as to the identity and purpose of the crafts and have not discussed or reported the events publicly. But they are now watching continually.  D!unn sighting one contains the report of their first sighting as well as their most recent land -based phenomena sighting.  They are taking me to the sights soon. I'm looking forward to it!    wolf",1998-03-07T00:00:00,39.0429,-122.9158

It was the size of a medium sized star and  fairly far away. The object caught my attention by leaving a bright yellow and orange trail down toward earth at about an attitude of 40 degrees above the horizon which lasted for about 20-30 seconds before it disappeared from the highest point of origin to the lowest.  It was round and tiny like a medium magnitude star and appeared at the time of the orange trail's disappearance and proceeded to move about directly East and perfectly parallel to the horizon, not appearing to lose any altitude at all.  I noted the time at the initial observation and it travelled eastward for 5 minutes before it disappeared over some high cirrus or haze.It appeared to be NNW of me,  perhaps over Orlando around a hundred miles away.I checked and there were no shuttles up that night.

This time of year, there is a lot of that and rain.  It only happened once so I thought nothing of it. A few minutes later, I see it again, but it makes me think it may be plane ‘headlight’. Both occurrences are happening in a southerly direction.  As I work at a military facility I, again, did not pay close attention.  Upon exiting the facility, I noticed that the ‘headlight’ I had seen minutes before was now more southwest, but moved more like a search light.  We had overcast skies and I was not able to spot a helicopter or plane. It now had my attention as I drove, because while it resembled a search/spotlight, the movement was erratic. I hoped to see it again. I was able to spot it again approximately 7-10 minutes later and probably 4 miles from the military facility.  The light was still located southwest.  I turned into an ! industrial area with less trees and low building to keep it in sight. The light were now more to south again but, even with less light pollution, I was not able to find a ground light source.  Spotlights that want you to find a location; I know from experience. There is a ray that radiates up into the sky. There was no ray from the ground. I noticed that the light was radiating, like a lighthouse (I am not on a coast and the direction from which the light was radiating was even more inland) rotating around a center point, but I could see the light all the way around without interruption. The radius of movement was far enough apart it required me to turn my head to follow it. I pulled over and began recording the light.  I recorded for approximately two minutes.  I began heading home, but thought it would be better to have another witness to the light and contacted a friend I knew would be awake at 22:38.  She was able to see the light while we were on the phone and her home is approximately 3 miles from where I was located.  She said her roommate had seen the light one his way home from a convenience store. We monitored the lights as I drove. Confirming we were ab! le to see the same lights and the same pattern of movement. The lights were spinning in a clockwise motion, rhythmically, and then it would stop, in an easterly position pause for 2-3 seconds before starting again counterclockwise. It would stop, reverse again, and rotate faster in the clockwise position before returning to the rhythmic spin.  We got off the phone so she too could record a video. I had my 15 year old come outside and view the lights when I got home (I live about 8 miles from the military facility; my child’s friend had mentioned the spotlight was visible from her home 9 miles south of our location via a social media forum.  I asked if my child was able to see a ray of light from the ground and no, was not visible. Now that I did not have to divide my focus, I watched the light, could see that the light seemed almost flat, and looked high in the sky.  It was similar to shining a flat bicycle flashlight at the ground in front of you so the light spreads far and flat.  I could see passing puffy clouds, but the light did not appear to penetrate the clouds so the light was not near me, and/or not below the passing clouds. The movement remained the same, but I was not able to record the light, as my battery was too low on my phone.  While observing the light it appeared to get thinner, brighter, and/or wider. I was able to see that the cloud density effected the light penetration.  The light was definitely coming from the sky and not the ground. There was texture/color variance to the clouds the light had been ‘white’ during most of the event.  It appeared a little more yellow when it was brighter, however I do not know if that was because of the clouds or the light itself. The light stoppe! d one more time easterly, before it began to spin again and was gone.  I stopped seeing the light at approximately 2300 and it did not return. I did not witness a craft of any kind during this encounter.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,30.128008631578947,-81.75236315789473

The first sighting on April 1 was out my bedroom window as I was lying in bed, in the northwest sky appearing over national forest land.  It was by far the brightest light in the sky and at first appeared to be a bright star such as Venus.  But after an hour in bed watching it, close persistent observation showed it to be moving with abrupt changes in direction, circular motions and other erratic movements . It ‘sparkled’ and seemed to fade in intensity at times.  It would disappear, then reappear nearby.  I took a video holding my phone very still and as zoomed in as it would let me.  Outside, there were no plane or helicopter noises, only silence. I called the nonemergent local Clayton police line to ask whether they had other sightings of a drone or light in the sky that night.  They told me no, but to let me know whether a drone came close to our private property and they would intervene at that point. I was unsure as to why someone would fly a drone in one spot (relatively one spot) for over 2 hours at night, unless they were searching for moonshine stills or something.  I made my husband come look and confirm that it was in fact moving and that it was not Venus. I did not look closer at my video but posted it to Facebook and asked if anyone else had seen it. After the 3rd or 4th sighting within 1 week, I was watching the barely moving light carefully and the surrounding less bright stars.  Then, about 5 other ‘stars’ started moving- not nearly as bright or as big as the original- all with separate flight patterns, all with abrupt erratic movements.  They clustered in the sky next to the original and did not stray too far from it, still in the northwest sky.  I got so afraid I had tears in my eyes and slept in my daughter’s bed with her that night. I would not look out my window intentionally for about two or three weeks after that.  I didn’t want to know at that point. My curiosity won out after a while, and I went back to observing, this time casually, before falling asleep each night.  I saw a Facebook post in April from a reporter for an ATL news station that showed a string of lights near ATL that was later attributed to the satellite train.  I wanted to believe this because it was easier that way.  But my light(s) and my experienc! e observing them did not appear consistent with the satellite train, not to mention I looked up the satellites’ positioning and course near us- they weren’t nearby.  I asked a friend of mine who’s father is a pilot locally if he knew of any lights; he advised downloading the FlightAware app and checking the area for any registered planes, drones, other craft when I saw it next. I did see many planes with their normal blinking lights in the sky above us reflected clearly on the app; I did not see any nearly stationary crafts within our NE part of the state, nor in NC or in the adjoining towns. In May and June, the light was present less often and always alone that I could see, but it had changed position drastically- it was in the western sky, very low , so low it appeared to be in the tree line in the woods right beside our house, shining even brighter than before (maybe closer?), still moving so that at times the trees would block it intermittently.  If I looked while lying in my bed, it was shining directly into my eyes but would occasionally dip down (into the National Forest?) and disappear for minutes to half an hour before popping back up again.  My dog barks often at the woods behind our house due to coyote, bears, possum, etc. He seemed to bark nearly constantly on the nights the light showed up behind the house.  Always between 9:30 to 10:00 pm sometimes until 1 AM (still there if I woke up at that time) and always silent.  We went on vacation for about a week for July 4th, and while we were with family, I got out my phone to show my mom my video from ! the first night.  This time, I paused the video and took still frame screen shots of my moving bright white spot- and I figured out that I could zoom in further than before.  And the zoomed in pictures really amazed me (coupled with disbelief that I had not thought to do this before). Frame by frame, split second by split second, the size, shape and color of the light changed, which was what was causing the sparkling and flickering effect from an unfocused distance. I couldn’t believe it. I’ve never seen anything like it, especially the drastic nature of the changes and the range of colors. I got excited (I’m in the medical field, science is exciting anyway for me) and told my husband as soon as we got back, we were going to actually go looking for the source of the light through the trees and track whether it was close or far, and try to get another video and pictures this time. He was not as excited as I was but agreed to drive once I saw it through the trees. But every nig! ht the next week, it was cloudy and/or I didn’t see the light ! in eithe r of its usual position(s). I thought I had missed my chance. My husband stated that the most wide open area of sky near our part of the county was out near the Persimmon Road Fire Station clearing and that we could go there to just see if it was in the sky at all. We went on 7/11, 2 days ago once it got dark. And low and behold, there it was just over the treeline in the EAST part of the sky, bright white as ever but still appearing like a star to the common observer. I took video with my iPhone, my husband took video with his android phone. No other star or cell tower blinking showed up on my video, only this light. And to my surprise, zoomed in, I saw the light pulsating, sending rings of light-concentric circles- out from the center while enlarging intermittently, then shrinking back down to normal. Like in a cartoon depiction of a boombox speaker blaring with each beat. We got in the car to attempt to track it or localize it in reference to the town of Clayton. We didn’t get much closer but my husband felt that it was pretty low in the sky still. At around midnight, we had a local cop stop and ask if we were ok, since we ended up on a road near the prison. And we decided to go home. I looked at both videos on the way home. “! Calm down”, my husband said. “You have to see this, zoomed in!” I said. I started taking still-frame screen shots of the video and zooming in during the video, and the colors, shapes and rate of changing from one configuration to another were startingly beautiful. I took about 30 still frames of a variety of appearances, enlarged them, and posted the video and still shots to facebook because this was INCREDIBLE. I contacted an old friend from the Air Force who had told me he flew over Clayton regularly when he was on duty, to see if he had seen anything or could suggest an etiology. He denied seeing anything and had no idea what it could be. Why hadn’t we brought out our monocular? I couldn’t find our binoculars, of course. That meant that last night, on 7/12/2020, we had to go watch again, this time before dusk so I could approximate the time it appeared in the sky and perhaps get a picture of it in the daylight of dusk. Nothing until around 9:30 or 35 pm, despite other stars being visible first, including the big dipper in the opposite direction behind us. Then suddenly, the light appeared in a position lower to the tree line than the night prior. It wasn’t there, then it was. The monocular didn’t help much especially since you have to hold it very still in order to see something else moving, and didn’t focus as well as I’d hoped and it gives you a headache after a time. But the light seemed closer tonight and my husband’s video did not disappoint. The video and pictures were the best yet. I will continue to watch and record this light for as long as it shows up, and I’m trying to find someone with a t! elescope. Examples of the morphology once zoomed in: 1.	Perfectly round, white and densely uniform in color 2.	Round white outer ring with dark or sometimes bright green inner ring. Bright or deep red hue around the periphery, often 3.	Overlapping spheres with sharp contrasted border between them 4.	Square multicolor center with less defined outer hue border 5.	Square within a square within a square, right angles seen fairly clearly 6.	Round flat dark yellow brown shape with a central bright yellow ‘raindrop’ center 7.	White ‘apostrophe’ outline with darker center and purple hue periphery 8.	Yellow, orange and green areas on a white irregular circle 9.	White and grey circle with borders showing ‘tri-division’: half circle and two unequal divisions of the other half 10.	Shadowy amorphous nondefined darkly faded circle 11.	Bright white sphere with a black ‘slot’ horizontally through the center, not extending to the edges 12.	‘Sand dollar’ notched edge circle with central white protrusion 13.	Green center with white periphery and red halo, with 3 horizontal black lines and one vertical brown line through the green center 14.	‘lumpy’ textured green and white circle 15.	Similar to a pokemon ball: pink top half, reddish bottom half with clear lined division between them;white boxed protrusion coming up from bottom 16.	Yellow and purple nebula like haze with a clearly defined white bullet shape in the center There are so many more given there are at least 4 shape changes for every 1 second of video. I invite your people to come to Clayton and investigate this, since it seems to be a long term type anomaly. My only worry is that I get too close for comfort to sleep at night, or it (if of intelligent design) figures out it’s being watched and leaves for good. Thank you for your time.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,34.899684615384615,-83.3813

It was just below clouds . It was whispy cloud cover nit thick at all Moon was to our south east and it was about 3/4 moon It hovered went west past tree line and then came back hovered again and went east then out of sight Lasted about 20 minutes. He says it was size of quarter at arms length quote from observer 1 “ Triangular in shape its flight path was like a clothesline parallel and lights where violet green white yellow and I want to say like Amber not red not Orange” Observer two only observed the object after informed by observer 1. I noticed it above hovering north west of my position . First thought it was a drone . Because it sat in the one position with multi coloured lights blinking . The lights to me seemed to indicate a circular pattern or craft. It moved east and to me seemed to have a appearance of lights in circular pattern at each end of object . To me the object was translucent the shape like a helicopter. It made no noise of an engine but I thought I heard air moving . It went to the east and disappeared. The lights to me seemed like Christmas lights . Flashing twinkling . But I like an airplane not in a fixed patter. After I stopped watching I saw in the top of a tree in neighbours tree a bright white light blink out the size of soft ball . I thought fire fly them it occurred it was too big to be firefly .  Several weeks before observer 2 saw in same location saw a yellow orange light travel upwards seemed steep incline . I took video and picture of that . It was northern sky,2020-08-20T00:00:00,42.98372082362082,-81.25387288267288

I was waiting for it to circle the air the way hawks do and it didn't, it just hovered, then it moved slowly. I figured it was a hawk surfing the wind. But it still didn't behave like a hawk. So I thought maybe it was a vulture or an eagle. I came to the conclusion that it was a type of eagle or vulture. I kept staring at it, it must have been about 1 minute by this point. The airplaine was out of sight. Then all of a sudden, it changed direction and shape and what looked like a bird then looked like a dark ball or sphere/disc with a slight shine to the top of it and it seeme! d like it was rotating while it quickly descended downward at an angle of about 45 degrees with a purpose, no wavering it was a clean line,toward the direction where the plane was headed although the plane was not on a descent. the object had no wings at this point.

We stopped the car and watched for a moment.  At first wethought they could be flares, then we noticedthat they were acting quite strangely.  Not intelligent type of movement, but they were staying up there for quite some time.  They were almost stationary for about 3 minutes in the skFriend and I witnessed ""flare like objects ""hovered more than 10 minutes per.Obj's #ing above 20.  Strange person(s) watched us. Then they started thier slow decent.  When I say slow, I mean it took them 7 minutes to come down aproximately 100yds. That is the thing that intrigued us the most.We could see a visible trial of smoke as ifthey were flares, but they were much brighter and acted in a way that neither of us couldjust dismiss as something that was normal.  They very well could be just flares and we don't know anything. But I am very good atj udging distance, adn have very good eyesight. I also feel that I am a UFO skeptic even though I am very intrigued.  I don't believe that they were necessarily extraterrestrial space craft, but they were notjust a simple flare or ""plasma displacment"".  They could have been a number of different things.  We have both tried to come up with explinations of the event and truely believe that that would be some what difficult toachieve.  The way that they decended was thefact that forced us to come to that conclusion.  It was a straight fall.  But took way too long to be a ""fall"".  It was aided by a rocket type of engine more than likely. Ifthat is so, it would more thatn likely havegone up, or been a little bit more eratic.  The light was at first RED.  When it startedto make it's ""fall"" it turned almost WHITE.I would very much appreciate it if someone would respond and tell me that theyknow what it is.  And I hope that this willnot be taken like a ""stupid person reportinga light in the sky that is more than likelyjust a flare or a normal aircraft.""

Me and a friend began to examine the craft and noticed a strange light configuration.  Three small lights in each corner (red) and a pulsating lght in the center (orange).  Until that day we were both sceptics. The ship was making making no sound at all and was sitting absolutely still.  We exited the car and began to get a better look.  It was very large in a perfect triangular shape.  The lights at each corner were very small in comparison to the large center light and were also not pulsating.  They were red in color but appeared to fade slightly into an orange in the center.  In the middle of the craft was at first glance an orange light but after careful examination was hanging down like a large ball of light pulsating and fading and then restoring to full brightness.  We then realized that the road permitted a closer look.  We entered the car and began towards it.  We ran under a passing of trees and then cleared them.  the veiw of the ship was elliminated by the trees.  Upon reaching the other side the ship was gone from sight.  The sides appeared to slope inward at an angle from bottom to top.,1998-03-07T00:00:00,38.9822,-80.2008

The sky still had consistent lightning.   We heard a craft fly over us, and it was very loud and peculiar sounding.  It was very fast and sounded like the stereotypical spaceship flying sound from tv shows and films.  We looked at each other shocked.  My husband commented that at first he was wondering if it were a tornado when it first started.  A few minutes later it happened again, following the same flight path [I believe NE to W, but am not certain] though it was somewhat quieter.   We get a lot of fly over from military and commercial, and are familiar with normal flight sounds. This was unlike anything we've ever heard, and with as much lightning and with as loud/low as the craft sounded like it was flying, I am unsure whether a military or commercial craft would fly that low in these conditions over a residential area.

With binoculars I can tell its very lit up, saucer in shape.  This evening I observed a blinking object which seems to be observing.  The blinking object approached from left, flew underneath saucer then to right.  I saw an object very similar to this UFO back in 1974 off of Gender Road, south of Reynoldsburg.  It seems to have red, green and white lights.  The underneath is very lit up with white lights.  I have no ability to take photo.  Too far for phone to capture.  Just within last ten minutes, it has raised up higher but again now it’s stationary, just hovering.  No noise can be heard but I’m probably miles away from object.  Round saucer shape with raised small dome like structure on top.  It’s possibly over Baltimore or Buckeye Lake area.  One more thing that might be important.  We see helicopters on maneuvers from Rickenbacker Air Base quite often in sim! ilar location but nearer to us and closer to ground.  They of course do not remain stationary and they fly from south to north/northwest and disappear from view within five to ten minutes.

Was using NVGs to show my Mother-in-Law The Andromeda Galaxy, both with the naked eye and with NVG. We watched the international space station fly over along with some space junk rocket boosters.  My Mother-in-Law was in control of the NVGs(PVS-7 Auto gate) at the time of the sighting.  She asked me what an object was coming across our sky from West to North East and while looking through the NVGs she pointed to a spot in the sky where I saw something moving a bit faster than a satellite,  was a lot brighter than a satellite and instinct told me it was in the Earths atmosphere based on size.  This was a very clear night with the Milkyway in view.  The naked eye easily picked this object up.  It seemed just a bit faster than commercial aircraft passing so I decided to start to video it after it passed overhead and counted to about 31 seconds expecting to hear the jet engines like every other commercial jet which passes, yet I waited and waited and even mentioned in the video it was far enough away that we should have been hearing it, but there was silence.  I took the NVGs because my Mother In Law kept saying there were 2 objects one black and the other the bright ball of light. So I too wanted to witness what she was able to see with the more advanced technology.  I peered through the NVGs and the object flared them as much as a ground based street light would and it was still far away by then.  Afterwards I was able to take still zooms of my video and this appears to be 7 sided and 3 dimensional with some sort of opening on 1 side and based on the stills it appears that it was rotating yet my eyes, camera and NVGs don't pick that up.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,43.3297,-87.9294

I got my phone out, and took pictures.  When I first saw the depression, I remembered the sighting the night before.  I looked for steps or prints leading to, and/or from the depression, but saw none.  Monday I called WRAL news Raleigh,NC, and asked if they had had other reports.

At about 1:03 a.m., in the early morning hours of August 10, 2020, I saw something out of the corner of my eye coming over the distant trees to the south. It was faint but very distinctive.  The sky was completely clear and dark but this object resembled something as it might be traveling through clouds because it was very hazy and muted. Yet, I was able to make it out clearly. It was shaped like a very wide V but the point was a bit more curvilinear-kind of like a boomerang. Each side of the V was made up of about three rows of thin, parallel striations of light that crossed the V lines. Think of train tracks, or a flock of geese flying in formation. That is what it reminded me of, with the outstretched wings representing the lights. Only you would have about three rows of geese side-by-side. The color of the lights was a golden yellow to orange.  This object was about 5 times the size of an airplane that you would see way up in the sky, where sound from the plane can no longer be heard—from where I sat it appeared as about a ½” to ¾” object. There was no sound whatsoever--it was completely silent.  I saw the UFO come into view as it passed over the trees to the south of me. It moved faster than a plane that passes overhead, but it didn’t streak across the sky either. It moved at a consistent rate in a completely straight line from the south to north, and my gaze followed it until it passed over rooftops and trees in the distance.  I would say I watched it for about 10-15 seconds. I came inside and drew a picture of it, then took a photo of the drawing, altering it a bit to make it look similar to what I saw if anyone is interested in seeing it.

Sunday evening in 1956, my buddy and I were on our way back to work in Wichita the next day, my buddy was an accountant working at a large company and I had just been hired the previous June aa a Technical Illustrator at the Beechcraft mfg. plant.  We both grew up in Arkansas City near the southern Kansas border about 60 miles south of Wichita and about once a month we would go back for a weekend in our hometown.  We were friends in High school and Junior College where we both worked all five years saving money for college beyond what we could get right at home in Ark City. We both had saved just enough to afford one additional year at a university. My buddy chose Wichita State Univ. I chose Kansas Univ. in Lawrence.  We were in my car a black ‘49 Chevy that I always kept clean and polished, which will be important for what follows. The night of our sighting we were on our way back to work on a narrow paved two-lane road that lead north into Rock Road in the southern part of Wichita.  (There were no shoulders back then just huge drainage ditches and no street lights on either side of a narrow a two-lane blacktop.)  Just as we were approaching town I suddenly saw a huge bright, yellowish light reflecting in the hood of the car about a foot in front of the windshield.  I immediately slowed down leaning forward looking up but I couldn’t see a thing.  I elbowed my buddy who was asleep saying, “Wake up and stick your head out the window, look straight up, and tell me what you see.""  His reply was, “What,” so I repeated and he got it. “It just looks like a big bright light to me.” “Well does it look like a flare?”  A logical guess, as I realized we were almost adjacent the huge Boeing aircraft plant. “What does a flare look like?”  Oh good grief.  My buddy was not a tech guy. “Well, does it look like it’s hanging under a little parachute trailing a small stream of smoke?” “No. It’s just a big bright light with edges that look... soft or funny like.” “Yeah! That’s exactly what I’m seeing in a perfect reflection in the hood.” “What do you think it is? It’s not a plane because it’s not moving.” “ I know it’s just hanging there, and we sure don’t hear any helicopter.”  We sat there watching for about ten seconds as I checked for traffic as we were stopped in the travel lane.  I could easily see about a mile in both directions, saw nothing. “Hey, wait!  Did you see that?”  What the heck is this some kind of really late firework display?” “Yes, I see the little tiny one separated from the big one, but it didn’t go very far.” After a short pause, the little one shoots off East North East and disappears in about one second. “Oh Wow! Did you see that.” “Yeah, I saw it.” Then the large light changes. “Hey, does it look to you like the big light is getting bigger.” “It sure does. And now it’s getting brighter too.” “Yes. Oh, Wow! There it goes too. Same direction as the little one."" The larger light took about 4-5 seconds to disappear then my buddy pulled his head back inside. “Ok, what the heck was that?” We sat there. I checked traffic, again nothing. “Well, I’m thinking we just saw a UFO.” “Boy, I don’t know.”  Unfortunately, Don passed away a few years ago. Only once when I was back in Kansas at a dinner with a group of friends did I have a chance to ask him what he thought we saw that night of the UFO. He quickly replied, “Naw, it was just a big light.” Without other folks present, I had a feeling our conversation might have been far more interesting. I was still years from retirement back then and didn’t think to follow up as I certainly would have if I’d been researching this UFO stuff the way I have been since retirement. Here’s what I found recently: Some History The following history might help to somewhat corroborate our visual sighting time in late July or August 1956 in Wichita. The huge Boeing plant was ramping up B-52 production in 1955 and upgraded the airstrip adjacent to the Boeing plant to handle the extra weight of the B-52s as crew training began about mid-year in 1955. The first B-52s went Operational in Feb. 1956, at Castle AFB (SAC base) northwest of Merced, CA. As flying ramped up, production glitches at Boeing and mandatory runway repairs at Castle grounded all of the new “BUFFs” for short periods during those first few months. Corroboration, maybe. The following UFO encounter reported by an RB-47 crew based at Forbes AFB south of Topeka in the summer of 1956 is ranked, as one of, or quite possibly, the best-documented sighting ever recorded. That contact is ranked high because of the extended period of contact time, ground/air radar recording, visual sighting by all six crew members and especially because of electronic interaction recorded by three “Recon-CROWs” during the encounter. The description of the light that followed the RB-47 is identical to what my buddy and I saw hovering over the Boeing plant about the same time period. (See Youtube URL below.)

I had not seen RH for about 19 years.  My last time seeing him was 1980.  We picked berries in the fields in early 1970's, hung out at the local skating rink, fun times. RH and I also decided to enlist in the military in 1974 together.  I did so in the USAF, and he went US Army.  After my initial contact made by phone early 1999,  I met up with RH at my home in Tigard, Oregon. His first comment to me was ""Remember the light in the sky over the cornfield?  That drove me to drink all these years!""  Like a rush of memories flooding my mind... it took me back to the summer of 1971 where RH and I were riding late at night on our bikes on Cordon Road, cross road of Haysville in East Salem which was rural farming.   The image of a cornfield, a large oak tree and a bright oval light hovering over the tree.  I was looking SSE direction as the tree was at a slight uphill direction in the middle of the field.  The scene is all I remember, I don't recall any sounds, any other aircraft or individuals, and don't have any memory of what happened after that event.  What transpired that night so many years ago?   RH stood there after making that comment holding a flask, which I presumed was alcohol.  We sat on the deck and talked about that night... neither of us could really make out what happened, but it was evident, it had a severe affect on my friend. For me, seeing this light is all I remember. RH and I kept in touch until his death in 2001. In the spring of 2019 I was in Salem and went out to the crossroads of Cordon Road and Haysville Rd. trying to pin point the area where we had the sighting... a flash back in time as the land, buildings have changed.  There was no longer a cornfield, but the barn was still there to the right and the oak tree was gone.  What happened that evening to scare my friend as bad as it did I don't know... As for me, I was not affected, but my journey into finding answers started in that cornfield in 1971! I hope here sometime in the future to make another trip to the area and talk to some of the residents living there to see if they have had any sightings like mine during the early 1970's. To analyze what we saw, from my experience in the USAF, it was not a conventional aircraft, nor the moon, or a street light, or vehicle headlights because it was in the air at about 30-35 degrees hovering over that oak tree. So at this time, its an unknown.",2020-05-01T00:00:00,44.9412471106758,-123.00423516160626

Note: I saw her the morning after she witnessed this and the first words out of her mouth were ,  I saw a UFO in my backyard last night. I have known her for about ten years as a neighborand I coukd tell something had happened to upset her. I sat with her and ner sister in my backyard for the day trying to calm her and asking her to write down what happened and to draw if she could the object. After a long day together she calmed down after talking about her experience. I must include that a Deputy Sheriff had been dispatc!hed to our town to look in a nearby woods after a sighting of 8 UFOsby her brother less than two weeks before. We tried to tell him what happened to her, but he didn't act interested. He just wanted to let me know he had checked out the woods at my request to the Sheriffs office and found nothing. He advised we find out who owns the woods so no one would possibly file a trespassing complaint on us for entering the woods about a week after the event became known. I checked with our County Courthouse Records and found a number of possible owners. I called each one to ask about ownership. A woman north of town told me the owner. I called the Sheriff's office back to let them know I had the owners name and then I called to get permission to reenter the woods for my husband to look around. There were some trees down in the woods, but it looked like someone had notched them out before they fell. There is an area in the woods that has a circular patch where no vegetation grows. It is barren. I had my family take pictures while in there , but when the!film was developed some prints  were lost.I still have some pictures of the teen boy standing at the end of the street and pointing to the woods he saw  light up red and where all the Ufo activity took place as described in a report filed to the Nat'l UFO R.C. as having happened on Aug. 7,1996, The reports being filed with the Center for Aug. ,Sept., and Oct. 1996 by me  will include a map and drawing for each sighting as soon as I can redraw the original from my files. I am submitting a video for the Center to review for the events that happened on Oct.18,1996.

I am not sure of the exact date or time.It was either August or Sept. of last year.My sister, Paula, and I were on Route 2 in Concord, heading East toward Boston after afishing trip. It was dusk. As we neared afield, I saw a large saucer, grey with alarge white highly luminescent dome on top.There were what appeared to be portholes or windows around it. My sister was not paying attention as we sped past it but I started yelling 'Oh my God! Look over the trees! Seeit? See it?' She said she saw a very bright object in the sky but could not quite make itout. By the time she looked up it was pretty much obscured. I turned the car around as soon as I hada chance to get another look, but it was no longer there.I have also seen instances of bizarre lights in the sky which appear to be above the clouds, and they make really odd formations. At first I thought they were searchlights that stores and discos usesometime, but the stream of light coming down from the sky that usually tells youthese are earth-based lights were notpresent. The formations these lights created could not have been made by aircraft.There were usually four to five lights.At some point, they would all convert together to create a single point of light and thensplit up again. I saw these on numerous occaisions when heading east on Route 2 nearConcord, MA, going toward Boston last year.On one occaision, my sister Paula also saw these.It is interesting to note, I guess, that Hanscom AFB is off Route 2 (actually, it's on2A), in Bedford, MA, which is just north ofConcord. I believe Dover AFB in NH is closeby as well.What took me so long to report these incidents? I did not know who to go to. I did not want to contact Hanscom for fear ofridicule.

The objects swung around, changing position with one another, then the top object vanished.  The other remained visible as we traveled forabout 20 miles. I was driving, and my friend ((name delted)) was a passenger.  We were on Route 8, on our way from Naugatuck, CT to Norwalk, CT.  About 1/3 of the way to Norwalk, in Derby, I spotted two large, bright lights in the sky, and pointed them out to ((name deleted)).  The lights were larger than a visible planet would appear; the closest description I can give as to size was that they were similar in size to street lights viewed from a car, only they were clearly very high in the sky, so the actual size of the objects had to be enormous.  We watched the objects, which were hovering in place, the one on the left a little higher than the one on the right.   Suddenly, the objects moved, rotating around one another (top to bottom) to switch places with one another.  Then, the one which had moved to the top winked out, just vanished.  There was a faint trail leading upward where that one had been, but it disappeared quickly.   I drove another few exits to Shelton, CT, where we got off of the highway onto Bridgeport Avenue.  We stopped at a car dealership which had a clear view of that part of the sky (I'd say, south, maybe south east part of the sky--I'd have to look at a map to be more specific--we were driving generally south at the time).    We got out of the Jeep and stood in the lot, watching the remaining light.  It kept its position.   After a few minutes, we got back into the Jeep, and I continued to drive to Norwalk.  We watched the light all the way to Norwalk; it remained the in the same part of the sky the entire way (probably for a total of 20 miles or so), so it had to be pretty high up.   When I dropped ((name deleted)) off at her home, I had one more look at the object by a running track near her house, then I headed home (driving north, so I could no longer see it in front of me).  I couldn't see the part of the sky where it was when I got home, so I just went inside. The lights were pale yellow or white-ish in color.  I thought they seemed round, but ((name deleted)) said at the time (and has maintained) that they seemed triangular to her.  They were definitely not airplanes (we saw plenty of planes in the sky that night--no comparison).  They also didn't behave like planes. I'm 29 years old, female, married, a webmaster/graphic designer by profession.  I've never seen any unusual phenomena in the sky before, and have always been skeptical about the whole UFO thing.  While these lights may not be alien in nature, I certainly can't explain them (if you figure out what they were, please let me know!)   I don't know ((name deleted)) age (mid to late 40s perhaps).   She is currently attending college full time to get her masters in painting, and I believe a certificate to teach (or something of that nature).

No surprise since I can see many planes coming and going on the horizon from the Pittsburgh airport on clear nights. We have a good view of open skies on the hill and have watched little meteorite showers in years past. This orange light was coming west it came so close and descended heading north.  I thought it was a plane crashing to the groud a few miles from my home.  It changed angles as it turned and it appeared as a metallic bottom with a glowing orange haze.  At each point there was a bright colored light. As I ran out the front door to witness the crash I saw it quickly change direction and ascend toward the east.  It disappeared from sight at a high rate of speed.  I think it was some weird new stealth like plane or a UFO. I was alone when it happened. I'm married and have a career and I don't want to be known as a nut. As I was searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed my siting I discovered y!our site.

We pulled into the driveway and parked my car and had our usual end of the day catching up before getting out. Once we got out of my car I took about five steps and was standing behind his car, which is parked directly to the left of mine, and noticed movement in the sky above me. I looked up and to my shock saw a boomerang shaped craft about 150-200ft off the ground cruising slowly over our house, the wildest thing was that it was completely silent. I could hear crickets chirping and cicadas all around us but not this thing. It was heading towards the southeast. I watched it for a good two seconds before i slapped my friend on the shoulder and told him to “Look at that fucking thing” and he saw it as well, we both watched in complete disbelief for another two seconds before it disappeared behind a tree that’s in a neighbot’s yard behind our house. After me freaking out for a good two minutes I told him to get in the car because we were going to try to follow it since I thought it would be flying towards a specific area that has been known, by my family at least, to be a small hotspot for UFOs/ UAPs. Unfortunately we did not end up seeing it again after we lost sight of it behind the tree. If i had to guess I’d say it turned before we got in the car to try to follow it, I genuinely believe there should be other witnesses to this somewhere in town because of the simple fact that it was flying so low.  Description: The craft was boomerang shaped and 25-35ft from wingtip-to-wingtip. It was mostly black but the perimeter of the craft was white with lights(?) that were turned off lining the outside of it. The tree it eventually disappeared behind is probably 75-80ft tall and this thing was NOT far from the top of it at all. It was moving very slow, it’s hard to put a MPH estimate on it but it went from overtop where our pool would be to disappearing behind a tree in about 4.5 seconds.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,28.02172891566265,-82.12932289156626

I was looking at about 75 to 80 degrees from north, so almost due east and about 45 degrees up from ground level in the east (well above the mountain skyline).  I notice movement across my field of view and quickly moved to find it.  I tracked it to about 130 degrees from north.  At that point I lowered my binoculars to see if I could see it with unaided eyes and could not see it.  I tried to find it again with the binoculars without success.  I estimate the time viewed in the binoculars was 10 – 15 seconds. I immediately had the feeling that I was seeing something unusual.  I had no perspective of how far away it was as I was looking into stars and blackness of night.  It could have been several blocks away or several miles.  I also could not discern the size of what I saw.  I did not even see a solid shape.  It was just the V formation of lights and moving south.  The object fit into approximately 50% of the field of view of the binoculars.  Added to the strangeness of the event was that there was no noise.  It was very silent.  To me, it was a surreal sight and nothing I have remotely seen before.  I am always looking to the night skies and that night gave me a moment I will not forget. The first impression I had upon seeing it was that it resembled the formation of a flock of geese flying In a V formation.  But this was definitely not that.  It was a moving formation of lights that did not vary from formation or direction.  Once I realized I saw something unusual, I went inside to tell my wife who was in bed.

It passed in front of the moon and continued in the South Easterly direction until it seemed almost to travel too far away from me, relative to my position on the ground, because it faded as though a car has driven too far away and you cannot spot it any longer. It moved very slowly and had no blinking lights. Its course was very steady, not like a flying bug or insect. It was barely a pinprick in size but was clearly visible due to sparse cloud cover and the brilliance of the moonlight. ! I knew it was not a plane or helicopter and assumed it was perhaps a satellite or the International Space Station. I watched reference videos of the ISS flybys to see if what I saw was different and I can only say that the difference to me appears to be the size of the light (The ISS appears to have been bigger light, bigger in the sense of its overall circumference, then what I witnessed) and that the object fell away from the planet.

I looked out the back window and watched with interest as the light(s) in the sky approached.  It got up to us quickly and began pacing our car on the left side at treetop level.  It was dark and we do not remember making out a shape, but we both remember it had lights - or rather, a row of lights, one of which would light up in succession in a pattern conforming to the direction it was moving (back to front from our perspective). I remember the lights being yellow; my Ma recalls orange or red. I was excited and started waving (I was about 8 years old); I have some recollection of thinking I discerned figures or forms I could communi! cate with.  My Ma began to freak out and started praying.  She said she knew there was a church up ahead a bit and knew the pastor that lived next door, and she prayed until we got there.  She pulled in to the church parking lot and the UFO began circling us clockwise.  My Ma freaked out more and started making excuses for why she couldn't get out of the car, knock on the pastor's door and say ""Hey, come out here and look at this UFO"".  She decided to turn around and go back to her brothers' place.  The UFO began following us, but soon just took off with a streak of light  --  not away somewhere across the horizon  --  but OUT -- through the atmosphere.  Within a few minutes, three low-flying aircraft were in the exact vicinity of the UFO.  My Ma said ""Someone else saw it!  I'm sure it will be in all the newspapers tomorrow.""

I was 11 at the time. For many years I believed what I saw was my imagination. Recently upon seeing the IS Navy declassifying and admitting to ufos, not outright aliens, but advanced unknown otherworldly aircraft indeed operate in our airspace I decided to do some looking into my old experience. Here it is.  I was home alone, watching TV, alone. My mom was out working late and would not be home soon. I forget the program that was on, but the news came on with the information that people were seeing lights in the skies above our cities. Me, loving scifi as a kid, ran out to see if I two could see the lights. What I saw burned into my memory and I will never forget.  I stood at the end of my culdisac, on my doorstep, overlooking the Edmonds woodway high school. And hundreds of feet into the air. Was massive rows of slow moving windows. Like. Almost like seeing a cruise ship slowly floating by, but you could only see the lit windows. And you could only make out the vague shape of a large object. At the time I thought of it as a slow moving train of windows 5 levels or so tall. 5 rows. Slowly traveling from the west over the school. To the east over Steven's hospital.  I ran inside to find my moms camera, searching and coming out to see if it was still there everg 30 seconds or so. The train of windows slowly drifting away. When I found the camera and finally went out to take a picture. The object which had moved over the hospital by this point. Was gone.  I readthat official reports are blaming the incident on Russian space junk traveling east to west over to the Pacific. I can most certain say as an adult. That is not what I saw. I saw windows, 5 rows tall. In lengths that I can only describe as massive. Slowly, perfectly, drifting west to east. Away from the Pacific. Level with the earth. With a faint deep droaning sound.  I now believe it was real. Coincidentally.  I had several dreams for years after that experience, of brings invading my room. As an adult I still experience this. I have had a history of night terrors though and often tell myself these are just fears manifesting in my dreams. But now I wonder. I dont believe I have any actual evidence or experience of abductions. Just bizzar long lasting dreams and irrational fears.",2020-05-01T00:00:00,47.82623459119497,-122.3462679245283

It was April 17, 2005 and I was on my way to work around 5:30am and turned south onto Shaver road.  As I headed south, Sugar-loaf Lake was just a few hundred yards in front of me.  The road by the lake was unusually thick with fog and I could see a red and white strobe light in the road about 15 ‘ off the ground.  I figured there must have been an accident due to the heavy fog and the lights went to a fire truck.  As I got closer the lights vanished. As I drove through the fog, the fog seemed different, almost like steam. Since I could no longer see the lights, I slowed as I didn’t want to run off the road or into the fire truck.  I decided to put my windows down to listen and that’s when the hair on my neck began to stand up.  There was not a single sound other than my car, not a bird, cricket or anything.  It was a scene right out of the movies. As I passed the lake I noticed the lights again on my right.  They seemed to be out in the water about 20 feet off the ground and maybe 30 or 40 feet long.  The fog was so thick I didn’t see what the lights were attached to.  They were a series of strobe type lights, one red then several white that went from right to left.  As I went another seventy five yards the fog was gone and so were the lights; everything seemed to have vanished.  I turned onto the highway and looked to my right and I could see part of the lake.  It was clear, there was no fog and it was completely empty. I have no idea what the lights went to.  One might speculate they were from a UFO, but I did not see a craft through the fog, only the lights.  I went back that way a few more time over the next few days trying to figure out what I saw.  To this day I have no clue.   I told my wife and a few coworkers about the incident that day. About five years later I was flipping through the channels watching a show on UFO’s.  They were creating a computer generated recreation of an incident observed by several law enforcement officers in Illinois.  I was absolutely shocked when they had the craft turn and I again saw the exact same configuration of lights I saw back in 2005. A few years later as I was driving my son down that road and telling the story.  It dawned on me that as you get closer to the lake the elevation drops about 10 feet.   Initially I had thought it was a fire truck due to lights being about 10-15 feet off the ground.

The area where we were observing is comprised of hills and agricultral zones.  Because of the cooler temperature, all planes in the sky were leaving con trails, however the ufo did not.  I am unable to estimate how high, or how big the object was, although it did not appear to be all that high, or all that large.
