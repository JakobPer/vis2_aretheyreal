While following the path of one plane I noticed a silver dot in the sky of which the plane had just flown under.  Having seen this perspective I was able to observe the silver dot hovering in a motionless position high above land then disappear in what appeared to be an ascet out of the blue sky and out of sight; straight upwards.  This piqued my curriosity and I questioned if what I had seen was real.  30 minutes later an orange or copper colored dot appeared which seemed to be more observable than the silver object I observed earlier.  The orange dot was hovering when suddenly two white dots appeared into sight.  The three objects hovered motionless for some moments then swayed back and forth.  Hovering in a triangle formation.  My initial thoughts were that I was seeing Mars(orange or copper color) and two neighboring stars.  I was skeptical only to the fact that I've never observed stars in the daytime much less Mars.  It also seemed that the formation was shifting from a right triangle to an obtuse triangle which took away any assumptions of planets and stars appearing stationary during the daytime.  I took pictures of the sky using my camera phone.  The quality of the camera I don't think is good enough to have captured these objects digitally.  However if someone would like to examine them I took 5 or so pictures of the sky.  I also walked over to a life guard and pointed out what I was observing.  He had no explanation of what these objects were but did see them as well once I pointed them out.  Minutes later the objects flew off in what appeared to be heading south in the sky.  Their departures were very swift and disappeared in what seemed to last less than a second.  I approached the life guard again and had asked if he still saw the objects in the sky.  He answered no and stated he saw the one object fly off.  As we tried to make sense of what we had just witnessed, another small white object started to appear.  This turned out to be a seagull's down feather descending onto the beach.  Our eyes had not been fooled.  These were not jets, clouds, or feathers.  Instead they mimicked the hours and hours of footage found documenting UFO's.  Which tells me that anyone with a trained eye can spot them.  They've been around for a long time and will continue to be.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

A friend of mine came by to say goodbye. I'd been loading the car and was standing in the yard with my friend, son, and grandparents. I then saw a very white light that looked like it was driving around the ground across the street on a hill. This happened just at early sunset. I was looking straight at the hill when I saw the object come up around the side of it and into view. At first I thought it was a dune buggy, but it only had a single beam out the front. In utter disbelief, I watched as it drove around to the top of the hill and then continued into the air. It moved very slowly and without sound. It was an extremely bright light and slowly moved across the street towards where we were. At this point we were all watching it. It was like a floodlight. After watching it for some time, maybe 15-20 minutes, my friend and I decided to get in his car and drive down the street to see if we could get a better view from another angle. At this point it was nearly over the street. While driving down the road I first saw a very small red light fly up from the ground and then fly up to the object. It seemed there was activity at the object with other smaller lights moving around it. Then to our left on the side of the road was another object. There are no houses or other structures in this area and nothing had been at this location previously. The object was very close to the road. It had an extremely bright white light shining out of an opening. We could not see the objects shape but it was very big, like the size of a garage. There was what resembled a hatch and the white light was pouring out from it, but it was too bright to make out any details inside of it. We decided to drive up to it. As we neared it, perhaps 40-50ft away the car engine died. Simultaneously with the engine dying what appeared to be the hatch began to close shut. It finally cl! osed com pletely and we were getting scared. The engine kicked back in and we returned to the house. By now the object in the sky was over the house. My grandparents were watching it with binoculars. We were not able to tell the shape of the object. My grandmother called Luke AFB and they told her they hadn't received any reports. At this point, and I realize this is strange but it's true, everyone seemed to act like ""so what, theres a ufo over the house"" and we got sleepy. My grandparents and son went inside to bed. My friend and I decided to go to sleep - on the front lawn, as if that was perfectly natural. We just fell alseep out on the ground. At one point I woke up and couldn't move and saw a blue light flooding the area but couldn't see a source. I then recall what may be a very strange dream. (?) Small people approached us and said they were going to check our feet and that they would not approach my grandparents. They did some physical exams. My friend was completely unconscious but I was awake and speaking to them in some manner although I was not able to move. The people did not move their mouths when they spoke. At one point they told me a being was there, I understood it to be a type of scientist. The creature or thing was like nothing I can describe, it somewhat resembled a giant praying mantis. It was fish or bug-like and was abosultely the most horrible thing I've ever seen. I became terrified and was fighting them. It was my impression that this creature did not have any compassion for humans. It did not speak to me but had a very cold presence. The next thing I know, my friend and I woke up in the morning still laying on the front lawn. Everyone - my grandparents, son, and friend actted like nothing had happened. They were like ""oh yah, we saw a ufo"" as if that was perfectly natural. I was the only one that seemed to think something incredible had occurred. We spoke about the examination of the feet and we realized that my friend had webbed toes which I didn't know, and I have double jointed toes! as does my son. Over the years my grandparents referred to this ufo event from time to time, and my son remembers the episode and says that one of the beings spoke to him. 2007 is the 20 yr anniversary of this event. I've often wondered about what happened that night, and although it sounds incredible what I've related is true. After the event I had an interest in science and have since earned a masters in astronomy. As long as I live I will NEVER forget the sight of that object driving up the side of the hill and going into the air! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Late one evening (between 9 and 10 PM) in the winter of 1988 (possibly February), I (a high school student) was sitting on a boat dock at Guntersville Lake with one other person (a high school student) when a large bell or thimble shaped object rose from the water about  a quarter of a mile from us.  It rose straight up (higher than the tree line) and stopped. Too close for comfort, we got into our car and drove rapidly from the lake taking Hwy 72 through Scottsboro to Huntsville (a trip lasting approximately 35 minutes).  The object followed us just above the tree line rapidly moving from one side of the road to the other.  The object was bright enough to be seen through the street lights once we reached Huntsville and followed us on a twisting path through town. We stopped at my house near Redstone Arsenal and gathered up a pair of binoculars and a rifle scope to look more closely at the object that was now hovering over the neighbor’s house.  We were joined by my father (a restaurant manager) and a neighbor (profession unknown), and we all watched the object for approximately ten minutes.  It was bell or thimble shaped with varying colored lights around the outside of the object in a diagonal line from the bottom to the top.  It rotated counter clockwise and was light in color.  After ten minutes or so, the object rose rapidly and sped off to the southeast. I saw several strange luminous objects in the skies over Redstone Arsenal in the spring and summer that followed- often the same objects in the same general area several nights in a row--but none came close enough for me to distinguish their shapes.

Impossible for me to determine its size since it blocked out any reference points I could have used. If forced to guess, i would say it was at least 60 feet long by 20 feet or so high shaped like a submarine. This means there was a distinct center high point but then again the black of the object left me with that impression. The object just appeared with no sound of any kind and or movement of leaves tree branches etc. The event takes palce on or about early June 1988. My grilfriend at the time and I were just returning from a restaurant at between 7: and 8. We were on the back prch of the house about to enter when we heard the rough missing sound of an air plane engine. As if the plane had no noise abatement of any kind and flying as the sound provoked low to the ground. We stepped back from the roof line to see what it may be, discovering it was an old rotary engine plane flying approx 200 feet. The palne was very close to us approx half a block to our true north as we were facing true east. The plane was flying directly west into the sunset. Our eyes followed the plane thinking the noise may represent engine trouble. As the plane passed us heading west and we are now looking more at the rear of the plane we noticed we couldn't see or next door neighbors house to the south. We couldn't see the street lights to ur south or the hospital to the south. In our way was a large long and high black something blocking out that area. We kept our eyes on the object leaving the back porch to approach it from our back yard. As we aproached my girlfriend and I didn't speak not a word. We both waled toward the object geting within 15 feet. Once my eyes and mind hooked up -- I realized this was anything but normal and I became uneasy. I looked off to my right or west to see the old plane beginning to bank south accross the then sunset. I looked back at te object noticing there was a lght fore, aft and mid not blinding by any means but present. I don't know if it was steady or blinking too difficult to know under the stress and confusion. Now here is the good part that can not be comprehended, I don't care who you are.  The object moved directly west at a speed undefined, faster than the fasted movement I can imagine. so fast It is undescribable. All I could see was a trail the lghts made going for miles to the west in an instant. Just as suddenly, i could see the street lghts, hospital, neighbors house ... The other most amazing aspect of the event is there was no sound or air movement. How could a large object move an incredible speed without creating a vacuum or noise only 15 feet away from me? As best I could see and it was only the trailing lights as if a picture was taken with time photography leaving the lens open. The object flew under the old plane as it continued to bank to the south and east. Immediatly after my senses returned I asked my girlfriend what was that all about and she remained stunned ans silent. After we both came to or thought we had our facilties back we went into the house to write down what we thought happened without sharing a single word other than lets write down what we saw and compare notes. We both saw the same thing and the essence of our vision is the speed at which the object moved. the blackness of theobject so we couldn't truly see its shape or size and we felt we were being looked at closely. Now the end of the story: We thought about calling our local airport sure the old plane was returning to it flying by site with what light was left. We talked ourselves out of it not wanting to draw any attention to us. The following day was a Saturday. We were washing our cars in the back yard listening to a local station on the radio. There was a break in by the announcer saying a sheriff or policeman was chasing a ufo near blue earth minnesota. the anouncer had the sheriff or policeman on line saying he would spped towrds the object getting within a block or two when the object would speed off at 90 degress at phonominal speed for a few miles and stop again. After about ten minutes the activity of the law man stopped and the station went back to normal broadcasting and not another word was said of the incident.  You coulod verify the incident by calling Blue earth police it was very near to that farming comunity. Finally-- one night in the early fall and it was pitch dark out. A group of us were returning from a another night at a restaurant -- no drinking-- at or about 8;00 when we noticed a huge explosion like lobe orange in color from the ground to about 100 feet by 100 feet and a true half circle. We had met at the restaurant so we were in idividual cars all returning home as neighbors. The area is in the country between two small towns some 15 miles apart. One is Cleveland MN and the direction of the orange lobes was toward Madison Lake MN. Every 3 to 4 minutes there would be another huge orange lobe coming from the ground and moving awa from us. We tried to follow the orage lobes like bomb blasts for the next 15 miles but couldn't keep up. As we traveled the 15 miles we could see the orange blasts from the road going into the horizon. I believe i was travelling south but not sure. It was single orange blast with no sound nothin like lightning more like a half sphere shape associtaed with a bomb blast. all of the neighbors saw it and wondered again what in the hades did we just see.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,44.145480334728035,-94.01062092050209

Then about five minutes later, it caught my eye again because it was still very low and didn’t appear to have moved so I remember thinking it must be flying very slow.  I watched it for a while and then decided it must be a helicopter that was hovering in one spot, but I began to notice that it was very large, much larger than a helicopter.  I turned off my radio and opened the car window to listen for the sound of a helicopter and heard absolutely nothing.  The object was a very bright light and was hovering over the Xerox building on Mustang Road.  I rolled the front passenger window all the way down to get a better look.

The strange thing is that when I lowered my binoculars in disbelief; the craft was not visible to the naked eye. But when I raised them it was visible again and still going along the same trajectory which was west to east, I believe. I watched it until it went out of sight from my point of view. It was solid and had to be huge. The way it appeared in my view was as clear and solid as planes at the height and distance have appeared to me. A military jet followed roughly along the same path but above it 3-5 minutes later.  I’ve always believed in UFOs but this is my first sighting. I personally believe they are spiritual in nature but I digress.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,42.368854674403615,-83.11026847195357

We were in a large sedan. I was driving, one person in the front pass seat and the other behind me. Making a right turn westbound on Latham drive, a newly paved 4 lane road, I was talking to my friends and glanced to my left and noticed a large ""something"" above a K Mart shopping center approximately 1000 yards across a bean field. Being a private pilot I would estimate this thing at about 1500-2000 feet altitude. I immediately rolled down my window (electronically) for I thought there could be some kind of reflection. Not so. This structure, suspended in mid air was not aerodynamic and looked as it was a large building or even a group of buildings clustered together. I immediately commented to my friends ""now what the is that?""  Both passengers with me noticed it and as I stopped the car on the side of the road it changed shape to a vertical cigar shape and looked to us as if it was going to crash right in to our immediate area, causing one of the passengers to scream. It moved towards us at an unbelievable rate of speed. It then changed back to the shape it was in (cluster of buildings) right above us. Dusk was changing to dark. There were many (6 or 7) small ships flying around this large ship at no particular pattern. Again I can not stress how big this thing was. I am from the Chicago area and it was for sure as big probably bigger than the sears tower downtown Chicago. Above us it moved slowly to the northwest, maybe one or two mile an hour for 500 yards. While directly underneath the ship we noticed three large circular lights or burners ignite with the highest intensity bright white light I’d ever seen. At that time the ship started to slowly become transparent meaning we could start to see through it until it had completely disappeared. Note as it disappeared it did not diminish in size.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,41.1916,-87.8555

De certa forma era como se alguma coisa me bloqueasse. Todas as vezes em que lembro do acontecido, vêem-me uns calafrios e uma sensação de angústia.  Neste ponto passo a narrar mais essa experiência que vivi em 1988.  No ano de 1988, estava eu em companhia de Margareth (Dra. Margareth Leite Figueira - importante advogada capixaba), minha namorada na altura. Voltávamos de uma viagem a Anchieta pela Rodovia do Sol. Estava uma tarde ensolarada e com pouco movimento na estrada. O sol começava a se pôr mas havia ainda muita claridade naquela tarde de verão.  Quando nos aproximávamos de Santa Mónica, praia próxima a Guaraparí, do lado esquerdo da rodovia, por trás de um pequena montanha de, mais ou menos uns 15m de altura, estava um objeto de cor grafite, parado na vertical!  Parei o carro, apontei para o objeto e perguntei a Margareth: ""Você está vendo aquilo?"" Ela, com os olhos muito arregalados, disse. ""Sim. É um disco voador.""  Este morro tinha uma característica interessante: era quase sem vegetação dos lados, mas tinha algumas árvores de pequena estatura no cume. A estrada fazia uma volta e continuava por detrás dele.  Desci do carro e aproximei-me do aparelho. Ele continuava lá, parado na vertical por trás do morro. Tinha por volta de uns 4 metros de diâmetro e quase não tinha espessura. Pelo menos, não conseguia dimensionar a sua espessura.  Entrei novamente no carro e disparei em frente para ter uma melhor visão quando estivesse do outro lado da montanha mas, ao chegar lá, não havia mais nenhum sinal do objeto circular e achatado de cor de chumbo. Era como se ele nunca estivesse estado ali.  Lembro que quando aproximei-me da coisa, mais ou menos uns 30 metros de distância, tive uma sensação de muito medo e, durante todo este tempo, nunca consegui reportar este evento, embora tenha contado para algumas pessoas.  O tempo total em que avistamos o objeto girou por volta de uns 5 a 10 minutos, entre o parar do carro e o deslocamento até o outro lado do morro.  A Dra. Margareth ainda está muito ativa em sua profissão e é titular de um importante Cartório no centro de Vitória. Com certeza ela poderá confirmar esta história verdadeira.  A minha intenção ao relatar esta história verdadeira é libertar-me de uma sensação de estranheza. Sentia-me como uma pessoa escolhida e, ao mesmo tempo, com uma grande responsabilidade por ter que reportar tal coisa.  Devo dizer que me sinto um pouco mais leve entretanto.  Sinceramente,  Daniel Amaral  ---   Curiously, passed so many years of this seeing and, having lived one another much more strong experience than this one in a phase of the life when I supposedly was much more conscientious and more knowledge of the phenomenon, just because after what happened before , I started to read a lot about flying saucers, etc.  I never reported  what happened after the first seeing what I start to do now.  I felt like some thing was blocking me. All the times when I remembered that vision I felt a sensation of anguish.  At this point start to tell the ocurred in 1988: In the year of 1988, I was I in company of Margareth (Dra. Margareth Leite Figueira -an  important lawyer of the Vitória, capital city of the Espirito Santo state), my girl friend that time. We was returning from of a trip to Anchieta through  the so called  ""Rodovia do Sol""-  Highway of the Sun. Was one sunny  afternoon  and with little movement in the road. The sun set was started . When we was near to Santa Mónica beach from the Guaraparí city, in the left side of the highway, in the  backwards of a small mountain , was an object of the graphite color , stopped in the vertical line! I stopped the car and pointed  to the object and I asked the Margareth: ""You are seeing to that"" She said. ""Yes. there is a flying saucer.""  That mount had an interesting characteristic: it was almost without vegetation in the sides, but it had some trees of small stature in the top. There is a curve in the road that continued behind the mount. I went down of the car and I came close myself to the device. It continued, motionless there in the vertical line for backwards of the mount. I was about 4 meters of diameter and almost did not have thickness. At least, I did not obtain the dimension of its thickness. I entered again in the car and I went off in front to have one better vision when it was of the other side of the mountain but, when arriving there, I did not have signal of the circular and flattened object of graphite color. It seems like was never had been there.  I remember that when I came close to the object around 30 meters of distance, I had a bad sensation of fear  during all this time. I'd never thought to report this event, even I have told for some people.  The total time of the sight was around 5 to 10 minutes, between stopping of the car and the displacement until the other side of the mount. Margareth still very active in his profession as a titular of an important Notary's office in the center of Vitória City. She certainty will be able to confirm this true history.  My intention when telling this true history is to free me of a strange sensation. Sometimes I feel like i am a chosen person and, at the same time, with a great responsibility for having to report such kind of thing.

Did not pay any attention to it, but began noticing more and more people stopping and looking at it, nudging their friends, asking questions like ""What is it?""  So we looked again, and then stopped and stared like everyone else. What I had thought was just a blimp was actually a collection of lights or glowing orbs that seemed to be part of one thing - except no body was visible to the object.  It was silent, hovering in the sky just over the street, quite large - like a football field - but without any discernible structure.  It was simply a collection of lights or small glowing orbs.  This was very evident when the thing began slowly moving east, towards the East River, and was silhouetted against the full moon - still, there seemed to be nothing connecting the lights, no body, yet they did appear to be part of a large object. The things then disappeared behind a building on the east side of Manhattan. I will never forget it, and I wonder if anyone ever filed a report because many people saw it.  There was nothing in the paper the next day because the Central park jogger was attacked that night as well, so that was plastered all over the front pages.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I thought you might be interested sightings I've had during my carrier?   In the early 1980's, I was flying as Captain on an MD80 from DFW to DEN.  Our departure time was approximately 8:00 pm, hazy, but with partial light still in the sky.  Climbing out of DFW on an initial 185 degree heading, and just passing through approximately 1,000' AGL (above the ground), I spotted a very large object out of the copilots window.  I immediately made the statement to my copilot, ""What the @#*! is that?""  It appeared to be elongated and ""cigar"" shaped, a grey metallic looking object, moving very slowing from right to left (west to east), and it appeared to have many small, dark, and slightly fuzzy looking, rectangular ""windows"" running longitudinally along the length of the object; a line or band of windows?  I immediately called departure control on the radio and asked, ""Departure, do you show anything ahead of us on radar"".  He replied, ""No, why do you ask?""  I told him I wasn't sure but that we thought that there was an object out ahead of us.  At first seeing the object, which was initially located in the right third of my copilots window from my viewpoint, I thought that it might be the undercarriage of a 747.  The object appeared to be moving very slowly.  However, as we accelerated on climb out, the object did not appear to be changing in size indicating that we were not going to have an immediate collision.  I had seen mirages many times before in the past, and so I initially thought that this might be a mirage.  Because of the hazy sky conditions, moisture in the air, and dusk, it didn’t appear to be a mirage, but still a possibility.  As we climbed out of 4500’, the object was now leaving us toward the east but still visible in the left third of my windscreen when departure had us turn to the northwest on our way toward Denver.  I didn’t think much of the incident until years later when I happened to turn the television on during one of my layovers.  The program, ""In Search Of"" was on and this particular segment was about a sighting over Montreal (Torronto?), Canada.  In that program, several hundred witnesses described exactly what my copilot and I had seen on our departure out of DFW during the same time period.  The announcer stated that through triangulation, the objects length was determined to be 6,000’ long.  That’s a mile long and would explain why it appeared that we were not closing on the object we saw!  I thought my sighting above might have some interest for your research?  Other pilot friends have had different encounters.  Back in 1979, I was flying with one 707 pilot and he told me that during a nighttime letdown approach into LAX, when still east of Palm Springs, California, he and his Captain had to take evasive action in order to avoid hitting another flying object.  As they pulled back on the stick to avoid colliding with their “UFO”, they could clearly see inside the “cockpit” of this craft and clearly saw the “pilots”.  Both of the American pilots were former USAF pilots and they both knew what oxygen masks looked like, the type worn by military pilots.  What they saw on the “UFO pilots” face(s), helmet or oxygen masks, they said was nothing they had ever seen before.  In their estimate, it was not of this planet.

Also, we have requested that he have the other pilots submit reports, as well.  PD))",2007-04-27T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

No houses or buildings for several miles from the rest or pull off area. A large tractor trailer truck, that had not been there when I pulled into the rest area, was there after the bright light (which gave off a loud humming noise) shot off toward the South West.  I had gotton out of the car to try to figure out what was going on. I was very suprised to see the truck.  I didn't hear it come into the rest area, and it was parked 20-30 feet from the front of my Audi sedan.  I ran to the driver's door on the truck. The driver just looked at me and said something like you see things out here at night that no one would believe, or words to the effect.  I was pretty excitited at the time. This happened 18 years ago.  I had no idea who to tell it to or report it to until seeing something about the National UFO Reporting Center on TV last night on the History Channel.  Also, I was concerned about saying anything to anyone other than my wife as it could have effected my professional life. I did not see what looked like a craft.  The light was so bright and it moved so fast I was simply stunned.  The humming noise was very loud.  I can only descpribe is a ""electrical"" in nature.  No other way to describe the sound other than the volume. I believe there is more to this.  However, in an effort to keep from sounding like I'm crazy I will leave this report as is.  It was the strangest experience of my life.  I do not drink or do drugs.  Never have.  It would be possible for someone to think I was under the influance after giving the full details of the incident.  I don't believe I was abducted.  However, the truck and driver and electrical problems (which cured themselves) with the car would tend to make it look like I was abducted or came close. To this day I have no idea what happened.

(the whole time the craft was in the northern sky) every time it changed postions i looked farther than it went because it moved so fast i thought there was no way it could move that fast and stop so fast. (it moved so fast my eyes barly registerd that it moved) but anyways at it had moved in the northern part of the triangle it slowly seemed to be moving up maby farther from the atmospere. it;s very hard to explain. but the lights begain fading but not because of distance more of the width of the circles of light. the width begain getting slimmer and slimmer. and the lights begain changed shades to darker. and the craft all of a sudden shut of the lights. but i could still see it was there.( like black on black) the only way to describe it was that some people have good enuff eye sight to see the part of the moon that isn;t being shone with light from the sun. baslicly like that. as i stated into the darkness of the craft in a split second it seemed to dissapere and i saw a few stars the apperd (normal stars) kinda like something was blocking it. aka the craft. when my mind finnaly register that i had seen somewthing i coudn't explain i kept thinking of aircrafts that might be simmiler to what i have seen. the only thing i could think of was the airplanes developed by canada that looked simmiler to a sauser. but this WASN;T round at all. defanlty a triange the lights that i saw iluminated parts of the ship. it was gray. i didn;t hear any sound cuz them dumb hillbillys were too loud. haha oh also i am sending a crrapy drawn picture that might help explain it if possable please call me or get back to me i would like to talk and further explain. ASK FOR ((name deleted)) OR U WILL NOT GET TO TALK TO ME thank you and i hope u consider me not crazy hahah.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

My cousin and I (both in our 60s) were reclining in pool chairs, relaxing and talking.  We both saw the object at the same time, directly overhead.  It appeared about the size of the moon when it is overhead.   The sky was very clear with a few light clouds to the northwest of us but none overhead.  They were the kind of clouds that you see at about 5000-6000 feet altitude.   The object was featureless and appeared one-dimensional.  Its color was grayish.  The effect was almost like the blue sky had a hole in it with an absence of color.  The object was moving quickly and silently from directly overhead (when we first saw it) to the northwest.  As it moved away from us it appeared smaller and smaller, like it would if it was getting further away.   It traveled underneath one cloud and as it did, the trailing edge turned bright glowing red.  It then traveled above the next cloud and disappeared from our view.  When last seen it looked to be only 20 percent of it's original size, which I thought was because it was rapidly climbing and getting further away.  Taking into consideration that it was at about 5500 feet in altitude when we last saw it, it was probably at about 1000-1500 feet in altitude when we first saw it.  I can't estimate how fast it was traveling, but it was a lot faster than the jetliners which regularly fly over from the nearby international airport.

Unfortunately I did not write the event down on my calendar, but in early September of 2005, my husband and I were sitting on our deck, about 7 pm in the evening, watching birds in our backyard.  I looked up and saw a small airplane flying quickly, but fairly low across the sky, from right to left (south-east to south-west), with it's lights flickering. The sun was behind us and shone directly on the plane. Immediately above the plane (a few miles higher up in the sky) was a very large, capsule-shaped object moving very, very slowly...if at all. The sun was reflecting directly off of it making it shine a very bright gold metallic color.  I pointed the capsule out to my husband... who does not believe there are UFO's...and will only admit to seeing a 'light' in the sky.  He did not pay much attention to it, but I did.  The sky was clear which made the next part strange to me.  The capsule appeared to move slowly  behind a cloud or a cloud slowly covered the capsule and eventually the capsule disappeared.  The cloud's shape was not defined in any way, except the edge that slowly enveloped the capsule. Because the 'cloud' had no definition or color the capsule could have been going into a slit in the sky.  While the huge capsule was slowly disappearing, the small plane continued to move quickly across the sky under it.  Do not know what it was, but it is seared into my memory!",2006-05-15T00:00:00,42.8838625,-80.042125

The other night me and some guys from my church decided that we were going to ride out bikes out to  the old fort Pickens camp grounds on the island of Pensacola Fl.  It was very late around 12:45am to 1:00am and their were no lights.  Me and my friends had run out of navigate able road(the road was ruined in hurricane Ivan a few years ago.).  We had stopped for a break to drink a little water and rest for a few minuets, ""just enjoy the wind.""  My two friends were facing to the west towards the fort and the darkness and I was a little ahead of them; only by a few feet.  I was facing to the east  in the direction of the part of the beach that has the tall buildings and bright lights.  We were taking and suddenly my breath was taken away by  8 to 12 bright orange lights maybe 7-10 miles (truly guessing) away.  I can say in all confidence that they were off over the water away from the resorts. 	I stared at them as they shifted and danced in the sky.  They were perfectly spherical.  They started to dim and I realized that they were going to fade completely so I yelled.  I mean I just yelled and pointed.  By the time that my two friends had turned around the last two faded out and they did not see them.  I tried to explain it to them and when they turned around to ask if I was high(Iv never done any drugs I am completely clean).  I was trying to explain what I had seen when the lights reappeared and I pointed again they seemed closer and one more time they disappeared from sight just as they turned to see them.  And then a third time they appeared in the same place as the first time just as intense and in the same nature they shifted their formation. This time one of my friends turn and saw them and he too was dumb struck.  They all shifted north together and two by two faded while moving north(with the wind). 	That was the last we saw of them only two of the three of saw them and we didn’t see them or anything else strange.  We made it to the end of the island and then turned back because there was no where to spend the night. We saw nothing else out of the ordinary.

Just after midnight, my teenage son was sitting alone on the veranda of the inn where we were staying while talking on his cell phone.  He noticed a dome-topped saucer-shaped object with three lights circling underneath fly silently over the valley just in front of him.  He tried to take a picture of the object with his phone, but, unfortunately, the picture didn’t come out.  The saucer came to a stop over a stand of trees and search lights illuminated the trees below as if the unseen occupants were looking for something.  The search lights ended abruptly and the object immediately flew off at a high speed and disappeared behind Mount Washington.  The object then reappeared next to the mountain a minute or so later.  My terrified son (who is quite skeptical about UFOs) came up to our room to wake us and get a camera.  My husband, daughter, and I followed him down to the veranda for a look.  The object still appeared next to the mountain. I stepped into the lobby to see if anyone else had seen the object.  Another hotel guest, who is a pilot, happened to be looking out the window a few minutes earlier and noticed a plane flying over the valley.  The pilot joked that the guy flying the “plane” must have been on a suicide mission as no pilot would fly so low through a valley surrounded by mountains in the pitch black of night.  I told him about the object my son had seen and he and his family came to watch it with us as it hovered by Mount Washington.  As we watched, it appeared that two small jets approached the object and disappeared behind the mountain.  The UFO disappeared shortly after that.  We spent some time with the other family speculating about what we had seen.  Because the UFO was absolutely silent, we eliminated many known aircraft.   We weren’t able to get a clear photo of the object as it was so dark and a good distance from us.  We didn’t see the UFO again.  Our kids were freaked out and insisted on leaving the next morning.  My son was left quite shaken by the incident and refuses to talk about it.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

My girlfriend and I were driving home from a local eatery at approximately 10:30 PM on August 16th 2007. The eatery is located on Preston Rd just south of George Bush Tollway. The route we took was to head north on Preston Rd and enter onto George Bush Tollway heading east. As we continued this way and reached the vicinity of Coit Rd to Custer Rd we witnessed three strange looking lights in the sky northeast of our location. We first thought maybe they are lights attached to a pole for construction work purposes, but as we approached closer we realized they were higher in the air, but not as high as you might expect a plane to be travelling. We then thought they were low flying planes, but the lights appeared to be brighter than what i'm used to seeing and they did not appear to be moving. We continued to monitor the crafts as we transitioned from George Bush Tollway onto I75 heading north and noticed that there were more than just the original three crafts. As we made the change to I75 there were now 3 to the west, 3 to the east, 3-4 to the north, and 3 to the south as we traveled through Plano. On approach to the city of Allen, Texas we then observed 3 more in the distance to the north and 1 to the northeast. They all appeared to have lights like a plane would have ( red, blue flashing lights with a headlight), but the light seemed to always be facing us even as we changed directions and as mentioned before, they did not appear to be moving. Shortly after we arrived at our home in Allen, Texas I proceeded outside with my binoculars, but was unable to observe anything unusual within the airspace I was able to capture. My viewing space was limited due to homes and trees blocking most of my view. Was there some military action or police action? If so, then why was it not aired on the news?

I observed it fly across the entire sky, from my point of view the object seemed to be two hundred feet long at least. I have taken several astronomy classes and have a background in the physical sciences.

It was like talking to a war veteran about his days in combat. I hope I don’t get this story wrong; my cousin told me just once about it after I brought it up. I heard he saw something after some of the family was giving him a hard time about the experience; saying he must have been drinking and didn’t take him serious (he's an honest person). My cousin (35yrs old) and his friend (33 yrs old) were at the friend’s house at about 1:00am, but I am not sure about the date (mid July?) 2007. They had been out fishing and were moving fishing gear back to his car from his friend’s vehicle. His friend said something about the neighbor (1 mile down) must have got a new yard light. They then noticed that the light looked like it was “wobbling” back and forth. Then all of a sudden the light slowly rose above the tree line still “wobbling”. I believe he said it was triangular shaped with three lights (one on each corner); he got a better look at it above the tree line. Then he said within a couple seconds it was a dot in the sky. It went straight up at a very high speed. After seeing it rise he said it might have been further away then what they originally thought (maybe 4 or 5 mi away?). It stayed up in the sky for a while looking like a star until it was gone. They were in the Otisville area and the object was toward the Columbiaville area.

This was located around Ione Washington about 10 miles south July 27. There were 9 of us that witness this sighting. We were all camping and it was in the evening, and getting ready to go to bed. When out of the corner of my eye I saw 2 bright green balls they seemed glowing neon like. At first I thought that it was a huge fire work ready to go off then I looked over and realized they weren’t blowing up and they seemed huge about 2 times the size of a basketball.  When I first saw them, they were in between the trees. I said, “OMG Look at that!” to everyone and I started to kind of freak out. I said, “We should get the cam.” but they started too move out of sight. So we all ran out into the drive way out of the tree line and there they were just hovering going slowly up and down and back and forth no real formation. It was kind of bouncy like, hard to explain.  There was no sound at all. They started to slowly go further into space. This lasted about 5 min. or so. They were very bright in the sky even as they got smaller in size. They started to look like a star.  Then my dad said, “Look, there’s a red one” it was going across the sky pretty fast but it seemed it could have been a satellite at first, but it then stopped and went the other way. It then turned around and went out into space following the other two. Then they all disappeared together. We didn’t get pics I am so upset cause they were in the sky for so long. But I can now say I believe that there is something out there.  Almost forgot this part:  The next day we were at the beach, and then there was this super loud sound roaring like, when all of a sudden there was air force jets flying really low and really fast. They were following the river. This scared the heck out of us. I have been up camping and my grandparent lived in this area all my life (I'm in my 30's)and never saw either thing ever happen up there before. We do have an air force base in Spokane but not sure if this is related or not. But seems very strange they were in this area the next day.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,48.6976,-117.2936

What I've done is gone back inside for awhile to rest and then I've come back outside to see if it's still there and I was able to find it quickly and it continued doing its strange stopping and then moving a few degrees and stopping again.

I was TDY to Ramstein AB in Germany. The other maintainer that accompanied me on the trip had never been to Germany before and wanted to do a little sightseeing.  I have been to Germany several times and had never done any real sightseeing myself, so we decided to go for it.   Well, Germany has many castles and after doing some research, we discovered that there was a castle close by in the town of Landstuhl.  So we got a cab and took the 15 minute ride to Landstuhl Castle.  Well, unfortunately, we got there a little late and the casle had already closed for the day.  Since the castle was at a higher elevation, it provided some nice views for picture taking.  So I started snapping away.  We were offered a great view of the town of Landstuhl below.   As I was taking pictures, a 747 aircraft was on final approach into Ramstein AB.  Of course, I didn't want the plane in some of the pictures, I waited for it to get out of the frame.  Digital cameras offer the option of taking pictures using the LCD screens rather than the view finders.  So I always use the LCD screen.   So once the airplace was out of sight, I snapped my picture.  Once a picture is taken, I have my camera set up to show the picture on the LCD screen for 5 second.  Then it goes back to live picture mode.   When I was taking the picture, I didn't notice anything on the screen.  When I looked at the screen after I took the picture, I noticed a dark shadow, which had the appearance of a flying saucer.   I then looked up into the sky to see if I could see what had showed up in the picture.  Whatever it was, wasn't there anymore.  So I looked back at my camera, which had already gone into live picture mode again.  I then switched the camera into picture viewing mode to further exam the photo.   At that time, I showed to picture to my companion.  We were both in awe at the sight.  When I zoomed in on the shadow, it truly made me believe that I had gotten a rare photo of a UFO.  I checked the lens on my camera and there was nothing on it.  I did not wipe it down for fear of scratching it.  It did not show up in any other pictures that I took.

What you are about to read is quite unbelieveable. But I swear on my familys life that what I say is true and even have a witness whom saw exactly what I did.. And it changed my life forevermore...  The year was 86.  I was 17. My friend and I were driving on a rural country road/hwy, just outside the town of Louisville KY on a fine clear summer day. The time was about 4:30pm. I was riding shotgun and enjoying the nice country drive when something caught my attention through the corner of my eye off to the left of the highway.  I noticed something large hovering over a wooded area about a quarter mile away.  At first I thought ""what in the world is that?""  It was a silvery metallic cigar shaped craft that was probably at least a hundred feet long.  It was in a vertical position, just hanging there motionless maybe a hundred feet above the treetops. I pointed this curiosity out to my friend who was just as puzzeled as I. I figured it must be a weather ballon or something like that. But...I have never seen anything even re similar in appearance in my 17 years of life. There were no appendages, wings, motors, rotors, windows, Nothing! It was a solid metallic shape that reflected the suns rays brilliantly. My friend and I were looking at the object trying to figure out what it was, when, in the blink of an eye it was gone!  I was quite excited and scared. Eagerly we scanned the skies around where it had been, looking for it, but it was nowhere to be found.  Maybe 30 seconds later, while looking on the OTHER side of the expressway from where it had been, I saw it hanging there motionless again. Yelling ""there it is!""  I pointed to my friend where it was, and we both watched it for several seconds.  Then, right before our very eyes, it disappeared slowly, as if it was cloaking, or dematerializing. It just faded out to nothing.  It did not move away.  It just disappeared. We were speechless.  I told family and friends but no one believed me, even with my friend as witness. I cannot describe how I felt, but know that this event convinced me to research what I saw, and over the years I have found much. Having seen this firsthand, I have opened my eyes to accept what others cannot. Many people have seen exactly what I have, all over the world. I don't know what it was that I saw, but it was broad daylight when we saw it, so there is no questionable night time issues here. In my opinion this was no government secret project/craft. 1. The technology was far too advanced. 2.  The speed used would have broken a humans neck, or the G forces involved would have been impossible for a human to withstand. 3.  As far as I know , no government on earth has craft cloaking/dematerializing abilities.  This has bothered the hell out of me for 20 years. It could be a government project, but I seriously doubt it. Having seen what I have, I honestly believe we are being visted by beings from another world.  Before I die, my one wish in this world is to truly know what I saw.

These discs were above the few clouds that were present that day. I called to her to look at what I was seeing and she saw it immediately. At that time another disc entered the formation from the West. We just watched in awe.  They continued to circle in perfect formation and then one by one they shot off to the West and seeming to go upward until out of site. This lasted approximately 3 minutes. The circle appeared to be about the size of a basketball and the discs were about the size of a quarter. This was above the level of clouds as there was a thin cloud that the discs flew above as they left the formation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I don't have the exact date of my one and only sighting of which i am convinced of still, all these years later was a UFO. I just canot explain it and nothing has come about in the last twenty years that can. There are no planes, Shuttle Craft, Or anything else that has been invented that i know of that looks any thing like what i saw. Myself and a friend were on a fishing trip in west cork,We were about ten miles from the coast heading down a rural road driveing at mabey fifty miles an hour.I am going down a slight hill and on both sides there are hedgerows with small spindely trees every so often and its hilly country side were driveing trough, Its dark and about one o'clock in the morning, All of a sudden with no warning a green light passed across the car from left to right like a scan the light did not seem to enter the car, It made a noticeable movement that i can only describe as being like a fine line of light that did not spread out and light up the whole road only the area we were in. It had a difference about it that i have never come across again.As it crossed away from the right hand side of the car i caught a breef glims of something glowing green moveing away over a slight hill the glims only lasted a few seconds. By the time i stoped the car and got out it had vanished, Myself and my friend just stood there with no explaination as to what had just happened I asked if he'ed seen it, He said he had,We were amased but only stayed a few minutes at the place and drove on, its odd but i dont realy remember us haveing much to say about it as we drove to the coast were we saw it again, It must have been fifteen or twenty minutes later when we got to the beach i had stoped and parked the car and was eager to get out of it and look at the sky it was a very clear night with very little cloud and as i looked out over the sea i saw it, it must have been a few miles out and hovering over the sea, It was a green ball of light, pure green light,It held there for a couple of seconds two at the most and then in a flash it raced acrossed the sea and it was gone.My friend said he only saw a flash of green light at the horizon as he got out of the car. I swear that this sighting is true, It has left me hopeing that in my lifetime it will be proved that were not alone in this universe that there is life on other planets, Hopefully not too much longer, I cant see how it can be hidden any more.

It was clearly visible for about one minute. It had 7 red lights in a circular formation. The lights were equally spaced from each other near the edge of the disk and recessed into something solid. The surface of the disk was not visible. I could see the stars in the sky behind the object but I could also clearly see that the lights were recessed in a solid surface. There was no reflection on any surface of the lights. The disk was turned on it's side with the axis (going through the middle of the disk) parallel to the ground.  The disk moved exactly like a wheel being pushed across the ground because as the disk rotated at the same speed as the object moved forward. It also maintained a constant height above the ground, moving up as it approached and cleared a hill and then down as it went down the other side of the hill.  The speed of the object was 5 or 6 MPH. The size was at least 60 feet across (from one edge of the disk to the other). The altitude was at least 60 feet. It easily cleared a group of 40-50 foot tall trees.  I describe it as a disk because that is all I could see of it but it might also have been a cylinder and I could only see one end of it.  There was absolutely no sound from the object and there was no visible exhaust or disturbance of the air.  I have seen all manner of man made aircraft in the Seattle area from military helicopters to stealth and B1-B bombers. While I don't know the origin of the object I can say it had none of the chracteristics of any man made craft I have ever seen or heard of.  My career is in software development.

I walked to the kitchen of the house that I grew up in, which had a very large window that ran along the west wall. I proceeded to the fridge, and took out my sippy cup that was already full of milk. I shut the fridge door and turned around to go back to my room. As I did that, I took a deep drink from my cup and looked up, and out of the window, I saw a purple spiral hovering in the sky, slowly rotating. The spiral was made from a soft glow of purple light, that was unlike any light that I have ever seen, and nothing more. It was about the size of a quarter if you held it up to the sky. I took a good look at the object for about 3 seconds, and I knew that it was something very, very strange. I got scared and ran back to my room. My second cousin was on leave from the military at the time, and he just so happened to be staying with us and sharing my room. I woke him up and told him what I saw. He went to go and have a look for himself. I don't remember what he said it was, or if he said he saw it. I remember what I saw as if it were yesterday, and it was not normal. The light appeared to be self contained, as if it were ""bottled"". There was no apparent source of light, and the light itself was not too bright, it was more of a soft glow, sort of like a neon light.

It's important to note that I've had similar sightings to this one two other times, all with witnesses.  I'll just put them all on this one posting.  First Sighting:  The happened way back when I was in highschool, about 1988.  The location from which we made the sighting was in the mountains above Boulder, Colorado, in the parking lot of the Bald Mountain hiking area.  I was parking with a girl I was dating at the time.  It was about 10pm.  We decided to stand up in the back of my car and put our heads out of the sunroof to look at the stars.  It was a clear night.  Looking northward, we just stargazed for a few minutes.  I then noticed three stars that seemed to be in a perfect equalateral formation, about 75 degrees above the horizon, fairly close together (if you hold your hand out at arm's length, they would be about the distance apart of 1"" between thumb and forefinger).  I just looked at them for about 30 seconds, and mentioned them to my companion.  She looked at them.  Then they started to move in apparently random directions, each one in a straight line, only a few degrees, and then they'd stop.  Then they'd move again for a few seconds, and then stop.  Then they all started moving about ""1-o'clock"" from their position, still in a clear triangle formation, but not equalateral.  They accelerated in that direction, and vanished.  We were stunned!  We both saw the whole thing.  We were both totally sober, too.  A year or so later, I saw a very similar thing, this time with two other sober witnesses, from the top of Flagstaff Mountain in Boulder, at night.  Later, about 1991, I again made a similar sighting, this time with another two sober witnesses, while walking in North Boulder park at night.  Geosynchronous-orbit satellites do NOT look like what I saw.  Neither do faster-moving satellites that move counter to the rotation of the earth.  Stars do NOT start moving and then stop and then move in different directions and then disappear.  I know that some people would say that what I saw were ""military planes"", but that's not true.  They were VERY distant and looked just like stars.  Military planes do NOT move like what I saw.  I know that it's hard to determine distance at night (or even in the daytime) of objects you see, but I have a good spacial sense and I know what I saw.  These were NOT normal astral events.  This sighting is VERY similar to one seen from Twin Peaks in San Francisco that I saw in the database, but can't find now!  Anyway, there are numerous cases similar to this one in the database.

Three of us were driving around the Woodland area of Mansfield, OH on a very clear night, just happy to be out of the house and hanging out.  For well over an hour, we could all clearly see a brilliant blue/white light in the sky.  It appeared to be a bright star, or perhaps a planet. It was fairly high in the sky, not near the horizon at all. Again, after seeing it for more than an hour in the same exact spot we thought it could only be a celestial object.  However, after a while we were driving down a road and saw it through the windshield...and suddenly it shot off to the north/northeast at incredible speed.  It went so fast that it left a blue/white streak halfway across the sky before it disappeared. At first we thought it was a meteor, but upon reflection realized it could not be--what meteors are blue/white and stay in the same spot for nearly 2 hours before they move?  Much later, a few years after graduating from college, I saw one of the friends again and they remembered the strange events as clearly as I did.

Married for 8+ years with a stable happy life. Ironically, we had just moved back to the Stockton address (my home growing up)nearly three years previous in December 1984 from Roswell, N.M.. We moved to Roswell by chance. Placed an application at the local sign company while I helped a couple good friends move to Roswell. Not Once did any of my super good partners who were born and raised in Roswell mention/utter a word about the Roswell Incident 40 years earlier. Anyway--- at that time and probably ever sense I was in my late teens I've always had the attitude that ""anything is possible"". I can only say for sure that the date an year can only be 1987 or 1988 in early to mid November. Why I remember that it was in November, we were having an ""Indian Summer"" that year. I was watering the edges of my front lawn by hand when for no reason I looked up into the sky above me and all I could see is a black. No stars, no blue-black color that one see's normally as the color of night sky unless you live away from city lights etc.The whole entire sky was filled with this huge black opaque object as far as I could see in all directions. Then through the branches of the tree that I was standing under,set of lights appeared in a chevron shape with a larger reddish orange with a glimpse of yellow lite was in the center of this chevron shape of different colored lights. It was so huge and looked as though it was traveling no more than 30-40 miles per hour. I remember thinking to myself as to what's keeeping this ship from just falling out of the sky. Going way to slow to not fall out of the sky. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I could see the real actual night sky with all the stars in the drk-blue black setting. As it continued passing over, I could see the enormity of this thing as it traveled in a north west direction towards the city of Antioch, Fairfield, Vacaville, Santa Rosa and eventually to the Pacific coast. As it was leaving my area, I was estimating the altitude with the telephone poles in the area. This ""Mothership or whatever took up at least a 3-4 block sq. area and maybe more at an altitude no more than 300 - 400 ft in the air  and was so quiet (not a peep)it was noisy.

I became stunt for few seconds then i turned about and grab my cousin's arm who was standing directly infront of me and told him to look at that direction and then i found the thing disappeared.  i never got to tell anyone because i thought no one here would believe me. i live in brunei and this place is a small country so maybe there's lesser chance for me to meet someone who have seen similar things. i was surprise to find this website where i can share with everyone who probably would have the encounter the same thing.  Even today i never got to tell much people here because im worried they will think im NUTs :0  from my memory, i remember that the object was not the typical saucer look which we always get on TV/indepandent day/internet/discovery channel. It was something different. it was very high-tech and unique. it is nothing like what i've ever seen in any movies. There were many details on the body of the craft as if it looks like pipes / wiring attached to the body. from the distance where i was standing, i consider the object small. probably measuring about 4 to 5 feet lenght x  4 feet width x 3 to 5 feet thickness. no lights were seen. i can see that object with available lights because i was close enough from that subject as the house had some lightings around the surrounding of the garden to lite up some part of the roof.  The stangest thing i canot figure out how it can do was; the object was actually floating on top of the roof (probably less then a feet away from the roof), the roof were soft and old and it should have made noise. even rain drops falling onto the roof would make noise but from my distant i hear nothing from the object and the roof (the corner part) was not even rattling.  after that incident i've always wish to see it another time. i told some of my friends i wish to see them again. i consider myself very lucky to see it that close because from documentary, discovery channels, books, internet sites, videos...all those who said they have seen are from a very great distant and they can't really judge how it look like. most of them say its like a saucer. but for me, it can look like anything.

He sees it, and we talk for a moment about it, then he turns, yells and points to the moon, upon which I see a white dot of light accelerate from in front of moon north towards the Nevada Test Site.  After traveling several degrees in the vision in just a second or so, it had accelerated to the point it was no longer visible. After this I began marking times using a function on my watch, and at 8:06 I noticed another one of the red darts.

The laptop has only an effective battery life of 70 minutes, and was not at full capacity the last time I used it, which was around 18:00.

I lost sight for a minute when I arrived home and parked and exited my car.  I looked in the general vicinity where I originally seen this and what I thought was an extremely bright star caught my eye. I didn't watch it continually at first but kept glancing back as I carried groceries in. Then I stopped and watched it closer. It was only white at this time.  I noticed that it didn't look like a typical twinkling star because it was so much brighter. Then it seemed to be shimmying a little or maybe slightly wavering from side to side. The light on it then appeared to be scanning.  I called my mother to get her to watch it. She agreed it was moving and the light appeared to be going around in circles or scanning. It gradually started to fade farther away but was still noticeable to us. Although if I had only seen it at this point I would have definitely thought it was a star.  Then I noticed a red light that seemed to come from it. This red light was getting more and more bright as the other was fading more and more. I watched the object with the red light go from west to east just opposite of what the first had done. It traveled along the mountain steadily just as if it were a typical plane I have seen at night. It did seem much lower though. I watched it as far as I could see it and it done nothing significant. The other light continued to fade and eventually I could not see it at all.  This all lasted for approximately 45 minutes. I am not sure how long it had been there when it first caught my eye.,2008-06-12T00:00:00,37.0484,-81.7025

The spot where it was just looked many stars bunched together that are no longer there when you look at that general area.  *With how big the object was and how fast it was traveling, it should not have been able to stop that fast and that’s what made me first think that humans could not have made this.

I would estimate the craft was about as wide as the wingspan of a commercial jet and about as long two football fields. It had a cylindrical fuselage. It had one green light near the front and two purple lights at the rear. The front sloped down from the main body of the craft and was lower than the rest of the craft as well.

At first I thought it was a plane but my boyfriend told me it was not as there were no other lights on it as there would be on aircraft.  My boyfriend told me to pull over so he could get a better look.  As we stopped another one could be seen following the first one, about half a mile behind the first one.  Then came another one behind that one,  more followed and it looked like a staggered line/formation of approximately 6-8 orange glowing balls.  We thought it was very strange and were a bit freaked out.  We called my boyfriend's parents and Uncle who both had seen the lights.  At first I thought it could be a formation of special military jets which don’t have lights or sound but my boyfriend said that was not possible.  After 5-10 minutes they went behind a cloud and disappeared south of Watford.

On a warm day in (what I can guess was) May, at about noontime, I was going out to check the mail. It was windy, and so I was looking up watching the leaves flutter around on the trees. It was then I saw a dull chrome object (I say ""dull"" chrome as it was not really reflecting the light as a normal chrome finish should)(maybe there was a haze around the object that made it appear duller? it was most definitely chrome.) at first glance I thought it was an airplane or a jet, yet on closer inspection I noticed that  1.)It was moving at such a slow pace it was nearly stationary, 2.)It had no wings or windows at all. 3.)It was totally silent. 4.)It was spinning on its side.  When I say spinning on its side, I mean that it was roughly shaped like this <> except the sides were rounded. much like a 3d oval with pointed ends. the rounded sides was theoutermost spinning edge, like the Earth's equator, and the pointed ends were like the poles. after I noticed this, I also noticed it was much too low in the sky to be a conventional aircraft. even though it was directly above me, it scarcely cleared the tops of the trees. As I reached into my pocket to pull out my cell phone (which has a camera function) to take it's picture, it sped up slightly, and I managed to take the picture and save it. shortly afterwards, it stopped spinning for a half second, traveled backwards about 20 yards, and then turned on it's engines, which emitted 3 vapor trails and began spinning and traveling at great speed. at this time the vapor trails resembled a helix (DNA) without the ladder rungs and one trail in the middle. it zigzaged across the sky, shot upwards and then back down and upwards again, and then flew off at a speed impossible for an airplane or jet, and disappeared beyond the clearing through the trees. shortly after this, I looked back at my cell phone, and it had been turned off (not by me) and when I turned it back on, It had been erased clean of anything I had stored onto it. ringtones, pictures, my address book--all gone. 3 or 4 days later, at night,(approx 2:35 am) I woke up to a pulsing, buzzing, electrical/magnetic type noise directly outside my window. after a minute or two I looked outside, and there seemed to be nothing there. Just the noise. But, when I returned to bed, the buzzing stopped, and there was a split-second flash of sea-green light. I dont know if this was from the same object, but it seemed to be related.  additional info: -When I spotted it, I was facing (roughly) NW -It was in the eastern part of the sky that it disappeared. -the pulsing sound in the night afterward lasted roughly 5 minutes.

I spent the weekend in New Jersey and on Sunday, my father gave me a ride back to Philadelphia.  I drove, and he asked if I could stop down in Chinatown so he could pick up some tea and some new teacups.  I took 95-N and got off at the Washington Ave exit, and proceeded up Washington Ave to 7th St. A few blocks before I turned onto 7th, I was looking up at the clouds when I saw something just kind of sitting there in the clouds that I could not identify.  When we turned south on 7th St., we pulled into a parking lot just off the intersection and across from Pho Ha where my father wanted to stop. I decided to hop out and use the DV camcorder my folks bought for my girlfriend and I back in Novemember when our son was born, and started recording.  The quality is not the best, and there's a Vietnamese band playing in the background in part of the footage but take a look. It's clearly not an airplane or a helicopter.  Around 2:38, I zoom all the way out to show just how far away this thing is, and based on that (which you'll see), I don't feel confident that it's a balloon as from that distance, even with my good eyesight, I don't think I would have seen a regular balloon flying that high, that far away, with the late afternoon sun kind of in my eyes otherwise.

I've ruled out planes, satellites, comets and meteors, and even! halluci nations as i was accompanied by a friend. this leaves only the things of ""fiction"", either something man made that has been kept out of public knowledge or something made from an older, more intelligent species, who are probably here to try and stop us from killing ourselves and our beautiful planet. this has been a memory that will always remain at the front of my brain, i still think about it almost every day.  in fact it effectively changed me from a hopeful skeptic to a full fledged believer. in less then a second.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,35.91850835322196,-86.88540525059665

They looked like folded paper that was illuminated from the inside. They were glowing kind of dull, not very bright a white/light blue color. There was the main group that maintained in the formation, then two of them trailing behind as if they were trying to catch up to the group. I refer to them as ""bird-like"" because I've never seen anything else fly in that sort of formation. But the objects themselves didn't have wings and weren't saucer shapped either. The best way to describe them is to imagine an oragami bird illuminated from the inside. I know it sounds weird, but it's hard to relate to something I've never seen before. It's difficult to say the size. They seemed small, ( in respect to things I usually see in the sky like planes) but I'm not really sure. They were flying below the clouds, and above the tree lines. But it was still hard to judge their distance away. The whole thing lasted about 7-10 seconds. It made no sounds like a plane or birds, just complete silence. Then then formation continued to fly into the distance until it was no longer visible. Before my friend and I walked outside and saw this formation, the same pattern appeared on his computer screen. The pattern floated across the screen, from left to right until it was off the screen. We thought that somthing was messed up with the power, so thats why we went outside.

While watching red-tailed hawks from the Palisades Park in Santa Monica CA. observed a dark grey spherical object approximately 500 feet over Pacific Coast Highway. Object caught my attention due to it's lack of motion. I assumed it was a tethered balloon, but given the variable wind conditions along the coast, from the west around 7 to 12 knots, I would have expected some wobbling or  other motion from a tethered balloon.  I was facing west and the object was about 80° up from my vantage point. I observed it for about 5 to 10 minutes. I never saw any buffeting you'd expect with having a tethered balloon and variable wind conditions. Size was about a pea at arms distance.  Having a tethered object of any kind in that area would be at the very least reckless as it's common for low flying air craft such as helicopters and ad banner planes to fly through the area. That location is about 2 miles WNW up the coast from the very busy Santa Monica airport and it's common for aircraft to traverse at or below 500 feet going up or down the coast over the ocean to pass the western part of the airport departure route (typically runway 21).  I ran out of time and had to leave the area. Always been a curiosity. Haven't seen any thing similar at that location, but I did see a similar object about 2 months ago, 2 miles inland. I observed it through my 10x80 binoculars. It was partially obscured by some clouds. Probably less than 20 seconds of observation time. Similar attitude.

We had been sitting for approx. 15 minutes when they abruptly stopped talking and before I could ask why, I looked up and saw an object approx.100 feet across move over my head.  It was absolutely silent and was moving at an altitude of approx. 50 to 100 feet above our heads.  The only light associated with the object was a very fuzzy glow around the perimeter of the object. Because it was poorly lit, I cannot say the exact shape of the object but it appeared rectangular.   Gaging by the time it took to disappear into the distance, I would estimate the objects speed to be approx. 50 m.p.h..   What I saw differed from my friends, since they saw it as it approached.  They described the large object approaching at a higher altitude and then abruptly dropping to the altitude in which it passed over head.

Joint Investigation by NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia, Fireball, Columbus Georgia  Occurred : 11/29/2006 16:00 (Entered as : 11292006 16:00) Reported: 11/30/2006 5:27:48 AM 05:27 Posted: 12/7/2006 Location: Columbus, GA Shape: Fireball Duration: Unknown  (NOTE:  Readers, for a full understanding of the following described inquiry, please see full original witness account at NUFORC; Columbus Georgia, Fireball, Posted 12/7/2006).  Recap-  A resident of Columbus Georgia, a retired educator holding a PhD, was reportedly ill on 28Nov06 and did not follow the normal local news of the day.  The next day, on 29Nov06, he discovered the circumstances of the 28Nov06 Columbus suspected 'airplane crash' as covered by the local TV station and newspaper.  At that point, he was mystified by certain events that had occurred earlier that day (29th) in relation to the Columbus Airport, said area which he had driven past in his automobile.  These unusual events described by the witness at the airport involved an alleged unmarked 727 that was taxied close to the adjacent roadway, and was suspected of causing the witness' passing vehicle to stall, as if some unknown electronic device was in operation from within the craft. Other unusual circumstances relating to this are described in the original account. The below described inquiry attempted to sort out all of the matters described by the witness in his NUFORC statement, which basically alleged that something unknown was recovered and then secretly removed from Columbus Georgia by agencies unknown.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On Thursday evening, 7Dec06, Peter Davenport, the Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, contacted this writer and described the account posted by the witness in this case. An agreement was reached to further scrutinize the situation.  Unavoidable events then occurred which delayed movement on this investigation in the desired prompt manner.  This writer was in the process of returning to MUFON after a 2+ year absence, and was in a transitional phase.  Furthermore the MUFON representative in Columbus Georgia had suffered an extreme medical condition which left him permanently disabled, and no other FIs were in close proximity.  This writer lives some 75 miles north of Columbus. Then during the first phases of the investigation, this FI developed an extreme case of the flu and bronchitis, with pneumonia, which lasted several weeks, most of which I was unable to speak properly.  This writer contacted the witness by both phone and email and further discussed the account.  He was asked, and stated he would inquire, if his associate PhD, his passenger on 29Nov06, would also submit an account.  (This account was never produced).  During these conversations, the witness stated that the local TV meteorologist (name on file) had stated that he had noticed a return on his Doppler radar unit about the time of the purported 'plane crash' on 28Nov06, and that he had spoken to this meteorologist.  This writer identified the meteorologist and placed repeated phone calls to him which were NEVER returned.  An email also went UNANSWERED, as did a letter posted to him at the TV station.  The witness had also described a quickly formed task force of search personnel that had been formed on 28Nov06 shortly after a 'crash witness' had phoned 911.  This search party consisting of Columbus Police and Fire/Rescue, FAA, and soldiers from the adjacent massive Fort Benning.  (NOTE: Sidebar-  This writer recalls seeing this large search operation covered by the local Atlanta TV stations, and the Columbus authorities stating, at sometime prior to 11:00PM, that no downed aircraft had been found).  The area of the suspected downed aircraft, vicinity of 8801 Macon Road, is the location of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft facility. Furthermore said Macon Rd. actually forms part of the northern perimeter of the Fort Benning Army Base.  From past experience, this writer is aware that any major public safety emergency IMMEDIATELY outside of the base has been responded to by Army emergency personnel due to the the possible effects on the base itself and due to the Army being a 'good neighbor' to the local Columbus authorities.  Thus a response by the Army Military Police, Provost, or base public safety personnel, is not unusual in a case such as a possible downed aircraft.  In this same vein, this writer contacted the Director of Security for the Pratt & Whitney facility (name on file).  He stated that he recalled the afternoon of the event.  The police had sent an officer out ahead to check on conditions as the search was organized and deployed.  He spoke to the officer, but could report nothing vital.  The DirSec's office is elevated, and he stated that it overlooks most of the area in question in a panoramic view, and that he had noticed nothing extraordinary such as a crashing aircraft or similar.  This writer also contacted the Columbus Police i.e. 911 Center to locate records of the initial emergency call and the original 'plane crash' witness.  This writer was bounced around to different divisions, and generally ignored for days on end.  Past professional contacts in that agency maintained when this writer was a Chief of Police had been transferred or also retired.  This investigator then filed a request for records under the 'Georgia Open Records Act', a state law similar to the FOIA.  This produced what was described as the only record relating to the event (since they maintain that nothing was found), a 911 dispatch card.  It listed the original caller's name and not much else.  The nature of the 'call' was described as ""Caller sts seen a plane go down north east of Pratt Whitney"".  Time received 15:56:14; Time dispatched 15:56:19; Time arrived 16:08:52.  This writer phoned the name listed as the original 911 witness, with NO response.  A complete letter of explanation of our needs, insuring confidentiality, and a SASE, was then mailed to the witness, again with NO response.  This writer also filed detailed FOIA covering all aspects of this matter to the FAA.  On 30March07, the FAA responded stating that ""........searched our files........could NOT find any records responsive to your request....""  During this inquiry, the writer earlier contacted a journalist with the largest Columbus newspaper (organ and name on file).  This individual had demonstrated in past years that he was a friend of Ufology, of MUFON of Georgia and ISUR in particular.  All aspects were explained to him as well as request for informational help through his various contacts among the local government and community.  He agreed to 'make some calls' and pass any info to this writer.  This individual developed nothing more than what was already known about the search for a downed aircraft, which he had monitored on his public safety scanner.  Also contacted was the Air Force Space Command.  This writer sent a request to Lieutenant ______ ______, USAF (name on file) explaining what information we sought  regarding returning space junk and re-entering debris.  The answer came on 5Jan07, indicating that the 1st Space Command Control Squadron at Cheyenne Mountain AF Station confirmed that there was NO returning orbital debris being tracked in the vicinity of the southeastern USA at the times in question.  Likewise the Joint Space Operations Center Weather Flight that there were no unusual space or terrestrial weather phenomena observed during the same time period.  A note added, in order to discuss meteors, refer to NASA.  The following data highlights should be noted, as it was taken directly from the data base of NUFORC, regarding the following states in the southeastern USA;  28Nov06, between 4:00PM  and 9:00PM and later;  Georgia- EST zone- Dacula, 7PM, Bright green object like shooting star, seemed to stop....moved on. Nahunta, 7PM, fireball observed, no color given. Dalton, 7PM, fireball observed, long tail, shooting across sky, changing pink and green, broke into 2-3 pieces, vanished.  Rome 6:35PM, fireball glowing green, NW to south, broke up into several pieces, appeared to strike earth, witness suspected space debris or meteor. Lawrenceville 6:30PM, very bright green light 'eyebrow shape', silent, very high-speed. Rising Fawn, 6:15PM, 2 round green lights falling toward horizon, aqua-green, no tail, like pencil erasure held AAL, witness later heard Chattanooga weather report of fireball meteors.  Alabama- CST zone- Birmingham, 1st, 5:30PM, Blu-grn ball of light; 2nd, 5:30PM, green light streaking across sky, thicker tail than meteor, seemed close to ground, went over a 'mountain', gone; 3rd, 5:30PM, large round bright green circle, WNW to ESE, seemed to be meteor; 4th, brilliant green light to NE, quicker than a plane, 45 degree angle to earth, lost behind trees; 5th, 5:30PM, large green fireball, W to E, surrounded by glowing white light, tail like a comet, next day news said NASA had no meteor reports, news called it a 'UFO"".  Pinson, 5:35PM, fireball, white then turned green, vanished behind trees....said landed 2 miles away. Huntsville, 5:30PM, bright green light, traveled east over Chapman Mountain, very fast, wife saw same from different location miles away, like Roman Candle. Bremen, 5:30PM, bright green fireball, falling, resembled fire works display.  (NOTE: Alabama Sidebar--The 'Decatur Alabama Daily News' ran a story in their 29Nov06 edition.  ""Lights in Sky Probably Space Junk or Meteor"".  Thumbnail--The 911 Center in Morgan County began receiving calls at 5:28PM CST on 28Nov06, that a brilliant lime-green light had appeared and the callers were claiming it was a 'downed aircraft'.  A multi-agency public safety search effort was mounted in the area and no downed aircraft was found.  Local astronomers went on to describe space junk, and so forth.  Including that lime-green would be consistent with burning aluminum re-entering the earth's atmosphere. A University of Alabama astronomer stated the ""sightings were too late to be explained by the meteor shower that took  place last week"".  (Leonids).  Article went on to discuss bolides, the differences in the way the human eye perceives color and a recent golf shot made by a Russian cosmonaut that hit a golf ball into orbit to become 'space junk').  Tennessee, split into EST and CST zones- Knoxville, 1st, 10:45PM, 8-10 blu-grn lights, very bright, circular, largest like 1/2 moon, others smaller, E to SE, seemed 60-100mph, large aircraft like a 'tanker' seen following behind; 2nd, 6:30PM, 5 very bright blue lights, silent, passed overhead, vanished, distant boom then heard, 5 minutes another boom; 3rd, 6:30PM, large blue fireball, moving east, unlike 'shooting star', traveled 180 degrees, broke into 2-3 pieces, reminded witness of shuttle breakup. Chattanooga, 6:30PM, bright green light, silent, as if 100 feet above ground, intense light, looked as if had 2 parts, shot forward then gone, policeman stopped, got out and looked.  Soddy Daisy, 6:30PM, 2 bright green lights close to horizon, falling at angle, witness says could make out a cylinder or cigar shape from which lights seem to come.....vanished.....neighbor saw same driving miles away. Oliver Springs, fireball, streak of light, NW to ESE, saw 4-5 balls develop from it, burned, went dark.  Kentucky, split into EST and CST zones. Stanford, 6:30PM, very fast green light, W to E, strange shade of green.  Hyden, 5:00PM, 7-8 blu-grn lights, appeared far away, detected circular motion.  North Carolina, EST zone.  Marshall, 7:00PM, green light, too fast for an aircraft, S to N, seemed 5 inches off horizon AAL.  Marble, 6:50PM, bright green light, silent, illuminated clouds, moving to NE, seemed 3000-4000 feet, 200-400 mph.  Boone, 6:40PM, fireball, large, bright green, poorly defined edges, clouds glowing green, changed direction slowly. Franklin, 6:25PM, 2 green lights, very fast, down then upwards, silent, one ahead of the other.  While there is a difference in times, directions, and exact descriptions, there is enough probable cause therein to indicate there was in fact something afoot in the SE skies of the USA the evening of 28Nob06.  TOO MANY similarities not to have been connected to the same, or a series of, related aerial event(s).  It's obvious from past investigations that a bolide, fireball, large meteor, or huge returning space junk, can be seen by ground observers MANY hundreds of miles apart. Likewise large meteor showers.  Past investigations have found CREDIBLE witnesses that all believed the light/object/fireball observed went to ground nearby when it actually traveled over the horizon, sometimes into another state.  A good example of this was a SC police helicopter pilot who made such an observation on the Ga/SC state line.  He was preparing to call out the search parties for a downed aircraft and actually landed his chopper to refuel so as to cross into Georgia to assist.  The object observed on that occasion was later tracked by citizen's reports across Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and on into Arkansas.  During the course of this investigation, it was found that the previously orbiting Russian reconnaissance satellite Cosmos 2423 was launched on 14Sept06 and it's orbit began to decay before completion of it's expected appx. 120 day mission (possible mechanical malfunction).  Various sources indicated that the breakup began on or about 17-18November 2006 and the satellite was then destroyed at some point by ground command to better control any resulting impact damage and to prevent 'foreign' intelligence services' from retrieving any possible surviving components.  The U.S. Space Command indicated that Cosmos 2423 generated 28 cataloged fragments, NORAD catalog numbers 29604-29631. Additional speculation is that the now smaller Cosmos 2423 fragments might have taken as long as 30 days to re-enter the atmosphere, which puts the 28Nov06 date well within that window.  One would like to think that the US Space Command would not be intentionally deceitful to the American public regarding requests for information, but in matters dealing with intelligence about reconnaissance efforts of a potential future foe, I'm not so sure.  In fact, in such a case, I would fully EXPECT such matters to remain confidential within our military and intelligence community.  Additional speculation on my part is that IF anything HAD been recovered during the Columbus Georgia 'downed aircraft search', and it rose to the level of requiring the find to remain secret or confidential, the Columbus Municipal Airport would be the last place used to remove it from the local scene.  The Columbus Airport is only some 4+ miles from the Ft. Benning base perimeter, and the location of the 'search' area is practically atop the base's northern property line (Macon Road vicinity).  Fort Benning Georgia is IMMEDIATELY adjacent the City of Columbus.  This fort is one of the largest U.S. Army installations in the world, and is the home of the Army's Airborne School, the Headquarters of the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the Infantry School. Official records indicate that Fort Benning, and it's various training commands, is serviced from within by Lawson Army Airfield which is capable of, and does, land the largest aircraft owned by the U.S. Government; the C-5, C-17, C-141, C-130 and others.  It is this writer's opinion that anything requiring such secrecy as described by the witness would have been flown out of Lawson Army Airfield.  Doing so would give TOTAL and COMPLETE control and security to such a confidential process.  Such security would be marginal, or non-existent, at a civilian municipal airport.  This is not to say that such a municipal airport has not been used during certain government projects, but again, anything arising to such a confidential level would be routed through a government installation if at all possible.......there is no doubt in my mind. Under such conditions it would be difficult indeed to prove for certain that anything clandestine took place.  As to the circumstances of the event occurring on the airport access road i.e. the witness unexplained stalled vehicle near a 727 aircraft.  Over the course of this inquiry, the writer has touched base with various former and retired persons with a background in military intelligence and other electronic 'specialists'.  Speculations vary, but in the opinion of one 'specialist', an electronic system that might cloak or disrupt the outside monitoring of the aircraft systems or communications........""I would not be surprised if such devices exist.  But effecting nearby electronic components?  Likely not"".  He went on to describe the need for this that some military aircraft might have......Air Force One, but such system would have to be discrete, being vital that it NOT affect other systems........further describing sound cancellation devices........additionally, the one successfully used with some Black Hawk helicopters and similar techniques used in our submarines.  It's apparent that the Georgia 'downed aircraft witness' saw something that led to notifying the authorities.  So did the witnesses in Decatur/Morgan County Alabama, both events leading to an official ground search.  Did pieces of Russian Cosmos 2423 or some other satellite or space junk come down in the southeastern USA?  Not according to the USAF Space Command.  Did the southeastern skies experience the 'Green Fireball' phenomenon as have other parts of the USA in the past?  Perhaps.  Was a truly anomalous event, including unknown craft, involved?  Maybe.  The NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia wishes to take this opportunity to appeal to ALL future witnesses........when reporting any unknown aerial event, please do not hesitate to provide full information.

It was about 3 miles in front of me on the south of the highway and appeared to be shaped like an aircraft (minus the wings). I could not understand why an aircraft would be so low and so far from the airport, but figured it could be some strange personal aircraft over a residential area.  As I approached (nearing the State Street exit), multiple vehicles on the highway were braking to look at the strange object.  Once within a ½ mile of the object, I knew it was not an aircraft (at least not a “normal” one). It reminded me of a torpedo: silver and shiny with “fins” on one end, but no noticeable “cockpit” areas. (I think there may have been a very skinny “window like” opening on the bottom.)   After this closer inspection, I thought that it could be ""a skinny blimp"" or ""weather balloon"", but again, there were no noticeable windows NOR an engine or propellers.  Additionally, there were no flashing lights and it held completely stationary in the sky. There was NO MOVEMENT at all despite tree blowing in the breeze. As I passed it perpendicularly on the highway, I studied the space below the craft for a tether, but saw no indication that it was attached to the ground. As I merged onto I-15 (northbound), I looked in my rearview mirror and was still able to see the craft hovering in what appeared to be the same location.

The light didn’t move as expected, instead it just hung in there in the sky so we decided to drive in it's direction. The light seemed to go from very bright to dim and back again. This wasn't the normal 'twinkle' of a star, it was much slower, and the light was not pulsing in a normal interval.  We drove west towards the light. While driving we started thinking that it was Mars, but this thing was too big to be a planet. When we parked, I found a tower with red lights about a mile away to use as a point of reference, and the light we had been tracking was much higher than the top red light of the tower. Over the course of 30 minutes, the white light moved lower and lower (We could not see the light moving, but comparing it to the point of reference, we could tell it had moved). It would get so faint that it would 'disappear' from our sight and then seconds later be back at full brightness. We saw a plane go by and when the plane got near the light, the light completely vanished. About 45 seconds later the light was back. By 12:00am, the light was below the lowest light on the tower (there were 4 lights). It seemed like it was getting further away, flying in a West NorthWest direction. All of the sudden, it was gone.

They were working in an orchard above Okanogan, WA on a sunny, cloudless day around the end of July in 1991 and had just stopped for lunch when they observed a silver object hovering silently in the sky above the hills that border Okanogan city to the east. The witness states the silver object shined brightly in reflected sunlight and appeared to be hovering at a height of between a half a mile and a mile above the ground at a distance of about a mile or so from them.  At that distance, it appeared about a half an inch in diameter to the observers.   He says that the object seemed to shimmer in the sun like a mirage in the desert and that it was spinning on an axis like a coin one might spin on a table top.  Because of this movement, it was difficult to tell if the outline of the object was a disk or triangle.  After 2-3 minutes, the object moved north and then shot straight up very quickly and disappeared from sight. END OF REPORT.

I was outside one night smoking a cigarette and I noticed two orangeish / dark yellow lights, maybe 100-150 yards away, traveling together from left to right through the neighboring woods.  One was slightly higher than the other, but both were relatively close to the ground around 8-10 feet or so, and the shapes were spheres.  From where I was the lights looked like the size to that of a cd.  They had a constant steady rate of speed which I would say was about 5 mph but did not illuminate the trees / wooded area where the lights were.  They were just there and nothing else was lit up in the woods.  I spotted the lights in the woods a couple other nights that week, except they were across the yard in a different locations, or were spread out- it was like the lights were there, and then they were gone.  Each time I saw the lights it lasted about 5-10 seconds and then they were gone.  I did not see any other shapes than that of light spheres.  I thought it was strange, and told my parents.  They did not believe me, but the whole thing was spooky.  A few weeks later it was late at night, around midnight, and I was watching tv.  A very very bright white light the shape of a sphere and about the size of a tennis ball passed by in front of the window and was gone.  This was different from the other lights I saw as they were orangeish, and this was a very bright light and scared the hell out of me.

Lights I’m reporting this incident after looking through your past sightings and realizing that there is one that corresponds with the time and description of a sighting I had as a teenager. I’m fairly certain the year was 1994, I was 14 or 15. It was a summer night and my gut feeling is it was July. I was camping out with approx. 5 friends in a friend’s sheep pasture near his house. I would like to note that we were sober and there were no drugs involved. Two of them had snuck a couple of beers from the house and drank them but were not intoxicated. It was a perfectly clear night out and around midnight or 1am someone noticed the stars were moving. We all looked up and in increasing numbers there were lights zipping through the sky, at what appeared to be a distance outside of our atmosphere, they were small and the size of stars. As in the report I read on your site, our initial reaction was that it was a massive battle in space. The lights changed direction on a dime, curved and moved incredibly fast, changed color as well as disappeared and reappeared. Unlike the report on your site, I remember retaining the impression that this was some sort of battle and remember bursts of light similar to explosions and they were doing what appeared to be dog fighting. Growing up in a rural community I’ve spent many a night watching meteor showers and shooting stars and can vouch that this was neither of these things. The lights slowly disappeared similar to how they had started until it was completely gone. I believe the whole thing lasted 5-10 minutes maybe longer.

At first we thought nothing of it, until after about an hour the lights began to move rapidly to the west for about 20 seconds, and then they went straigt up and disappeared. There were more sightings, and possibly a landing area witnessed by me and my two friends. I don't want to send all details right now because I am a little embarrased as it is.

I was hit so hard with the nausea just the moment I sat down, and I was fine afterwards.

On August 17, 2007, I and another person witnessed something we cannot explain.  We were in Sweetwater (Hammonton), NJ.  The time was about 10:00 PM.  The sky was mostly clear. Being a city dweller, I am intrigued by all the stars that can be seen when in a rural area.  I was on a boat dock, looking approximately NE, at about 70-80 degrees from the horizon.  There was a fairly bright star that was sort of yellow in color.  Slightly below and to the left was a dimmer “star.”  The “star” moved in an erratic manner over a very small area.  Sometimes it would stand still.  Sometimes it would zig-zag and even reverse direction.  Brightness of the light changed as it moved.  All of the stars around it were stationary.  I pointed it out to someone who was with me and they confirmed my sighting.  We watched it for about 5 minutes. I looked around a bit and spotted a second moving light while looking in a south-easterly direction, a little to the right of the glow from Atlantic City, and about 60-70 degrees from the horizon.  This moving “star” was also confirmed by the person with me. I went into the house and brought two other people outside.  They were unable to spot the lights.  We continued to watch the lights for several minutes.  Total time of the sighting was about 15 minutes. After going home, I contacted an amateur astronomer.  He knew of no natural phenomenon that could cause what we saw.  Another person I discussed this with suggested search lights or a laser pointer he saw used in Australia to point out the constellations.  Both search lights and the laser pointers create a visible beam pointing to the sky.  The lights we saw had no ""beams"" leading to or from them.  Also, search lights cause a wide beam and a spot if they hit a cloud.  Air craft cannot move in this manner.  Any idea what we witnessed?",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

My wife was coming to get me in the barn and as we exited she turned around at the door to speak to me. When she looked to her left, which was a westerly direction, she said, ""Boy, that balloon is really low."" When I was finally clear of the barn doors I turned to my right to see this black sphere shape that was crossing the sky. I was trying to determine if it was a balloon as she said but due to the speed and the direction in which it was flying I thought that it can’t be a balloon. The sun was still up and had not yet set as I watched the object move across the horizon. The object maintained its shape and altitude the entire time and did not change from its black color. As I started to turn to the southeast direction I watched the object move.  You could see that the object was shiny as it caught the setting sun. The object crossed over the roof top of my neighbor’s house and then over a group of trees in the field across from our house. This gave me an idea of how high the object was. I would guess that it was between 800 feet to 1000 feet high. As it traveled northwest to southeast the object did not change from this altitude. The distance traveled was very quick.  Once it was over the field, which would have put the object directly in front of our house, it disappeared in the sky.   As my husband and I were walking towards the house I noticed something in the sky above us. I couldn’t tell what it was so I asked him if he saw it, too. Together we watched it cross the sky right above us.  What we saw is best described as a black sphere. It was very visible to us; there was nothing else in the sky. It was clear in our field of view. At the same time we noticed it so did our dog as she began barking. There were no lights – no sound as it traveled – just a black sphere that traveled across the sky. It was flying north to south and at a fast speed. It flew horizontal, it didn’t move up or down in the sky just straight across in a direct path. Then it just disappeared – it didn’t go up into the clouds or disappear into the horizon - it was just gone. We saw it at around 8:45 pm - the sun was just beginning to set. We watched it for several seconds as we discussed what it could be. The height it flew was similar to the height of a low flying aircraft. The actual size of the sphere was hard to judge but it seemed smaller than any aircraft we see flying at that height.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,40.2889,-83.1974

When I first saw the object, which was larger than all the stars, it was about 40 degrees above the horizon.  Within a few seconds I could tell that it was moving eastward, toward the area where my cottage is.  It did not move in a straight line the entire time that it moved eastward; it strayed a little several times from the course that it was on.  It was completely silent, and the intensity of the light, which was radiant, never noticeably varied.  After a minute or two the object was almost directly above my land; and when it was nearly overhead, it did not look far away: it did not look as high in the sky as commercial planes do when at cruising speed.  It seemed to me to be at an altitude of about 15,000 feet.  It looked about five times larger than all the orbiting satellites that I have seen, and I have seen many satellites.   In fact, at no time did it look like it was in outer-space.  (The only planet visible that night at the time when I saw the object was in the southern part of the sky, and it was probably about 30 degrees above the horizon.

And so, in brief here are the details of the event as I heard them from three separate adult females living as neighbors in a small coastal enclave in Guilford, CT. At roughly around midnight on August 18, 2007, a comet-like, highly-luminescent and glowing green object appeared descending in a rapid fashion towards the surface of the ocean.  The object, which traveled in a consistent, linear trajectory was additionally noted to have a bright contrail which seemed to wax in intensity as it neared its duly inevitable impact.   Upon impact I was told there was no discernable noise but a great flash of light that illuminated the entire panorama of the community and ocean.  When the witnesses were questioned about how certain they were of the object’s identity as a comet or a meteor all three seemed to balk.

We didn’t think much about it, just noticed that it was the brightest star. It caught my eye again  and I noticed it was moving directly toward us. I had time to say “should we run“ twice before this light was traveling directly over us.  It  wasn’t extremely bright or large…..It hovered past us at a very decent speed…. I couldn’t see any shape really, but as this white light past and I was looking at what could be called the back of the object/light. I saw red white and blue lights flash repeatedly in a horizontal line. But still no shape. This lasted maybe 20 sec as the object flew into the SW sky. We just stood there...very confused  Within 5-10 min. We saw another white light that appeared in the distant NW sky. This light was flashing red white and blue as well. I think it was the same one… It was moving in short and very fast spurts in all directions/diagonally. When it would move, only the white light was visible. We watched this flashing and moving for about 30-45min.  I then saw two more lights, basically appear close to the first light forming a triangle. These never flashed or moved.  While observing this……I saw something out of the corner of my eye…..I turned my head “WHAT THE HELL?”  Luckily my brother saw this too…It saw a cylinder shaped object ..it was transparent… energy, about 20 feet in the air, with a sphere like “head“.  That’s the only way to describe it..this was the weirdest part of the sighting..  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing …I’m so glad my brother saw the same things….. I don’t think I would be sane today  THEN two more extremely bright lights appeared to the right of the already present 3 light. These light had slight up/down movements.  The light would dim so much it was barely visible, when this happened I saw sphere shaped outlines behind the lights.. my brother did not see these sphere outlines. As the light would get bright again the shape could not be seen…If the one on the right  moved up then the one the left would move down, simultaneously. These were very short and barely noticeable. I cant determine the distance of the two. But they appeared to be closer than the  first 3...we watched this for like 2 hrs.   During this, we saw 4 shooting star. Orange in color…another weird thing is that at the hotel 3 stray cats were all over us. I mean friendly like we had had them for ten years..    very strange...but i loved it!!!!  FYI: Ft. Sill is less than 20 miles from this location",2007-11-28T00:00:00,34.4598,-97.2046

It was contained to about the six inches of the windshield.  It was visible at the upper, center part of the windshield but I could not tell you how far away it was.  I seemed to be close and low.  There were no clouds in the sky and no storms nearby.  It was dark but not extremely dark.  My husband yelled, “What the hell was that?”  I told him it looked like the Star Ship Enterprise taking off at warp speed.  We did not see anymore flashes.  However, I did see three points of light about fifteen minutes later from my porch.  They were extremely high and looked at first glance to be stars or satellites in orbit.  The peculiar feature about them was that they were triangular in form.  The three points of light moved in unison. Possibly, they were military.  I don’t know of anything else that could travel in that manner.  I contacted a local news station to see if anyone else had reported strange lights in the sky, but they basically treated me as if I were a nut.  I don’t watch them anymore.

I walked out closer to the woods and the light remained the same intensity but the object was small so i figured it was a kid.  Ar ound 15 yards away I found it being very odd and I yelled out ""Hey, what are you doing?"" the light object stopped moving and then looked toward me with crisp blue eyes and a bright flash of light occured.

Just after midnight of the morning of September 5, 2007 I saw a bright orange rectangular object in the northeastern sky. At first I thought it was the moon seen through clouds, but the shape was too close to the horizon and in front of the Cascade range to have been the moon. And the shape was so unusual and so ‘unnatural’ that I was totally puzzled. As I watched for about the first 10 minutes, the object moved away back toward the northeast and disappeared.  I left my window for about five minutes but returned out of curiosity to see if the object had returned. As I looked, the object did begin to reappear but this time the shape changed to an actual triangle but retained its bright orange appearance. I decided to go quickly and get my binoculars that were in the car in the garage. I was not sure if the object would be there when I returned.  When I returned, perhaps within 30 seconds, with my binoculars, I was able to focus more clearly on the object. It was definitely a triangle and had moved closer moving toward the southwest. It stopped and stayed in one place and as I watched through the binoculars, three orb or globe-shaped spheres, all smaller in size than the object itself and seemingly ‘colorless’, emerged and moved around the object. Two of the orbs floated at the base of this triangle of light. The third remained somewhat stationary.  The now four objects remained in place for about 15 minutes and then seemed to drift back toward the northeast and finally disappeared altogether. I called our local police to see if anyone else had seen or reported what I had seen, but the police said that no other calls had been reported.

It had a total of eight lights all together.  It rose above the tree line, turned, and dove back down.  It reminded me of a breaching whale. What struck me as strangest was that there was absolutely no sound.  For as large as it was I thought there should have been some noise from the engines.  I immediately turned to the person I was talking to to ask them if they had seen it, and he was still looking in the direction of the object.   I stayed and we talked about what we had seen for about a half an hour before continuing on with patrol.  I headed up the hill and decided to check out a construction site that was in the woods where they were building a new energy monitoring station, to see if there was anything to account for what we had seen.  When I arrived the first thing my partner and I noticed was that the huge stadium lights that were always on were out.

It was a single object that took about 20 seconds to disappear into the sky.  My first inclination was that it was a balloon, but following it fairly high in the sky I was positive that it was not.  I would guess the elevation to be 10,000 feet or below.  It did not leave a con-trail and did not resemble anything that I had seen before in my 46 years of life.  The path was not an ordinary North - South commercial jet flight path.

I could not find information on this website about this , and was hoping to confirm what I had observed the two previous evenings. Outiside At approximately 8:40pm on Sunday 9/16  after sunset I was observing the evening sky saw two small (blueish)dimly lit round objects travelling from North to South over the Kannapolis area. They appeared larger than a star or satellite, but (reflective ?)brightness of about half of the surrounding average stars. They appeared to be very high elevation, and faster than any  manned aircraft I have ever observed. Speed estimate would be slower than a meteor, and much faster than a satellite when viewed from Earth and moving about 5 degrees apart at exact speed and direction, one following the other. They crossed the sky  about 25 degrees above the North horizon to about 25-30 degrees from reaching the Southern Horizon and duration of abount 15-20 seconds. Curiously enough, I was again outside at  aproximately 8:40 pm on Monday 9/17. I did not see the same objects, instead only a single. Appearing larger, (about 3/4 thumbnail at arm length) and a triangular in exact symmetry. Coloration was dim, but reddish hue possibly from reflection ,against the early twilight blue. This object appeared to follow the exact previous North to South path , but may have been considerably larger or lower in Altitude. The triangular object speed was nearly 2-3 times faster than the previous, with the duration of about 7-10 seconds to cross the sky. Neither obsevations included atmoshereic disturbances, contrails, or sound activity. Elevation, I believe was low orbit, maybe several miles above commercial aircraft. I tried but did not observe anything other than normal aircraft/satellite activity on 9/18 from 8:35 pm until 9:00 pm. Probably the object you saw was a few minutes earlier than what I was prepared for. I would really be interested in seeing an image on the website, or maybe a link to it if possible.

The exact date is unknown now but documentary evidence from the event indicates it was definitely between mid September and mid October 1991. We were sitting in my car looking at the water at the Port of Olympia, Washington. Time was late evening, with clear sky transitioning from dusk to night. Exact location was parked at the KGY radio station tower at Port of Oly facing north looking over the water of Budd Inlet, with West Oly to the left, East Bay Drive and Priest Point Park to the right.  There was a very bright star (or so it seemed) shining singularly in the sky out over the water directly in front of us, but looking quite far away, as all stars normally do ( ! ). We must have sat looking at it for a good half hour while talking about life and random things.  Quite suddenly this star 'expanded' for lack of any other way to describe it, exactly the way that a Hoberman Sphere does (I found out many years later what a Hoberman Sphere is, and just about crapped myself the first time I saw one in motion its movement looked so similar), but with no visible structure, just one point of light expanding into numerous points of light, perhaps 20 or more, moving quite fast into a giant and perfectly spherical formation of several star-like lights. The formation resembled a grid over a globe with a light at each connecting point between latitude and longitude, but again, no visible structure, just lights in this formation.  This assemblage proceeded to rotate there, HUGE, the lights traveling around the far side of the formation visible through the front side lights moving the opposite direction, in the air for several seconds while we stared slack-jawed in disbelief. I sat silent and stared while she repeated like a mantra ""this is not happening"".  As suddenly as it had initially expanded (and after rotating there in the air for a very long moment) it collapsed in an instant into what appeared to be a single star again, the same as we had stared at while talking all that time before.  Just when we were wiping our brows and ""WTF!!!""-ing over what we had just seen, it slowly began turning red and pulsating. Then it divided. The star (as it were) remained stationary there and began ejecting duplicates of itself (for lack of better description), 5 of them if I recall, appearing one at a time from the stationary light, same color red, all pulsing in time with one another, traveling at an even distance from one another at a constant and relatively slow rate across the sky away from their starting position, heading east / southeast. As soon as they were evenly spaced and enroute the original ""star"" took up a trailing position in the single file formation and they all flew off slowly over us and eventually the treeline and out of sight.  All of this, start to finish took maybe 2 or 3 minutes. The whole thing happened in complete silence, whatever it/they were made no sound at all, which hit us when, as they were flying away, we noticed a small general aviation airplane flying a different direction but at a much higher altitude. We could just make out the distant drone of the prop engine from the airplane but could hear nothing from the light formation traveling visibly well closer to us. This was when it also dawned on us how much closer the whole event had to have happened to us than it looked to the eye at first.  We were praying that pilot would see these things and perhaps react in some way we could take as confirmation he saw it, but no, they were below and behind him and heading away from his position. He flew right on wherever he was going, apparently unaware.  Optical illusion? Sober group hallucination? Swamp Gas? In all the years since, I never have figured out what the hell that thing was, and I would be shocked if I ever did. It / they moved with obvious coordination which implies some kind of intelligence / control, it was like nothing I've ever seen before or since, I am (after seeing it) hard pressed to believe it to be anything of ""known"" terrestrial technology, I have resigned to the likelihood that I will never know what it was at all. I would have written my own self off as nuts the very evening I saw it (I was never really a ufo 'believer') if not that my girlfriend had sat right there beside me and witnessed the whole thing too.  I went back over a partial video shot of the event (yes believe it or not I had a video camera in the car but the battery had been dead and was only holding a residual charge from sitting around, it was enough to power the camera about ten seconds), the video is completely useless because it was getting dark (everything was plainly visible to the naked eye, but with this cutting edge late '80s video camera, all one can really make out is a blank screen with a few strange flickering whitish dots on it that seem to come and go. The only anecdotal content of any value is the audio track of my girlfriend and myself freaking out (apparently I wasn't silent the whole time!), ((allusion to profanity deleted)) etc in the few seconds. Unfortunately I didn't have the wherewithal to hit the ""show date/time"" function in those few seconds. The best I can do is note that the unrelated video clip shot immediately before it was on September 17th, 1991. This event was probably within the next few nights or up to a couple/few weeks (?) after that, I have no way to know for sure now.

I got off the schoolbus and started walking down my street toward home.  It was a clear afternoon, and I noticed an aircraft flying at a high altitude. It made barely any noise, but the sun was glinting off of it so it attracted my attention. It looked like an ordinary passenger jet, except that maybe the wings were a bit longer and thinner than I would have expected, but not by much. I watched the aircraft as I was walking down the street.  Eventually I noticed a bright light, which changed in intensity a bit, but did not appear to have any noticeable shape.  It approached the aircraft at slight angle, coming up from behind it on what looked like an intercepting at a greater but steady velocity. After about a minute, a small contrail curled off the opposite side of the aircraft, and travelling much faster than the craft itself, curled around the front of the aircraft and headeded toward the light.  When the small contrail had quickly closed half the distance to the light, the light instantaneously changed speed and direction to a course five times as fast as it had been moving and almost 90 in a different direction.  It disappeared from view within a second or two without approaching the horizon.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first, I didn't pay it much attention since aircraft are a common sight around a military base, but then it started doing some wierd flying maneuvers like skipping forward quickly,stop, coast backwards, then up in an arc, then straight down, stop, then the object began ""dancing"" like swaying to the left and right while going forward.  Then it shot up in the air, slowly descended, then it went straight across the sky, it shot down in an arc behind the hills, then re-appeared even closer to me (about a quarter km), which freaked me out a little, and it was at this point that I realised it was a disk shaped object, with really bright lights on the bottom, the center appeared to be red-orange, but at times almost dark pink? In the night sky it appeared to be gray-purple color, but that could have been reflections since the sky was a similar color..the object moved across the sky behind me, made no noise at all, and I lost sight of it due to the trees behind me but I could still see the lights through the trees.  It was then I noticed how close it came to my position when I could see about 150 yards in the direction of the object the light flickering down illuminating the ground. I felt a strange ""charge"" in the air, like in a lightning storm, and my hair on my arms and neck were stood up..the next thing I knew I couldn't see it anymore, and I turned to my right to see if the object was going to emerge on the other side of the trees, and it didn't emerge where and when I thought it would, but when I glanced over my right shoulder there it was hovering in the air about 300 yards or more away and it took off like a shooting star (left a light trail or blur) upwards and I got such a fright I had to sit down and have a cigarette. I  had this feeling it was watching me for that second, but I am not sure if it was the same object or another object that I never noticed since my attention was on the first object.  This was my 3rd strange sighting at Gagetown while I was a Reservist but the only time I actually saw anything up close.

At that time we knew nothing of the stealth bomber or the stealth fighter. But these craft made no noise. The looked like triangle. No visable formation lights or any kind of markings that would make them any kind of united states air craft.I herd some of the brige crew in the mess hall make the same kind of statements on seeing the craft.

They appeared to be no bigger than the millions of stars that already light up our sky each clear night. The odd thing was they were moving around....like a group of fireflys way up in the sky...dozens of them. Now they werent moving across the entire sky...they basically stayed in the same area of the sky.   I watched the rest of the trip home and finally got my brothers attention when we got out at home to look up and see for himself.  Not only were there several little balls of light flying around...they seemed to be centered around another light...only this one was much bigger...and it seemed to be pulsating every cpl seconds.  Now the larger, pulsating light didnt move..it appeared to be stationary in the sky...but the smaller ones were litteraly zipping around like a cloud of gnats.  We continued to watch and came to the meger conclusion that it had to be some sort of UFO/S.  And just like that...there was nothing...if you'd blinked you'd missed it...the lights were gone.  I know how this must sound but after talking about it for awhile with my brother we kinda thought it looked like there was some sort of 'mothership'...the pulsating larger light....and that the smaller ones were just that...smaller ships doing some kind of manuevers..lol, i know how that must sound..and i did watch star trek every night growing up...but i thought it might help u to understand exactly what i was looking at.

I respect the fact there are people like you to tell these stories to...and i hope that with every 1000s bullshitters out there...there may be one crediblem, actual, eye witness of a UFO. what i am wondering is if you've ever heard any accounts like the one i just told you about before?

Have you ever heard of anything quite like this before? Thank you so very much for your time...im sure you spent a few minutes trying to read through my absolute terrible grammer and sentence writing skills...Have a good one!!

This was actually my second sighting, but have just recently decided to post it after reading another accounter that sounded a lot a like. There was a difference in color but the observer is from Midland, which is fairly close to my location.  My first sighting was driving home from a friends' house around 1am and had pulled off a dirt road onto a paved road. Right away I noticed something in the upper left corner of my front window. I assumed it was a bat or hawk due to it's rotating motions. A minute or so down the road I was wondering why it would stay with me and at the same spot. I then noticed when the trees along side of the road came it would disapear from view and then come back into view when trees weren't there. I dimmed my lights thinking I had something lose or broken in them, it was still there. I was now almost half a mile from my house and had slowed down to 20mph watching the object. At this point I was scared, I almost missed turning into my drive way and when I did I pulled right next to the front door to my house. I gathered my house keys and opened my car door quickly. When I closed my car door I looked behind me (Dirrect East) and saw it was a white, oval shape and always moved in a large circle. The color was about the same as the stars, maybe a bit brighter, only white that I could see. This was the first time I could clearly see it and not doubt myself on what it was. I ran to my door, put in my key, went into my bed room and sat on the bed. I had never experienced anything like it before, so I was very scared. I kept thinking I am your friend I won't hurt you, I wanted them to know I would befriend them or something. I did feel a numbish comforting feeling, though I layed awake for 2 hours before falling to sleep.  My second sighting I was driving home from my girlfriends house, at least a week or more had went by. I had been looking for it every night, but had no luck. This night I thought was the same, I pulled in my usual parking spot further from my front door. When I got out of my car I looked up and there it was! I ran to the house door, but curiousity compeled me to watch it. I stayed there, watching it for about an hour before I was shivering. I then hurried in my house, grabbed a coat and came back out, it was still in the same place. It would always move in circles, maybe this was how it stayed in flight. I would say every 2 or 3 seconds it would revovle. I gained courage to walk out back to my car, then to the back door to my house. It moved a bit as if following me. I then walked to garage, barn, camper, and start of field which it always would follow me. I looked back towards my house and saw a light, so someone else was up. I walked back up to the house thinking now that it would not go away if I went back inside. My grand father was awake and I had him come out in his underware just to see it. He was in the seventh army anti-aircraft and had a better perception of it's distance then I. He said it appeared to very high up, which I had thought it was lower and very small. Being high up made more logic and I realized that it was probably a more reasonable explaination. He went inside after about 20 minutes and I followed. I told him I wanted to walk out into the field and see how far it would follow me. He told me to be safe and take his truck, so I did. I drove around our hay fields for a few laps at low speed watching it follow me. It always stayed on the east side of me. I felt like I should go to our back field down a two trail through the woods, but I think I was too scared. I ended up comming back to the house and parking the truck. I then watched it until 5:30am or so when I felt the need to sleep. I went to my door and waved good bye, hoping I would see it again another night. While I got ready ! to go to bed, I looked out the window several times until about 6am and it was still outside. I hope to see the object again, which I believe is a UFO. To add, both nights were very clear skys though I cannot recall seeing the moon. From my house door the object looked to be telephone pole hight, maybe a bit higher, but was very small about size of hand. I would guess it was very high, but I don't know if you could calculate angles some how to find out. If you need more inforation please let me know. The sighting has really made me rethink life and realize that the unbelievable could really be true. I hope that people can take the time to read my incounter and believe in it. I now have a video camera ready and waiting so if I am lucky and this ""UFO"" allows me to I will hopefully be able to record it. Unforunitly I can't afford to stay awake every night to look for it, but I try to look out the window whenever I can or look in the sky when I drive home.

This observation was made sitting in a Boeing 757 (Continental Airlines), flying from Newark, NJ, to Stockholm, Sweden. Our altitude was 35,000 ft. Around 3:30 (UTC) I observed a bright light at 10 o'clock. The light was at a somewhat higher altitude and was seemingly sitting still in the sky. First I thought it was another airplane heading toward us with its lights on. I then noticed that the brightness of the light was slowly fluctuating and also changing colors from white (clear)-red-blue-green-white. No flashing lights (like on an airplane) were observed and no shape of the object. I took a digital picture of the light. Since it was dark outside the exposure time was long, so the camera moved while I was taking the picture. This caused the light to ""draw"" an irregular line on the picture, which makes it possible to see on the picture that the brightness and colors of the object were shifting continuosly. Less than one minute after I took the picture our plane started to climb up to 39,000 ft and changing the course more to the right (away from the object). This made the object ""move"" to a position at 9 o'clock, where it stayed for a minute or two. Then it started to move slowly to the right until it disappeared in front of our plane. Still at i higher altitude. It was impossible to see how far away from the plane this object was, but I am sure it was a few miles. This happened almost exactly two hours before landing at Stockholm Airport (7:30 local time) and the position was due west of the Farøe Islands, which I saw from the airplane approx. 30 minutes after the observation.

My two sons and I plus our neighbor's son (7,5,6, respectively) planned to watch the sky for meteors on that Saturday night.  We live in Fall City, a small rural community about 25 miles east of Seattle in the Cascade foothills.   We set up a tent, got our sleeping bags, pads, snacks, etc., and waited for dark - we had planned this for the previous week or so.  The moon is dark and sky was beautifully clear.  We were having a great time - saw 2 satellites and at least two shooting stars.   At about 9:40 p.m., my 7 year old declared that he was tired and went into the house.  About 5 minutes later, my 5 year old yelled look at that light (not star.)  The neighbor boy and I looked to the Northeast and saw a large, intense, white light moving from NW to SE.  The light was far brighter than any stars in the sky and was moving at a very deliberate pace - it took the light about 10-15 seconds to cross about 2/3's of our field of vision i.e. from the time we saw it until it went behind some adjacent trees.  I could not tell how high it was, but it appeared to be quite high up.  There was no sound whatever and we live in a very quiet area.  At first I thought ""airplane.""  But as I observed it, I came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane, certainly not any airplane I had ever seen before.   The light looked round and about the size of a BB if you hold it at arm's length.  It was a very clear, very steady white/blue color.  It did not blink, flicker, or attenuate in any way.  I was very impressed with the ""steadiness"" of the light.   It moved, as I noted above, very deliberately. That is the only way I can think to describe it.  The speed didn't appear to vary and it didn't appear to turn or change course in any way.  I know this must sound like a terrestrial aircraft of some sort, but I don't believe it was.   It was like a very large star moving through the sky, very bright, very intense, very very impressive.  It was not a meteor, at least not like one I've ever seen before.    I am a geologi! st and have spent a great deal of time in remote areas and have observed the night sky constantly.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I do not drink or take drugs, ever.

I see planes cross the night sky every night.  I am used to spotting commercial planes going to San Jose Airport and Military Planes going to the base coming inland off the coast as I watch the stars nightly.  Last night right before midnight I had an urge to get up and went outside to peak at the moon, which was either full or very close.  Clouds covered the moon partially. The rest of the sky was clear. It was a beautiful small cloud formation.  Others must have seen this. Although you had to be paying close attention.  I suddenly saw an object. It was glowing, but had no lights.  It glowed evenly around the craft with a slight green hue. It was more like seeing a giant shadow.  It was large, massive, sort of rectangle but it had an angle that slimmed to the nose.  It made no noise but the shear size of the object caused my heart to skip and me to involuntarily verbally blurt ""Holly SHi%T!""  I waited to see the shadow appear from under the clouds where I would really see it as it was not that high in the sky, maybe 2000 feet.  I was a bit scared in honesty.  It was so big and silent.  It quickly came out of the clouds and what I saw was a huge glowing semi rectangular object move quickly across the sky.  I could clearly see its underbelly.  It was being followed by a large plane.  It was not a civilian plane but it could not keep up with the craft.  It certainly got a better view than I did.  The underbelly had no visible markings, very stealthy. The size really shook me.  It was like half the size of the giant craft in Independence Day, minus the lights etc.  It was just a smooth surface glowing with a very defined shape.  I would have to draw it. The sound of the sound barrier breaking thundered when the UFO left. This could of been the plane pursuing it as it was escalating in speed.  The UFO was just there and passed out of view from the building as did the plane as the sound went off. The craft was gone very quickly but I know what I saw.  If it was not a UFO unless the military has some very fast, dark,  glowing planes of strange dimension they are testing. The UFO seemed as if it was gliding effortlessly and with no sound.  I could hear the plane as it came closer. I must admit it looked just very much like the only other UFO I have ever seen with my own eyes and with my mother very close up around 1973.  I can find the exact date as we had a family death later that night. I was young.  It was within miles of here. 20 other people saw it as the paper wrote it up the next day. It glowed the same way and was shaped the same.  But in 73 it hovered right above the trees so close my mom drove off the road and we just stared and said nothing until it just disappeared. This craft looked the same but was moving where the one in 73 scared us both simply due to its size and left so fast, we did not see it move.  I never forgot that night and the strange dark huge glowing object, only to see it again nearly 37 years later.  It was just as ominously as the first encounter. I had no time to grab my camera.

Facing the southern sky at 5:40 a.m. The cloud cover was low I looked up and saw three lights forming a giant triangle.Hovering over the pasture. I then noticed four very tiny crafts also triangle shaped that seemed to be hovering along side of the huge one. Moving ever so slowly, I then looked even deeper straight up into the sky and shockingly realized there was an enormous grayish triangle that actualy covered almost the whole sky above me. I could barely see the outskirts of the sky itself! I watched in awe for hours as it moved ever so slowly.Then it went straight up so fast and out of sight. This is the first time I have seen this craft. I have wittnesed many other alien actions in this pasture with my son since November 2004! I can't describe in words these events. They usually always occur in November. This is the first time we have ever encountered anything of this magnitude.On other occasions, I have witnessed smaller alien vehicles that were landed in the pasture, which resembled only what I can describe as a ""tent"" with a glowing lantern inside. The actual beings I have seen range from 12'tall and skinny, to short at 3'. All with their own ""jobs"" to do in their alien race. I've seen them digging in the field with what appeared to be an object resembling a shovel.Some forming an assembly line passing something down the line and loading onto this tent with the glowing light. Watching with binoculars ( which they get disturbed by ) if you watch too long! In one instance as I had been peering to intently, the tall one swiftly turned his head looking at me right back through my binoculars causing them to break inside, now looking through them everything I see is double! I have seen craft's that look like a birthday cake with colors of blue, red, yellow and green. One actualy lifting off the top of the other and seperating in opposite directions.There are many other instances we have enthusiasticlly waited hoping to see them again.This is also the first instance in which they have appeared during or close to a full moon. Another symbolism is that it always gets real cold like a bone cold when they are near. I have no doubt at all that they know we are watching them! They know we are there!Since Nov. 2004 many occurances have taken place which is totally mind boggling. My son is the person that brought this to my attention and at first I must say I was a little to aloof about the whole idea of such! My mind was completely changed after the first sighting. We think these are the aliens better known as ( The Grays. ) After all they are gray and do not seem to be aggressive. So many other odd instances too many to write on this paper! So I will stop noe.

The object was viewed with the naked eye and only a hyper-blue white was eminating from the underside of the object. When viewed through 8x21 binoculars the object appeared to have red and white lights at each of the 3 corners in addition to the hyper-blue type light coming from the underside. The blue light would get brighter and dimmer but the red and white lights remained constant.  The object hovered for at least the 30 minutes that it was viewed with very little movement. When fixing a position and then viewing the oject in comparison to the fixed point the object remained at approximately the same location with very little movement. In checking online there were reports made in March 2008 with the Pasco County Sheriffs office by others but seemed to be explained away as an aircraft. What was seen in the sky by myself and one other observer on 04-20-08 was not any type of craft ever seen in our lives.,2008-06-12T00:00:00,28.301835570469798,-82.70539194630872

I was driving home from work at approximately 9:30pm.  I was approaching a traffic light when something in the sky caught my attention.  I figured it was a plane but it was moving horizontally across the sky at a fast pace.  It was definately on fire and there was a smoke trail behind it.  I was concerned that it might have been a small plane that was on fire but then I realized it didn't make sense because it wasn't falling it was moving in a straight line across the sky.  It was hard for me to follow it because I was driving and I didn't want to cause an accident.  Nobody else on the road seemed to pay much attention to it.  Eventually it became obscured by some trees and I could not see it anymore. I did not hear any sound associated with whatever it was.  It never occured to me that it could have been a UFO until I stumbled across this site.  I had wanted to read more about the UFO sighting at O'Hare airport.  I am still not sure if what I saw was anything other than a shooting star or a comet.   I don't think it was a shooting star because this was at least the size of a golf ball maybe a little larger.  But I guess it could have been a comet?  I have never seen an actual comet before (except in pictures) so I have nothing to compare it to. I really wish that I had been able to watch whatever it was more closely but hindsite is 20/20 I guess. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They stayed around for at least 30 minutes, slowly making their way out of site behind clouds and mountains, only to appear again about an hour later.

I turned to look at what it was (figuring it was late fireworks)and saw a BRIGHT blue orb-like thing that was a bit larger than a basketball. It was just hovering about 5 feet outside my window (Im on the 2nd floor of my apartment building and all thats outside that window is about 15 ft of air and then a green strip of trees). It was blue with a small glowing white center and a light, I guess, foglike white around the outside of the blue section. After starring at this maybe 10-15 seconds the thing exploded. It was like watching pictures we have of a supernova explosion. It turned completely white and exploded in this blinding shiny white and was probably the size of a kitchen table at its largest as it exploded. And the really weird part is while it was exploding it let off the loudest sound I have ever heard. It wasnt a rumbling like thunder, it was like a pop and a snap that seems to resonate throughout the apartment. I have never heard a sound like this. I felt like I could feel the waves and it shook my floor slightly. I mean my ears were ringing it was so loud. And then it was gone. Not a trace. After sitting there just flabbergasted for about 1 min I went to the window and looked out and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I know I wasnt dreaming or hallucinating because my cats were looking at the orb when I was and both ran across the room and hid when it exploded and the sound came out. I dont know what it was- but I think its safe I can say it wasnt of this world. I never saw or heard anything like that.

My girlfriend and I were traveling on US Rt. 50 heading east from Parkersburg to Clarksburg.  We were passing through (around) Salem when I noticed a large triangular-shaped object in the sky just above the horizon.  At first I thought it was an oil-rig on top of the ridge (a common sighting in WV), or a cell phone tower, but I had made that particular drive hundreds of times and felt as if something was unusual, so I dismissed both of those notions.  I woke my girlfriend and asked her if she recognized the object in front of us; she didn't.  The object was vertical, at first, with bright red lights in each corner.  Immediately after waking my girlfriend an extremely bright white light came on in the middle of the object, seemed to make a sweeping motion, and eventually ""highlighted"" us for a brief period of time.  This made both of us nervous, but not particularly scared.  I had to look down at the road and when I looked back up it was floating horizontally above us.  When I looked down at the road again and back up it had disappeared.  The object never seemed to move while I was looking at it, nor did it make any sounds.  I originally thought it was a helicopter but dimissed the notion when I realized it had to have been within 100ft. of us and not making any sound whatsoever.  Both my girlfriend and I were fascinated with the unusual sighting and had thought about calling the regional airport in Clarksburg to see if there were any aircraft in the area at the time.  We never did and never really talked about it the remainder of the time we dated.  I probably wouldn't have really thought about it much more until I watched a UFO special on TV sometime in 2001.  They were discussing a case and had an artist's rendering and animation of the exact same object that I had seen.  Since then I've told the story to some people, always siting what I saw on the television special. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The rest of the crafts still hovered over head performing amazing maneuvers seeming as if to defy gravity with there smooth twists and turns- and then they shot up and disappeared.

Thinking he might not be able to wait until 6.40 when I normally get up, begrudgingly I got up and went down stairs with him in the pitch black, my own dog following us.  I didn’t put any lights on in the kitchen and went to open the glass door, just as I did  I saw 2 objects totally still, next to each other in mid air in my garden. They were head-height and probably only 3 metres away. I looked around in the kitchen to make sure no lights were reflecting, but it was totally dark. I wasn’t scared at this time but opened the door and stood in the doorway. I probably saw the objects for a total of about 4 or 5 seconds. It seemed like a long time because I was trying to remember everything about them and was checking with myself that I wasn’t dreaming. I remember thinking at the time that they looked like really big corks but were more angular than corks and rectangle (around about credit card size perhaps but a bit slimmer). They didn’t look like ‘lights’ although they were bright againsed the pitch black sky. They were kind of cream in colour and didn’t particularly look ‘other worldly’, more like new tiny remote control type gadgets or something. They didn’t make any sound.  I had my face just outside the door for a second then they both kind of sped off to the left at exactly the same time. At this point I think I suddenly got really scared and couldn’t even move my head or go out to follow them, which now I am annoyed about. Incidentally the dogs didn’t rush up to the objects when I opened the door, they just went out to pee  and then came back in. I stood there for  some seconds and then came back in as I was freezing.

An official air-miss report on the incident several weeks ago appears in Pilot magazine. Aurigny Airlines captain Ray Bowyer, 50, flying close to Alderney first spotted the object, described as ""a cigar-shaped brilliant white light"". As the plane got closer the captain viewed it through binoculars and said: ""It was a very sharp, thin yellow object with a green area. ""It was 2,000ft up and stationary. I thought it was about 10 miles away, although I later realised it was approximately 40 miles from us. At first, I thought it was the size of a [Boeing] 737. ""But it must have been much bigger because of how far away it was. It could have been as much as a mile wide."" Continuing his approach to Guernsey, Bowyer then spied a ""second identical object further to the west"". He said: ""It was exactly the same but looked smaller because it was further away. It was closer to Guernsey. I can't explain it. This was clearly visual for about nine minutes. ""I'm certainly not saying that it was something of another world. All I'm saying is that I have never seen anything like it before in all my years of flying."" The sightings were confirmed by passengers Kate and John Russell. John, 74, said: ""I saw an orange light. It was like an elongated oval."" The sightings were also confirmed by an unnamed pilot with the Blue Islands airline. The Civil Aviation Authority safety notice states that a Tri-Lander aircraft flying close to Alderney spotted the object. ""Certain parts of the report have not been published. I cannot say why,"" said a senior CAA source. Earlier this year, however, the MOD declared its intentions to open its UFO files to the public.

I think it was following the balloon like it was studying it. I took a picture of the cloud it hit. Like as if maybe there a vortex to bring the light back to the dimmension it came from.

It almost looked stationary but after watching it for a minute or so I realized it was coming closer as it appeared to be raising higher on the horizon. This apparent movement is what really held my interest. As I wathched this light coming closer it suddenly and very rapidly moved to the right (northwest?). This movement covered a significant portion of the horizon but from my vantage point I was still basically facing west. After this apparent 90 degree turn and movement the light just sat stationary on the horizon. From this point the object did another 90 appearing to move straight down. This put it behind the tree tops on my horizon. It then seemed to bob around for a minute or so before making another sharp fast movement directly up. This once again put the light above the tree tops. Again this thing bobbed around for a few moments before its last big move. This final movement started from a close to stationary point above the treetops on the horizon , it steadily moved to the right again ,this time at about a 40 degree angle downward until it disappeared behind the trees then the horizon. The light did bob up behing those trees a few more times but never made another clear appearance. I checked my watch during this last sequence behind the trees,it read 2244hrs. I estimate this entire viewing lasted 4 or 5 minutes. I was not drinking , I do not do drugs , and I am on no major prescription drugs.

It is hard to say how far away it was, but a guess would be around 5-10 miles.  Thinking it was an airplane I thought it was odd that I didn't see any blinking nav lights on it, so I countinued to watch it.  After around 3-5 seconds of watching it began to change trajectory and began going up at what must have been a high rate of speed.  The light went through a color progression changing from the white light to white/orange,orange,orange/red, red then disappeared.  The upward movement traveled of a span of around 2.5-3"" of sky.  I stayed outside for several minutes afterward waiting to see if more lights appeared or this one returned and saw nothing.

She noticed a large, very bright, white light in the sky and told me to look at it, wondering if it was a star.  This was in the western night sky.  I immediately said that was something unusual.  We positioned ourselves to face the light directly and watched it for nearly an hour.  We originally thought it might be a star, but it was too large and bright.  I told her that it made me nervous.  Was it a helicopter?  Or, a plane?  It was motionless for so long, that it could be neither.  Maybe it was a blimp, but a blimp wouldn't be out at this time of night and doesn't have a light coming out of the front of it.  It was obvious that a craft of some sort was behind the light.  We called our father, who was at his house nearly a mile west of us.  He and our step-mother went into the driveway and looked at the light.  He said he believed that it was Jupiter - that the planet was low in the western sky now.  We continued to watch the light and nearly 20 minutes later, it began moving in a northwesterly direction.  Our niece came out during this time and watched it with us.  Our brother came by and said it had to have been a hot air balloon flying at night.  This was not possible because the light was too large and the craft was behind the light, as opposed to above it. Also, the light wasn't a flame.  The light began slowly moving and became smaller as it headed northwest.  Within another 2o to 30 minutes, it was gone below the trees.  It was so unusual, though, because it hovered in one place (we wondered if it was over the Golden Dome of Notre Dame, as it looked like it was above the campus).  There is no way it could have been a star because of the way it moved and because of the direction it took.  All the other stars in the sky, which were obviously so much farther away, didn't visibly move in the sky like this light did.  It was different from the movement of the moon, as the path and speed of movement were very inconsistent.  When we looked at the light at first, it looked like a giant 5-point star.  There is a street light that shines in the trees near where we saw the light.  What we saw was much  bigger than the size of the street light.  We called a local television station and asked if anyone had called in this sighting. He told me that we were the first.

She rolled down her window and stuck her head out. She said it she could see a clear triangle shaped object flying North with a bright white light on each corner. I say it was moving slowly, but she says it wasn't moving that slow. Still, it was not as fast as a conventional plane. She also says the two lights appeared to join together into single object and formed the triangle. However, I believe that was just an illusion caused by the angle we were diving at it.  We kept looking back as we drove away and it was still there moving away. It did not make any sudden or quick moves when we were watching it.

I was looking from a 6th story balcony from  the marriott ocean club in kaanapali, maui, and I was looking at this one colorful star ( it had red around the white dim lite and a greenish coming from the sides )  at the very top of the one mt.and the object  that i thought was a brite star or planet maybe -  started to move,it headed  down the mt. parallel to the mt.  where there are no roads, it came straight down slowly and then stopped and emitted a bright white lite ( not like a lite house - it wasnt a beam and didnt lite up an area around it that  I could see around it- as i was maybe a few miles (1-2) at most away from the base of the mountain)  but the lite was so big it glowed  a brite lite with a red fringe on it and green like sticks coming out of the sides in lites and then the bight lite went out and then it did the same thing three or four times in one spot as it stayed in one spot as it did that ( that was quite a time to be in one place for a plane or helicopter and the lite was really bright from such a distance and quite large for that distnace but the lite came from the middle of the object and didnt move around or anything it just glowed , but i could look at it but turned away to make sure of what i was seeing as i looked back at it  went out and then on again more than once , then it moved further straight down the mt. not glowing anymore but still you could see the main colors of it- it stopped and i wasnt sure where it was on the mt exactly but in the morning i could see it was most likely just above or around the high tension wires that are along the side of the mt. sideways . there arent any houses there and no road that leads up the mt. and there is a golf course below  the high tension wires but i dont k! now how far away the object was from the wires or the golf course . so it had to be somewhere abover the golf course and above where the wires are. It was dark on the mt but gets more lit up closer to the golf course and there is some constuction of a new marriott to the left side of the golf course but at 8pm it is highly unlikely anyone was working from 8pm on that nite. I did see some cars coming along a road up there near the construction but again dont know the distance from where i saw the object finally stop and the golf course or the road the cars were on. I DO know that from where the object started from on top of the mt there are no roads that lead down from the top of the mt. where this object came from . I found it amazing no one would notice such a bright lite coming off the mt. so high up and i was amazed that it was so bright when it was glowing on and off but it was high up the mt at that time but it was not a helicopter as they dont have such big lites on them and I wouldnt  think they fly after 8pm that high on the mt in the dark  and what ever it was certainly didnt move like a plane or helicopter. This object stopped in one place for quite a while maybe five minutes as it gave out the glowing  bright lite on and then went black and then on again and then off a few times. what would do that ?? i have no explanation of what it was , but what looked like a star at first way at the top of the mt. or  above the mt. moved straight down and then  what stops and glows on and off and then moves down and stops by high tension wires????. well,at that point  we had been up watching this for about an hour and when it finally just stopped and stayed in one spot somewhere above those high tension wires i watched as i had gone into my bed  with the shades of the balcony pulled all the way open so we could see it from our beds , my aunt was with me the whole time and we fell asleep staring at it as it just stayed in that last place for twenty minutes or more . a ufo ? i am not one to speculate and took all ki! nds of p erspectives of the mt the next morning and there is no road from the top of the mt. where it started from to where it first stopped and although they  are building houses much further down the mt near the others ,this object did not go to the point of where the lites were so we could see it better . I know it was something unusual and was told by the maui news who i called the next day (to find out if anyone else saw this) that on and off people do call aobut lites in Maui. Maui is a vortex by the way. I was also told by someone at the observatories that expeditions on foot have been made up the west maui mts and they found a pyramid of what they think is of alien origin some where up there - the mts are about 7000 ft high i think -?? does anyone know about that pyramid they found or was that a secret ???? I am not a person who imagines things or makes more out of something than what it is but this was not anything like I have ever seen before and I  kept trying to find something that it could be other than an unidentified flying object.

While a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a friend, we were driving on a country road in a wooded area after dark.  We first saw a stationary orange rectangle on a ridge line about a quarter mile away.  As we drove along the base of the ridge about 20 seconds later we noticed an orange reflection in the windshield, and at that point I rolled down the window and stuck my head out the door to look straight up.  What  I saw at that point was a pair of rectangular orange panels moving in sync directly above our vehicle, just above the treetops, mirroring our path along the winding road.  This conitnued for about two miles.  The objects made no noise, and there was no wash of air hitting us from above.  I believe the panels were part of one object, located at the rear of it.  I kept my eyes fixed on it the entire time and when we came to a stop sign I jumped out of the vehicle and it shot straight away from us, slightly gaining altitude, but made no noise.  It did not disappear over a horizon line, but disappeared from view in the distance in less than two seconds.  I estimate each orange rectangle to have been about 15 by 20 feet and about 20 feet apart, with the outer edges angled slightly forward.

It hovered, I did not hear any sound.   As far as I can tell it was black with sides and angles that were all equal to each other.  It had white lights on each corner and one red light in the very center.   I was too stunned to say anything about it but when we got back to the house the woman in the car in front of us had seen it too and she was hysterical about it (I haven't told many people because of my mom's reaction to her friend seeing the same craft).

I live in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Canada approximately 20 miles east of Vancouver, B.C. on March 31, 1997 in the back yard of my home in a small residential neighbourhood of Port Coquitlam, maybe a few minutes after 9:00 pm on a Monday evening, I too saw this very large ""boomerang"" shaped craft.  Shortly before 9:00 pm my father had called me and said that this night was supposed to be the last night that the Hale-Bopp comet would be visible, so that if I haven’t already seen it I’d better get my last look!   Being 5 months pregnant at the time and a little bored I went outside to observe the comet, I was looking up at the sky when from the direction of the Southeast I saw this very large what I could only describe as a boomerang shaped object float over above me.   The craft itself was dark with absolutely no lights on and completely silent.  It looked to be very large, it’s a little difficult to judge its distance but I would say it was only a couple hundred feet above me and it was moving slow but steady.   I remember walking slowly backwards trying not to take my eyes off this thing, watching it for as long as I could keep it in sight walking to the farthest corner of my yard practically climbing up on the fence just so I could get that last look until it disappeared from sight.  The whole encounter only lasted maybe 2 to 3 minutes. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before or since. Listening to the radio program on Coast to Coast on the evening of March 13th 2007 got me excited because until now I thought that maybe I was only one of a few who had witnessed this encounter, when I was describing this craft to friends and family 10 years ago I was describing it then as a boomerang shaped craft.  It was surprising and comforting at the same time to hear stories from people that were so similar to mine. Although I did not see this craft on the evening of  (March 13, 1997) where many others did in Phoenix Arizona, I can undoubtedly say that this ""boomerang"" shaped craft was seen March 31, 1997 in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Canada!",2007-04-27T00:00:00,49.259753974895396,-122.77502217573222

I noticed a row of lights in the sky and pointed them out to my husband.  There were 5-8 lights in a straight line almost directly overhead.  For a split second I thought they were some planetary alignment, but quickly realized that they were too bright and too perfectly aligned for that to be the explanation.  The sky was perfectly clear and it was still too light for any stars or planets to be visible.   We watched the lights for a brief period of time and discussed what we were seeing.  We weren’t sure if it was one object with lights on it or a well-aligned formation of separate objects.   Suddenly the lights started to dim and move closer together as if they were moving outward.  This movement was so rapid that it was similar to the effect in Star Trek of ""going into warp speed.""   At the time, we made a call to a local T.V. station to ask if anyone else had seen it.   The next night, there was a brief report on the weather portion of the news that a number of people had reported strange lights of unknown origin.  The weather reporter said that the lights were multiple planes lined up in a flight path for landing.  My husband and I were very certain that this was not a reasonable explanation for what we had seen.  We recently saw a news report where the former governor of Arizona disclosed his sighting of the Phoenix lights around March, 1997 (just a few weeks before our sighting).  The accompanying video footage of those sightings were extremely similar to what we saw.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

My bed faced a large window directly with a pull down screen covering it.  A amazing bright light flooded the room suddenly and much slower than a conventional light as eerie as that might seem.  I was gripped, frozen by fear and hardly able to breathe.  I wanted to call for my grandfather, but nothing came out.  I scanned the room vaguely and the light seemed to suck all the color out of everything leaving only a black outline and white where color should be.  I had a terrifying sense that I was the only one awake and that I was not supposed to be.  My ears were filled with what sounded like a thousand people whispering or what I imagine inhumanly large power lines buzzing with electricity would sound like.  My body was impaled upright by fear and my head frozen in the direction of the window.  In what seemed like an eternity to me, but I believe happened in mere moments the shadow of a figure crept across my window with only the impression of his body passing by.  But for one brief moment and for what will forever fill my heart with fear and make me cringe to this day, I had the most horrifying realization that it (and I say it full of disbelief in myself as well) knew I was awake and turned to me to contemplate my intrusion.  As swiftly as it came and just so it was gone.  The light seemed to creep right back out and left me sweating profusely and cringing in a mixture of disbelief, but mostly terror.  I cocooned myself in my covers and held myself for hours before I finally found release in forced slumber. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I felt alert and full of adrenaline. I then noticed my old cat looking at something outside. This itself would normally be very odd. She was old and almost blind. She never focused on anything including me. That is when a spotlight illuminated my room for an instant moving from N to W. My room had 3 large (4 ft tall, 1.5 ft wide) windows facing directly south and one window facing west. I quickly pulled my blinds up on 2 of the south facing windows hoping to catch a glimpse of it. My house is close to Cecil field airbase and our house was directly in the path of P-31 Orions on landing approach which normally fly E to W. They never illuminated my room. Sometimes, our local Sheriff  helicopters fly over too which is what I expected to see. They had illuminated my room before but they flew higher, their light was not as blinding, and they tended to fly in circles which this did not do. They also tended to make noise. I was surprised to see a dark circular craft hovering over some nearby tree lines. There was no sound. None. It had an Extremely bright spotlight which was very Blue in color. The craft was moving NNW and its path took it just past my house and past my backyard. I estimated the craft to be hovering at a very low altitude. 50-75 feet above the ground. As it moved, it was also moving its spotlight. After I had opened my blinds, the light had been refocused at the street 60 feet away (South of me) and just to the right of the craft straight down. Again, if facing my house from the north, to the right of my house and south 50 feet on our street. It moved the light quickly north, then northwest and then again into my bedroom where it then stayed (obscuring my view of the craft for most of its time within my vision) focused on me as the UFO moved towards, and then past my house. I would estimate its speed at 20 mph.I tri! ed looki ng through my west facing window and watched the light as it moved to the neighbor's house directly behind mine and then northward out of view. I never heard of other reports and did not bring it up because it greatly disturbed me. I didnt sleep the rest of the night. I cannot stress how errie it was that there was no sound at all. Were there sound, everything about the incident would scream normal sheriff helicopter activity. There was just absolutely no sound at all, completly silent, and it seemed much lower than I normally observed local helicopters.

It floated past the corner of the building I was next to so I couldn't see it any longer. I laughed and told the cashier what I saw when he waited on me. He stuck his head out the window but it was already out of sight. A few moments later he gave me my order and I drove forward. As I turned around the corner of the building I looked to where the object should be based on it's speed and direction. There was nothing there. Before I pulled back onto the main street I looked all around and up. It had disappeared. Because of the flatness of the area and lack of large trees or tall buildings the only way I could explain it disappearing was if it had crashed behind a home and lost it's air in the short time between when I saw it float past the building and when I pulled up. I listened to the local news that evening to hear if there had been a balloon crash or even a balloon show. Nothing was mentioned. As nutty as this sounds it really happened just as I wrote.

It was the year 1998 in San Angelo, Texas.  I went outside  because there was nothing to do inside. When I looked in the sky I saw a very big glowing red glowing fireball moving accross the sky with no sound. The moon was out too, it looked about a little smaller than the moon, it was big.  The fire ball had a really long tail connected trailing behing it. As the ball continued to move accross at a really slow pace,  about the same speed  and height as a plane moves accross the sky, this was no plane though it looked like a big comet or meteor.  I have never seen any thing like that before, and I've seen a few comets and meteors.  AS the ball moved accross the sky, the tail stayed glowing red and stretched accross the sky as far as I could see.  I wanted to call my mom who was asleep at the time inside.  But I didnt want to wake her.It lasted about an hour, the tail stayed lit a little longer after the ball kept going out of sight.  The tail just faded away real slowly afterwards.  I could tell it looked like it wasn't falling down to Earth, it just kind of looked like it kept going around the world.  I looked for some pictures on the net of what it looked like but found nothing.  IT looked like a comet but alot bigger and closer.  Pluse it was red and glowing, not blue.  I thought it might have been a spaceshuttle taking off but now I have seen how they take off, strait up in the air not accross the sky.  To this day I dont know what it was.

Orange sphere descends and touches surface of wilderness lake.,Lake Makokibatan,ON,1999-02-10T23:00:00,sphere,~3 Mins,"Occurred : 2/10/1999 23:00  (Entered as : 02/10/1999 23:00) Reported: 4/25/2007 2:26:14 PM 14:26 Posted: 4/27/2007 Location: Lake Makokibatan (Canada), ON Shape: Sphere Duration:~3 Mins",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56407.html,"Orange sphere descends and touches surface of wilderness lake I’d like to relate a second-hand sighting that I found compelling, based on my own personal opinion about the credibility of the witness, and because I know if I were never to share the account, it would go forever unreported officially. A few years ago, I went on a fly-in fishing trip with my father and brother on a lake in a very remote area in northern Ontario, Canada. The location was Makokibatan Lodge, an outpost on Makokibatan Lake which is only accessible by float plane. We had our own ""cabin attendant,"" a very sweet and down-to-earth woman in her 50s, who would knock on our door early every morning with coffee, and remind us that the fish are not going to catch themselves.  We got to know her well by the end of the trip. One night, my brother and I went outside, and stepped into a wooded area just out of range of the dock light’s glow, and looked up to enjoy the sky. I’ve seen many star-dense skies in zero light pollution areas, but this one, presumably because of our boreal latitude, was breathtaking. The thing that immediately struck us both though, was all the STUFF flying around up there!  I’m versed in the subject of aerospace, and my brother is a high-level electrical engineer that maintains a military security clearance for the work he does with the Department of Naval Intelligence, for which he has worked on satellite projects. We recognized this satellite/space junk mess above our heads for what it was, but it was quite a sight. I've never seen so many star-like objects in transit across the sky in my life. The night sky in this place is alive.  At times we would see as many as 4 different satellites in various orbits at once.  My brother pointed out a couple that were in polar orbits, which he said were either military or WX.  We saw a very tight constellation of three evenly spaced satellites forming a triangle traversing the sky in formation, and a blinking star-like object, which my bro informed me was a spin-stabilized satellite of some kind.  I’d be lying though if I said I wasn’t watching all of them very closely for a change in vector or speed, but of course they were what they were.  Quite a show. The next morning, our cabin lady came in, and in small talk, we told her what a great sky we enjoyed last night and how we couldn’t believe how much garbage was flying around up there, and she related that the sky is one of the reasons she feels lucky to live up there etc. With last night’s light show still fresh in our minds, to my surprise especially coming from my brother, he followed up with, ""So, have you ever seen anything strange?""  She replied in her thick Canadian accent, ""Oh yeah, well, me, once.""  Her response was patently nonchalant and innocent.  Surprised, we pressed her for more.  She went on to describe a night a few years previous, off-season, where she was up by the cabins while 3 or 4 ""hands"" were working at the dock, and they observed a ""large"" orange sphere, self luminous and about the brightness and color of ""one of those orange street lamps,"" casting shadow as it approached over the treetops on the opposite side of the lake, hover over the center of the lake at 300-400ft AGL (my estimation based on where she pointed), then descend to touch the surface of the lake. She said it ""dipped"" slightly into the lake and just sat there. (Note: It's a very large, choppy lake, so no ""ripples"" would be visibly cast and were not mentioned, nor did she mention any bobbing in the chop). It stayed there for a number of seconds, then ascended slowly, accelerated, and ""shot straight up"" and out of sight.  She spoke in a quiet tone and gave me the impression as if she was almost a little embarrassed to share the story, but again, casual about it. She ended the account by saying dismissively, ""I don’t know what it was."" and dispensed a shrug. She did imply during this conversation that many of the employees have their own experiences. As she spoke, i got the impression that her attitude was that in this place with such a conspicuous, immersive, impossible-to-ignore sky that occasionally seeing something ""strange"" is just kinda bound to happen eventually if you work and live here.  In retrospect I wished I had pressed her for a little more detail, but didn’t think it was appropriate at the time. The previous night, while gazing at that crystal clear, star-blanketed dome that betrayed to us every single little chunk of trash parading above us, I couldn’t help but think, ""Well, if UFOs are real and one got anywhere near this place, you sure as hell wouldn’t miss it.""  I think the unassuming, down to earth folks that work in this place are probably quite aware of that too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We used to go out in the cat tails and and pat down a circle and hang out together. One evening it was getting dark, and we all decided that we should probably get going. We all stood up and, when one of my friends looked up and said hey look at that! I looked up and to my surprise was three star looking objects in a triangle. the wierd thing is that this tringle of three star looking objects were so high up that they looked to be up in space, and also that they were moving at a slight angle straight up into space. As far away as they were ( if you held out a marble in your fingers that's about how spaced they were), the triangle had to be so far apart I can't even begin wonder how far apart they were to make that triangle. They just kept moving almost staight up into space tell we couldn't see them. This all happenend in a matter of about 20 to 30 seconds. Very impressive. I hope I am not wasting your time, but after seeing that I have always been very interested. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was headed in the direction of Mather Air Field, so I assumed it was a large military plane. As I continued to look at it I noticed that it was not moving fast enough to be an airplane. It was so low in the sky that it should have been moving very fast. I could not make out any wings or tail, just a defined object, white in color, not glowing in any way, with a silver/metallic edge around the bottom and sides. It was shaped like a flattened (or squared) cigar, not completely tubular, and I could see the details of the shape in good detail. It was definitely a technological object—not cloudlike or organic in any way. It appeared to be hovering, possibly moving very slowly to the east. I was looking at the object through my front windshield for probably 30 seconds, as I was driving in slow traffic. I had to brake for traffic in front of me, and lost site of the object for a few moments, then found I saw it again through my driver side window.  I continued to look at the object hovering for another 20 seconds or so until traffic forced me to go forward, at which point I lost site of the object completely. It was as if it just disappeared—but I had to concentrate on the road so I can not say I saw it vanish—I just could not find it again. I thought it could have been a reflection in my window, but since I saw the same defined object from two different windows while craning my head around in the car, and since it was noon on a sunny day, it could not have been a reflection.

Flew straight course but made partial spines on its axis left and right. Our Power was out do to late payment that night ( 9-18-07, 11:25 PST ). I was alone in the back patio, reclining in a chair listening to my headphones and enjoying the cool night air, there was not much else to do. First I will tell you that I am very familiar with the night sky and can tell the difference between planets, stars satellites and different aircraft. I have been through Private pilot and Civil Air Patrol ground schools and have had over 60 or so flight hours in private pilot training, and familiar with what lights aircraft should and are required to be equipped with and what each lights function and meaning are etc. On the night of my sighting the sky was clear and I was sitting back looking up at the stars while enjoying my radio station. I was facing up and out to the east.  I noticed some movement in the corner of my left eye, I faced that way and saw what looked like and moved like 4 bright white satellites moving in perfect formation across the sky at a speed a little faster than satellites move across the sky. The formation was that of a perfect triangle with the fourth light dead center. All the lights (3 points and 1 center) were identical in size, color ( white with slightest hint of blue) and brightness. And all about 50% brighter than the brightest stars out that night. As I have no way of knowing the actual size of the craft as there was nothing to reference it off of, I cant make an estimate on the altitude or speed. But I got the since it was pretty high and cruzing at a good speed, If I put my hand up to the sky the object would be equivalent in length as the width of 1 1/2 fingers.  The object had only these lights and they stayed solid. No red/green wing tip position lights, anti collision or any other for that matter.  The object moved in a straight line to the south east crossing my view of the sky at an angle. I was very confused as to what it could be, I took out my headphones ( volume was not high so I had no ringing in ears from radio station) and listened for sounds of engines which I should have been able to hear if it was a passenger jet, Prop plane or rotocraft at their perspective heights based on the size of the object as it appeared, but heard nothing, this is also a very quiet neighborhood especially at night.  I still figured for a moment that just maybe, it could be a newly deployed satellite. I have seen on the NASA channel where a satellite would be deployed by being released in a case where the case comes apart and the parts drift apart leaving the satellite.  But I was convinced it was not some kind of conventional aircraft or space junk moving in formation when after about 15 to 20 seconds the craft rotated approximate 90 degrees to the right on its axis ( the center light ) it took about 3-4 seconds to make this smooth rotation. At that point it stopped rotating and was still flying in the exact same line of travel and speed but now sideways. (it was pointy side forward to begin with) Facing almost south west but traveling on to the south east.  It continued on for about 10 seconds in this configuration then just like it did before it now rotated on its axis left back to its original configuration now facing its line of travel. I was really excited to see this because I knew for sure it was not any satellite(S) or aircraft I have ever seen. I was thinking this is either some out of this world craft (cool) or something brand new that we had (also cool), and if it is something we have It has to be using some new kind of propulsion to be able to rotate and fly sideways so smoothly like that.  It continued on to the south east until it was out of site. Both of the crafts rotations were the same speed (about 3-4 seconds) and smooth, never seeming to have an effect on its straight line of travel or speed.  The best I can compare it to would be a tank moving down the highway and the turret being able to swivel left and right without effecting the speed or course of the vehicle. Only what I saw was what appeared to be an entire aircraft do the same.  In my aircraft (flight schools aircraft I use for training) I can do what is called a crab which is where you give full left or right rudder and opposite aileron to put the aircraft in a slightly sideways configuration, but only about 10-20 degrees or so and at the expense of speed, it creates major drag and is used sometimes to drastically slow the aircraft, usually for a landing where you may be coming in a little high and or fast, it allows you to loose some altitude and speed quickly by using the body of the aircraft it self to create a lot of drag.  I know of no aircraft that can put itself in a sideways configuration from forward movement at high speed without breaking apart, moving off course, loosing speed etc. Some aircraft can hover and fly sideways at very slow speeds and some rotocraft but not at high speeds in the hundreds of miles per hour or faster.  Because of the amount of space the craft took up which was not a lot, like I said about 1 and a half finger width  and limited number of stars out at night in our sky around here (near by city lights drown out all but the brighter stars) I did not get a chance to see it cross over a stationary star to see if it would block it out, I did watch for that but it did not cross any stars in its line of flight from my point of view. This may have helped rule out separate objects doing formation ( very impressive Formation ) flying but I really got the since it was a single solid object.  Also the lights on the craft all maintained their brightness during the entire sighting across the sky. Satellites I see will usually blink or fade, these lights did not.  I do not know for sure what I saw that night but It was diffidently making deliberate movements making me believe it was controlled by something or someone.  Also for reference the crafts line of travel was south east with the line taking it over or just slightly north of BFL Meadows Field, rather than right over the city of Bakersfield. If anything it would have skirted the area of Bakersfield on its northern edge.  I have included a picture I made on a paint program showing the crafts appearance, line of travel and movements. What I actually seen looked a bit more distant than it appears in the picture. Consider it a somewhat zoomed in look at exactly what I had seen. Also the positions in the sky where the craft changed its configuration was much more distant from each other than what you see in the picture, it was about 10 seconds between the left and right rotations and the craft was seen for a total of about 50 seconds to 1 minute which covered the entire line of sight of sky I could see which was quite a bit.

October 12, 2007 Around the middle of September I sighted an unusual object in the western sky.  The reason for the untimely reporting is simply because I had no idea that there was even a place to report these things to.  It wasn’t until I encountered a second sighting of a completely different object (which I will put in a separate report) sometime during the first week of October that I started researching for a place to report.  Our local airport manager gave me phone number and web site. I live about 700 or 800 yards from the Oregon coastline and the western sky is over the coastline and the Pacific Ocean in general.  Approximately 8 PM, I was standing on my front porch looking at the recently darkened sky when I noticed movement to the northwest which appeared, initially, aircraft like.  A white and a red light in the sky, moving, at first glance, typical aircraft.  As I looked closer I thought to myself, ""That’s sort of odd.""   What I saw didn’t really look like an airplane.  I thought possibly a blimp but I could hear none of the familiar noise that travels with the average blimp.  As the object moved slowly toward a more westerly position from my porch, my view became clearer and the object started looking nothing like an airplane or a blimp.  Looking due west from my front porch, I first sighted the object at approximately a 45 degree angle to my right in the northwest sky and seemed to be running parallel to the coastline.  Our local airport would be at approximately 35 degrees assuming due west was 90 degrees and zero was to the right.  Often time, jets leaving the airport take a similar flight path.  As the object reached its due west position, I could tell it was many times larger than any of the largest jets I’ve seen here or even the blimps that fly over the area fairly often.  It also now appeared to be further out than I originally thought.  The object continued in a southerly direction until it reached approximately 120 degrees (my left) where it started to angle slightly more eastward and also began to angle more upward into the sky.  Until this point, it had been traveling more or less horizontally along the coast.  It continued this upward path until it flew out of sight. When I first sighted the object, all I could see was 2 lights, a very bright white light at the leading end and a less bright red light at the trailing end.  The white light did not appear to be particularly directional and seemed to create a soft glow or haze near the leading edge.  The red light was probably 30-40% dimmer but crisper with less haze factor.  As the object got to a more westerly position its shape became more apparent.  It looked to be tube like with the white light fairly centered on the leading end and the red light seeming to sit on the upper side of the trailing end.  Although we do get some thin to thick fog along the coastline, this night was clear and so fog was not the simple answer for why the upper and lower edges of the tube did not appear particularly crisp.  The crispness of the tube edges seemed to fade in and out slightly and if, indeed it was further out than it appeared, then thin, not quite visible fog could have been the reason for this.  The size of the object was kind of hard for me to tell but was quite large, maybe hundreds of feet long.  I would say that it was probably 8 to 12 times as long as it was thick.  The side clearly appeared to have the roundedness of a tube with the light that seemed to glow very dimly along the side from the leading end, almost highlighted like.  I thought possibly (?) reflected light from the town.  At no time did I ever hear any noise or sound come from it. When the object reached its roughly due west position is when I called my wife out to see it.  She came out and caught the last 3 or 4 minutes as the object angled up and away from the coastline into the upper part of its path where it flew out of sight toward high, thin clouds.  It did not appear to reach the high clouds and seemed to just disappear 20 or 30 miles out to the south and east.  The entire time of my sighting was probably 10 to 13 minutes.  It flew quite slowly for the first 7 or 8 minutes and seemed to speed up some (to not quite as slow but not fast by any means) after its flight path changed upward and inland.

We, at first, thought it was a small aircraft, but it was very close to the ground. The light showed that it was very maneuverable in its sporadic, three-dimensional movements. Unique to this light, however, was a beam of a lighter white going from the main light (let’s say craft) to the ground. The light could move independently from the movement of the craft itself, and it searched from the trees surrounding the field to about the middle of the field. The craft continued these actions for about 15 minutes until it traveled to the tree line. The movements then switched to only a line parallel to our side of the field on the opposite side above the trees. The light remained on the ground for 1 more minute until the craft got brighter (as if its beam were shining at us). I and my friends got the distinct feeling that it has seen us seeing it. Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone. It did not go below the trees. It did not fly up to the sky. It simply disappeared.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,42.4557,-88.3038

We both believed the possible helicopters were conducting a search of the area.

As they came closer to Highway 152 and the entrance to our small mountain cimmunity (Kingston NM, Pop. 30) I immediately realized the objects were too large to be helicopters.  They were flying in a single line formation much too close to one another.   All three triangular black objects hovered directly above our location for approximately 10-15 seconds at an altitude of less than 500 yards and then continued up towards the canyon to Emory Pass summit which is in the direction of Silver City NM.

They did not look like Harrier Jump Jets as they were more triangular and dark black.

The object was not highly reflective. The exact form is uncertain. It was not well defined; however it had the shape of a rectangle if I were to guess.  I followed the object in a somewhat southerly direction. The previous blue object appeared within the ‘field of view’ (fov) for a few seconds.  I continued to follow the 2nd object for 2-3 min. It traveled ~ 5-6 inches (arms length). Due to the apparent altitude of this object and the one below, the exact form and shape are uncertain. I’m not certain why I did not return to viewing the ‘bluish’ object rather than the ‘white’ object ?  Again, this object and the one below were most likely not visible to the unaided eye.  ~ 14:35 3rd object. Identical to the 2nd object. I viewed it for 6-7 min. traveling at a relatively slow pace as above. It suddenly began to pick up speed and began to travel in a SW direction.  I maintained sighting of the object as I backed 15 feet toward the NE in order to maintain view. This movement was required due to tree obstruction.  The objects acceleration increased to the point that I was required to run beyond the tree obstruction. When attempting to relocate after moving to a new viewing location about 30 feet to the SW, I think I found the object,  however it appeared to be accelerating at a rapid rate and appeared to be droping in altitude to point of losing sight. This last view is uncertain.  15:00 as perspective: Four (2 blue / 2 white) balloons, visible w/o binoculars as a single object toward the North at about 75 º.  Balloons traveled ~ 12-14 inches (arms length) over a period of 25 min. As they traveled toward the West, they ascended to an altitude during this period where they were not visible w/o binoculars.  (later ID'd as typical ""Caldwell Banker' grouping of 'open-house' balloons)",2007-11-28T00:00:00,40.137,-75.2062

The difference that set it apart from any aircraft is that it looked like a small cloud that was lit up from behind by a white  light.

As it flew over it faded out and again and lit up again in perfect rythem as it headed straight southwards.

I was unable to sleep, and walked to my window to look west across the lawn over into the area of Presser Hall, and, after a few seconds in the window, my attention was drawn upward by an unusual object.  The sky was clear, with no adverse weather conditions, and I recall no noise whatsoever.  But, I noted an object, which I can only describe as a black or other dark colored equilateral triangle which appeared from not directly above my building, but rather at an eleven o'clock position.  The most striking feature about this object was that it did not fly with a logical leading edge.  In other words, if twelve o'clock would be straight ahead, and the nose position on a conventional aircraft, this object's corners were at roughly two o'clock, five o'clock, and nine o'clock.  Continuous white lights were observed at the two and nine o'clock positions, and a continuous red light was observed at the five o'clock position, which would approximate the ""tail"" of the aircraft.  This object left no contrail, and made no noise whatsoever.  While difficult to state with certainty, I would estimate the object to be approximately 1,000 feet above ground level, traveling due west.  I watched the object pass over the Bethany Campus, and lost sight of it as it disappeared behind Presser Hall and various trees.  At no time did this object perform any stunning maneuvers, or violate any fundamentals of physics.  At the time, I noted mentally that I was less than 100 miles north of McConnell Air Force Base, and initially attributed the object to a military test of some sort, but soon realized that McConnell is not really known as being a test facility.  I remained at Bethany until May of 1998, and never again saw anything similar to this craft, but did, on numerous occasions, witness various military aircraft in the area over the years.  Aside from the bizarre angle and leading edge placement, I could easily attribute this to a craft of Earthly origin.  However, at present, some twelve years later, I have yet to see anything about new military aircraft that have a leading edge built in such a manner.  It struck me as odd enough that I made a crude sketch immediately after seeing the object.  (In 2004, after hearing a radio program in which Mr. Colm Kelleher of the National Institute of Discovery Science discuss sightings of so called ""black triangles,"" I drew the object in a more detailed manner, and attempted to place it ""to scale.""  I subsequently filed a report on this incident with N.I.D.S. and included my original and later drawings, which I will forward to NUFORC in a separate email submission.)  As the object was so dark and blended into the night sky, I could not tell definitively if the object was a proper triangle, or if the edges were more rounded.  Therefore, in the more detailed drawing, the edges of the object are drawn both as straight lines and as curved lines.  I am certain the object was not perfectly round, in any event.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,38.6237,-97.6876

I stared and then noticed the light was not moving. Just as a mentioned this to my mother and sister the light began to zip smoothly towards us.

It was a rather clear day.  Very little cloud cover. I witnessed at least one craft silver/grey in color, very reflective.  I cannot give an estimate of the altitude of the craft in question.  It flew across the sky from E to S.  At a point around SE it disappeared from the sky.  It had not changed direction or speed.  I did not take my eyes off the object.  Upon scanning the sky, I discovered the object in question back at the original place in the sky at compass E.  Around this time of that year, I witnessed several craft having the same characteristics both in behavior and appearance.  The most notable sighting of these craft occurred around this time as well.  I saw one of these craft while in the backyard of my house.  The cigar-shaped craft crossed the sky, then stopped in mid-air.  A blue light came off of it, shining brightly even in mid-afternoon.  I don't recall exactly what happened that day, other than two odd things that I cannot account for.  One: I seem to have blacked out, but I came out of it standing upright in a different part of the yard than where I was when I saw the light.  Two: My clothes seemed in dissarray, my shirt was on inside-out and my pants' zipper was down.  I have since then had a dream about that day.  I do not consider the dream to be 100% reliable.  It may be the actual events of that day or merely my imagination.  However, the dream started out exactly like my real memories of that day.  In my dream I see the craft come down and hover over my house.  The next scene is me sitting naked in a white room with sophisticated equipment on my right and 2-3 ""greys"" in front of me.

They waited a while and when the distance became too far (but I still could see them in the sky), then they went back to LIE and proceeded going toward City.

It was the end of a work day (a Thursday or Friday, as I recall) and I was carpooling with another fellow from nearby Benton City, where we both lived at the time.  We were driving along a long and relatively straight stretch of road near the Columbia River, headed toward the West.  In the distance, staright ahead of us, was a slowly pulsating white light, to the left of a mountain in the area.  At first I thought it was the headlights of a plane approaching for a landing at one of the area airports.  When the object never moved for well over a full minute, I called my friend's attention to it and we continued to watch for at least another two minutes.  Still the object held motionless, but continued to pulsate, at about 4-6 seconds per cycle, I would guess.

Peter We are a small group in Alberta and I had this report sent to us.I did send it on to Chris Rutkowski of Canufo. What prompted me to write to you is this is similar to the recent one at O'Hare Chicago sighting.3 pilots saw this object and reported it to the tower at Spring Bank airport. I followed this one up and am still trying to get more info.The report I got was from a small A/C waiting to take off as he saw this object about a mile away.The tower reply was that they had nothing on radar.Another A/C coming into land also reported this object.There was another A/C behind the first one that also saw the object. I contacted the airport manager and he contacted the 2 controllers and they said they never saw any thing.Spring bank is a small airport west of Calgary and is used by small A/C only. The color was said to be dark grey/black.The sun would have been setting in the west and the object was observed looking east.. The observer said that once airborne he would report back to the tower but after T/O the object had dissapeared. Why the controllers could not see the object is a mystery as they would have had a perfect view of the object.It could have been a weather balloon but then the tower should have had a warning of this and also most of the balloons have radar reflectors on them.,2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

They were very high, just below the clouds and were in ""c"" formation for about 5 seconds. Then they made u turn and flew right over me. I expected hear a noise like a sonic boom or some thing but there was no sound. And when they turned around, they seemed to change formation at the same time and they seemed to merge together into one large bright light. This light seemed to change colors very rapidly. But as soon as they merged, they broke off into about 20 lights. They all turned to back to the original color purple when they lined up side by side. All that happened in about 5 seconds before they were suddenly engulfed by a bright blue light that came out of no where and the light slowly faded. It was completly gone after about a minute and the lights had gone with it. But the area in the clouds where they had been looked like it was glowing a purple-green color and looked like it was radiating some kind of plasma. But it only lasted a few seconds. I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it but I was the only one who had seen it. I drew a sequnce of pictures that depicted what I saw. I was to nervous to tell anyone about till now. I hope that explanes every thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-02-01T00:00:00,39.0411,-76.4942

One day, while speaking with my father about the event, he had said he saw the same phenomena.  We talked about it, and past ""green flash"" events, and traced it back to an air-fuel making plant located in Rosemount, MN, which emits such flashes at times.   Rosemount is about 5 miles North East of my location, and where me and a friend witnessed the same event as well.   Once also, there was a powerfull explosion that came from the plant around five years ago, which illuminated the entire night sky to the point that it was seen from Eagan, MN, which is an estimated seven miles from the plant.  Now I cannot fully include that this is the cause of the flash, but that is what I am now assuming the cause is.

First of all i would like to add the fact that i am a 26 year old private pilot that has been studying aviation since about the age of 10. i have extensive knowledge of 90% of aircraft that are on the civilian and military market. i am currently in college and me and a few of my friends were going down to the bolivar peninsula,tx (crystal beach) for labor day weekend. i am from houston so we took interstate 10 east to highway 124 through winnie,tx to get there. around 10 minutes after taking a right on to that highway i saw a helicopter moving parallel to these powerlines that was parallel to the road that we were travelling. what caught my attention was how close he was to the lines and i could clearly see how close he was to them because he was about 350 yards in front of our path.the road made a sway to the right and the farther that me and my friend traveled down this curved road,""at about 75-80mph, we gained alot of headway on the chopper. well, by the time the curve was overwith i had relized that the 350 yds i thought he had on us was really about 100 yds and it was ""very"" clear that it was not a helicopter...it was a glowing orange ball about  three times the size of a basket ball. it was amazing"" and it was moving at about 90 miles an hour parallel to the power lines.""5 feet above them"" and my friend was flooring his jeep to keep up with the thing and he did a good job of it too. it never made a sound but we were going so fast with the windows down i would have never heard it anyways. Believe me when i say this, we were hauling ass after this thing. This thing was a glowing ball and it was not emmitting any light at all.it was like a big ball of candlelight but it looked like the size of a basketball from the altitude it was keeping. we followed the object for around 45 minutes when we came to a hill and a small community along the highway in between the peninsula and winnie and we watched the obje! ct fly a bout treetop level over that community and me and my friend watched as people were walking down the street, driving their cars, and were completely oblivious to what was just over their head...one thing that i can tell you is that watching that made the whole thing very erie""...keep in mind that by this time we had been watching this thing for almost an hour .... what i saw that night was not un explainable..it was obviously an aircraft but just not of human engineering...it was of something else. me and my boy knew that nobody would believe us, so for about 20 minutes i tried to get the best picture possible with what we had and that was my camera phone...i t came out as crappy as the the phone camera but it is visible on the picture so anyone that would want to see it could. at the time of the picture the object was about 75yds in front of the truck just above the power lines  until it slowed down and it was above us anywhere from 100 to 200 feet and instantaneously dissapeared...the only way to describe the way it is like someone turning off a lightbulb. it just vanished after almost an hour of following it..truly one of the most craziest things ive ever seen. i didnt even tell anyone other than my girl but i found this website and saw all of the other reports that were almost identical to what i saw and i felt like it was my obligation to write this... i am going to leave my information so i can be contacted just incase somebody wants to hear my story but i have been doing someresearch since this and i have found that these kinds of sightings happen all the time like everyday somewhere in the world...there is obviously not only a presence of unhuman technology but there is a ""major presence"" and people are always talking about the government and how they are keeping information from their people..i think that is only because they no nothing at all and there is absolutely nothing they can do. i know what i saw that night and there is nothing that an f-16 can do against and object that can move like th! at and d issapear at will...we are simply out of our technological league"" that it is why it should be up to the people and private organizations such as this to find answers to questions dealing with this presence...it is obvious that nasa is censored by the national govt so dont think that some liberal elected politician is just going to walk into congress and demand answers to questions that dont exist"" sincerely, !#$@% ps.contact information will be given upon request.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,29.8152,-94.401

I was driving for about 10 minutes and still couldn't tell exactly where the lights were hovering over, by the time I reached my destination. I'm guessing they were over St. Charles or South Elgin. But what I found so bizarre was that they didn't move at all. At first I thought they might be helicopters doing a search, but there was no searchlight scanning the ground or operating lights on the craft or perhaps light standards like you'd see at a high school football stadium, except there were no supports, and were way too high in the sky. Not only that, but they were just a solid amber colored light, with very little glow around them. I thought for sure other people must be seeing this as there was alot of traffic along Randall road that night.

I noticed a formation of lights suspended at what I estimated to be a couple hundred yards to a half mile off the ground, about 50~100 yards north of the highway.  I no longer am positive about the exact pattern or number of lights, but what I do remember is either a cluster of three white lights forming a close triangular at what I took to be the tip of the triangle at the east, or else a single white light at the east--either way I took that to be the front of the craft. At what I took to be the rear--the west end--were a row of about five lights, lined north-to-south. They were not uniform in size or shape, that is, three or four were red, with one of these beings smaller than the others, and one other of these lights was white--I don't remember its relative size. Between these two ""ends"" of the object were other lights, reddish or even a little orange; two or three of them, a little smaller than most of the lights at the rear. As an electrician, I noticed that the quality or type of light emitted from all of these lights did not seem the least bit unearthly; they were certainly not flourescent, a little brighter than what one might expect from normal incandescent bulbs, more like the intensity and quality of shine that one sees with halogen lights.  I was navigating the east-to-northeast curve in the highway while looking at this thing, trying to both stay in my lane and make out an outline of the object. I was not able to see a solid shape--just the pattern of the lights. I told my friend, sleeping in the passenger's seat, to look but he was groggy and not awake enough to understand until we were well past the spot. He did not see anything, and went back to sleep.  I have seen airplanes fly parallel to I-40 on their way west to land at Will Rogers Airport. But (a) they fly much higher than the thing which I saw, (b) their lights flash, this's did not, (c) they speed past even at their higher altitudes fast enough to recognize their movement from my truck, this thing was clearly stationary, (d) the pattern and number of lights did not match what I am familiar with from conventional aircraft--for example, the two or three lights I saw in the middle were spread too far apart north-to-south for this craft to have had a standard airplane shape. (e) from the intensity of the light, it was clear that this thing was far lower than any airplanes. (Again, the lights were neither flashing nor moving, and I noticed dust particles floating through the lightbeams immediately below the sources of light.)  While I don't doubt that advanced civilizations may exist which could travel here from their own worlds, I also don't necessarily ascribe what I saw to otherworldly technology. Maybe it was a test flight of some fancy new  military plane from the local Tinker Airforce Base. I don't know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When I got to look at the one that contains the object, I suddenly remembered why I took the shot and zoomed in on it to see if I could make out what the object was I had seen. When I looked at the second photo, which was taken 3 seconds later, there was no object that appears anywhere in the frame. I was using a Canon PowerShot A540, without the zoom on, and was holding it at about a foot in front of my face. I have no idea where the object went after the first shot was taken. I would say that the ridge in the foreground, just below the object, was about 2/5 of a mile away from where I was standing and that the object was much further away than I had intitially thought, possibly a mile from where I was. I would put it's size at about 35-50 feet in diameter. I also noticed when I zoom in on the object in the photo, there appears to be some sort of vertical rod on the top of it. Others I've shown the photo to, have noticed the same thing. The whole time frame of my sighting lasted about ten seconds from when I first spotted it, took the two photos, and was no longer able to see it anywhere. My son and his girlfriend where in the same parking lot, but where about 100 feet from where I was. The sighting didn't excite me and I didn't even mention it to them. As I said, it was distant and it never struck me at the time as possibly being a UFO. Who would have thought they'd ever be presented with the opportunity to get a shot of one in their lifetime? At the time, I just took the photos as a curiosity. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe it's a bird, with wings upraised.  However, PD))",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

The object was a large ball of silver-blue-white  light with a spasrkling surface.  It had a small trail of the same colored light.  It was visible to us at an angle of about 30 degrees above the ground in a falling trajectory of about 30 degrees relative to the ground.  During our observation the ball of light appeared to disappear behind some high hills in front of us in the area of Cascade Resevoir (N44-31-27 degrees x W116-02-59 degrees). If it had hit the gound we would have expected there to be a flash or very bright light in that direction - we did not see anything but it's diappearance behind the hill. The local Sheriff had several reports and sent a deputy to look for the object. The deputy did not find anything. It was not reported in the newspaper nor on TV, and the large airport tower to the south saw nothing in the air nor on its radar (they said).",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

I am a grandson of my grandmothers. I don't ((fool)) around, and i'm not one for wasting my time on time consuming websites like this one here. Anyhow... my grandmother is very religous and doesnt believe in hokus pokus ufo's nor aliens, or whatever the hell propaganda spotting of ufo's people of the world conjure.  On the other hand i do, but im not one to let my mind run off in a frenzy over the thought, that hey, maybe we're not the only ones around. I believe in energy, positive and negative... im not religous in any aspect, i only believe in what i believe, which is energy, and what is plasma, im liviing now and it is good, and if i die tomorrow, then oh well, as i must have served my purpose, we all die eventually, so death to me is just a new birth, a breakdown of molecules: evaporating, condesating, and mixing to form another form of some other kind of form: elements of the universe, something i think scientist's will never grasp, nor understand. I'm not trying to sound nuts, I just go deep, and i don't care what anyone thinks.  But last summer of 2007, my fiance and I went to visit my grandmother, like we do every sunday. It was late, like 7:30- 8, im pretty sure but dont take my word for it. She was in the kitchen, drinking coffee, we were there for about forty-five minutes and she said oh man! did I tell you... I took ((child's name deleted))  (who was only a year old at the time) outside to show her the stars when she pointed up and made a noise. She said (grandmother):There was this long silver cigar-shaped thing floating over the house, and it was moving very,very slow, and I stood out there for not even five minutes, when it disappeared over the tree lines. I got excited... and every now and then I think about that, so thats why I jumped online to try and figure this out or get some answers:spite of curiousity... I've always been into the stars because it fascinates myself, i always wonder what might be out there, i've always felt trapped here on earth, and if i was filthy rich, id probab ly build something, to get away and to see the beautiful outside, even if i starved to death on my way to everywhere, at least i would die with a glimps of what i always have wanted to venture on into. Im not crazy, im just passionate, and i express my passion when i speak, or write, like ive just done. So you can take this as a complete hoax, and ill probably take u guys as complete assholes, seriously. U should check this out. If u want me to leave my name, and my grandmothers name and address, fine. that'll be no problem with me. Oh, for information, just so u know: she lives on 64 acres of land, i guess she lives in the valley of a small ""moutain"" or a really big hill, anyhow she's above sea level, compared to the actual city of erie. And on another note: When my mother was a little girl, maybe 5- or 6, her and her sister dissapeared into those woods, from the beginning of daylight to the dropping of it, my grandparents found them sitting talking into the air, to themselves. till this day my mom will tell you, that there was a large rock like thing floating right above the ground, and they were talking to eat, having a conversation with it, but she doesnt remember what it was about. to break this down even further: my mom is 46 years old now, and she's very cool, she's into these crystals or whatever the hell they are, her plants, and she's very spiritual on an energynote. her husbands an electrical engineer at g.e., and when it comes to those kind of things, he thinks shes pretty much nuts. you'll have to get ahold of her. like face to face. it's interesting. anyhow, i think ive said entirely way to much. so how the hell do i get ahold of you people, if a... i cant leave any info. about anyone, or myself? whats up with that? oh, and im not a treky or whatever the hell u call those freaks. im just a normal dude who thinks to! much.

A few days before 4th of July me and my family were taking my dughter to my father s house in success MO.   We left St. Louis around 7pm. The sighting took place on hwy 17 between licking and success. Anyway it was around 8 or 9pm and was dark.  There were 7 (i beleive 7) oarnge colored lights that appeared to be on top of a hill side about 4 miles off. However the 7 lights must have stretched 1/2 mile or so and they turned on and off in no specific order. Then we came to a curve in the road and the lights were not sitting on the horizon hillside but they were up in the air. Im guessing the hight of a small plane. The lights were in a straght line, It was too dark to see an outline so I cant say the shape, only that the lights stretched about 1/2 mile. The lights would turn off and on in differnt orders. Some times lights 1 2 and 7 would light up, then all would lights up, then some would go out and come back on. They did not flicker and did not blink. I was in the navy on an aircraft carrier and I also live close to St.Louis airport. This was not a plane, Too big and it had oarnge lights, no blue or red lights, no white lights.  Also I know it was not military flares, do to the way they would light up. Sometimes 7th light and 2nd light would light. Then all would light, then most would turn off and later come back on. I thought it was really cool what we seen, However my wife was not impressed until a show on the history channel. It was a UFO show, UFO over illinois, I showed her what was on and then see was schocked, because the lights they show were what we saw. Also there is a video of UFO I beleive in Mexico, were a huge object is filmed over the city, with a straight row of lights that just turned on, It was very similar to that. I know that there is a military base close to my sighting, Fourt Leonardwood, But again, there is no way this was an aircraft, I don't know what it was but it was realy something to see.  Thanks...

I am in the US Military and currently stationed in Iraq.  On 15 June 2007 at approximately 2230, I and two other soldiers saw a strange object/formation/thing in the sky.  It looked like a funnel cloud about 100 feet tall and was approaching us from a northwest direction.  It was white/grey in color.  There were no visible lights on it.  It was moving fairly fast.  I used my night vision goggles to get a better look at it.  I could then see two steady lights.  One light was at the bottom of the funnel and the other about halfway up the right side.  As the object passed overhead, it looked more like a cone.  Once it passed us, it headed into a southeast direction, then immediately south.   I noticed a third light moving towards the object at a greater rate of speed with my night vision goggles in the same direction; both moving south from Baghdad.  The object and lights then began to fade out of sight.  I am not sure if this was a UFO or the International Space Station, since they began working on it I believe the same day. I'm sure there were other people who saw it here also. It was dark and wish I could have taken pictures. ((NUFORC Note:  According to the schedule for the ISS, posted at www.Heavens-above.com, it was not visible from Iraq from June 9th to June 17th.

Around 1 am MST, I saw a light moving due east. It was the brightest object in the sky, brighter than Venus or Mars, white, very high. Clearly some kind of flying craft. I could not determine a particular shape, other than it resembled very bright star. It did not shoot across the sky, or flare or flash. The speed was constant. There was no sound, and no blinking lights. I spotted it at once as I walked out my back door, facing south. It was moving steadily eastward and upward. It did not disappear over the horizon. It faded from view into the night sky at about 80 degrees SE (I think that is the correct measure). If one looked straight up, then south down to about 80 degrees, then west to about 40 degrees, that is where I first spotted it. I followed it east to about 80 degrees, and that is where it faded into the clear sky fairly rapidly. I would estimate the sighting lasted roughly ten seconds. I would like to know if anyone else saw this. Thank you.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,46.92450254041571,-114.02240554272517

It stayed directly on path over my building, about 150 feet up. It was flat and round, I could see that because as it traveled it seemed to tip over, revealing how thin it was, then back to flat. Then upon passing by my building and a few more, it stopped and hovered, then turned a semi circle to the right. I freaked at this point because it was going against the wind.  The object then resumed course away from me and I was at risk of loosing sight of it so I ran up to the roof to watch it. It was gone upon my arrival and I stayed for maybe 10 minutes looking for it. I returned downstairs to my deck. Upon return I looked all around and over to the right about 2 blocks down the object was back paralleled with my building and moving east bound again.

Pilot flying Cessna flys with disc-shaped craft over lake.,Sneads,FL,2007-06-16T13:20:00,disk,5-10 minutes,"Occurred : 6/16/2007 13:20  (Entered as : 6/16/07 13:20) Reported: 6/16/2007 10:02:38 PM 22:02 Posted: 8/7/2007 Location: Sneads/Chattahoochee, FL Shape: Disk Duration:5-10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57111.html,"Pilot flying Cessna flys with disc-shaped craft over lake. Hello - I am a student pilot working on my private license and I was flying my Cessna 150 on my solo x-country flight coming back to Quincy airport on my way back from tri-county airport near Chipley, GA.  I was coming up on Lake Seminole and I noticed a straight line shape, metalic/dull white in color with no reflection that I could notice out on my left flying at my exact altitude right on the horizon. I noticed it when I was scanning the skies for other aircraft, like a good pilot should do.  But something struck me as odd about this thing, beause it appeared to be flying. At first glance I thought maybe it was just a metal barn or something, but as I went along it stayed in the exact location on my left on the horizon, about 700-1000 feet away is my best guess.   At that point I knew it was something that was airborne. And then I thought it might be a glider, because of its extremly smooth flight, but then I saw no fusalage, like a normal aircraft would have. And thats when I knew there was something very strange about it.  It maintained its realitive postion on my left on or very near the horizon. There were no speed changes, I tried to gain on it by putting in full throttle to get up beside it but it just stayed the same distance the whole time.  I tried to gain some altitude to get a more 3-D image of it but it climbed when I climbed. I did a dutch roll (tipped the wings back and forth while keeping the nose in the same postion, not changing course) facing it, just to let it know I was aware of it, and it did not respond, just staying horizontal and keeping the same distance (I was going around 90-95). Like I said, I could not really get on 'top' of it to see a great 3-D image of it but I got a pretty good look at it and I would say it had to be a disc.  I kept questioning myself the entire time thinking ""is this really what I think it is?"" and then when I got over lake seminole I could see it above the lake and I knew it was in the air and REAL, no me seeing things. There were several boats and p eople out on the lake so I KNOW someone else had to see it, as we were over the middle of the lake, and it was a Saturday in the middle of summer at aound 1:20 in the afternoon, so there was lots of activity below.  I did glance down at my altitide meter and it read 2000 feet, and this was in the middle of the encounter. I could have lots or gained a hundered feet or so from the begining or end of the sighting but 2000 is the average alititude I'd say. I would glance away from the object from time to time to scan the horizon for other aircraft but I never say any.  And when I was over lake seminole I radiod in at Quincy airport that I was over lake seminole and that there was a unidentified flying craft flying with me over the lake, hoping someone might come out to see for themselves.  I kept my eyes on it till we got over the lake and then I glanced away from it back towards Quincy for only a brief half second and then glanced back toward where the object usually was and it was gone. No sign of it. I was kinda ticked at myself for not keeping my eye on it and letting it 'get away'. But it had stayed with me so long that I was feeling complacent and kinda felt comfortable that it was going to stay there. And I also noted that 30 seconds o a minute after I lost it it started to rain lightly, as I notcied drops on my canopy. The best physical visual I can give you is if you a quarter away to you on your left at eye level. Thats what it looked like.  Please feel free to contact me as I would like to know if anyone else has come forward from the lake below or whatnot.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,30.7693,-84.9471

This is my story...  I live in Quinton which is approx 4 miles from Birmingham city centre. I have had an interest in military aircraft since the age of 14, I'm now 32. I know the signature patterns of aircraft and helicopter strobes  and flight dynamics so the identification of an aircraft I can make instantly. I have been an amateur astronomer for over 10 years and own my own 10"" Newtonian telescope with observatory so even the faintest satelite or space anomaly I can identify. To put it short, my eyes are quite well trained and not as easily fooled as the untrained eye. I have had a keen interest for most of my life with Ufology and have read many  if not most of the ufo literature available. I have read many case reports and sightings so I know what  could be easily described as a ufo when a logical explanation is available.    Heres my sighting,   I was standing by my patio door having a cigarette and my wife had just gone in  the bath, whilst smoking I noticed a black  object in the sky approx 3 miles away from  my home, at first it could be confused with  a hawk hovering at close range, but over a heavy populated area at approx 3 miles,  I think not. I continued to watch the object as my mind  was trying to rationalise what I was seeing to an object I could relate to, i couldn't. The object was black, no lights no sound. It seemed to be oval shaped and on ocassions changed to a triangle shape. Visibility was very good, clear sky with a few rain clouds to the horizon and a few brillant white clouds which were being illuminated by the sun. I watched for an estimated 1 min 30 secs before accepting that this could be a ufo.  I have a 9 month old daughter and when she was born we decided to purchase a digital hard drive camcorder to film her growing up. I decided to fetch this knowing  more than likely that when i return the object will have disapeared. I returned with the camera and noticed the object was still there, only now it was on the move. I powered up my camera and started to film the object. The digital display on the camera is approx 3 inches in size so I couldn't tell if i had the object in view or even in focus, but i continued to film. The object moved over the trees and towards  the horizon and finally disapeared behind a cloud. My ideal reactions would have been to notify the local police of a potential unidentified object within a flight path and even contact air traffic control. Reading as many ufo books as i have i know how important recordable data is, but strange enough i did what most general public do, i thought how strange and just sat down going over in my mind what i had just witnessed. The only plausable thing i did was to email Timothy Good straight away. Although the obect was quite far away, with a trained eye i could just about identify its shapes. We decided to watch the video to see if you could see the little dot in the sky and to our amazment we captued 2 mis 32 secs of the ordeal, and the footage  is very clear",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

I and my family including a wife and a 03½ year old daughter were going to the country’s capital Islamabad by road for vacation holidays. We started our journey from Lahore at about 05:30PM and had to travel a distance of 400 Km to reach the destination.  Taking two stopovers in the middle of the journey and approx. 45 Km from the destination, a strange phenomenon occurred during traveling at a speed of 120 Km/h when I suddenly picked up a red blinking light at an altitude of approx. 200ft, moving fast from east to west at a speed of a taking off passenger jet. We were traveling north.  Initially I thought that it’s an aero plane and for the attraction of my daughter who was sitting behind us on the baby seat, I said to her look there’s an aero plane in the skies. But as it approached more closely on the Motorway, it didn’t look like an aero plane to me and my wife. It was an orange colored object with a saucer shape and a red blinking light at the bottom and a glowing purple light around its circumference making an arc. I immediately slowed down my vehicle and brought it to 80 Km/h and recorded time on my watch as 09:30PM local time. As it further approached, we observed that it was spinning too fast more than the speed of acceleration. The first sentence my daughter said when she saw it, was ""Mom, I have seen it in the Chicken Little movie.""  I lowered my window to hear any sound as I was expecting a roaring sound from such a close distance but nothing was heard.  We had an eye contact with the object for more than 10 Seconds before it disappeared and we could not find its red blinking light neither the purple arc light any more.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

My father and I saw it as it traveled over our house (and shook it quite violently).  It had a very low-pitched roar, rather dissimalar than a helicopter's - it was more like the noise you would hear from a quake, and for its size it was moving at an alarmingly low velocity and altitude. I have no idea what this was, but I can vouch for its existence.

I was seated on the right side of the plane in the exit row over the wing. As the plane made its' final approach, the sun was setting in the western sky, and it seemed we were in a low level flight path (say 6,000-10,000') for a period of 10 or 15 minutes (perhaps a holding plan).  During this time, I observed what appeared to be a glass ball only 100-150 ft off the right side of the plane.  The object appeared to be maybe 8' in diameter.  The sunset was shining on the object and was somewhat reflected in the object, such that the round shape of the object was clearly identified. The object was moving in the same direction as the plane, but just slightly slower and slightly lower in elevations such that I initially saw the object ahead of the plane, then watched as the plane slowly passed the object.  I witnessed the object be hidden by the wing as the plane passed, then appeared again behind the wing.  I continued to observe the object until i could no longer see the object from the window as the plane continued to pull ahead.  After witnessing the object, i stood up to see if anyone else in the plane was glued to the window, pointed, talking about it,etc.  I didn't see anybody else that appeared to have seen the object.  The plane landed.  On the way off the plane, I stopped at the door and asked the flight attendants if I could speak with the pilots (cockpit door closed), but was told no.  I asked if they had seen anything and they stated not. I waited in the terminal for the pilots, but they never appeared from the plane/gate.  Have others seemed similar objects.

I have not said anything publicly for almost 40 years but with the wealth of information you have I thought it might prove useful, perhaps to corroborate some other sightings. I am sorry I cannot give you a date. It has been too long. The way it acted might prove useful. I filled in a date on the form so it would go through but it was 1969 to 1971 in Beaumont, Texas.  It was Summer and in the afternoon, I think it was a Sunday but I am not sure. It was clear and sunny. I was on interstate 10 heading west, which is actually south on this section of the highway in Beaumont. The sighting was to my right or towards the west. This is what occurred. 	I saw a shiny object darting in the sky. It was so unique I pulled onto the side of the road as the road rose over Highway 90. To my left was Gateway Shopping center. I pulled up behind two or three other cars that had also pulled over to watch. Another car pulled over behind me. We all got out and stood watching. The object flew between points very rapidly (I mean almost instantly) and then hovered. It flew in a square or rectangular pattern moving out Highway 90 toward Houston. It overlapped itself and worked farther and farther away. If I had to guess, I would say it was coming back about half way each time it made the return leg on my left. Anyway, it moved much farther away on my right than it returned on my left. My first thought was that it was mapping or surveying. It flew this pattern until it simply was too far away to see anymore. It took a long time. It is hard to say because I did not time it but it must have been ten or twenty minutes before it was too far away to see. 	It stopped at each corner for only ten or fifteen seconds, as it flew the grid centered over Highway 90, so each square took one minute or less. It flew 15 or twenty of these that were visible after I stopped. It was impossible to tell how high, how far away or how large it was. There was absolutely no scale to work with. 	It was not like a light. It was the sun reflecting off something but I cannot say what shape it was. I doubt that it was long unless pointing away from me. The light was concentrated instead of spread out. 	We watched together without speaking, at least not from one group to the other, and when it was over, we shrugged at each other, got in our cars and drove away. I hope this is useful. Once you have seen one, you wonder why everyone tries so hard to deny them. We still do not have anything that can do what this craft did and it did not seem to be a threat. 	You asked for info on me. I am 54, owned a supply company for over twenty years and I am now a full time college student. I am an Environmental Science major at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas and I think I was a student at Lamar when this sighting occurred (Either that or a senior in high school). I have a fairly high IQ and no reason to fake this. There is nothing to gain from this. 	It would be nice to find out if others reported something similar. I have never seen or heard of anything similar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-04-27T00:00:00,30.068837269372693,-94.17593579335794

It was snowing steadily.  I was looking for a place to park and sleep as the next day I wanted to track deer in the new fallen snow.  There were no other tracks in the snow, so I am sure I was the only person to witness this event. As I passed along the edge of the lake (about 100 yards from the road, right on the shore of the lake), I saw a very bright white light in the upper branches of a tree (maybe 25-30 feet off the ground) across the field.  The trees, of course, were bare at that time of year, so I could plainly see the branches both in front of and behind whatever this thing was due to the light.  I first thought that it must be a broken power line due to the heavy snow, but I couldn’t see any power line.  It wasn’t moving at all, just flashing in the same position in the tree.  I only saw a brilliant white light flashing intensely, very similar to a 4th of July sparkler.  I didn’t see any flame or sign of fire, which was strange as it seemed to be lodged in the tree branches somehow.  I would say the whole ‘thing’ was about the size of a basketball or slightly larger. I drove down the road and managed to turn around.  I came back and stopped the car (same position as before) to watch the light.  Finally, after about 10 minutes, I decided to investigate.  I opened the car door, felt the cold air, and quickly reconsidered.  I was either too lazy or scared to hike over the snowy field to get a better look.  I regret that to this day, because later I found out there was no power line along the side of the lake.  I didn't return the next day to investigate either...

This sighting occured on the east side of Columbus while driving at approx. 3:15pm on Nov 29 2005. I was driving in an area where I had driven on numerous occasions. I was driving on the outerbelt around Columbus (I-270) traveling north. I was comming up to the overpass crossing over I-70 which runs east and west through Columbus. Being the outerbelt is generally speaking circular my perspective of the object was in continual change while I was moving. I looked east along I-70 and noticed a stationary object approx. 1/4 mile from the overpass. It was sitting just above the tree line slightly to the north of I-70. I at first thought that I was looking at a very large waving banner that was attached to something. I had never seen this in that location before. It was very promonent. I quickly realized that I was looking at a solid object that had a rippling appearance moving along its surface, moving from west to east and going around it. The object was sitting parallel to I-70 maybe 50 feet above the trees. It had the appareance of being a long pipe parallel to the ground, being somewhat longer than a tractor trailer rig and maybe 5 feet tall. I slowed down to look at it but couldn't pull over and stop on the overpass because I had traffic comming up on my rear. This is the point where the situation gets really interesting because just beyond the the I-70 overpass is an underpass for a road that parallels I-70 just to its north and as I approach this underpass I notice a dark blue and/or black helicopter with no markings circling the overpass. I assume that the chopper can see the object but looking straight east now I can no longer see it. From this perspective I would now be looking at it's west end. I at this point look into my rear view mirror and see a dark blue sedan of matching color right behind me. It appeared to be a current model unmarked Chevy Impala that had a beacon on top.(the beacon wasn't on and may have been some type of detection equipment for all I know) The beacon and it's lenses and the windows of the car matched the color of the car so it's interior could't be seen. As I passed under the road crossing over I-270 the sedan pulled over and stopped under the underpass that the helicopter was circling. I must comment about the synchronistic aspects of this happening. This was my third non disk shaped close UFO encounter but the only one I have reported.(the other two encounters were actually closer as I was right under them) I have had four other encounters with the black helicopters but had nothing to do with UFO's. I appeared to be the focus of their attention. At the time of this happening I was scheduled to go to the UFO conference three days later in Virginia beach at the A.R.E.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

This sighting occurred in December of 2005. We did not report as we are unsure of what happens with these reports. Before this sighting we have noticed alot of strange UFO activity in our rural location such as weird lights in the sky, unknown sounds in and on top of house such as ""something"" running arcross roof late at night or very early in the morning hours. Also, a few months before this sighting we observed five to six ""helicopters"" with very low humming engines and air to ground spotlights flying around the area as searching in a grid formation.  We(husband, wife and child) went outside to the rear of our home to gather the trash cans and wheel them out front to the curb. About mid-way I(husband) happened to look up and saw a huge ""ship"" and proclaimed "" What the !@#! is that?"" at which time my wife and son also looked up and observed the object. It was moving from South to North VERY slowly and was less than 150 feet in the air or right above our tree tops. The object was sort of rectangluar in shape but not quite. The rear of the object was ""glowing"" an yellow orange color and making a low humming sound. In the center of the object was looked like a large dome that hung below the object and pulsated the same yellow orange color. As we only saw the underbelly of the object we also noticed many what seemed to be ""tubes"", my wife said it looked to her more like a flying generator. To say the least, we all three were very shocked and with me being a ufo buff got quite excited! Since this encounter we have heard that same ""humming sound"" on other occassions that seem to come from right above our home. We also hear very strange sounds that come from the woods around our home quite frequently and still see strange activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

As the traffic was heavy it took us about 90 seconds to travel the distance between the two roads. Initially it had a diamond like polygon shape and I thought it was a cloud.  My son said it was moving too quickly to be a cloud, but not quickly enough to be a plane.  It was an extremely bright light.  As it rose vertically, the leading edge lost its rectangular shape and became rounded.  It was trailing a bright jet trail.  Then it turned to the south (left) and became sickle-shaped, still trailing a jet trail.

The road is Old Springville Road in Birmingham, Alabama, in a part of town called Clay, in Jefferson County.  We were about driving down Old springville road, and were about to pass a townhome community named Sommersby. When turning the curve right in front of Sommersby my wife ectstatically yelled, ""Look, Look right there.""  What we both saw was very surreal and chilling.  Off in the distance some 100 yards away, and about 50 ft above this particular grouping of town homes a multileveled, disc-like, object hovered.  It had rectangular lights solidly lit around the perimeter of the disc. It was saucer shaped, and appeared to have four banded levels.  I immediately drove into the neighboorhood to get a closer look, but upon doing this the craft must have been aware and either manuvered away to fast to observe, or cloaked itself.  The real scary thing about this event is that we have seen a disc hovering above this same group of houses before several months ago. It was a nearly identical disc.  I am afraid for the people of this neighborhood, and can only wander have they seen this too being in such closer proximity than myself on the road?

Then, after i saw the initial light, a second just as bright light was following maybe 10 kilometers away from the first...Moving at the same speed! I ran inside to get the camera, and by that time the two lights which were traveling North to South had passed. Everyone I was with were in shock, and we have no idea what to think about this. Stars would not be flying so close to each other at the same speed and the chances of seeing 2 shooting stars following each other could be hardly possible.

There were 2 bright lights traveling across the sky from west northwest to the east southeast. They were not flashing. They did not have any color like an aircraft light. These were single lights. The distance apart was approximately 3 inches at an arms length. They did not change direction nor did the space between them change from what I could see. They were traveling much faster then any aircraft that I have ever seen and the lights were much brighter. The total time they were in my view until out of view was no more then 90 seconds. As they passed overhead I did not here any engine noise as from an aircraft. I told my son that it is probably the ISS or possibly the shuttle but today I looked up their orbit at the time and they were nowhere near the west coast of California last night.

The lights remained the exact same distance from each other.  After approximately 2 minutes, the lights faded out into the sky.  The lights were moving from the northwest to the southeast.

We were all instantly enthralled with the object beacuse it had virtually no form, it was glowing, it was silent, it would stop in mid flight (float would be more like it), and then it would change direction and go in reverse. After about twenty seconds of watching it, the thing started dropping a few burning embers that would burn out before hitting the ground or trees. That was when it started getting really weirs. We thought whatever it was was going to crash but it keep hovering over head, moving very slowly. It continued to do so fo almost another minute and a half and then it started to drop quite a lot of burning embers to the ground (the object itself did not look like it was on fire at all) nad then it just disappeared.

These planes always appear as two white winglights having an apparent separation of a couple of millimeters at arm's length, with red and/or green FAA flashers.  Last week at approximately 2300 on 05 October, my two teenage cousins and I saw a triangle shaped airplane flying VERY LOW in the sky. It was HUGE, having an apparent size of about a half-dollar or full silver dollar held at arms length. I immediately thought it was a civilian heavy aircraft in serious trouble, but it never gave signs of distress, so we waved, because we were sure the pilot should have been able to see us! It had a strange light pattern, three solid, bright white lights in a nearly equilateral triangle pattern, apparently two wingtip lights and a nose light, with a square formation of four dimmer fuselage lights immediatley behind the nose light in a perfect square box pattern. It also had one red and one green light, and at least one of those was flashing. It was definitely a jet aircraft because we could hear the quiet rumble of jet engines, but they seemed much quieter than they should have been for an airplane that sheer size and low altitude. Despite the size, I couldn't tell anything about the fuselage shape because there was no moon, and the fuselage lights didn't seem to reflect off of the plane at all (black paint?). It appeared in the north and flew approximately northeast to southwest slowly and steadily with no deviations in course and no contrail. We thought it was a stealth bomber. It was definitely an airplane of some kind, A HUGE airplane. My cousins seemed to think it was the neatest thing they'd seen in a while up in the country, and I agree!

This object had no tail or contrail and was moving way to quickly to be an aircraft in a tower controlled airspace (TCA). I saw none of the red or green lights associated with conventional aircraft either. The object appeared to fly over the interstate then pitched up a bit before it went completely dark. I raced home and checked the Heavens-above website for any satellite or ISS overflights of the area at that time. I could find nothing flying over Omaha for that time period. I was able to see the ISS flying overhead at about 7:40pm on Saturday night October 6th. It was not anywhere near as bright nor was it moving as fast as the object I had seen the night before.

As the monument was closed, and gated at that hour of the night, we drove about a mile down the highway, and pulled off, and down through a series of small hills, to a riverbank, to car-camp until the morning.  We had been at rest for perhaps half-an-hour, or so, when we noticed bright white lights moving across the southern horizon.  We sat on the tail-gate of the truck, and watched as these lights seemed to almost bounce around the horizon, from east to west, and back at a rate of speed that was almost unbelieveable.  The lights would go from sitting still to extreem speed, and then come to a complete halt, just as quick.  After watching these lights for fifteen or twenty minutes, my friend went to sleep, and I was left sitting up watching.  Shortly, thereafter, I looked directly above us, and saw what appeared to be a triangle-three points of light, rotating clockwise, and surrounding it a hexagon-eights points of light moving counter-clockwise.  To say the least I was spooked, and only watched these lights for a moment.  The lights were not extremely bright, but had the brightness similar of stars.  Had it not been for the motion and covering up of other starlight (shadow of the shapes) I might have put it off to actually be a constellation.  I don't have a clue as to what we saw (man-made, or otherwise) but am sure that what I did see was real.  Several months later, back at home in Georgia, my friend and I saw a program that had footage of similar horizon lights.  Both of us got a cold chill upon seeing the footage, and we both exclaimed loudly that that was what we had seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Having read much UFO material myself I was convinced that this object was a craft of some kind, since it followed classic descriptions of previous witness accounts from around the world. However I suppose at this point we were not totally convinced.  After about 4-5 mins we saw an unmarked helicopter flying overhead, in what looked like an interception path to the object! My friend thought he saw police markings, but I didn't notice any. Just as the helicopter got to within about 200 yards of the object it shot off at a steep angle eastwards at an amazing speed that left a brief streak of light, almost as if it had turned into the light itself! At this the helicopter turned round and headed back inland.  We were all sober and not under the influence of any drugs. I felt Privileged to witness such an event, but also fairly frightened.

No real shape we could see.  Just a huge ball of light.  It crossed the highway and I watched it go into a field near a house which had on a yard light high on a pole.  It was too dark to see what was in the field around the house but when the light passed the house and went over the field it split into two lights which seemed to dance over the field.  I asked my husband to pull over so I could continue to watch but he said there was no place to pull over and to stop would not be safe (because of possible other cars coming up behind us).

On this day in 1998 I awoke with racing thoughts, mostly concerning the condition of earth and Man's need for change, as these thoughts continued i became very aggitated and filled with nervous energy. To counter-act this energy i felt compelled even urged to go for a walk. I feel it is important to mention that i am well educated family person and,untill this day, had always been of very sound mind. As I made my way through my rural suburban nieghborhood, these thoughts moved on to how a man might need to find a means for living outside the human body, cryogenics, etc.. Then as if suddenly I had an image of a large park that was five miles from my home and got an overwhelming urge/belief that if I were to go there I would be visited by extra terrestrial beings. By this time I was so worked-up, I felt that i would definately need to walk there, just to have good nerves and a level head. So I began the long walk, this is when things took a full 360. Not even a block from my neighborhood I began to feel as though I were being followed, I looked over my shoulder to notice a black suv about 200ft behind me moving slowly. I immediately felt an overwhelming to evade this vehicle, so I then ran through the yards of the houses nearest to me to get to the next street over, and there i found another black suv. This time I made sure to look at the occupants and they were two men dressed in black siuts both wearing sunglasses.  At this point I have become so nervous that I decide to change course to a different park where I knew I would find some familliar faces, taking only routs through woods and yards so as to avoid being followed by the vehicles. Once I arrived at the park I began to describe the vehicles and the men to my friends; and as the last words came out, yet another suv fitting the description pulled into the park. My four or five friends then believed what I had told them, and one friend and I decided to go to a nearby payphone to call another friend to make sense of the situation. Now we took the direct rout through the trees knowing that the suv in the park could'nt follow us there qiuckly. As we emerged from the trees we began to run across the road to the phone, when seemingly out of nowhere, another black tinted suv with two men in suits had to come to a screaching and swerving stop to avoid hitting us. We both had believed the road to be clear and were startled. So we began waving our arms and yelling at the driver of the truck, who was now only a few feet from us, yet he and the passenger coldy looked forward and drove away as if we were'nt even there. for the next few hours my friend and I went from street to street attempting to evade the black suvs and sedans, who were everywhere we went. My friend eventualy decided I was in some kind of trouble and left me to deal with it on my own, even though I was clearly very distressed. I stayed in the woods for a while fighting the urge I had to make my way to the park I had orriginally set out for, for fear of these men in black. Then, around 1700, I decided to attempt the journey again. At this poit I was very exhausted, so much so, that passing car's exhaust seemed to be stealing my breath. There were no more black vehicles, yet I was now fighting the exhaustion. As I made my way up a paarticularly steep hill, I smelled the fresh air that sprinklers give off in a small subdivision I was passing and decided to head toward the good air instead of the park. I was found by a family friend about 1830 completely confused and exhausted, who returned me home. I needed more than a week of bedrest and relaxation to even begin to feel normal again. It is my belief that these men in black coerced me mentally so as to make sure I did not get to that park that day. This is the second day of my life that i have spoken of this incident.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

Hello, I am reporting this incident after seeing your site on a national geographic television show on 5/22/2006.   While driving from our home 45 miles away; we were going to visit my inlaws for the Christmas holiday.  The in-laws live approximately 15 miles out of town; which is a very rural area of Hempstead county just outside the town of Hope, AR.  The local small airport and tower is also North and West of Hope, AR, but on a seperate State road #278.  The road I was traveling on was highway # 73; which is approximately 3 to 5 miles West of 278.  To get to the airport one must travel US 278 for about 5 miles from the city limits of Hope, AR.  I was approx 5 miles on US 73 heading NW when I told my wife to look at that plane with his landing lights on.  He sure is low to the ground and even though the airport was only approx 2 to 3 miles due east he was too low to land at any of the 3 runways there.  I told her to pull over and back up because we were on a straight stretch that was approx 1/2 mile long, I said it looks like he is trying to land on the road. As we pulled over the light changed directions from due west and turned toward us just above several houses and 50 to 75 ft oak trees.  I told her to put it into reverse and back up as fast as possible.  Just as she got into reverse, the light was aimed toward us but not upon our vehicle.  It appeared to hover just above the farm and chicken houses and oak trees that are adjacent to US 73.  I rolled down my window to listen and get a better look, had my wife shut off the engine.  It was a clear bright night, crisp cold air, no visible clouds in the sky and stars were plentyful.  I got out and looked at the object hoovering maybe 1/4 mile from us, only a front white light on, but the shape was unmistakenably triangle.  I could not hear any noise coming from the object, only the sound of chicken houses and the occassional dog barking.  With the crisp cold air I thought any sound from the craft would be easy to hear and travel far, but no one in the houses came out to look at the object,nor did the poultry appear scared.  After maybe 1 1/2 minutes to 2 minutes the object turned the light off, turned due West and took off very slowly and then just sped up so fast it was gone.  The object turned on its axis without forward movement, engine sound or any visible jet blast or thrust  from what I called the rear of the craft after the point turned due west.  I have seen 4 other craftin my past and present, but none of them gave me the close up view like the triangle vehicle did.  I did look ((initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2006-07-16T00:00:00,33.6383,-93.8298

It seemed to be at a very high altitude, much higher than any of the whispy clouds in the sky that day and this thing was moving FAST.  It made no sound, which I thought was odd, since I live out in the country and you can always hear planes flying overhead, and it left no trail.   I'd say it was probably a metallic-silver in color, and may have had a haze around it, but it was hard to tell if it was emitting its own light or if it was reflecting the light from the sun.  I watched it travel all the way across the sky that was visible to me, until it went behind a cloud and the trees were in the way to see it any longer.  Immediately after I lost sight if the object, a large jet flying at a very low altitude went past, traveling almost the same course, only going south/south-east.  The oddest thing about the whole experience it that when I was 10, I saw an almost identical object in Wisconsin Dells, only about 8 miles away from this sighting.  That objest was much lower in the sky, but it was the same sphereical shape, and that one was definately a dark silver color, and it was hovering in one spot before completely disappearing.

We both noticed them at the same time and tried to figure out what they could be.  We named every possible flying object and discounted every single thing that it could have been. We were facing south, and they were to the west of us flying south. They were at a distance of about 150 to 200 yards away. They slowed down and then hovered in one area for a few seconds then turned and faced west and started to fly west.  But when they turned, the triangular shaped objects became ""sliver like"" thin, except the ball shaped object, and continued on.   About the time when they were almost out of our view, we were surprised to see another strange triangular shaped object with something hanging from it, just beneath it.  We thought it might have been an ""ultralight"" singleman plane with someone sitting in the seat below the wing, but quickly dismissed due to the fact that it was beginning to become dark outside, and the fact that small air crafts like ""ultralights"" are not allowed in the city.  And we had just had a light rain storm in some areas of the city with lightning reported in other areas with no rain. Near my house the sky was green with no rain or lightning.

Leaving the Gere Public Library at 8:35 pm, I saw what seemed at first to be a brilliant orange star in the lower eastern sky.  At that time, only the moon and a few of the brightest stars were visible (the moon was in the western sky opposite from this anomalous light). What caught my eye at first was the unusual orange tint, and as I trained my eyes on it, I saw it was moving slowly westward in my general direction. I wondered whether it could be a plane on a landing approach, but there was no noise and instead of having blinking navigational lights, the light intensity fluctuated (growing gradually brighter and then gradually dimmer every second or two). I continued to watch this pulsating orange light for about a minute, then it suddenly dimmed and disappeared completely. That struck me as very odd, since the sky was without a cloud that evening. I searched that area of the sky for another couple of minutes but the object didn't re-appear. Several other people were nearby, but apparently I was the only one there who noticed this anomolous light. As the light periodically brightened, it would become several times brighter than any star or planet in the sky at that time, including Sirius and Venus, which were also visible during this sighting.  I am a research scientist and medical writer (50 years of age).  I've been skeptical of UFOs most of my life.

At least one of the 4 lights was set slightly back from the others, making the triangle off just a tad. The lights were at the approximate height that any helicopter, or airplane getting ready to land or having just taken off would fly. There was absolutely no sound with the lights.  I walked back into my apartment to get my camera, thinking how odd that was. When I got back out, I almost did not expect the lights to still be there, but they were. It appeared as though the lights were moving very very slowly, because they had hardly moved at all. I attempted to take a picture, but was unable to get a good result.  At the same time I was trying to get the picture, two other people were walking to their car, and also saw the lights. Upon staring harder at the lights, it seemed as though they were moving very slowly in a Southeasterly direction. By this time, the 4 lights had formed a uniformed triangular shape.  As I watched, the furthest westerly light started blinking, and after a few seconds, blinked out. Then, the next light began blinking and also blinked out. Within seconds, the third light also began blinking, and then blinked out. By this time, the last remaining light had switched directions, and was now moving northeast.  As I watched the remaining light, there would be times that it would flash very brightly, and I caught a glimpse of a shape of something, but before I could define it, the light would grow dim again. It almost seemed, as if it were a rounded shape, like the nose of an airplane, but much larger. As I watched, the singular remaining light continued to move to the Northeast, and then it just stopped. It would still continue to blink brighter, allowing me to briefly make out the shape of something, but then it would grow dim again.  Within, 18 minutes of my first seeing the lights, the fourth and final light then blinked out. As I walked back into my apartment, I suddenly got chills, as if I had just seen or experienced something extremely important.  In the past, I have seen other strange sightings, including something similar a few months where there were three lights also in a loose triangular pattern.

And immediately my friend says “that’s a plane man” and I automatically agreed with him thinking it has to be… no way you know? As we got about half way down the road we noticed it hasn’t moved at all, so the next thing my friend says is that it has to be power line stand with lights or something and my reaction was were about to find out we are coming up on it now, we pass the power lines on the road which has no lights at all on it and then we pass about 300 feet of tall trees blocking the view and as we pulled up next to this craft immediately three other lights were now visible one of which was a blinking red light. It was a big black triangular object hovering completely stationary at least as long as 2 city buses together. It was only about 50 to 100 ft. over the trees, no sound completely silent no shine what so ever. I could see the angles of the craft through the light and could tell it was a three dimensional triangle about as tall as one story of a house. As soon as we stopped the car after taking a right on page rd. the craft started to move slowly away as if it had seen that we figured out what it was or as if there was some sort of intelligence looking back at us just steady slow cruising seemed to gain altitude and in a matter of seconds was totally gone, the lights we had seen two miles away had disappeared in a few seconds.

I was just getting off my computer from chatting with my boyfriend and decided to step out on my balcony for a cigarette. I was looking along the horizon to the west and up into the sky at the stars and noticed an object that I had never seen there before. It was just over the tree line. I knew at once that it was either a plane or something else since it was too bright to be a star or a planet. It was spherical, bright, and appeared to have a halo or an aura around it. I kept watching it to see if it would turn towards the airport to land, but it didn't. For a good three minutes it remained stationary in the sky. Then all of a sudden it dropped in altitude and picked back up to the exact place where it was when I first saw it. It then zipped toward the north and disappeared. In the place where it disappeared, there seemed to have been a hole ripped in the clouds. I knew at this time that it must have been something not of this world, so I went inside to get my blanket and wrap up on the balcony. About five minutes passed with me sitting on the balcony watching the sky for another or the same object. Suddenly one appeared on the same place the fist one had. It had the same characteristics as the first. This craft zipped to the north and the south with ease and agility. Then it returned to the same place where it first appeared, and the light that it was emitting slowly faded. I have seen a few UFOs before, but never anything of this magnitude. My father had once described the same phenomenon to me, except the craft was much closer to him. There was the same agility and the same aura to the object. He also reported that the craft shot up into the air and that there was a hole in the clouds from where it passed through.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,28.991721126760567,-80.99088169014085

The object was not spherical because the ring of lights would combine into one bright light, implying that it was disc-shaped.  A red light also flashed when the ring of lights became one extremely bright light.  The ring of lights and the bright light were the same color as the stars, and even brighter. 	The object hovered back and forth, growing as it approached us.  It zoomed out and in away from us, and when we walked close to the area under where it was hovering, it became larger and chased us, as the red light appeared. 	As we got closer, we could hear the buzzing noise.  It wasn’t a constant buzzing, but had crescendos and diminuendos.

Whenever I take that route I look over at Stonehenge because it is a lovely sight.  While looking at the view, a distinct downward puff of smoke developed over stonehenge, almost like it had been forced out of an exhaust pipe. Being an ex military man, I asked myself 'what the heck is the army firing anti-aircraft shells over a public area for?'. This thought occured to me as the Salisbury plains are a major military training area.  As I continued to watch a very faint outline of an egg-shaped vehicle appeared to hover above Stonehenge, emitting a faint blue-grey haze around it.  I am aware that clouds or smoke change shape as the wind or air currents affect it, but this shape remained constant and firm along its outer edges. Very faint signs of round windows or 'port-holes' appeared two thirds the way up the vehicle.  To be honest, it appeared and then disappeared so quickly that only something that could cloak itself could do what it did. At no point in time did it make any attempt to move away or accelerate.  I am a stable man, not prone to hype or hysteria and my military background has given me a keen eye for the hidden or unusual.

I was relaxing in my friend's backyard while looking at orions belt and other obvious formations as Houston is too bright to see very much else. Suddenly I noticed something moving in the middle of where I was looking. It was not obvious at all as it was not emitting any light at all. The only way I was able to see it was due to the fact that the moon was pretty bright that night and the shadow underneath this object provided just enough contrast to see it. It was travelling east to west and held a steady speed comparable to a helicopter. It looked either relatively close (like a helicopter) or very huge. Really, it seemed both big and close. It is hard to tell with no light coming from it though. Either way it would have been close enough to hear if it was a helicopter or airplane or anything with an engine. The shape was large and seemed round. It was absolutely silent and gave me a very creepy feeling. It was dare I say it...camoflauged against the night's sky. I looked away a few times to make sure it wasn't a spot on my eye or something in my head and found it everytime I came back to it. I called my friend over after I could make some words out. He didn't get up in time and it was hard to make out if you weren't watching it the whole time. I then lost it behind an unavoidable tree blocking our view. I never saw it come out the other side either. If I had to make a guess as to it's path it seemed close enough and travelling in the right direction  to be generally following or flying over the bayou. Which would be a very discrete path to take for any object trying to hide. It left me shaken really as I knew something was flying low and big and silent and dark as the sky. It was pure luck I was practically looking at it as it crossed my eye while watching stars. I am not sure as to when this day was exactly as I forgot to post here. But it was last year before it got really cold. Maybe October instead of Sept.

Today I witnessed a flying object that I definitely could not identify, it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I am a 24 year old man, healthy, with perfect eyesight, and no history of mental illness of any type. I am not prone to exaggerations or having an overactive imagination. I served in the U.S. Army a few years back, and I do not drink or do any type of drugs, nor do I take any kind of medication. What follows is a detailed description of the object I saw this afternoon while sitting by the pool with my fiance. She did not see the object because her view was obstructed by some small shade trees surrounding the pool, also her eyesight is not that great, and by the time I told her what I was seeing, the object was seconds away from disappearing from sight. The object seemed to be flying at an extremely high altitude, making it appear extremely small and making it very difficult to discern it's actual shape and size. From my position on the ground it was like watching a tiny sugar ant! It appeared to be dark in color, probably black. The object appeared to be opaque, and it did not seem to reflect the sunlight or emanate any light of its own either. It moved in and out of the few clouds that were in the sky mostly at a constant speed, although it did seem to speed up somewhat as it left from view. The really odd thing is that it did not disappear from sight into the clouds, but rather just seemed to become invisible into a clear blue sky. There was very little cloud cover at the time, but I did see what appeared to be a very faint trail of vapor or exhaust trailing behind it. It flew in a very odd flight path that I've never seen with airplanes, helicopters or birds. First it seemed to make a circular pattern, then a figure eight, followed by a straight line from left to right, and then back from right to left, it again made one or two circles, one more figure eight, and another circle, before simply disappearing into a cloudless patch of blue sky. Another thing that struck me as odd, and this my fiance did witness first hand too, is that there were several large black birds that flew above us just a short while before the object first came into view. They were flying towards us, in the opposite direction of where I saw the object. At first several of them were flying pretty high up, but they were still very clearly recognizable as birds. This is why I know for certain that the object I saw afterwards could not have been a bird, for one thing it was flying at an altitude that was much higher than any of the birds, who at one point were flying about as high as any birds I've ever seen before, although later they flew above us again but at a much lower altitude. Also the flight path & speed of the object was so completely different from  birds or any known ai! rcraft, at least in my experience.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,28.02172891566265,-82.12932289156626

My thought then was that it would streak across the sky to the north and that would  be it. But, instead as I was driving I didn't see it streak and instead looked back to the left and saw that this object seemed to slow down to a really slow speed, and as it was night time I couldn't get a good feel for what altitude that it was at. As I've said I was driving and on my way home which is outside of the town limits towards the Taos Pueblo. I slowed down considerably due to me trying to keep this object in my eyesight. At this time I was able to get a good look at it and could see that it was what appeared to be a segmented string of objects which was the center mass and around and leading this, were what appeared to be smaller disk shaped lights which were space evenly around in a ""v"" shaped formation. These where what I thought at first to be sparks or flares, but as mentioned, since it had ""slowed"" down and I also had been able to travel the half mile down the road at a 15mph speed or so, and had left the town area where the overhead lights diminished the clarity of the night sky, the details stood out quite a bit. I by now had pulled over on the side of the road and could see that this object was moving by now with faster speed and seemed to be ""banking"" directly towards an opening between the Taos Mountain/Wheeler peak area and the El Salto peaks area. The object moved in a smooth, almost liquid motion with all of it's ""satellites"" moving in unision, and when it approached the opening between these two landmasses, it sort of ""flowed"" through the opening, with again, a smooth banking motion. At that point, I could see that on the top of this object were what looked to be a series of flashing lights running from front to back, twinkling in series and at the ""end"" of it were three flashing li! ghts, in a triangle shape.

I was driving east on I-84 through Waterbury, CT and in my left peripheral vision I noticed a moving light.  I looked over and it appeared to be a shooting star.  It was actually kind of startling, as it did not burn out and looked like it was coming at me.  Then, it looked like it blew up, similar to the ending of a firework.  It was very brilliant, but startling.  I didn't think much of it and just settled on the fact that I was tired, had a couple drinks, and it was probably just a firework.  I told some people and they thought I was crazy.  Recently I was looking up the UFO event at the Chicago airport.  I found this site and started looking through some of the reports and noticed someone else had seen the fireball at the same time and date.

The two light ""tails"" seemed to be flying together, 2,000 - 3,000 ft. above the groud.  I live in an area where jet traffic is rare, and these two light trails acted unlike anything I've seen or imagined.  The light trails were moving west, over Lake Michigan.  At that time of day, in this small town, I heard no sound associated with these lights, which stretched for over one hundred feet.  I generally ruled out meteors, because they appeared to be too close to earth, and also appeared to be in formation.  Obviously, aircraft are on this path toward O'Hare hundreds of times per day, but these lights were WAY to close to the ground to be on approach, and there were no flashing lights.  In fact, I saw no ""craft"", but just the tails, which were very bright and consistant lights.  The tails did not spread out, or get weaker as they moved across the the sky, like I would expect a meteor to do, but rather they extended for a distance, then just quit shining.  Again, I have been on over 1,000 flights, and enjoy aviation and astronomy, and I've never seen anything that created a tail of light like this.  The brightness of the light, the speed at which they moved, and the relative closeness to the ground, made me believe that I was seeing something different than I've ever seen before.

It was around 9:00 pm and we had just finished having dinner on the balcony of our 15th floor condo.  My husband took our two kids (ages 9 & 14) to walk on the beach.  I remained on the balcony, speaking to my mother on the telephone.  I sat on the balcony looking directly out at the ocean and sky.  It was dark, but the surface of the water and the sky were very discernable.  It was easy to make out where one ended and the other began.  As I looked out, I noticed a large, round. orange-yellow glowing object appear in the sky.  Over the next few minutes, four others just like it also appeared.  The objects would glow and disappear on and off for several minutes to follow.  Three other objects, exactly the same size and shape as the original five, appeared off to the right in a triangle pattern shortly after.  In a span of approximately thirty minutes, several objects appeared in the sky and never moved.  The only change in their appearance or position was that they glowed on and off at different intervals.  As this was happening, I told my mother that I thought I was seeing UFOs.  She laughed until I told her that I was absolutely serious.  At that time my husband and kids came rushing back into the condo asking if I had seen the strange light in the sky.  We watched the sky for many hours that night, and every night for the remainder of our vacation.  We saw nothing more of the strange lights.  Until the night of July 21st, I absolutely did NOT believe in UFOs.  I thought anyone who claimed to believe in such things was a nut.  I still don’t believe that there are little green men flying around our atmosphere, but I do know that my family and I saw something that cannot be explained by anything we have ever seen before.  They were not planes – they never moved.  They were not helicopters -- they were much larger and perfectly round.  They were not fireworks.  They glowed on and off in the sky and then vanished.  Two other strange events happened in connection with our sighting.  First, when we awoke the next morning, we immediately searched the news stations for reports of the strange light, because we were certain that someone else HAD to have seen what we saw.  We could find nothing on television, so I checked the Internet.  On The Drudge Report there was a story about a UFO sighting in England – with pictures.  The photos were exactly what we had seen several hours later in Panama City, FL.  After I had read all of the articles that I could find regarding the strange event in England, I came upon this site and one other where I could post information regarding our sighting.  I filled out the required information and uploaded my account.  I was aware that there could be some lapse between the time that I posted our information and the time that it appeared on the sites, but my postings never made either of the sites.

We were on a flat stretch that is called the hop stretch and at that angle you could see up the entrance of the Cowiche cannon. We saw an oscillating greenish/blue light and a reflective look as if the lights where reflecting off of something shiny with a hit of reddish underneath it.  The object was about a mile up the road from us moving toward the mouth of the cannon hovering just above the trees.  As we got closer the object looked disk or roundish in shape and was moving very slowly into the cannon and then ascended up to just about the ridge sides of the cannon and continued very slowly as to be traversing the cannon and we stopped and watched it for about 12-20 minutes as it slowly continued up the cannon with its lights oscillating and disappeared from sight.

Time for this was supposed to be around 9:00 PM CST. I saw this light moving in the sky and then it made a very sharp right turn and headed straight over the house. I’d like to know if any air traffic controller at Lebanon’s airport noticed this anomaly. Sounds astounding huh?  But I swear on mom and dad’s grave that what I saw was very real. Note: I drew in 2 dimension what this all looked like and it is still in my journal. It was of a teardrop shape with the lights (bluish in color) along the lower body panel and were all the way around it. From the point where the light was moving from my left to right was maybe a distance of around 2 miles away from me. When that light turned at the very sharp right angle it came over my home as silent as if it had no engines at all but took less than 10 seconds to reach my home.  No sound at all!!

This light flashed at least 40 to 50 times and appeared almost random in the location it appeared in the eastern sky.  The duration of the time in between flashes also appeared random.  But from one blink to the next, which would have been only a few seconds, many, many miles would have been traversed. The path of the flashes was not at all straight – and it could not have been an airplane.  About 5 minutes after the lights stopped, a military jet flew overhead at relatively low altitude.

I could tell it was spherical by the lights on either side of the central light. After about five minutes it drifted slowly south and became a tiny star like dot as it moved. During the encounter i stood up and stared, blinked ect so as i knew i wasn't imagining. The central light also moved from side to side creating an eerie sensation.  I believe that potentially i was being observed emotionally as i had aroused from a dream several minutes earlier and had been highly emotional and had cried. After this i looked out the window and there was the ufo. So perhaps they were formulating thoughts and actions however that would seem pathetic and ridiculous.

It was a very warm and humid night with a very slight haze, no moon visible, but the brighter stars were visible. I could see the Big Dipper, so the slight haze wasn't much of a factor. Suddenly from the Northwest a very bright white light appeared in the sky. At first I thought it was an approaching ""Flight for Life"" helicopter. As the light passed over, at about the altitude you would see the copters fly, but there was absolutely no noise. There were no usual blinking red lights.

Group always stayed in formation parallel with the ship, about 100 to 125 feet above the sea, moving out to where they could be just barely seen, then come back to within 100 to 150 yards of the ship.  They did this three times, then came within 25 to 30 yards of the ship on an angle, and went back off the stern.  At first I thought they could be sea gulls with the light of the ship reflecting off of them, but when they came close and went off the stern, I could see that they were not birds, but dull lighted globes, or spheres.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

My friend and I were near the famous lighthouse on Hilton Head Island, listening to live music with a large group of people.  We were sitting on a bench, looked up (in the direction of the land, not the ocean) and saw a large, very circular and bright white/yellow light hovering in the sky that appeared out of nowhere.  It would move slightly, but was practically still.  We heard no sounds, although, if there were any, they likely would have been drowned out by the music.   We stared and did not speak, watching the object move forward slightly through the clouds.  Then the object disappeared, analogous to someone turning off a light.   After it disappeared, my friend and I looked at each other and confirmed what we had both seen.  Two other couples sitting on benches to our left had the same gaping mouth expression as we did, and asked if we had seen the light as well.  While we were recent high school graduates, the two other couples were in their mid- to late-60s. Others at the lighthouse may have seen it, but the 6 of us were away from the action, not facing the direction of the event.  We had no clear explanation for what it could have been.  There were no fireworks or searchlights at the event.  We were ridiculed by family members, who insisted that our sighting was related to nearby military facilities.  Although it was now 6 years ago, I still get chills thinking about the event, which I remember as clear as day.  I would love to know if others that were there saw the same light, but unfortunately, I do not remember the exact date (I would estimate it being early to mid June of 2001).

My husband and I went fishing for catfish after dark at a local public lake. It was a cloudless night. We had a Coleman lantern and I was watching the end of my rod looking for twitches that would mean I had a fish on. I suddenly noticed a light reflected in the water and I looked up to see a bright ""star"" that was rapidly getting brighter. I yelled to my husband who wasn't fishing and hadn't yet noticed it. For a second I thought it was a meteorite heading dead on for us as there was no movement at all. I was convinced for just a moment that we were going to get hit and die by meteorite! Then I noticed there were no ""sparks"" like I've seen in other fireballs I've witnessed and I next decided it must be a super nova. It got so bright it almost hurt my eyes, it lit up the woods around us, even brighter than a full moon would. It then started to dim at the same speed that it brightened and eventually faded away to nothing. It seemed to take a long time, but I'd guess it was actually around 30 seconds in duration. If I remember correctly, I think I heard something reported on the local news a few days later involving a bright light or a super nova, but I'm not sure. I have since seen aerial flares on TV and though they are similar to what I saw, flares actually have a floating feeling about them and they last much longer than my light.

We began discussing the possibilities of what it could have been.  I also recall that, do to the speed it was going, we estimated that if it wanted it could travel around the world in about half an hour.  Then, about 20 to 30 minutes later, the object returned, not from the horizon it was traveling towards, but from the horizon it came from the first time.  This time there were two more object in the same triangle formation, making up 5, and behind the object was another single object that seemed to be tailing it, at the same speed, with a visibly bright orange object pulsating around it.

It seamed very low because it so large, it filled my entire view coming over the house and flew past the window.  It gave off the sound of a very deep sounding yell.  The sound was pretty quite but still unmistakable that the orb was making it. It was way to large for a plane and it was almost like a perfect circle.  The bottom drooped down.  It flew very slowly over the house, stopping for only a second a little past the window.  It sped up almost suddenly, then slowed back to its original speed, like it  re-thought its movements.

The town we worked in was only 800 people, Yakutat, Alaska, so I went out there with the Chief of Police.   We saw a white diamond object seemlessly traverse a bright blue sky without a single cloud.  We got a video camera, and as I tried to focus in closer, it would dart away out of lense view, as if it knew i was attempting to take video!  I still have 20 minute or so of video of this thing that would move in curvy directions, nonlinear, and vibrate into different shapes which appeared to be circular, then back to diamond.   High-tech secret, or otherworldly, who knows.  I can't deny what i saw and have on tape.  Neighbors came out and saw this thing with us.   Finally it passed out of view; we thought maybe it can read out minds?  Who knows?  I asked it to come to me, and even today, 4 years later, i still think when i am alone, that i wish it would be brave enough to contact me at some point in the future.   To date, nothing.

The night sky was completely clear and no clouds were in the air so I could see the object of light quite clearly. The light moved too fast to be an airplane, produced no sound, was at a hight of about 200 feet or 300 feet, and seemed to have a small haze around it. At first it was on a southwest trajectory, but then changed immediately to a west north west trajectory. At first I thought I just was seeing things or got too much of a buzz off my cigarette. However, after talking with my friends for another 5 minutes I decided to look in the sky where I saw the object.

Unusual White Lights Incident Report:  Unexplained Lights  Location of Incident:  Southwest of Sherman County Roads 55 and 16  Date of Incident:  January 18, 2006 Witness:   Patrol Deputy; Sherman County Sheriff’s Office   At 1943 hours on the above date, I was on routine patrol in the area of (southwestern) Sherman County Road 55, westbound, and approaching the intersection of County Road 16.  There are no street lights or other light sources in that area, as it is quite remote, with only a very few residents living in the area. As I proceeded west on Road 55, my attention was drawn to my left, to approximately a ten to eleven o’clock position, by unusual lights, which appeared almost instantaneously, which I caught out of the corner of my eye.  The lights appeared to be five orange fire-like balls, which appeared to be on the same horizontal plane.  As I perceived movement out of the corner of my eye, but the lights were not moving when I looked at them directly, my impression was that the lights had traveled in a left to right, or east to west fashion.  The lights hung in the sky, approximately 10 degrees off of the horizon, clearly stationary, for approximately five seconds, before each of them blacked out simultaneously.  I immediately pulled my patrol car over to the side of the road. Within approximately twenty seconds, I observed one light, starting just above the level of the first row of lights, illuminate, followed by a series of four additional lights that illuminated over the course of perhaps two seconds, and in equal intervals.  I estimate these lights to have been approximately 15 to 20 degrees off of the horizon.  I could observe no smoke trail, as one would expect with high intensity military type flares, and noted the lights were equally spaced, which would be quite difficult to do with precision, with ground launched military flares.  These lights remained illuminated for perhaps five seconds, and again, as with the previous lights, shut off in unison.  This synchronicity in the illumination patterns seemed, to my thinking, to eliminate flares as the source, as flares would burn out at different times. I waited in that location for several minutes, but observed no additional lights in the area.  Additionally, I was monitoring the Renner Field CTAF/Unicom Frequency, as well as the Aircraft Emergency frequency, and overheard no unusual traffic on those channels.  My impression was that the lights were quite far away, possibly in the area of Cheyenne Wells, Colorado, but could not make any determination as to distance whatsoever. After seeing this anomaly twice, I telephoned Goodland Police Officer [WITHHELD], whom I knew to have an interest in such oddities.  Officer [WITHHELD], who was off duty, listened incredulously to the observations I had just made, and stated that he would be en route to my location from his residence in Goodland.  That call was placed to Officer [WITHHELD] at 1946 hours, and lasted between one and two minutes. While I awaited the arrival of Officer [WITHHELD], at 1955 hours I telephoned the National Weather Service Field Office in Goodland, and spoke to the meteorologist on duty.  I did not catch his name, but I explained to the meteorologist who I was, and that I had just observed some very unusual lights, which I estimated to be south of the Town of Kanorado, but that I could not estimate a range at which I observed the anomalies.  I asked if the weather radar had picked up any unusual activity in the area from Kanorado south in the vicinity of the state line, and probably into Colorado.  The NWS employee checked the previous twenty minutes of radar data, and stated only that ""There is one anomalous return south of Kanorado on one pass, but that’s not unusual.""  I asked if the NWS radar was calibrated to pick up aircraft, or if it eliminated aircraft from the data collected, and he said that routine air traffic was not detected by the radar. At 1958 hours, I received a call from Officer [WITHHELD], asking to confirm my location, and I then moved to the intersection of County Roads 17 and 55 to make his finding me somewhat easier.  From that location, I could still observe the area of the sky in which I had observed the unusual lights.  Officer [WITHHELD], arrived at my location at 2003 hours. At the time of the arrival of Officer [WITHHELD], we observed what we regarded as unusual lights, although they were quite small.  The lights appeared to be consistent with those of small aircraft as far as size, but the FAA required colors and flashing lights were not present.  These unusual lights consisted of steady-on white lights, and we noted an unusual lack of known air traffic in the area.  These lights seemed to begin directly south of our location, and continued to the area directly above us, and west for some distance.  As it was a clear night, numerous light and commercial aircraft could be observed in the area, but none were in the vicinity of the white lights we were observing.  I began checking all aircraft frequencies at that time, and found nothing unusual in any aircraft radio traffic.  However, it was clear that none of the ""known"" aircraft were in the area of the unusual white lights. These white lights appeared to be moving, largely in a southwesterly direction, but I did observe a small group of three, just above the horizon, which appeared to be spinning in a counterclockwise circle, as if it were three separate aircraft circling at an air show.  However, these three lights did not contain any of the FAA mandated lighting, and the pattern flown was quite tight, leading me to believe that not even the best of pilots would attempt such maneuvers, particularly at night. At approximately 2025 hours, the sequential orange lights again appeared in the same vicinity as I had initially observed them, following the same pattern of lighting up sequentially, creating the illusion of movement, remaining illuminated for a few seconds, and blacking out in unison.  This occurred twice, and Officer [WITHELD] was able to see for himself, the lights which I had described.

It was already dark, a clear night. I was driving alongside the Harbor Freeway (110) and this structure, fairly reminiscent of stadium lights, sat above it. I pulled into the large Alpine Village parking lot to observe. It was square and thin, and I always thought it matched a CD jewel case in dimension ratio-wise. It appeared black in the night sky, with circular white lights that ran in rows throughout the bottom, with one pulsing red light in the center. It was low, about 250-300 feet above the freeway, and would probably be covered by 3/4 of my hand extended as I watched from about 150 yards away. It was about 25 feet on each side. I could hear no sound. And traffic flew by on the freeway below, as this thing didn't really appear all that unusual. But I wondered what purpose a light grid served that high over the freeway. It was completely still, no wobble or sway, as if it were attached to a pole. After a minute of suspension, it cruised south in a straight line over the freeway , about 30 mph and stopped.  A moment later it traveled north again about 1/3 of the way back. Stopped briefly again, then headed east towards the city of Carson, slowly, and dipped it's left side and straightened out again. I decided to give chase, but my car was in poor condition and soon lost it.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

Then we all saw it....It was right near us out to sea, there were some clouds that probably shaded our view for where it started. It first was a bright white light that was maybe 3-4 kms altitude. It was moving east towards Melbourne. Then changes direction slightly and the white light dims till it is almost out, while moving in a NE to E to NE continually. Now it is quite dim and you could almost not see it. Then the light dims on again but it is red and it is shining. But it wasnt as strong as the white light, but it was further away.  If I could speculate as to the shape, it was probably disc or a ball, and probably the size of a small plane.....

I own my CNC machining business.  Have been a race engine builder for years.  Worked with GM for years.  Studied astronomy, physics and engineering.  Very down to earth person.  I don't look for phenomena, but have always had a major interest in the natural world.  I quest for knowledge in all my endeavors.  I not easily swayed, I seek facts and details.  I could go further, but that being said, here's my event.  February 2006;  I was driving home late at night, ~12:00 a.m. from my shop.  My girlfriend was with me at this time.  We were heading north on I-15.  Just passed California Oaks off ramp, we both noticed a very bright light hovering just above the horizon about NW, 10:30 from our position.  It was very strange in that there was no traffic in our direction.  No lights ahead and one set of lights very far behind us.  Very unusual for the busy I-15.  We commented on the brightness of the lights.  Like they were pointed right at us.  They were brighter than any aircraft lights I've ever seen.  But there were 3 together but distinctly separate.  We thought it may be a helicopter.  It moved ever so slightly towards us, maintaining it's altitude.  We continued to comment on the strangeness.  As we approached Bundy Canyon, the object seemed to start to draw a bead on us.  Again there was oddly no other traffic in our direction, but a sporadic car passing on the opposite side heading south.  As we passed Bundy the object was now even with us and within a 1/4 mile to the direct West of us and falling slightly behind us, say to the 8:00 position.  It's altitude was maybe 200'.  It then turned and maintained running parallel to our direction exactly off at 9:00.  It maintained that distance for ~ 1/4 mile, then moved in to us.  It continued to fly directly over the truck.  I become very uneasy and speed up to around 100 mph, because I felt like it may hit us.  It flew directly above us for maybe a 1/2 mile and then started to veer off to the East and disengaged slowly.  I could not see it off the passenger side except for just a couple of glimpses.  My girlfriend continued to eye it.  She said it then shot off to the East at an extremely high rate of speed.  Faster than a jet she said.  Strange facts:  NO noise.  This object made NO noise, even flying about 100' above us.  Three aircraft type landing lights up front and two of the same type lights in the assumed ""Rear"" of the object.  NO traditional navigation lights or strobes.  And the most amazing aspect of all is that there was no visible body.  We could not make out any physical type of structure to the object.  NO wings, NO fuselage, NO body.  Just lights and void between the lights.  Even as the object came over head, we could not see any type of body.  The object did appear to be circular only becuase of the way the lights were positioned.  I figured you may like to add this sighting to what ever compilation you may have.  You may contact me anytime if you would like to ask any further questions.  Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I’m a skeptic but a believer.  This incident occurred on my way to work at 0430 between Waunakee, Wi. 53597 and Middleton, Wi. 53562.  As I was driving on county hwy K and heading west between county hwy Q and US hwy 12, I saw a column of lights that resemble the broadcast towers that dot the west side of Madison, Wi. which is adjacent to Middleton.  Initially, I instinctively interpreted this column of flashing lights as one of the broadcast towers off in the distance.  This thought did not follow through in my mind though.  As soon as I focused on the road ahead again I immediately returned my gaze to the lights again.  This was not hard to do for the traffic at 0430 is nonexistent.  I was able to slow my car speed and observe.  What I observed was a tower of flashing white lights not far off in the countryside.  My calculated guess would be about ¼ - ½ mile.  The countryside here is farmland – dark as night can be.  I always enjoy viewing the stars at this time of morning on my way to work. There are few things that I enjoy better than the night sky.  I must say that after I concluded that what I was seeing was a possible UFO mimicking a TV tower, I burst into laughter at the thought of concealment by looking like a tower of lights.  Beautiful!!  This column continued to move in a westerly direction as I turned toward Middleton on to US hwy 12 heading south.  I didn’t stop to view it any longer as I continued on into work.  Sooo….it was observed by me for approximately 10 min.  I just recently decided to report this observation because I believe that what I saw was not part of the normal fauna of my path to work.  I also continued to look each morning thereafter at the towers that do exist there and the distance and size they actually are.  They are extremely further away to my sighting and observations.  I didn’t count the number of flashing lights but they were all flashing white.  The height of the light tower I find difficult to estimate but will guess at between 100 -200 yds.  As for closeness to the ground;  It was definitely off the ground.  I will not try to guess. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I would like to start by saying that I have never seen an unidentified flying object before that I could not quickly explain away as something explainable. On August 20th, 2007 at 9:50 p.m. I stepped out on my deck to have a cigarette. We just had our first real rainy day of the summer and the evening sky was mostly cloudy, but clearing up. I noticed the moon partially obscured through the clouds to the southwest looking from Lafayette Oregon south-southwest towards but between if you will, McMinnville and Salem Oregon. The moon was not a full moon, but a quarter moon and it was low in the sky. Directly to the west-northwest of the moon in the sky there was a large break “Spot or Hole” in the clouds where I could clearly make out or see the stars. I would say that this break in the sky was approximately 3 to 4 miles long by 2 to 3 miles across. I was just about to light my cigarette while looking at the stars through the break in the clouds when I saw a large Oval shaped object move very fast from west to east across the break in the clouds. The oval object was a solid white to aqua blue in color. Not transparent. No flashing lights could be seen associated with this oval object. This object moved very quickly across the break in the clouds. I quickly tried to explain it away when, a second large oval object of the same description moved very quickly across the break in the clouds in the same direction. I do not feel that what I saw was something normally seen in the night sky. I.E. a satellite or commercial jet aircraft. These object were moving way to fast. Closing notes: Each object was seen for about 8 to 10 seconds.  In my opinion I feel that these objects were Not personal aircraft, military aircraft, commercial aircraft, shooting stars, or satellites. These oval objects were larger then commercial aircraft by a least two fold. No sounds could be heard I.E. engine sounds. There were no “Flashing Lights” associated to these objects. There were no “Streaks” of light trailing these objects. I would place these oval objects at 5 to 10 thousand feet in altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and STS??

I was in a hurry.  It was about 5:45 a.m.Central Daylight. I was traveling from Valentine, Nebraska.  The meeting registration was at 9:30 with the meeting to begin at 10:00. I’m including this piece of information because it did have a small part in my actions at the end of this story, I believe.  I was  traveling on Highway 20 approximately two to three miles west of Johnstown, Nebraska, just a very short distance west of Plum Creek. (less than a mile, I approximate)  It was dark and I was watching for deer, porcupine, etc, yet, trying to keep aware of the time and my schedule.    The stars were out.  All of a sudden there is a flying object coming parallel to the road in the opposite direction I was traveling, just clearing the trees. In other words, it came from the other direction and was just beyond the fence line on the opposite side of the road.  It was flying pretty low to the ground, yet, high enough that I was thinking it was a small private plane because I could hear it so well, and because it was so low.  There were a lot of lights flashing, and a pretty loud whirling sound, an unusual sound to me, but the only way I can describe it was like a helicopter sound, but more a whirling sound than a chopping sound.  It definitely was not a helicopter. I remember being amazed as there were twenty or thirty lights flashing on this vehicle.   At first I thought I was close to Ainsworth, as there is an airport there and it was so low to the ground I thought it must have just taken off.  I thought it was a very fancy plane.  I said some things out loud, and I believe they had a bearing on what ensued.  I will relate those comments in a few paragraphs.  At first I didn’t think much of it, I thought it was a small plane definitely with sophisticated instruments, radar, etc. I continued driving only glancing at it twice. It immediately came back to check me out, as that is when I realized I must stop to see what in the world this was.  I was looking at the road, (driving) so I didn’t see it shift into reverse, but that is what must have happened.   As I think about it now, at that point, I remember being surprised as I could see stars through it, and the lights weren’t flashing and making as much a noise as it had made an instant before, when it first was visible and coming over the trees.    I pulled over, off the road onto the shoulder, put the vehicle in park, and opened my window.  That is when I realized this was a very unusual event in my life.  I stared at it, and remember there wasn’t much of any sound now, and just an instant later, there was no sound.  It was suspended in the air, and just hovering there, about 15 or 20 ft. in the air.  I could see through it.  The lights weren’t flashing then, and there were only a few lights. Also, I remember thinking that whomever was in there, was not visible, but no doubt was looking at me.  The lights I could see were on the exterior of the craft and there were only two or three that I recall along with apparent illumination in the interior.  The visible lights  were in the position of one or two corners of the craft, I believe, but I remember thinking there weren’t lights in each corner, maybe just three lights.  My attention was directed to the interior, illuminated but not a very large space, and I thought two levels. It looked like a large rectangular glass (plastic) box.  The interior wasn’t very wide. There were no desks, no panels of instruments, no anything, but it was dimly lighted allowing me to see functional space.  I’ve tried to recall the measurements, but bear in mind, this all happened in a few minutes time.  These measurements are the best I can recall, and here they are.  The plastic box, which this craft appeared to be, was approximately 18 feet long, maybe a little less, but not much.  The height was approximately 13 feet.  It was rectangular with the horizontal measure greater than the vertical measurement.  It appeared there might be two levels, but, of course, I didn’t see any steps, etc.  The space inside was illuminated lightly, I could see some depth to the space, and I’m going to guess that at about 4 feet. The reason I thought it was two levels, it appeared there was some kind of horizontal divider in the craft, in about the middle. I have calculated that I was no more than 120 feet from the craft. 18’x13’x4’ approximately, and about 120 feet away.  I looked in the rear view mirror and saw two large trucks (cattle trucks I realized after I got out on the road) approximately 1/8th of a mile behind me, coming very fast toward me.  I got scared all of a sudden, and wanted to be in front of the trucks to protect myself.  I remember calculating that it wouldn’t put the trucks in danger if I were to pull out on the road and get up some speed, which is what I did.  I didn’t even glance back, even though I wanted to, to see if I could see the vehicle flying away.   I was in animal country, and I had two large trucks bearing down behind me, so I just drove and concentrated on the road in front of me. The appointment I was traveling to had a very small bearing on my leaving so abruptly, but primarily I felt I wanted the safety of the trucks to escort me away from this experience. It was a very meaningful experience to me, however, and now I know UFO’s exist.  As I was driving away from this experience, I felt a sense of gratitude I had experienced it.  After getting out on the road again, I immediately came to Plum Creek and then Johnstown, and soon after that, Ainsworth.  I pulled in at the gas station, and saw the two big cattle trucks go by, and I’ll always wonder if they saw anything.  They may not have, because the craft was  inconspicitious and the trucks were traveling very fast, and I recall some trees just to the left, or west,  of the craft.  The lights of this craft  appeared to be the source of the energy to navigate it, and with the many flashing lights and the whirling noise, it seemed like a happy little vehicle, just singing and whistling along, before  it spotted me.  Forgive me for  being repetitious, but I don’t have time to make this a grammatically correct manuscript. Some of you who are reading this are probably appreciative of my repetition as I don’t want to leave out any important points that I know I experienced. When I was first parked, and looked at it, it shut down to no sound and even though there were some lights, they were not flashing and they were very few in number.  The craft was completely stationary, suspended in air about 15 ft. off the ground.   I could see through the spacecraft, and could see the interior but could see no objects.    I would gauge it just a few feet on the other side of the fence line (standard distance from a road) and suspended approximately 15 ft. in the air.  The last thing I want to relate is what I said, outloud, because I think they heard me, understood me, and that is what caused them to take a better look at me.  When I first saw the vehicle (which I assumed was a plane) I distinctly recall what I said, and that I said it out loud.  My windows were rolled up incidentally.   After glancing at this vehicle initially, I assumed it was some rich person’s vehicle because it would cost a lot (just judging from the power and the energy I could see and hear) and I said, “You’re a sophisticated little plane.”   Then I recall saying, as I’m driving down the road not even looking back at it, “little fancy dancy plane!”   Then, I remember saying, not having any idea the craft was anything other than being a mile or two away from me, “Wow, twenty or thirty lights!!” more or less to confirm in my mind what I had just seen. (When I first laid eyes on it, it was just having a good old time, clearing treetops and all those 20 to 30 lights flashing, making a lot of whirling sounds.  It appeared to be feeling very good.)  Then, I realized it had reversed itself, and it was still parallel to the road I was traveling down, at approximately 60 mph, and that’s when I said, out loud, as I pulled off the road,  “Boy, I’ve got to have a better look at you!”  I stopped on the shoulder of the road, put my pickup in park and rolled down the window.  And there was no more talking, just looking at this space craft, as I have attempted to describe it.  I definitely remember hearing the small purr being cut even more, so there was absolutely no sound as it was suspended in air.  I sensed no evil or ill feeling.  It was a friendly force.  I sensed curiosity on their part, and I greatly appreciated this experience, even though I did get scared and wanted to be ahead of the trucks and not left behind.  I hope to see another space vessel sometime, if I am so blessed.  If I do, I will  try  to be braver. But, you have to admit, I was pretty brave the other morning when I had this great experience. Before October 6th, I really didn’t believe in UFO’s.  I had not been drinking or smoking anything, I was totally sober and have been for years.  I know what time I left Valentine, and what time I arrived in Ainsworth, and there was no great lapse of time.  I imagine my encounter lasted only a couple minutes from the time I first spotted this noisey  craft, when the craft returned to my proximity, when I parked to observe it and  when I pulled out on the road again.  The man I talked to on the phone from this website asked me to draw a picture of the relationship of the size of the  vehicle I saw to the sun in the sky.  I think this would be confusing, I’ve given you the measurements as best as I can recall them.  If I would have to do that, it would be close to the relationship of a 3x5 file card to a penny.   Thank you for your attention.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

At about 6:30 pm I noticed what at 1st looked like a huge plane over the KY side of the river. What was unusual was that it look like a plane with its wings tilted at approximately 30 degrees and coming directly at us.  I asked my nephew if he saw this and he confirmed that he had been watching it for a while and wasn't sure what he was looking at either.  We set there for 30 minutes or longer and watched this object fly east then change course and fly north-northeast.  For quite a while this object looked like it was flying toward us and tilted but then it began moving east.  It had lights on both ends of it and we estimated it had to be very large, mabye a quarter mile from end to end.  The lights on both ends blinked and were both red.  We thought that this was 2 planes at 1st, but it was definetely 1 object.  At no time was any noise noted from the object, or any plane aircraft noises heard during the siting.  This was a very weird object, flying at a very slow speed and I think that it was hovering when we thought it was coming directly at us.  Anyone with any info. on this would be appriciated.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,38.0519,-87.2485

We had leveled-off at FL210 and were cruising just south of Manteca VOR (a navigational aid near the city of Manteca, CA).  Traffic at this time of night is usually very light and quite easy to spot at ranges exceeding 50 miles.  ATC (Oakland Center) routinely advises us of traffic in our area.  While on a mostly southern heading, I noticed a somewhat unusually colored light off to my nine-o-clock position (east of us).  It appeared to be close to our altitude, but many miles distant (over the foothills of the Sierra mountain range).  Normally, lights seen at that altitude and distance appear to be of a clear white color… usually the recognition or landing lights of another aircraft descending into the Bay Area for landing.  This light was exceptionally bright and very yellow in color.  I pointed it out to my First Officer, in passing.  He also remarked on how bright it was.  I’d seen unusual lights like this one before – both out over the ocean and on descent into the Bay Area over Concord, CA.  They’d always turned out to be oil refineries/rigs burning off gas.  This light did not flicker as those had.  As we continued our flight to BUR, we’d occasionally look out to the left to watch the light – which, over time grew both larger and brighter.  After about five minutes of observing the light, it began to take a definite shape and seemed to be paralleling our course.  The top portion of the light was semispherical, and the bottom portion formed a clear “V” shape coming to a point at the base.  Over time, this “V” shape with a pointed-bottom became larger-and-larger.  Our curiosity piqued, I asked my F/O to call Oakland Center and ask if they had any traffic on their radar at our nine-o-clock, same altitude.  They replied saying that the only traffic in our vicinity was an opposite direction King Air descending out of 13,000 feet (which both I and my F/O already had in sight).  No traffic at our nine-o-clock was seen on radar.  We continued to watch this bright yellow light grow in size over the next ten minutes, until it filled about a four-inch square through the window on my side.  It was impossible to accurately gauge our distance to the object, or its true size, since we didn’t have any other visible references against with to judge it.  Anecdotally, all I can say is that it was both LARGE and of a VERY unusual shape and color.  Other aircraft lights (while flying at night) uniformly appear to be circular points of light, and are all in standard colors (red, green, white or white strobe).  The light we saw did NOT appear to be a light ON an aircraft – the light appeared to be the entire outline of some sort of aircraft.  As I said before, the light appeared to be paralleling our course and coming closer (i.e., remaining in the same relative position even though we were moving south at around 300 knots over the ground, yet getting larger).  Please take that observation with a grain of salt though.  Without being close enough to see details on the craft or compare it against a ground reference – it could just as easily be something very large seen at a great distance.  Things observed at a large distance do not appear to have any relative motion.  We continued to watch the light until it appeared to take a northern course away from us at great speed (both decreasing in brightness and size, without changing altitude).  Both my F/O and I have 5,000+ hours of experience – most of which was gained under similar circumstances (at night, over California routes)… and we were both flabbergasted by what we saw.  We both admitted it made the hair on our neck stand up.  To be honest, I was spooked by the experience, but have chosen to not bring it up with our airline or the FAA out of concern for being judged a nut-job.  I’m not saying the things we saw were of extraterrestrial origin – but I am saying we saw something that (in both of our professional opinions) was nothing like any other aircraft we’ve ever experienced in our careers.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,37.77417,-121.2256556

Then all of the sudden we lost track of the objects. From the north we saw a black disc clear as day come over raccoon creek golf course- Jefferson apartment complex. It moved slowly across bowles maybe a 100 feet of the ground, it was almost like you could reach out and touck it.

We live in a remote , wooded area outside of town without street lights.We were on the last road to the house ,heading downhill when I noticed the bright light was above the tree line. I mentioned it to my wife at which point she suggested we pull into the drive and watch it.I pulled into our drive,still 100yds. from the house , and turned the vehicle and headlights off. The brightlight continued in a straight course directly toward us. By this time I'm thinking it has to be a helicopter. Oddly though we noticed as it got ever so closer there was no apparent noise. Just as the object flew directly over our heads many things were evident. It was not a helicopter,it appeared to be moving much too slowly. It not only had a huge bright spotlight on the front,but also one pointing directly downward at the ground as well as one pointing directly to the rear for a total of 3 spotlights.The spotights were increadibly bright! The craft was metallic gray/silver with protruding structures underneath like pipe work. It was cylindrical in shape with no obvious front or rear other than the direction it was flying. It was approximately 20-25 ft in length and 10 ft wide. It was moving from the South to North toward the Greater Austin area. It seemed to be traveling no more than 15mph. It moved so slowly it is hard to believe it could stay in the sky.The only noise I could hear was when it was directly overhead.The noise was a faint metallic clanking or moving of metal parts.It did not have blades or wings! It was no more than 30 ft above us just clearing the trees. The light was so bright we couldn't make outfine details of the craft. We watched it slowly cruise overhead and continue across the front of our property through the woods.

While attempting to make a phone call I began staring at the moon (it was waxing at a half crescent).  I cancelled the call and scrolled the sky until I was at about an 80 degree angle just north of the moon.  A brighter than usual star (maybe -1 mag.) caught my attention.  It was moving east to west at a fairly high rate of speed.  It was circular in shape and white in color.  There was no trail what so ever.  I assumed it was a satellite and decided to watch it until it disappeared from the horizon.  After several seconds I was astonished.  The object slowed and than at that instant, it made a 90 degree direction change and accelerated to an astonishing speed.  It was out of sight in a second or fraction of.

I have NEVER experienced any ""sightings"" before and though I support MUFON (probably the only Louisiana member) I am a scientist and I try to take an unbiased look at everything.  In the case of this sighting, scientifically, it could have possibly been a meteor being ""deflected"" in the atmosphere but there was NO BURN TRAIL and the way it varied its speed was just remarkable.

It was a short view due to the size of the building NW (next lot)of me and not quite fully dark yet.  A more detailed map with drawing will be submitted as an update when I can.  It came into my view as it passed over my head look toward and above the 3 story apartment building NV of me. It was a dark, triangle craft, about the size of an old caddilac car.  There were dim, rectangle shaped lights from the point to the back, but not across the back.  Stranger yet was that there was one more light on the left size than the right side, like one light was out. It was about a 4/5 second sighting. I won't forget it.  I screamed for my roommate to come see, then passed him on my way back through the house to get outside to try and see past the bigger building. A street light, made further viewing impossible, past the larger building. It was moving along 15/20 mph basically paralelling I-5 from North Mt Shasta, towards, if it kept along that flight line, to the NW of Black Butte, to the town of Weed, Ca.  I would think that cars on I-5 may have been able to see it. I didn't think until later that I should have called Weed PD to look for it coming.

There's no flashing lights and it's at an altitude much higher than even a military aircraft...like I asked before, it seems to be at the same altitude as a satellite but I don't think a satellite can make turns that quickly or move side to side as it's tracking across the sky. The first time we saw it was the night of the Perseud meteor shower and then again about two weeks later. It came from due north and was moving towards the south but when it got almost directly overhead, it took a sharp turn to the southeast. The second time we saw it, it stayed on a ""straight"" course but started to zig zag very rapidly for about two or three minutes.

This particular night, as i was leaving my mothers second floor apartment,on her back porch,(10 ft high)my daughter was comming out to tell me goodbye, i happened to see out of the corner of my eye, a very unusual light comming from the west. It was kind of far away, and i at first thought it to be a plane, but there was no sound yet, and its color was a brillant, bluish/white. It flew towards the southwest(to our left) slowly across the sky. By this time, my mother had planned on walking the dog, and she came out and saw it.It moved so very slow, almost like a plane that was coasting,it seemed too big to be moving that slow to me, especially with no wind currents or sound. Then , it turned east in a path directly towards us. We kept watching, and slowly, very slowly, it moved increasingly forward and got about 20 ft away before i could hear it. It was a""type"" of jet engine sound i would say, that is, it had a whine like a jet, but this whine was a very low pitched whine, thats the only way i can describe it.Now its even more desturbing to me, because even though i can hear some sort of engine, it was still too quiet. The engine whine did not match to either the slow speed, or the size. This thing seemed to float in the dark sky. Now that it was about to go over the top of the house, i tryed to make out quickly the shape of the thing before it was gone. For the life of me, i could see no shape in the middle.It just had three lights spanning the front, and three spanning the back. It seemed that between the center of these lights, the shape, or craft moved, i could see something wobbling. Another thing is, when it turned to cross over the top of the house, it didnt turn like a plane, based on the movement of the lights, it seemed to lay on its side, then turn, then lay flat again. All the lights ! blinked in unison, which i knew was wrong from the start, and they were all the same color. For a split second, i thought it might be a blimp, but it moved faster than a blimp, and more jerky and irratic.The sound waves didnt seem to reach the ground like a regular jet does, the whine was up with the craft.Ive talked to a vietnam vet that i work with, and he told me that because a jet cant fly, it has to keep a constant speed of 175mph to stay in the air. This thing cralled.As i drove back to work(east)i looked for the continuance of its path, but it was gone. Later at work i realised that i was so worried about getting a look at the shape that i didnt even see what color the lights were, when i got back from work, i asked my mother, she said orange. The next day, my daughter(13) and i were talking about it, and i mentioned that i asked my mother about the color and what she said, and my daughter agreed. I told her i was upset that i couldnt see a definate shape, and she said she saw it, and it was a disk.

The object was unmoving, and I wondered if my dream of seeing a supernova before I died was about to be fulfilled.   The object was unmoving, and I could not discern any other lights associated with it, as with an airplane.  After viewing it for about 20 seconds, the light faded to zero in approximately 5-7 seconds.  Prior to this its light output was steady, insofar as I could observe with the unaided eye.   Of course, Jupiter was low in the west at the time of the sighting, and I saw it, as well as the moon, which was just past first quarter, i.e., in waxing gibbous phase.    Venus can never appear where this object did since its greatest eastern elongation is about 47°, as I recall.   Sirius, the brightest star, is not as bright as this object was, and, of course, it's a wintertime object.   I don't have a ready explanation for what this object could have been.

At first we thought that it was an airplane ( because of the flashing colored lights) but it did not seem to move. We watched it for over an hour & it only seemed to move slightly - if at all. Then we thought it must be a star. Do stars have different colored flashing & moving lights? Could it be a star whose light was affected in some way by some haze or smoke in our atmosphere? Other stars nearby looked normal. When looked at through binoculars, this light seemed to change shape slightly ( to become triangular at the top - joined to a ""half oval"" at the bottom ) & the red lights were along the oval portion at the bottom - while the amber lights were in the centre & the blue /green lights seemed to be more on the left side. The next evening, we found it was still there in the sky. Could it have been ""The Bell Blimp""? Who knows?",2006-10-30T00:00:00,50.69344537037037,-120.42138209876542

It again made no noise and was much larger than the last object we saw. It ""seemed"" to be only a few hundred feet above the car or so.

It seemed like a small object but it appeared and was gone within half a second, it almost seemed like a rocket. We were both saw and heard it and almost discounted it until we realized shared details of what we experienced. We heard a faint 'whizzing' sound as it zipped overhead.  The second experience was much more profound and happened a few minutes later. As we discussed the first incident, we noticed about 7-9 lights coming from the south towards the north. There were unlike any lights I have ever seen, they weren't bright, somewhat hazy. At first I thought it was a flock of birds but then I realized there was no flapping, and that I wouldn't see birds so clearly at this hour and at that altitude. Suddenly the lights took a V SHAPE formation as it passed above us in total silence. That was the most shocking part. It seemed like a giant triangle gliding silently at the edge of the clouds, it seemed quite large. I grabbed my binoculars and looked at it and saw that the lights had a strange geometric shape to them that were identical in each light. (I created an image file that I can email with this submission) I couldn't tell if it was one UFO with 9 lights or 9 lights in a V formation. All we could do was keep exclaiming 'oh my god what is that?' over and over as we watched it disppear on the north horizon. There was a lot of haziness in the light around it as if it was passing through the clouds, my mind literally short circuits when I try to think about it because it does not fit into the framework of anything I understand.

One morning in late October 2006, as I prepared to leave for work, I went out to my back yard to feed the pets.  My back door faces east towards the I57 highway which is approximately 400 hundred feet to the east of my home.  I always check the sky and get an idea of the weather.  This was approximately 8:00 AM.   I looked up at the eastern sky which was mostly cloudy and immediately observed a giant circle of a hole - exposing a clear blue sky- in the clouds.  My first thought was that it was not normal.  I looked at it for several minutes, but the clouds never moved or closed over the hole.  I returned indoors, completed my preparations for work and departed the house at approximately 8:45AM.  I could still see that the huge hole in the clouds had not moved or grown any smaller.  I took the north entrance ramp to I57 at Burr Oak Avenue that kept the unusual sky to my immediate right at all times.  Traffic was moderately heavy for a Tuesday morning rush hour, but not slow.   I was able to observe the sky constantly northeast or east of me for the twenty minutes it takes for me to drive from my home to my job on the southeast side of Chicago in the South Shore community.  The formation remained unchanged for the forty-five to sixty minutes that I observed it.  I recall that it was mentioned on the evening news during the weather report because people had called or e-mailed about it.  It was explained away as a cloud occurrence that may have been caused by jet fuel or engine fuel exhaust from a plane.  I thought, ""No Way!""  I think a picture of it was sent to the Daily Southtown newspaper as well.  I am writing about it because of the sighting that took place at O’Hare Airport occurred on November 7, 2006, and the disk that was observed hovering over the airport hanger was said to have created the exact type of hole which I observed in the eastern sky over the far south side of Chicago a week prior to this event at the airport.

This sighting happened above my back garden, in full darkness, on a clear, cloudless night. My property is surrounded by trees, and has a clear sky view, directly above the back garden.  A very fast object travelled from north to south, covering approx 100 degrees of sky, in about 1-2 seconds.  The object was pure white, with a halo type covering, and resembled a cigar type shape. Inside the ""halo"" there seemed to be a long cylindrical shape, with a rounded front, and no discernable rear.  I have no frame of reference for a dimension, but an estimate would be, width of 2 fingers at arms length, and a length of one fist at arms length.  The altitude was low, and i estimate under 500 feet. There was no noise, or any unusual phenomena.  I would not have written in about this, except for the fact that i have seen this twice now.  The second time was a month later, in mid december 2006, when i was in Tweed Heads, Australia.  I was outside a house, at approx 22:00, with my wife, and we both saw this ""object"". This was almost identical to the one i saw in galveston, and the direction of travel was south east, to north east. The details for this second sighting were effectively identical, with very high velocity, white ""cigar"" and halo, no noise, no associated phenomena. My wife asked me not to repeat what i saw in galveston, as there was only one observer, and no proof of any kind, and i concurred this was correct. However, after the sighting in australia, and its extremely similar description, in 2 very different localities, but with 2 observers, i feel it is reasonable to state that this was not an abberation, atmospheric phenomena, or an isolated incident.

We were approaching Ireland at 33,000 feet, -81 degrees F and going over 600MPH, when I saw what I took to be the northern lights.  I was thrilled and watched the lights for at least 45 minutes.  They looked like 2 vertical parallel streamers.  Sometimes rippling, waving, coiling, and sometimes looking like a shaken carpet rolling from one end to the other.  The 2 streamers remained distinct; they never merged.  They looked like clean straight sheets, which never quite touched.  They were NOT FUZZY or PUFFY in any way, and were almost colorless. After about 40 minutes or so I noticed the lights got almost firey and looked almost orange.  I looked through the window ahead of mine and saw that the lights ended at perfectly square black object!  This object had a light in each corner; 3 white and one blue.  So much for the northern lights!  The lights faced me-it flew in the same direction as the plane, like a square book propped up on its spine, the title page facing me (with the lights in each corner).  Our speeds were so evenly matched it took almost 10 minutes for the plane to pass the craft. After we landed, I asked a pilot if what I saw were the northern lights.  He said we 2 planes were flying parallel with our plane (who mentioned planes?).  As I turned to go he said it was actually a UFO but he hadn't wanted to alarm me.  What a character.

They continued like a plane rather than a stationary object, but seemed too low for a plane, and with this usual converging light pattern. We were driving approx 100km/hr on the Highway 401.  Advertising flood lights cast a larger fuzzy light.  Since they are projected from the ground, you can tell roughly where they are coming from.  These were more defined lights and didn't connect with one location on the ground.  The converging pattern was more precise than you see with advertising lights.  They travelled with us and were visible as we drove along.  When we drove past towns, they were fainter, due to lights from buildings, but were definitely still there, and travelled along for some distance.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

I live 2 blocks from the airport. As I got closer to home, the clouds caught my attention because they seemed to be shape-shifting without loosing mass or volume. At one point they almost looked like ancient asian symbols. The firt one I could not make out, the second one looked like a perfect mushroom, and the third one looked like a an ancient writing tablet. But what shocked me the most, was that the 3 clouds became oval shaped again! Getting more and more definition as I shorted the distance ariving at home. But what grabbed me the most, was that once all 3 had good oval definition, and a smaller (but still huge) oval cloud detached from underneath one of the biggest clouds in a perfect round/disk shape opening. It seemed to detach, and re-dock back with the other ship. The clouds disipated a few minutes. I could not believe my eyes. But I try to dismiss it myself as just the weirdest clouds I have ever seen in my life! And that's why I also thought that it will just get dismissed as clouds by anyone else, so I have never shown anyone.  And here is the kicker: I ran to my back yard, and I got to take some amazing pictures of most of the events!!  Please let me know if you are interested in seing them.  I do not want to send them to you just yet, until I talk to somebody (you contact me). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I moved slightly to block the sun’s glare with the gutter, and had a clear view from 8’ to 10’ away of what looked like a metal ball - solid, perfectly round & smooth and the size of a baseball.  It started moving slowly to my left with the dragonflies moving with it.  I tried to rationalize what I am seeing as a bubble or seed pod - but it was not a fuzzy outline - but a solid perfectly round ball.  I looked around for anything else in the sky, but don’t see anything.  Continuing to watch the object, a 2nd ball - identical to the first  (but with no dragonflies) moved slowly into view on the same track and height reducing the distance between the two until just above me - then it went straight up vertical from horizontal at a right angle increasing speed slightly (maybe x 2) as the first object continued on same track & height.  I was astonished that I had seen something that shouldn’t be there.  Since I had observed this for maybe a full minute and so close, I didn’t run to the front of the house to get another look as I had already seen it very clearly and didn’t really want to draw attention to myself.

We saw a slender oval shaped object moving at a high rate of speed over farmland then into city area and then lost visual sight of the object. This time line is only 10 to 15 seconds.  The color of  the object was a white grey.  I live in a small city of  Guadalupe which is 7miles west of  Santa Maria, CA.  Between these two cities is seven miles of farmland, very flat farmland. We were traveling east on highway 166 from Guadalupe when we saw this thing around 10am.  I was driving , my wife sitting shotgun and my three kids in the middle seat of our Suburban.  The morning was solid overcast, but very well lit.  The object was only approximately 50 ft. long.  It was flying very low only about 200 to 300 feet off the ground that is why we all noticed it.  As soon as I noticed it I immediately rolled down my window to see if I could hear it flying.  Guadalupe is only 17 miles from Vandenberg  Air Force Base, and Santa Maria has an airshow with fighter jets and they do travel fast and low.  When at the air shows those jets, traveling away from you low, make a tremendous amount of noise at high speed.  That is why when I saw the object I tried to listen to hear the noise, the kids think it’s cool.  While waiting to here some noise I notice that there wasn’t any distinct lines or features on this thing and then  it is gone over the city.   The object traveled into over the city of Santa Maria. We have a telescope, my kids and I look at stars, planets and meteor showers.  I hunt, fish and often record the rocket launches over the hill at VAFB.  I see the airshows and this did not look like any plane.   This incident happened on 9-8-2007.   The reason I haven’t  reported it until today  1-23-2008 is I just learned there was a place in which to report events like mine.  I remember the date and time because my son lost his soccer game socks and we were going to buy a new pair so he could play.  Not telling anyone of this incident really bugged me. Meaning people like you, so others could see if th! ey were not the only ones too.  I know in my case you don’t want to say anything in fear of being ridiculed.

I noticed a round bright white light coming across from the left side, and it was moving very slow. I thought to my self that plane is too low. But that is when the round light stopped moving and that is when I figured that the object was flying straight in my direction, at this time the light was right over the house across the street. This is when I noticed the object was not making a sound, and it started to move side ways again. It was about ten to fifteen feet above the house, and the house  was about forty-five feet across the street. As I started to point in the direction, the thing stopped agin, at this time it started to go up and out away from us. At the time of my hand being in the up Poisson, I could not cover the light with my hand, so I guess the circle was about eight to ten feet in diameter I don`t know.

The triangle with the lights was following so close it was as if it were towing the triangle which was very close. They flew over and I could see them shrink before disappearing over the horizon, leading me to believe it was actually much larger and flying much higher than they looked as it flew over. I figured it was bigger than a football field if that was 500 feet. After seeing it so long makes me think it was much higher which means it was really big!

Oddly enough, the coyotes were howling wildly until the object appeared. I looked up and just above the ridge near the Gold Mill was a very intense yellowish light, similar to a street light (yellow form). We watched the light and then shone a flashlight towards it and as we did the object rotated towards us and two lights were visible, though it appeared they were both attached to the same object. The object was no more than a quarter mile from our location, just outside the B-loop bathrooms. The object didn’t move or leave the area and hovered just above the ground with a dim light projecting below it in a search-like pattern. We both thought it might be a helicopter but when we realized how close it was and that it was making no noise we were puzzled. I realized I had my video camera with me back at the campsite and we both ran and got the video camera and my wife, brought them back up the hill and started taping. I was shaking badly but managed to get several minutes of video of the object which is clearly visible and close. At one point the object appeared to lower and then a single light came in view in the very place the object was before, it rotated and two lights became visible. We watched this thing for nearly 10 minutes and then it dropped below the hill. An orange glow could still be seen for several minutes. We walked back to the campsite, very confused about what we saw and quite honestly terrified. The orange glow reappeared on the horizon around 9:45 and we left the campground for a hotel. We are not, or were not UFO believers, but I cannot explain the totally silent object that we saw tonight.

I was sitting in the back yard at my Girlfriend's house at 5:15 CDST in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.  We had just returned from Hibbing, Minnesota where we were shopping.  We were about to relax and have a drink. I was leaning back in my chair looking up at the sky which was almost totally clear and blue, except for clouds near the horizon.  Basically , it wa a totally clear sky, bright with sunlight.  Windy. My girlfriend was checking on her flowers.  I saw 3 white spots in the sky slightly southwest of vertical (toward Duluth).  I thought they might be fighter airplanes which do pass over at times.  And I thought they could be white birds.  However these objects were very, very high or at least appeared to be and I could not see any definition in the shape as you might with a bird or plane.  My girlfriend thought they appeared triangular. At first sight these spots were in a straight line and proceeding to the Northwest  by West.  I thought I might have seen a tether, but I may have simply interpreted the regular in line motion as tethered.  I was thinking of baloons.  But the fact was I knew that the objects did not appear as baloons or aircraft or birds.  The three spots were not shiny.  They were dead white.  They proceeded in a straight line as though on the wind.  I think the wind was in the opposite direction.  Very soon after first sight the objects moved in relation to each other, first appearing in the shape of an ""L"" with two fairly close together, almost touching.  But as the movement went on the three objects took positions at the vertices of a perfect equalateral triangle.  The triangle did not rotate.  There was no sound.  The motion was very steady as you see in a flight of birds.  As the white spots moved more to the Northwest, they stopped.  Abruptly.  The motion seemed kind of chaotic at that point, but reorginized and then began moving more or less straight south. It was then that the spots disappeared.  On first sight, with the objects in line, the appearance was quite different, but I would say the distance between the two outer objects or spots and the center was about the same as the distance between the points of the triangel shape later assumed.   If the points were tied together, the changing shape might have been that of triangle being rotated so that I just saw it from a different angle.  In the middle of this incident I got a cell phone call from my daughter about band practice.  That distracted me as I tried to get her to go and look. I called the Duluth Air National Guard security service at 5:45, a half hour after the sighting because maybe they had it on radar.  Of course, I didn't get any information and really, I was happy just to report what I saw. I am certain that the thing I saw was white.  Dead white. Not shiny.  It didn't change direction quickly although it may have been going very fast.  It must have disappeared instantly.  I don't know how high it was.  Certainly higher than birds flying.  And. . . I have never seen any thing like it and I have never made a report before.  I am 67 years old.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,47.2432,-93.5119

I saw three white or yellowish white lights moving slowly from the west to the east in a triangular formation at an undeterminable altitude and velocity.  I assumed that these lights were all part of one object because they did not move in relation to each other (their triangular pattern remained stable).  There was no red flashing red light that is typically seen with aircraft at night nor was there a sound of a jet or propeller engine nor was there the chopping sound of the rotary blades of a helicopter.  There was no apparent sound at all.  The light formation was close enough so that if I extended my hand that the two outer lights could just be seen on either side of my index finger.

As we traveled on the desolate highway South, a bright green light went over us, very low to the ground and at a high rate of speed moving south above the highway illuminating the area around us for a moment. We were very startled and I inadvertently drove off the road and stopped the car, yelling ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!"" over and over. I reached under my coat and took a hold of my 1911 pistol instinctively and then thought, “Yeah right”. As for the object itself, it was very large and oval shaped and simply glowed green and was very low to the ground making no sound and moved at a high rate of speed disappearing over the hills to the south.

It was approximately early afternoon and the wind was really blowing very hard.  We were approaching Auto Outlet (a car dealership).  It was common practice for the car dealership to have balloons (this month I seem to recall single purple and yellow helium filled balloons) tied to the front posts and lot lighting fixtures.  Due to the velocity of the wind the balloons were straining against their ties and leaning towards the Auto Outlet buildings and away from I-35 in the direction of the wind.  I was right at the northernmost corner of the Auto Outlet property and my husband was approximately 4 bike lengths ahead of me (he is a faster stronger rider in a hard wind or just about anytime).  We were on the western side of I -35 on this access road.  We were on our way home from a pleasant ride that day.  The Auto Outlet property has a bill board, or it did then, on the McCarty side of the lot where south bond drivers on I-35 can read about their car dealership.  This bill board is about a standard large bill board size that businesses pay for ad space so highway driver's can read the signs.  My husband and I look above the roof line of the Auto Outlet buildings and observed a very strange sight.  There was a rectangular, 3 D object floating slowly straight up above the buildings.  Next to that object was a 3 dimensional square cube object.  This object changed over time in appearance and navigational mode so I'll do my best to try to explain what I observed.  The larger object was the rectangular object.  From what I observed the side closest to me, the bottom, the back end and  the front end were a purple grey type of material that had no seam lines.  The object appeared to be filled with gas and the fabric covering the shell without seam lines did not undulate but kept a rigid straight line appearance on all edges and sides that I could observe while lifting slowly up at first.  On the end closest to the billboard side of the building there was a short distance to the cube, and there were no connecting ropes, guy lines etc.  The cube was rotating on a 360 degree pattern, always remaining at the same end of the rectangle.  The cube rotated that 360 degrees at a faster rotation rate than the lift rate of the two objects together.  The cube straight up lift rate was the same as the purple grey rectangle.   The cube appeared to have a purple bottom and alternating purple grey on one side, red on line side and yellow on one side and black on one side of the cube accounting for a 4 sided cube.  The cube like the rectangle had no seam lines, appeared to be of some kind of fabric, without seams, and kept the edges and sides perfectly straight and rigid there was no undulation in the fabric like a cloth baloon would be expected to have.  Also surprising there was no visible frame structure such as internal piping retaining the outer edges of either the cube or the rectangle.  As the objects continued to slowly rise, I noticed as did my husband, that if these objects were filled with a bouyant gas, it sure did not move away from I-35 as the Auto Outlet yellow and purple lot balloons did.  The objects did not respond to the very gusy wind that day in terms of speed and direction.  The objects were going straight up slowly as though no wind were present at all!!  It was so gusty it was hard to ride the bikes sideways to the wind.  The winds slowed our speed.  It took a lot more effort to pedal against this kind of wind and move.  It was very surprising to my husband and myself that no one on I-35 tried to pull over on the shoulder and stop and look at these two objects.  It was as though they did not see the objects as unusual or they had no frame of reference with which to relate to the objects. The objects did not make any sound at all as they moved. After the objects got above the height of the ""along the access road power lines"", they changed configuration.  The purple grey rectangle shifted somehow as on an invisible axis and moved from horizontal view to an up-ended view and as it did so the cube moved with it, still rotating as it did so in relationship to the very same end of the rectangle.   The cube ended up above the straight ended up rectangle and continued its rotation at all times.  Remember please, there were no guys, no ropes, no attachments between the cube, the space between and the end of the rectangle. Once up-ended in a vertical arrangement, the purple grey fabric of the rectangle began to undulate like a catepillar's segmented body trying to move up a leave blowing in the wind.  Pockets of gas started to undulate upwards inside the rectangle towards the top end of the object.  As more gas was moving upwards, gas from below leaving the lower portion, caused the object to lose the rigid rectangular shape from the original lift, sinking in in that region and narrowing the formerly rectangular lower end section.  The top section closest to the cube was rounded now and the fabric was bulging out from the increased gas pockets inside.    The overall structure looked like it was climbing up not just floating up.  All this while the cube kept its perfect cube shape and continued rotating without attachment on the same end of the other object it always stayed in configuration with. This continued until the object was quite small and as high up as the air space normally traveled by a stunt plane pre-jet.  At that height, it appeared to resume the shape originally seen during the lift and turned the cube end west ward.  Originally the cube end was facing the south.  With the cube facing west I could only see the bottom of the purple rectangle and the back end of the original purple grey rectangular larger object.  At this point, the objects took off at a vastly increased speed, while not as fast as a jet air plane it was noticeably faster than any derrigle I have ever observed.  The rate was possibly faster than a private beechcraft plane going approximately 120 miles an hour or more.  My brother owns one and I have flown as a passenger in his plane before. I have never seen anything move like this before, constructed like this before, change shape like this before, and my husband and I do not believe the objects were man made. We do believe it was some kind of  surveying unit or probe for close observation of the environment.  Something like a mobile environmental collector. The area is close to the Balcones fault line, the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone, Canyon Lake area.  So there are geographic anomalies close by.  San Marcos River is entirely spring fed from the Aquifer. Close in calendar time, we read an article about the US Government considering budgeting funds for high flying spy derribles.  However, this was before that project was funded because the news story stated lobbying was going on to obtain support for a bill in Congress to fund the spy derrigibles.  Such spy derrigibles were to be extremely high altitude units. The objects we saw flew close to the ground and in normal air space.  They simply moved as nothing else ever observed and were constructed in a unique way out of unique materials. It would appear from when we first saw the rectangular 3 D with rotating cube on one end that it had just lifted up from the lot behind the Auto Outlet and we had arrived at the frontage access road just as the slowly rising object topped over the top of the buildings.  We did not take pictures.  I do not know if my husband would consent to talking about this to anyone for fear of derision.  I want to protect my anonymity because I am a licensed state professional. Second first hand account  My husband and I were driving into Austin Texas on I-35 and observed two grey apparently gas filled tubular shapes, the length of a standard pick up truck undulating in movement floating very close to the ground but never touching the ground, down I-35 next to a concrete divider wall (units for use while road construction is in progress), between Onion Creek and Town Lake.  We both were amazed.   The objects paced our vehicle perfectly, we were going about 65 mph because traffic was heavey in broad day light.  The objects were directly in front of us and over to the driver's side closest to the concrete divider.  Then we watched in total amazement as one object went straight throught the concrete divider having turned with the movement of an eel towards the  concrete divider it had been traveling next to.  The other object  undulated sideways and up and over the top of the concrete divider unit and down the other side.  Both left our view at that point.  We both agreed they did not appear man made, had no seams.  These two units were grey gas filled like tubes that undulated like eels and/or worms,  were longer than a man is tall, and seemed to make decisional changes in direction and speed. They also appeared translucent, which the tow objects described in first hand account were definately not translucent at any time that we observed.  It was almost as if the grey tubes were life forms.  No eyes, no mouths, etc.   The skin on these two objects did not look like any kind of fabric but rather like a membrane.  The closest thing I can think of is imagine a picture of a cell under a microscope without the internal elements and cilia. We did not take pictures.  No camera on hand at the time.  I am not sure that my husband would agree to talk to anyone and I am a licensed state professional. Family related experience  My California Aunt and Uncle (Uncle is now deceased) had a home on private land that adjoined the Tahoe National Forest.  This couple owns more than one home.  They had a hill top home with a sliding glass door and outside deck overlooking a forested valley towards Tahoe National Forest.  They get so many grazing acre rights inside the forest for having land adjoining the forest.  This is why they located there or so my mother has told me.  One night they were both sleeping with the curtains open where they could see out through their sliding glass doors as they feel asleep.  At the same moment they awoke to see a blinding white light fill their bedroom and the space outside the sliding glass door.  As if mesmerized they felt drawn to go outside on the deck to try to discern the shape of the object and make out what it was.  The object they told me later was huge and appeared to be round due to the light.  They never could see the defined edges of the object because the brightness of the light never diminished enough to make out the actual edges.  The object made no sound and drifted or floated towards the valley floor below them.  After a while it appeared to land and the lights went out.  When the lights went out, because they were out in the country there were no surrounding lights to reveal the ship.  In the morning they got up determined to attempt to travel to a road closest to where the ship landed and to hike on foot to try to find the landing sight and see if the ship was still there.  They wanted to know what was going on where the ship had landed.  When they got approximately where they would have to pull over on the shoulder of the road and hike to the site, they saw a man that looked exactly normal from a distance.  They drove right up to him, stopped and got out to speak to him.  The man was dress in a white shirt, white pants, white belt, white socks, white shoes, all in white.  His hair was soft and his face was unlined.  The man was normal height and had black hair, black eyes with undiscernable pupils from the color portion of the eyes, fair skin like a caucasian and normal looking features.  However the air there felt charged and something about this man did not feel right to my aunt and uncle.  At this time my aunt and uncle  were in their mid fifties.  The man appeared no older than his thirties.  He was lean and fit.   They asked this man if he had seen the bright light in the sky last night and if he was there looking for what had landed.  They asked him where his car was.  The man was in the middle of no where so to speak and there were no other people around, no animals in view, no bicycles in view, no motorized vehicles of any kind save my aunt and uncles car.  They asked him if he needed assistance or a ride somewhere. The man at first listened to their questions but said nothing.  When my aunt and uncle fell silent and stopped asking questions the man looked at them like he really meant business and told them that it would be in their best interest not to try to find the landing site, not to hike in the woods that day, not to stay in the area and that they should leave the area immediately.  They left feeling not at all comfortable with the situation.  Having driving less than a car length away my uncle said he stopped the car to look back towards the man to see if he had failed to observe anything else important.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  There was a distance of at least 100 feet or more between the road and the tree line of the forest and nothing man made or geologic for the man to hide behind.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  They said they never saw anything like this before or after this experience.  They told me they were certain the ship was a UFO and the man was not a human born on this planet. My aunt and uncle did not give me permission to release this information but they told it to me first hand.  They did not take any pictures.

On Saturday February 11, 2006 at about 5:45 in the morning a friend who was visiting for the weekend decided to step outside and take a look at the morning sky. I was busy making the coffee when he came in quite astounded and excited at what he had just witnessed. He said he was enjoying the views of the winter skies when all of a sudden a brilliant white, round, light appeared directly north and at approximately 70° alt. above the horizon moving slowly west. I asked him if he was holding something at arms length between his thumb and index finger that would represent the objects size what would it be? He said, without hesitation, “about the size of a BB”. One of the strangest things about it, he said, was that when it appeared it was already moving “as if it decided to just appear as it was moving slowly west”. He stated that it made no sound or changed it’s direction of travel. After observing it for about 30 seconds or so he said he picked up the faint sound of a jet and then he saw it pop up over the trees in the west. When  he glanced back over to the object it had stopped moving.  After just a few seconds the object headed north at an incredible speed and disappeared below the horizon. He said he tried to count down the seconds using the 001 method as it moved away from the jet but never made it to the second zero. Our friend has always been a true blue skeptic about these things, but now as he states, “I’m not so sure about this anymore”. This is the second, close to identical, sighting of this object from our property in six months. I filed an incident report last September 30, 2005 that was an identical match to this one except that object was literally on top of us. It’s color, shape, point of origin (north), and direction and speed of departure (north) were the same. I have no idea what this object is, where it came from, or what it’s interest is in this area but my curiosity is now getting the best of me. I would like to find out how many other sightings have taken place that have not been reported.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

So i called my older sister outside of the house to come take a look, and all she could do was look no words could excape her mouth, so i asked her ""what do you think it is, i truly think its a UFO,"" and she answered ""it looks like one!?"" then asked her ""does it appear as though it is moving?"" and she said yes, i then told her to watch while i get my camara, she then shouted ""hurry up it looks like its leaving!"" a couple of seconds later she said ""never mind its still there."" as i run outside the house with my camara and snap the first picture, it starts to move more and with every picture i took the more it moved, finally when i thought that i had enough pictures, my sister and myself retreated back into the house, at around 4:55 a.m. i went back outside to see if was still there and it was, which lead me to believe that it was there long after i went back into my home.

In the middle of them is a little park next to a little building that is the offices and the pool.   There also is the parking which is significant because the parking areas a lit with orange parking lamps.  As I was looking around this large open area I noticed another light that was the same color as the parking lamps except it was hovering over the building across from me.  The distance from my building to that one is about 200 feet.  After it had registered in my brain that a light shouldn't be there another orange circle apeared next to this one.  They were stationary and silent.  From my view point the UFOs were just above the three story building.  At this point I yelled for my girl friend to come out side and bring my camera.  As she was coming outside three more UFOs appeared below the original two.  After a couple of seconds the bottom three dissappeared.  Then one of the remaining two vanished.  When they would dissappear they would vanish like a light bulb being turned of slowly with a dimmer switch.  Now only one remained.  A couple of seconds later it vanished, but reappeared only now it was in a different spot.  It moved a little more east than it original position.  It repeated this action two more times.  Than it vanished for good.   Both myself and my girlfriend witnessed this.   However, it was very short.   My digital camera didn't have enough time to turn on.

Possibly, but could 4 sets of eyes be playing tricks at the same time?  As I looked closer at the sky I could see many more of the same flikering colored lights mingled amongst the constilations.  Some seemed to be stationary while others moved slowly, almost unknownst.  Then I saw what appeared to be smaller white lights leaving a brighter flickering colors cluster!  My mind raced with curiosity and bewilderment, could this be UFOs??  The rest of the evening I couldn't keep my mind off of what could possibly be going on in the sky above, I found myself returning to the patio to see if there had been any changes?  Most of them hadn't moved all evening while others had and as I stood there for a long time I could tell that some moved slowly, most kind of hovered, moving back and forth and a couple traveled at greater speeds.  It's incredible!  They informed me that they and a few friends had been watching them for about 2 years!  As the morning drew closer, the lights moved higher in the sky, disappearing as the sun came up.  I have to admit that while I knew what we were watching I was still questioning what I had witnessed that night.  Since that night I have been watching and noticing that most are still in the same place while the constilations have traveled.  I know these are not stars!

We turned onto a main road then off onto the next road down from the one we turned off and drove up about a half mile and stopped. It had snowed during the day and the road was covered and a very light snow was falling.  We were looking behind us and near the end of the road alittle up from the main road we could see a white light that looked like it was a car with just its dome light on. It went off then came back on closer to us and then off and then we started to drive again. Looking back it seemed as if there was something right behind us, a black shadow of something and a red beam flashed by the truck.  We then came to a stop sign and turned left onto the road we live on, about 100 ft after turning it seemed like we were in a blizzard with snow flying heavy and blowing very hard. Our satellite radio lost reception during this. The blowing snow stopped after about 10-15 seconds and then totally stopped as if a helicopter had gone right over head.  There was no noise of any kind and we returned home 2 minutes later. 2 hours after arriving home there was a bright white light in the lower sky outside our house moving in circular patterns for about 40 minutes. My girlfriends mother witnessed this light it then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,42.7078,-77.8831

I noticed that the stars were blocked out in the middle and it was just black. The strobes were constant with no black out at all. The object was slowly moving from east to west/northwest. There was no sound at all. This object had to have been either very large or extremely close. I tend to believe that it was a combination of both. I opened my front door and called to my wife who was inside the house. She came out but the lights were to distant and she could not see them. She then called to me and stated ""did it look like that?"" I looked to the north east sky and saw a second group of lights that was exactly like the first and following the same path.

I grabbed my binoculars and found the object. The reason it seemed as though it was vibrating was because a red and blue light were tightly moving around another object with a bright white light on it. This is when I went outside. I went into my backyard and easily found the object again. I watched it for about 25 minutes. It just hung there in the same spot while the lights moved around. I was too far away to make any sound out, as it appeared to be hovering over Northern Waukegan. Trying to photograph it with my camera phone would have been pointless, so I didn't bother.

We sat looking at the stars for around an hour the event time listed is approximate, and we saw a few shooting stars as normal.  I lit a cigarette and over the opposite ridge from where we were sitting a large glowing disk shaped object emerged.   The object slowly drifted in our direction and within seconds was directly over our head.  The bottom of the craft looked like a mass of glowing jelly.  I know this sounds weird but hey its what I saw.  A greenish color that turned a turquoise blue at it’s edges.   We were standing there looking in amazement when a flash of light broke my concentration.  I looked to my girlfriend and she was as bewildered as I felt.  The cigarette in my hand was burnt to the butt and had burned my fingers to a red color...and of course it hurt like I was burnt.   How long did I observe the craft?  Were we abducted? Why don’t I remember the time it took for a full cigarette to burn or remember it burning my hand?

I had a feeling that I was going to see a ufo. (I have predicted the appearance of sightings I have had, due to a feeling I get, to which I have had all my life). The sky was blue - not hazy or cloudy - just blue. I noticed outof the drivers side window two jets flying in formation. The jets were very far away and were tiny - you could just make them out in front of their chem trails. I lit myself a cigarrette and watched the jets for a while, by now the jets were visible from the windscreen. I said to myself, that feeling must be just a coincidence (for the last  several sightings I have had) when out of the blue canopy a star shaped and star coloured object descended and hovered above the jets, (it was quite a long flight down for it)I was just thinking YES! when not 1 but three other crafts descended 1 by 1, identical to the first and just sat there hovering with the 1st. I was blown away by this but then the second and forth 'Stars' ascended back up through the blue canopy. Just as the first 'Star' started to ascend, the other 2 'Stars' came back down. Now there were three hovering. The first 'Star' re-descended and now all four were hovewring there. My Friend came out of the store and by now I had got out of the car and was leaning/sitting on the bonnet. I asked her to tell me what she could see in the distance, she replied, I quote: "" I can see two planes - why?"" I asked ""what do you see above the planes?"" She replied: "" I can see some stars - so what? You can see stars in the daytime sometimes!"" I asked: ""ok - what are the stars doing?"" She then became anxious and shouted: "" so what! I wanna get out of here, lets go, I don't want to be here!"" As it was my friends car, (I was driving for her)we had to go. Since this happened I have told people and although they think me insane I kinda knew that they would believe me once they heard my friend tell what happened. (she is a teacher and held in good regard and standing)So a couple of times we bumped into each other whilst I was with a person whom I had 'relieved'the story with and I asked her to tell. Her reply has been, on both occaisions: I don't want to talk about it!"" This is not a story but a true account of 1 of my many sightings, it isn't just the fact that I see a fair few ufo phenomenon it's the fact that I predict their appearance.

I said good bye to the few people I new and headed out the front gate and up the football field drive to the PCH.  I was parked (my 1990 black Bronco) across facing North on the road before me.  The road was dark and there was no one or a car around.  I walked across the road and went to open the drivers side door and get in.  Simple enough.  Not thinking of anything but getting home.  But rather then getting in the truck before I even opened the door the last think I remember were my feet lifting and my balance going backward like I was slipping but my feet we already off the ground.  Then everything in my mind went black.  The first part is not that scary but it is the next part that I have trouble sharing.  I do not remember an abduction or aliens of a ship nothing.

Since I live on a farm with my parents, I have to get up to do chores in the morning, and I do the same at night. During the winter months, it is usually dark at those times, so the night sky can be visible if it isn't cloudy.  On several occasions, I have witnessed a bright yellow-orange light off to both the east and west of our house, which remains stationary for a period of about ten minutes. One particular evening, the object appeared in the southwestern sky, clearly visible in the twilight. I observed it slowly (very, very slowly) moving from south to north for a period of about ten minutes (to hazard a guess, I would say it moved about an inch from my perspective in the sky). I walked into our barn to feed our animals, and about three minutes later when I walked out, the object was due west, having moved significantly in that short amount of time.  It can also be observed off to the southeast sometimes in the morning, and it usually does the same thing. Look away for a few minutes, and it will have moved significantly across the sky.  I know for sure that it isn't a form of aircraft (such as the MedFlight that flies around every now and again) because there was no sound emitted. The light is also very intense, and it never blinks. In addition, there are no major airports anywhere near us, only a small one across town that houses small aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

On July 13th or the 14th 2003 around between 8-8:30 pm in Licking county, Ohio, I walked outside my home and the very first thing I did was look up into the sky like I always do to see anything out of the ordinary.This time I got my wish! As I walked down my porch steps,I looked up. Then I turned to my left towards my dog,I pet him everytime I go outside. That's when I looked up again as ususal,This time I saw an airplane up in the sky.It wasn't one of them small 4 passenger but one of them huge airliners that carry abut 100 I suppose?...Anyway,I have never in my life seen an airplane fly so low to the ground before and that alone caught my attention right away.If I wanted to I could have counted all the windows on one side if I felt like it but seeing it so low below the clouds and closer to the ground was more interesting than that.  As the plane was flying on by,I noticed this tiny white dot come out of nowhere up from behind it.As the plane was moving south bound this white dot came into better view for me.To make a better description what I saw, This white turned into a 3-layer grey oval shapped ball of light.It literally followed along side this huge plane for about I'm guessing 10-15 miles?I estimated how long a mile is on the ground then took that measurement in the sky and calculated there.I watched them both fly off till I could no longer see either of them.This grey oval shaped ball of light,I'm guessing very hard here,was about 1/4 % size of that plane itself. Uusually I can hear airplanes,helicoptors in the sky,even many miles before they are even close to my area.This plane that was side-tailed by an unknown flying object was about 2-3 miles from the ground up.And I heard NO sound what so ever period.The only reason I even happen to witness this event was bacause I am always looking up in the sky dan and night for anything out of the ordinary,if it wasn't for my interest in ufos and aliens,I would have probably not seen none of this.  This grey ball of light never moved out of track while near the plane.It stayed in a very straight line all the way along till out of sight.the distance between the ball of light and the plane was probably between 70-100 feet.neither the plane or the object made any sound. My strong opinion that the grey ball of light wasn't a missle cause the object would have smacked right into the plane therefore causing an explosion,There was no impact and the object was like I said a few good feet away.It wasn't no cloud cause I have never seen in my life a cloud so round,grey or actually move so perfectly in a line like that,plus at speed? I don't think so.Not to mention that day there were hardly no clouds in the sky to begin with.Myabe a couple here n there but that's it. It wasn't no shadow cause there was no ground to bounce off from and the plane was no where near the shape of this object.  Basically that day I saw for the first time an actual ufo.And there was even an airplane right along side with it to know for sure that object wasn't an airplane!

I focused my attention to that part of the sky and this ""star"" was stationary in one position then seemed to turn off and immediately reappear in another fixed location in the sky. this continued for several minutes each time the ""star"" would do this appearing and reappering in the same two spots each time, it seemed to stay in the original position that it was first spotted in for a longer time than the other.

It was july 1st, 2003. my brother was over his friend's house. he said he noticed a ""red oval object"" followed him ever since he noticed it floating over the dark sky. when he arrived home, he was filled with excitement, he yelled ""UFO, i saw a red ufo in the sky"" Then he told us to go outside to see it. We were in our backyard.  There it was, the object looked like a ""Red fire ball"" floating in the cloudless dark sky. it didn't made any sounds. thus it floated in a circular rotation. it did this for about 10 minutes. we walked toward a bit. the object seemed to move towards us, that's when we paniked. we went back inside the house. we were just watching it from our windows. The object didn't look like a ""red fire ball"" anymore. it looks rather more like a space ship. the object now looked like a flat pancake, but it looked as two flat bowls were on top on one another.it had many different lights. and different colors. the top lights were yellow, the spinned in a revolutionary way(circular motions)  the bottom lights were blinding yellow and white. the didn't blink or anything, they just were blinding all the time. Me, my brother and sister were amazed as we watched the craft hover a bit closer to our house. we NEVER saw anything like this. it couldn't be a plane or helicopter; planes do not hover around in circular motions for quite an amount of time, and helicopters tend to make sound.  anyway, the object was there; a flat pancake looking craft with a bunch of lights. the color of the craft was also metallic. As the craft got closer, we began to panic even more.  Me,my sister, and brother were nervous because it was floating closer and closer above our house. so we rushed and closed the windows fast, i was the one who closed the last window and i saw IT very very close above the house. it had so many lights from the bottom area of the craft. i stood still, then after i closed the last window, a Very LOUD humming sound was heard, the whole house shook for about 5 seconds, we froze , not moving, just looking at eachother's eyes. the whole house vibrating.. and a loud humming sound was heard, even our dog was still when this happened. objects also fell from the counter tops. After those 5 seconds, i looked outside the window and the UFO was gone. We never had this odd experience before. Me, my sister and brother questioned eachother with confusion. we asked eachother ""what the hell just happened? did you hear and feel that?"" i asked both of them ""did you hear that humming sound! you guys didn't move""  we couldn't sleep that night, we kept all the lights on in case that weird Object returned, we were freaked out. we were just thinking of it. but this affected me more than it did to them..  After a few days after that Ufo incident, i began having weird dreams. i had these ""episode-like dreams""  everytime i would go to bed after this incident happened, i would be afraid of sleeping with the lights off, or even having the window of the bathroom open.  Anyway, 3 nights after i saw the Ufo, i had this weird dream:  i layed in bed, after i fell asleep, i was blinded with a realy bright white light. i was laying on the surface. i woke up(in my dream) then i walked for white a long time, i felt fatigue and tired. the light was also foggy. then i noticed something pulled me into corridor.  Ok, after that happened, i woke up from my sleep. then i thought ""what the hell was that all about""?  the next time,  i had another dream, but the weird thing about this was that, it continued. Ok this is what happened after i fell asleep the next night:  i was pulled into a corridor, i just felt something grabbing my arm, but couldn't see who it was. The corridor was rather foggy, the temperature felt warm, too. after that, something pushed me to the floor. the floor was warm and moist(something liked a jungle floor) i looked around the area, the area was steamy, foggy.. it had a bunch of wiring around. also it had many many lights and different corridors or tunnels. the area i was in was rather circular and large.  ( i assumed i was in some type of room) after this happened i woke up.  Ok, this was getting a bit disturbing, i told my mom about this.. but then again, most people dislike to believe in these things. so i didn't told anyone else because they wouldn't listen.. the next night, i didn't wanted to fall asleep, but i did.. this was the most frightful nightmare i ever had..the dream was the continuation of my dream i said above.. it resulted this:  i opened my eyes, in the same room, but i was laying on top of a surface. i couldn't move, my legs, arms were weakened. all i saw was a foggy place.. the top ceiling was wiring and lights. this was the same big circular room. All of the sudden, i felt a hand touching my arm. i began noticing sounds around me. then i saw these creatures, About 4 of them.. They were tall, thin, they had slanted blueish eyes(asian looking). they were purplish transparent, No hair or facial features, just a slit for a mouth and two small dots that made out their nose. but since it was foggy, i couldn't make them up more what they looked like. Ok, this is going to be more bizarre.. the creatures were communicating by making ""gargling"" - like noises.  then i thought ""what the hell is going on""? i was a bit dazed. after i heard their communication, i again... woke up. the last thing i saw was a hand coming close to my eyes.  that was the last dream i had about this.. after that i kept drawing things of my dream experience. i do not know anyone with this effect. my sister and brother were also witnesses of the UFO incident that we saw in July 1st, 2003. i asked them if they had nightmare of aliens or ufos or being abducted. they replied with a ""No"" i guess i was the only one affected. Also, i never met anyone who has gone through this. however, i did see people on television with this same experiences ; ""Seeing a UFO, then having ufo nightmares of being abducted in their dreams"" after seeing this in television i was shocked.. the t.v. program was called ""unexplained mysteries""  that is all i can remember for now. please i would like to keep my self annonymous. I did NOT make this up, i didn't type all this for the ""hell of it"" and spent my time in it for nothing.. ALL that was typed above was my personal experience.. I do not have any fotographs of the craft i saw.. i just have sketches and drawings of the craft i saw in july 1st 2003 and sketches/drawings of the creatures i saw in my dreams.. thank you for reading and listening.  as i said above.. i want to keep my self Annonymous.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,33.957283606557375,-118.35592349726777

I stepped outside onto the deck at the rear of the house to let my dog out at 3:00AM.  Like I always do, I looked up to check out the sky.  It was cloudy directly above me but was only 50% cloudy (cumulous) with big breaks in between clouds. In the breaks between the clouds the sky was clear and I could see the stars very well. When I looked up I saw a round dim-lighted area in the clouds resembling a searchlight hitting the clouds.  Then I noticed it was flashing, at the time it was a consistant flash (one second on, one second off)but was inconsistent at times, too.  I was still wondering why a searchlight would be on so late and then it got to the edge of the cloud and was in the clear.  I was surprised though that it still appeared to be a round flashing cloud (pea-sized at arms length).  It was now in the middle of a clear sky with no clouds coming.  That's when I decided to get a better look at it.  I stepped inside and grabbed my binoculars that I keep in a cupboard right inside the door.  This took less then 5 seconds and when I stepped back out there were swirls of clouds covering it.  These clouds had a cirrus look but had a defined outer edge (multi-curved)and washed out like a smear toward the flashing cloud.  At this point I had to show someone so I went and woke two family members.  They came out and at this point it had moved to the next cloud blowing by.  The cloud it made was just dissapating but still visible.  My family saw what I had been seeing confirming that I'm not seeing thing's.  We watched it for another half hour.  It never moved more than six to eight inches (at arms length)never making a sound but continuing to flash.  After the half hour it went behind a cloud and we lost track of it.  Twenty or so seconds passed and I heard a low whooshing sound that lasted about ten seconds.  After a couple of minutes of no sign of it my family went back to bed.  I stayed outside and about 20 minutes later I saw it again.  This time it was not flashing and was hiding! on the edges of the clouds until the cloud moved a distance and then it would meander to the next cloud coming.  I saw this with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  It was still visible because a circle sticks out againt a backdrop of blurry shapes.  Anyway I watched it jump clouds for about five more minutes until it disappeared again.  I continued looking for it and about a minute later I heard the whooshing sound to my left (west).  Looking up I saw what appeared to be typical FAA lights of a plane/jet at about the same altitude as what I was watching but a few miles away.  I looked through my binoculars at the lights and could only see lights, no craft.  Then it either turned off it's lights or took off because I took down the binoculars and it was nowhere to be seen. I don't know what I saw but it was definately some sort of craft.  I live about ten-fifteen miles away from Selfridge ANGB and witnessed what I believe to be four Black Manta TR3A's (another bizarre occurance)back in '94 so I do leave the possibility open to it being a black project.

I was born and raised in Craig Colorado and now reside in Southern Illinois. In the report the subject claimed ""i noticed a unusual beam of light to the west shining over the Rockies."" Now as a former resident of this town, and someone to have knowelge in geography, the Rockie Mountains are to the East of Craig, and not to the west. Now the writer may have meant hey noticed the lights to the West of the Rockie Mountains, and not to the West of Craig, but I don't know for I wasn't there. I do know when I lived out there I whitnessed UFO's, it was a green streaking glowing light travlening from the North to the south, so I'm not trying to say the individual didn't say anything, but may his directions were wrong. If I wouldn't have seen something with my own eyes there I would say he is crazy, so I hope with this either he re-thinks where he say the lights, or if he saw anything at all. I'm sure visitors do go there, but I believe our friend may have his directions crossed or he saw nothing at all.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.6762,-107.8126

Well early this morning I was outside getting some fresh air and at the end of this field I saw a bright light that was tree top level.  At first I thought that it was a helicopter that was coming my way but it made no noise and it was moving around like a butterfly would. As I watched it I thought that someone had a kite with a flashlight hooked onto it or something because that is what it resembled but then I could also see a few blinking lights onto the side or back of it.  It was hard to actually see the craft itself because of the light facing my way. But I could see that there was a dark shape around the light like some wings sticking out.  I kept watching it and it kept fluttering around in a small area so I debated whether to run inside and get the binoculars or stay outside. Well I started to feel a little creepy being that I was well out in the open field so I came inside to get the binoculars and before I could get them up to my eyes this object took off quickly out of sight.  It moved to my right and up and was gone. It went from fluttering to a hard straight move without sound so I know that it was not a helicopter.  I also felt that it knew I was watching and at one point I had to look away because I felt that my eyes would burn from the light.  So that's all for now. Can't wait for the big to be over to get all of the updates and new entrys.  As always.... Believer  P.S.

Doing yard work, clear (some clouds) sunny afternoon.  Took a break and looked up, saw what looked like an all white sheet of paper traveling at high speed over my head approximate size of a quarter at arms length.  Object was heading almost due west.   Object changed shape to an imperfect boomerang shape as it slowed way down, then it changed to an imperfect triangular shape with rounded corners.  Continued to slow down to a crawl as it got much, much smaller.  I am assuming it was climbing very fast not just getting smaller but it appeared to get smaller. Then it appeared to be a perfect round all white dot from below as it came to almost a complete stop at a very high altitude. It may have been a white sphere but there was no dimension, no shadow. It began to speed up again and went near to the sun (from my vantage point). I covered the sun with my left hand and could still see the white dot quite clearly two to three inches from the sun.  It then got smaller and smaller until it was almost out of sight.  It then appeared as if a dark area was surrounding it in a larger flat circle, but this was very faint, just prior to it climbing out of my sight.  What is odd are the feelings I got when observing this object.  First off, it had no apparent dimension, no shadows against itself as you see with an aircraft, it was like a cartoon cell image in the sky yet it was there, not an illusion or a reflection. Secondly, it was traveling in a manner that it seemed that our atmosphere was neither aiding it nor preventing it from climbing out of sight at an incredible rate, again like watching a cartoon.  It was not following the rules that we have to follow in our atmosphere.  Thirdly, when it did slow down and speed up, it appeared as if it was being pulled from behind to slow it down and again pulled from the front to speed it up. This is just a feeling I got, I cannot expalin it.  It moved in a manner that I have never seen.  I am a commercially rated helo pilot and have been to a lot of air sh! ows and NEVER seen anything move like this.

This light shifted to white and brightened considerably as it traveled low in the southwest to southeast. This light was not a jet... too fast actually... but it was moving in the direction of Eglin Air Force Base. I really don't believe it was a jet because of its peculiar lighting and fast movement. It flared like a satellite too...but it just didn't seem like a satellite.  I may have seen the so-called Eglin space plane... mentioned in some aviation circles.

(I Had read the day before in the ""Orange County Register"" that a European Satellite was being made to crash land on the moon and that the Impact Flash would be seen from Orange County) Since I did not see anything different with the moon, I scanned the whole night sky for any stars or planes or any other peculiar object.  To my surprise, I saw a bright Star just north of 90 degrees (from the top of my head)  At first I thougt it Was Mars or Jupiter because It gave out a really bright orange, almost Copper like Glow. As I watched it, all of a sudden it got really bright, and then it seemed to have had a burst of light from one side, and something like fire or some debris seemed to be expulsed from it and began to freefall, and as it did, it began to loose its glow. If you ever seen fireworks as the sparks began to freefall and loose their fire glow, that is almost what it looked like, but this definitely was thousands of feet up in the air. My Significant other saw it too, and she thought it was high enough to have been a satellite, but neither of us have seen a satellite that stays static up in space.  I don't know if this bright object that we saw, was deploying another object or if it had been hit by something else causing it to be damaged and loose material from it. this happened just in a matter of seconds, by the time it was over, my friend had opened the door, and when we looked up again it was gone. I believe that if whatever came off that object crashed or landed on earth, it must have been happened in the Yorba linda or Fullerton Hills in Orange County.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,33.805629234338745,-117.8263324825986

The object seemed to have a ""tail"", like a comet, and had the appearance of being on fire.   Two more objects followed, travelling the same path in succession.  The fourth object followed the same path as the first three, and was closesly followed by the fifth object, which appeared to be closer and/or larger, and travelled east to west on a slightly more southerly path.   The fifth object was shaped more like a lemon and a small light was visible tracing the perimeter, clockwise, then counter-clockwise, and repeating.   Several of us reported the sighting to three Conservation Officers at the State Park, who had also seen the objects, and stated that we were among 40 or more people who had reported the event.   The Officers contacted the United States Coast Guard to inquire about the objects, and they were told that no USCG personnel had witnessed the event.

My first impression was that it was a weather balloon, but it remained overhead for almost an hour with little descernable motion. I pondered whether it was a distant supernova, but have heard nothing over the astronomy news. It looked to be above the troposphere. I say this only as a former meteorologist. There is the slight chance it was a passing asteriod, which I have heard rumors of, but am not sure it was visible during the day.  The little motion I observed was in a NNE direction by no more than 5 degrees for duration of sighting. Eventually, I had to get back to surveying the area, and had to step in a building for an hour or so. The light was not visible when I tried to reaquire it an hour later.  My partner observed the same anomoly, but thought nothing of it. We have not mentioned it since.  Local military air traffic showed no interest in it, either. I watched numerous flights depart the Air Force base only to practice formations and usual touch and go's.  I have released countless weather balloons and tracked their paths across the sky. Never have I observed one shoot straight up, nor remain relatively motionless for an hour. Jet streams and upper level winds usually take the balloon out of sight, or the balloon pops when reaching high altitude.  I do not think it was a UFO (ET), a star, nor a balloon. Stars move west. This object drifted no more than 5 degrees NNE in an hour. Balloons pop or move rapidly to the east after reaching altitudes of 30,000ft and up.

I noticed a little to my right just a few degrees west of due south, just above the horizon, a shiny object.  This was no ordinary object.  It was long, very narrow, and silver, and standing up-right, and seemed to be somewhat pointed on each end, but it was hard to tell exactly because of the second or two that the sighting lasted. I thought it might have been a reflection, but I could also tell it was far away as I could compare it against other objects such as power lines, and telephone poles, and commercial buildings.  This has to be one of the oddest things I’ve seen, I don’t see too many of these reports shown on the web sites. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

We have students at home, 3 of them, one of the students was coming back and parked his car in the street, when he saw a metallic bright sphere floating in the middle of the tree we have at the left of the house, well, more exactly, behind the tree, over the terrain lot to the left of the house. As he saw the object coming down, he decided to move the car to the street around the corner, and watched from there. At that very moment, I decided to go and buy a sandwich at subways, so I went outside to open the car, when I looked above me the object was exactly over my head, 5 meters above me, I just saw a round shinny red or strong orange shape, with fire in the bottom. I will try to explain: the object, that I saw in detail, was expelling an orange light, like you will see in the pics, but had a shinny metallic cover because I could see the fire reflecting in the cover. I knocked in the window so everybody that was inside the house in the kitchen, came outside they all saw it, I tried to take a pic but failed, but one of the students took 3 that I later increased dpi to get a bigger image of the objects. The first object started to move and just vanished moments later, but a 2nd object appeared exactly over the house and started to move to the point where the first object vanished, it was across the street, but it avoided the house in front of mine, at an horizontal distance of 10 meters, vanished in the air, then a 3rd object appeared, all identical, the 3rd object did exactly the same.  One after another, at that point, everybody already freaked, we were yelling, my mother went inside, to her room, one of the students suffered a shock because he tought the ufos didn't exist, so he suffered a thrauma, this was his first experience, but it was my experience number 30 approximately LOL",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

I used a vhs camera rather than a digital becaues I did not want pixelation to interfere with what I was filming.  Some time later I went and bought a dvd vcr player to transfer the film to dvd so I could view it on High Definition big screen TV. From above the bart station in Pittsburg, the view was over the area where the pittsburg power plant was located.  Behind this some distance away sits the Suisin marsh to the left and to the right the Travis Airforce base.  As before the area observed seemed to be floating above the earth, you could see the thermal windmills beneath it.  It seems to be organic in nature and takes up an immense amount of space.  As sunrise advances you can see the sun rising between the earth and this thing, the sun shining behind the thermal windmills.  This particular morning there appeared to be some sort of accident that kept the thing from cloaking.  Before as the sun came up and started over the horizon, you could only see it while it was just rising, after it got up a bit in the sky, it seemed to cloak itself, I caught this on film in July, as soon as the sun hit a specific point, it dissappeared completely, and looked to be a patch of burn off or smog that never leaves no matter what time of day it is.  just an orangeish smear across the sky until the next sunrise.  At first I thought it might be a hallucination caused by plasma or water in the sky reflecting something that was on the earth somewhere, however I have studied the area, even using satellite images of the entire area and can find nothing that looks similar on the ground in a 50 mile radius.  Anyway on this day, what people tried to convince me was a cloud, had an accident that made impact on this ""cloud"".  You could still see the thermal windmills underneath this object, but on top of it was definitely a crash site.  There were two spiraling stacks of smoke coming up from the place where it impacted?  Five of the b! igger cr aft we had seen before were ""circled"" around the crash site.  It was windy that morning, however nothing in that direction was moving with the wind.  The smoke spirals stayed where they were for quite some time.  The other craft which looked like a measure of ""jet stream"" except they were luminous, and brightly lit, instead of staying flat horizontal to the earth, were all in the sky above the crash site, bovering in one place sitting dexter and sinister to the earth, tilted diagonally. Smaller craft were seen on the film we took of it after slowing it down  to the slowest point we could without going frame by frame, film taken of these before revealed what we could not see because they moved that fast.  Where I could see sparks showing up in the high sky with the naked eye, slowed down you could see they were some type of flying craft, that would enter and leave the larger craft.  I tried to find any news release about activity that morning for several weeks, and finally found a report where they had reported that a flying craft had crashed into the Suisin marsh.  the area of land where we keep seeing these things, are across the Sacramento River, and there is an area there of swamp and island marsh type land where at one time supposedly toxic waste had been dumped.  Whether or not this is true I dont know, it doesnt look healthy.  However that land is still viewed below where the thermal windmills are located.  And since the sun comes up and can be seen between the thermal windmills and whatever it is that floats out there and cloaks itself at sunrise, I am inclined to believe this is something else entirely, and not only that it appears to be organic in nature.  The film caught in July shows structures built on it, towers with strange large ball shaped things stuck to them, and several craft on platforms that tilt diagonally just before they project themselves into the air at such a velocity, all you can see is an instant of a streak accompanied by what may appear to be a spark when the sunlight shines off their hull.  Recently I finally found someone with a large screen HD TV, (A retired school teacher) and I was able to take the film I had saved to DVD with me to view with them. This definitely is not a cloud. And there definitely are structures there, and I dont know about the craft, but they look like flattened pac-men, and appear to be a bit beat up, however that may be a part of their camoflauge.  To glance at them if you dont really LOOK at them I suppose some might try to say they were cloud formations, however each one are identical to the other, and it shows several of them ""grounded"" and several more that take off or dissappear.  With the wind blowing at the rate it was, which you can see by the swaying trees also in the picture, this ""cloud"" did not move in July, nor has it moved since.  Its like a cloaked organic structure that is always there, with craft that come and go.  It is not Travis Airforce base, nor is it swampgas.  Its not morning afterburn or fog, and its not in a place where there would be a large amount of fog.  I am surprised after my posts that I have not heard any feedback.  My friend who lives at the house where we shot the film also has a lot of footage of this phenomenon, including the craft that crashed and the five surrounding craft that hovered overhead at diagonal stances.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,38.028,-121.8847

After my report on November 18, 2007, of three spheres over the Phoenix skies.  I became exited and intrigued about my coincidential UFOs sighting; thus I started to keep a watchful eye more frequently on the skies.  Also, since my first sighting happened at 3pm during the day, I only watch the sky during the day; not having the need to watch at night, since night observations make easier to confuse ordinary lights with UFOs. ******** SUNDAY NOVEMBER 19, 2006 ********** Still excited about the sighting on the previus day; while my wife and daughter went to church, I stayed home, I went to the backyard around 1pm, at the beginning I didn't see anything, but after 10 minutes of watching, I could see a white spec to the North at 80°, after a little while it became more visible since it descended more becoming a metallic sphere, the altitude was higher than the flight of a commercial airline plane.  The sphere travelled for 3 minutes Southbound until it dissapeard and it was reflecting the sunligh in flicks giving the impression of being a rotating object... ********* THURSDAY NOVEMBER 23, 2006 ******** We went to Tucson, AZ to spend Thanksgiving with relatives... We arrived to Tucson on Wednesday night, and on Thursday around noon while the Turkey was being prepared I went outside to my relatives' backyard; The house is located in South Tucson close to Irvington Road and Benson Highway... The day was a nice with some light clouds on the skies; and again after watching for a while, I was facing Southwest and I saw this bright metallinc, aluminum like, sphere coming down slowly from the clouds at 60°; I called my cousin's boyfriend and he put his sunglasses on and we could see the UFO flying high from Southwest to Northeast towards the Catalina mountains until it dissapeared without descending.  We could see this object for around three minutes and again, it appeared to have a rotating motion, since the sunligth w! ould ref lect on its body and flicker once in a while.  ********* SUNDAY DECEMBER 10, 2006 **********  I was in my house, located in West Phoenix, watching TV.  I could hear a helicopter's noise flying low in the neighborhood; I came outside to the backyard, and noticed that the helicopter was two blocks East of my house; flying in circles; it was giving orders to someone on the ground thru the speakers; then I turn my sight Northeast at 75° and saw this metallic sphere stationary way up there, I went inside to get my wife, but she didn't want to come out, because she's tired of me looking for UFOs; when I came outside again, the spehere was not in there anymore, then I turned North-Northwest and I found it at a much lower altitude at 45°, and I definitely could appreciate an oval shape and reflecting sunlight, I ran inside the house to get a videocamera; a cheap Panasonic Mini DV53, when I came outside the UFO wasn't in there anymore and the helicopter had moved four blocks south of my house and it still was flying in circles.  I look around for a while, and turned my head up 90°, and there it was right above me.  I tried to focuse it with the videocamera but it wasn't in there anymore; I looked for it and I found it East at 75° and it had ascended; I wasn't able to get a shot of it, but it definitely was in there; I finally got tired and went back into the house; The event lasted at least 10 minutes....  ********* WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 13, 2006 *********   I went to pick up my 6 years old daughter at school, she gets released at 2:40pm, I always get there 10 to 15 minutes early, and while I wait for her, I scan the skies looking for ""my friends"", it was a nice day, sunny with a few light clouds, at 2:39pm, I noticed the metallic sphere appear East-Northeast at 75°; there's always a bunch of people picking up theird kids, and I watch around to see if anyone notices what I'm watching; noone is watching, I assume noone is into this, noone would care.  The UFO travelled right above us as I picked my daughter, it took ! around t wo minutes since it appeared and dissapeared on its path...  ******** SUNDAY DECEMBER 16, 2006 ********** My brother and his family came to visit, it's been over a month since I've been watching the skies looking and spotting UFOs, and he's not aware of my activity yet...  He needed some tools because he was going to do some work on his car; I was on the driveway getting tools out of my car; I noticed the UFO East at 80°, my brother came out, then I tell him, about some events over the last month, he scratches his hair, by now the UFO has moved farther East and it's visible at 45° over my neighbors tree. I didn't tell him about it, and then he spot it, and he asked ""Like that one?"". I just smiled and replied to him, ""Yes, just like that one"". ******** I must disclose that since the first sighting I've watch similar UFOs in at least 9 different times; however, since the time my brother saw that one, I'm not able to see one more sighting.  Also, I've been able to find video of similar sightings...  check them and judge for yourselves....

But, as it moved there were a few lights on the bottom and I knew I was no longer looking at stars.

I work on the Tempe/ Phoenix line at the corner of Priest and Washington Streets. This location is approximatley 3-4 miles East Northeast of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. My office and viewing location are directly under the landing flight path of westbound landing flights at Skyharbor. This particular occurance is a repeat and has been repeated for a total of at least 10-12 occurances at this location. On this day at approximatley 2:15 pm I was in my car in my parking lot at work. I was skywatching as I have been seeing various orbs ( black and white ), strobing cylinders , and one saucer like object for the previous 2 months. When I say 2 months that is only when I started looking at this location. The first object was a definite saucer shape..white on top and black on the bottom. The object drifted and wobbled Northeast for about 10-12 minutes at a fairly slow clip before it faded away in the sky. No sooner had the first object faded away when it was followed by a larger, white orb which was traveling slightly faster going more due east, vs northeast as the first object was going. Due to the clear sky and no reference objects in the sky..ie other planes or clouds..I could not judge the distance of the objects. They are either quite large and quite high up, or relatively small at low altitudes. They produce no noise. The are very similiar to the objects seen in CNUFOS.COM..which is done by local Phoenix resident. I have had at least 10 days observing these objects over a course of a few months. This is only given that I go out and watch one hour and day at the same time of day and even then I don't go watch every day. On any given day I will see one to three objects within a few minutes of each other. I have not seen any travel together or tandem. Since these events occur so very close to the flight paths..either takeoff or landing at one of the nations busiest airports, I am surprised there is not more investigation from local FAA authorities simply for the sake of passenger safety alone. I make no claim that these objects are extraterristial, however they do not appear to resemble any manmade objects that I am familiar seeing. Even in the event that these objects are simply "" balloons "" ..the frequency and proximity to a major US airport should alert someone in a position of authority to keep an active watch on the skies to avoid a potential air tragedy.  I hope this summary is helpful to other residents or aviators in the area, either on the basis of interest in the subject or minimally for air safety as a precaution.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

Green lights from georgia to Minnesota?,South St. Paul,MN,2006-12-03T18:30:00,light,2.5 hrs,"Occurred : 12/3/2006 18:30  (Entered as : 12/3/2006 18:30) Reported: 12/26/2006 5:36:52 PM 17:36 Posted: 2/1/2007 Location: South St. Paul, MN Shape: Light Duration:2.5 hrs",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54162.html,"Green lights from georgia to Minnesota? May be related to the Georgia Green Light Case. We left the BP Gas station near the intersection of US HWY 10 and Jamaica Ave S in Cottage Grove, MN At approx 1830 hrs. We were headed NW direction on US HWY 10 from Cottage Grove, MN towards St. Paul, MN. As we were driving past the exit for 80th St and US Hwy 10 the sky above the refinery became visible. The sky was overcast, dark and a fine mist was in the air, the temperature was above freezing, perhaps in the low 40s. My daughter Kourtney (14) and I (34-M) were in the front seat while my son Chris (12) was in the back of our Durango SUV. My daughter and I could see a distinct Green Light that appeared to be sourced within the clouds or a bit below, shining down, and flashing as if taking pictures.  The light was a dull Green color that repeatedly flashed sometimes from slightly different positions over the Marathon refinery. This green beam was a dull color that did not reveal its source. We could see only the hint of a shadow with no definete outline. The mist helped to show the definete beam shape ( like  a spotlight) as it aimed for the ground.  As each flash of the light occured, the vapor that was in the ""beam"" during the flash became charged and glowed like an Ionized gas. These towers or columns of light (possibly ionized gas or mist)remained much brighter than the source that appeared to be creating them. In the three to four minutes that it takes to drive towards the refinery we saw perhaps ten to fifteen formed.  As we got closer to the refinery the columns of light/ gas floated away from the refinery in an eastern direction at the wind speed. I would estimate this to be about fifteen to twenty miles an hour with a lower elevation of approximately 1500 feet and a terminal elevation of 2000 feet. they were that tall...  Also the lights seemed to be overpowered by the refineries bright tower lights. as our eyes adjusted to the brightness, it became harder to see. I doubt anyone at the refinery would have noticed these at all.  There were no spotlights at the refinery either, which  I looked for as some kind of explanation. As we passed the refinery, they seemed to disappear. I continued to my destination (near downtown St. Paul) and spotted the lights forming again on my return.  This time the green light seemed to be a pale white or yellow light (like a sodium lamp color) but still the columns of gas/mist would form and glow and float away from the refinery, for miles! This second sighting was approximately 1900-1910 hours.  I was alone so I returned home and picked up my wife (36) my step daughter (16) and my friend Mike (38) and we returned to as parking lot in Newport, MN (across the highway from the refinery) and watched these lights form repeatedly. At one point the lights were so numerous they looked like a photo of a ""galactic center"" with neboulous clouds and colors. This peak of activity occured around 2010-2030 hours with all of us witnessing these columnsof light.  A few columns appeared over the inver grove heights river valley, and some of these ""stragglers"" flew directly over our head at this time. They looked like florescent lightbulbs- sort of. We listened with the windows open and did not hear a sound coming from the sky. by 2040 hours, the lights were gone and most of the columns had blown away with the wind.  The approximate lattitude/ Longitude location of the refinery is:  44.51.08 N 93.00.10 W  our observation point where the columns flew over us:  44.52.28 n 93.00.02 w  The columns that flew  above us originated approx:  44.52.23 n 93.01.17 w  I did see a dark streak shoot across the lower cloud elevation suddenly at the termination of the event which was not observed by the others.  No electrical effects were observed.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

She was frightened and hurried back to bed. She tried to wake me, but I was sound asleep. She laid there still with her eyes open. After a few minutes, there was a bright light that shined in the bedroom window. She said it was so bright, it lit the room up like daylight. It lasted just a few seconds. after a minute she got up to look out the window. She said see saw a couple of shadows moving around in the woods. She then woke me up and explained what she saw and heard. I looked out the window and went down-stairs but didn't see or hear anything.

It was 02:30 (London Time) and according to the in flight map provided by the airline we were apprx 200 miles SE from Halifax. We were at 38000 feet and travelling NE at apprx 548 MPH. The plane was a Boeing 757 and I was sitting in Row 15 seat F.  I noticed a bright orange glow on a cloud which must have been at least 10 miles away. The sky was clear above the scattered cumulous which reached up to about 1000ft below our altitude. I do not remember seeing  the moon.  At first I thought it was just inner cloud lightning but thought this was odd because of the bright orange color. As I continued to watch I saw an intense bright orange sphere of light which was smaller than the size of a pea from that distance. The sphere hung in the air and did not climb or decend and remained at about 10 miles. The object lit up the cloud behind it with a bright orange glow similer to athe glow achieved by a fireplace. It was orange. The object remained very bright. Almost laser bright.  I spoke to the lady sitting next to me in seat 15D and asked her if she could see the same thing. She agreed. She could not guess what it could be. We both watched as the object remained and we moved Eastward. We watched for at least 5 to 7 minutes.  The object then started to desend through the cloud causing the glow to follow down against the clouds behind it. The object desended vertically through the clouds.  After about another 4 minutes we lost site of the object but the glow took longer to disappear.  I did consider that I had witnessed an inflight collision but on landing in London there were no reports of air accidents.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

After approx. 5-6 min. of sitting still the smaller light darts directly toward the brighter larger light. Larger light grows slightly brighter and darts away into the sky while second light stays. Second light stays in position until we can no longer see the lights. Later on at approx. 3-4 am we are driving back into town, of course I'm all freaked so my eyes are on the sky. Me and driver (3rd person now at home) spot a dim blue glowing object moving slowly against the wind through the clouds.  After approx. 10 sec. it brightens slightly and we distinctly see the object dart through the clouds and into the sky. Seems as if these sightings occur only in those locations at certain times late at night. In my opinion it is impossible that they were planes due to their movement, appearance and behavior. Objects spotted near airport, Bell Helicoptor and Pantex so maybe they're OURS. Thank you for allowing me to report this sighting.

One travelled just laterally across the sky right to left and disappeared under our roofline. Its apparent velocity was very fast. Another then rose above the roof line at right and seemed to travel towards the other 3 which had maintained a constant position. The 3 lights looked as if they were gaining a lot of altitude as they were getting very slightly dimmer and smaller over the period of time that they were visible. They eventually faded out abruptly The other light continued to move diagonally towards the triangular formation but never got near and at one point kinked its travel back towards the right very quickly before continuing to travel right to left and up.

Just short of 2:00, while driving home from work, I witnessed strange lights in my rear-view mirror. At first, I thought it was a police car pulling me over for a routine traffic stop, but that was not the case. When I came to a stop sign, I looked back, and I saw the lights floating in the air. I put my vehicle in park and stepped outside of my vehicle to get a better look and that’s when I saw the shape of the craft.  It was a triangular shaped craft. The points of the triangle were rounded. The lights, the color that I can only explain as being a “yellow that was almost white”, were just on the inside of the angle of the points.  The craft appeared to be rotating, floating still in the air. From where I was parked, the craft appeared to be approximately five hundred meters away, in area on the outskirts of my town, known as Meadow Creek, which is on the south end of town.  From where I was, the craft appeared to be approximately the size of a small sedan; perhaps the size of mine (Chevrolet Corsica).  After witnessing the craft, I immediately rushed home to grab my digital camera to take a picture of it. When I returned to where I had seen the craft, it was gone.  This report is being filled out at 2:25 on the same day that I witnessed the craft, so I do not know if there are any other witnesses to this craft.

It did that twice in a row, and then the third time it got very bright then faded to this red color then broke off into three little circles.  Then a couple minutes later it disappeared from the left side of the sky then turned up on the right. It did that for about 10 - 15 minutes.

It was the next day that we found out that another person who lives close to the town saw the same thing we saw. She went online and reported it.

One huge Black triange with white lights followed by a second smaller triangle with blue lights,Crown Hill,WV,2007-10-20T20:20:00,triangle,5-7 minutes,"Occurred : 10/20/2007 20:20  (Entered as : 10/20/2007 20:20) Reported: 1/25/2008 10:10:59 AM 10:10 Posted: 3/4/2008 Location: Crown Hill, WV Shape: Triangle Duration:5-7 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61200.html,"One huge Black triange with white lights followed by a second smaller triangle with blue lights I am 39 years old and currently functioning as an RF (Radio Frequency) Engineer for a regional PCS (CDMA) service provider. I have had 5 UFO sightings to date. Now that Ive covered a little background, let me get right to the latest.  Date: 10-20-2007  Location: N 38 : 12 : 11  Lat      (NAD83) W -81 : 23: 54  Lon  West Virginia (Crown Hill area)  Time: 8:20pm  I had to travel to Tazewell Virginia for business that day and my trip home was around 2 hours. After dark I checked the night sky on a regular basis, I usually do this since it increases the odds for seeing things, sounds simple, but a lot more people would be seeing these things if they could forget their problems for a moment and just look up. As I was traveling west on route 60 between two small towns, Hansford, and Crown Hill my attention was drawn to the brightest star in the sky, since it happened to be near my field of view when I glanced upward from the wheel to scan the sky for anything of interest. Having stared at the bright star for a second or two I dropped my gaze below the star and discerned that I could distinguish the mountain top from the sky since my eyes had adjusted to the night, and the fact that there is a strip mining operation located along the top of the same mountain providing some ambient lighting helping to clearly define the top of the mountain against the black star filled night. OK cue the Twilight Zone Theme, here's what happened at that point. For a completely unknown reason I glanced back at the highway, just to be safe, I had not seen another car for some time and after making sure I was still driving safely I looked back up, but I stopped short of actually looking at the bright star and instead became fixated on an area just below the star I had looked at previously.  I remember thinking ""Why am I looking at en empty piece of sky?"" Before I could even formulate another thought a large orb of white light appeared, Ok, let me explain how this appeared, it started as a small pinpoint of light and grew to a large orb of white light, fast, but slow enough that I mentally registered the observation. I believe I stared at this for about 5 seconds before I witnessed another orb appear to the right of first orb, it arrived in the same manner as the first but appeared to be slightly smaller. I will try to explain this next part as clearly as I can. After the first two orbs appeared they were followed by around a dozen more, with each orbs appearance taking 1/2 the time as the last, accelerating in speed until all 12 had fully appeared in a loose straight line in the sky, I remember thinking wow, that looked like a computer controlled sequence of lights. At this point I decelerated down to about 25 mph, I know this area is not heavily traveled so I wasn't concerned since I was alone on the highway. At this point I was convinced that I was looking at a small fleet of luminous orb UFOs, I remember getting nervous and a bit frightened when I noticed that it looked like the orbs on the far right were moving. I thought I was going to witness ariel feats of a dozen UFOs hovering over the mountain.  I quickly realized I was actually looking at a huge triangular configuration of around 16 large white orbs. At this point I swallowed hard and felt a lump in my throat, I did have the resolve enough to roll down the window and listen for sounds. You guessed it, no sound at all. At this point I went for the phone to get a picture, it politely refused to go into camera mode, seems the battery was too low, that's another weird story in itself. I then fixed my concentration back on this triangular formation of white orbs of light. It was heading straight for me, but it was also rotating on its axis without banking. It rotated until the point of the triangle was pointing north from its previous eastward orientation. At that point it began travelling north from its previous eastward course, all without banking, it remained plum while rotating to achieve a new azimuth heading. It was on course to pass over my view. Before I continue I want to stress that given the nature of the appearance of these orbs, as in how they appeared, one after another in a clearly timed and perfectly executed nature, I am left with only two conclusions given the data I witnessed myself, one is that this object for all purposes de-cloaked in a timed sequence before my eyes, or two, the object materialized from some other time/space/dimension. Needless to say both are quite humbling to see/contemplate.  Lets get to the size of this object, I call it an object because once I could see underneath this thing, it was blocking out the stars, and the large orbs of light were clearly following the leading edge of this triangular object that occupied the space in between the orbs. The orbs were anomalous, hell, everything about this was anomalous, I felt like I was in overload mentally because nothing was correlating to any prior experience. I could not resolve a single thing about this that made sense, it was ominous and very disturbing to me. It was at approximately 700 - 800 feet in altitude and roughly 1/8 mile ahead of me and took up 3/4ths of the windshield in a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It appeared to have a convex semi circle rear on it judging from the orbs of light in the back. Let me explain the high strangeness of these lights around the perimeter of this object. I looked intently for any signs of these being mounted to the side of a solid object, I could not see anything that indicated that these orbs of light were attached to the black mass that they clearly were following in perfection with, as a matter of fact I felt a cold chill of fear and amazement when I realized that the dark mass that was clearly blocking out stars as it passed overhead, was blatantly, absolutely refusing to reflect any light from the obvious orbs that were mere inches from it!  I noticed then that another white orb of light had appeared at dead center underneath the light absorbing black triangular mass. This new orb was blinking on and off, in a slow repeating cycle. I looked for a refection of light from the undercarriage of whatever this black triangular mass was, but to no avail, the Orb of light would appear and then disappear, I said it that way because it didn't power down and back up, it simply was there then gone then back again. I laughed out load at this point, I was just in awe at this, and let my analytical side take a break, I just tried to take it all in and experience it rather than trying to understand it, my logical mind sort of passed out from overload.  At this point I actually physically jumped at what happened next. one instant there was a black star filled open sky in front of this huge triangular object, the next instant there is another black triangular object travelling at the same speed, in the same direction, and within approximately 100ft of the first object. I was utterly just numb at this point and reverted back to my logical mind as the trauma of a second triangle appearing like a David Copperfield finally sent everything else I had into shock. The second black triangular craft did not share the luxury of a light absorbing hull as its big brother continued to disturb me with. Rather this new entity gave me a couple of things I could relate to, one it reflected light, and two the lights appeared to be fixed to the object and quite visibly had a housing around them. Let me point out that the new object had all blue lights, and more interestingly enough they appeared to resemble LED lights in appearance. This new triangle looked like the classic Belgium triangle with the difference being it had blue lights, three of them positioned at each point of the triangle respectively. The other noticeable difference in comparison to the Belgium triangles was the fact that I could clearly see an elaborately geometrically designed housing covering these blue lights.  I couldn't make out much detail from the blue light reflected from the undercarriage of the new triangle, but I was relieved a little in knowing it did reflect light, unlike the disturbingly huge triangle that defied physics in every detail of its existence, and somehow absorbed light, it was like a triangular black hole, very disturbing to witness. At this point I watched them both disappear over the mountain to my north from the view of the passenger side window. I drove a few more miles before I really snapped out of it. I told my wife and two children as well as two of their friends all about my encounter three times in even more excruciating detail than here. I couldn't sleep and in the end I worked a full day on two hours sleep, full days are usually 10 hours for me, but I was still energized from the night before. As a footnote, I work in a building that is directly in line with the Charleston airport, I watch C-131's fly over at a very low altitude, I am fully aware of the size of this aircraft at various altitudes and I estimate that it would take 16 of these flying at the same altitude in a tight V formation to roughly equal the size of the first triangle, they would also need to be fitted with large round lights mounted on extensions from the hull to simulate the orbs, so a mistaken aircraft this is not.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

Earthquakes shake Puget Sound area on December 7 and 12, 1880. On December 7 and 12, 1880, two earthquakes strike the Puget Sound region.  Frightened residents rush out of buildings. They are felt in Portland, Oregon, in Port Townsend, in Seattle, at the coal mines at Newcastle, and in the Stuck and Puyallup valleys in south King County.  Shortly before the December 12 earthquake, an apparent meteorite is sighted crashing into the Chuckanut Mountains just south of Bellingham.  Over the next three months a number of aftershocks follow. December 7th Earthquake  On December 7, 1880 at about 5:45 p.m., the earthquake was felt throughout the Puget Sound region. Seattle, Bainbridge Island, Tacoma, Puyallup, Olympia, and Port Townsend reported shaking.  At Seattle, ""People rushed into the streets from stores, restaurants and saloons.""  (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December 8, 1880). People in the Chinese district were most frightened and it was one or two hours before they calmed down.  A Mr. Atkinson, who was in Newcastle at the time of the quake, came to Seattle a few days after the earthquake that occurred later in the week and reported that the December 7 quake was stronger than the one on December 12.  At Seattle the shock waves were felt traveling from the southeast to northwest and at Bainbridge Island they were felt traveling from north to south. December 12th Earthquake  On Sunday December 12, 1880 at about 8:40 p.m., the second Puget Sound earthquake of the week was felt strongly in Seattle.  It was more severe than the December 7 quake.  A witness of the 1880 earthquake, a Seattle resident, wrote in 1904 to the Seattle Post Intelligencer:  ""It was so sharp that it caused people who were on the streets to stagger.  It was a Sabbath evening and quite a large congregation was at church on Third Avenue   ""The shock alarmed the worshippers and they arose en masse.  One lady fainted and a panic was narrowly averted by the minister and one cool-headed man who stood near the door"" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, March 20, 1904, p. 1). In Seattle, “Dogs in the street howled and horses endeavored to escape from their stalls” added the December 16, 1880 Port Townsend Democratic Press. The quake caused lamps hung from a 16-foot high ceiling at a house located at the northwest corner of 2nd Avenue and James Street to swing six to eight feet. At another dwelling, a chimney fell. At the south end of King County, residents along the Stuck and Puyallup valleys stated that the quake moved the earth like ocean swells. A Meteorite?  Just before the December 12 earthquake, a Seattle resident reported witnessing what “seemed to be two very large balls of fire that appeared in the clear sky a short distance apart and hung as in balance an instant, and then darted down and toward each other until they crashed and disappeared. A moment afterwards came the shock” (The Seattle Weekly Post, December 17, 1880). A Whatcom County paper reported witnessing a meteorite that descended into the Chuckanut Mountains. It is unknown whether this strange event was the cause of the quake. The December 12 earthquake was felt from Portland to Port Townsend, where it lasted about 11 seconds. It was not felt at Victoria, British Columbia, or at Neah Bay near Cape Flattery, the northwest point of Washington. During the following three months, a Bainbridge Island resident reported three more aftershocks in December, five aftershocks in January 1881, two aftershocks in February 1881, and a single aftershock on March 14, 1881.

It is belived that the object was some 10k to 15k ft altitude.  It at first sighting just seemed to float in a set area not moving at all then suddenly it moved diagonally at some 30 to 45 degree angle up then stopped momentarily then without even a gradual change in direction is just suddenly moved straight across the sky and eye blinking speed so some 10 miles it was believed.  Again it did this same move only in a completely different direction more then just abruptly.  It moved at the speed of light but all moves were done in  absolutely reverse moves. This went on for some 20 minutes,  Finally 3 F-86s were dispatched for observation for encountering and they could not even get close to the object.  We all knew that it was a UFO becuase of former warnings not to ever discuss what if ever we should see in the sky.  It was told to us all that there were no such things as flying saucers ant that they were only figments of out imagination.   We all knew better that that.  Most of us had all read or heard of the ""Project Blue Book"" (Major Keyholes Report, which was printed in 1947.)  We had never hoped to see something of this magnitude but after seeing this we all felt sure of what we had seen.  I had went into operation shack and had asked questions as to what they had seen on the Radarr scope and was answered that they could not ID the object because it speed would not be calculated on thier screen but did note that when the F-86s ever got near the objects area, it would move so fast it could not be registered on the scope.   They did say however that they did know it was something but of an unknown craft and that there was not any place on the planed earth that could even possibly have anything like what was seen or acted on their scope.  The whole subject was ordered to be silenced  and not even discussed but of course we did at some risk of violation of orders.  This was the most fantastic thing I have ever seen in my life, this thing moved several times this was until then it literally in a flick of an eye shot out of sight just as though it was like a light switch being turned off.  I disappeared as fast as it was believe to appear.  Literally disappered.  My theory is that this thing can control magnatism in some way as well as crontrol its stability at will. It definatley was and is being control by some intelligence. I have  tried to make this know before but to those I have expressed, they would look at me as if I was nuts. I and we know what we seen and it all true. I was a A/1c (buck Sgt) at the time stationed at Itazuke Air Force Base on the Island of Kyushu Japan during the Korean War. There were no dummies stationed there. We were all skilled in what we did and were proud of who, and what we were but this was astounding to say the least. Thank you.

At the time of this experience I was about 25 years old and I had about 150 hours of flying time. I was at this time also employed with an airline and had been for about two years. I was flying my plane from Minnesota to Anchorage, Alaska. I landed at Edmondton, Alberta and cleared with the Royal Canadian Air Force, getting briefed and permission to fly their airspace via the ALCAN highway. Just after sundown on 12 July, 1956, I was lying under the wing of my plane, half inside a sleeping bag, watching a plane shooting takeoffs and landings. As the plane landed and taxied into the hanger, I saw a blinking light approaching just above the hanger. I thought what is this idiot doing out of the traffic pattern. I sat up in my sleeping bag and watched as it grew closer. It looked so very low and as it got over the hanger I saw that it was round and the lights were not blinking, but the object was wobbling back and forth and this gave the illusion of the lights blinking. There was no sound. When directly over the main hanger, it appeared to be huge. I would say a few hundred feet in diameter. It was impossible to actually judge the size for I could not tell the altitude even though it looked to be no more than 100 feet above the buildings.  I shucked out of my sleeping bag and turned on the ignition in my plane to radio the control tower, but the radio was completely dead, not even static. I then took a rough compass bearing and watched and timed the object as it passed over us. It went about due west, blinking all of this time for 20 minutes when it made roughly a 90 degree right turn and accelerated and was out of sight in less than 10 seconds.  I tried to call the tower again on my radio, and I was able to get through to them, but then decided I had better not report this information or I might be held up from leaving for Alaska for several days, or maybe even be refused permission to continue my trip. So I said nothing. The next morning I took off for my next days destination, Calgary, AB.",,,

PD)) This incident occurred about October of 1956 or ‘57.  At the time, I was Assistant station manager for a major airline in Anchorage as well as an experienced pilot.  One of my men and I went on a caribou hunting trip between Nelchina and Tazlina, Alaska, several hours drive from Anchorage.  Without going into all of the minor details, we missed our hunting party and caught a ride into the bush with another party, hoping to find our group.  We were dropped off and we hunted the next morning and that evening we caught a ride back in a jeep with some other hunters.  The trail we followed was on the top of a ridge about 600 feet above the valley.   At one point the trail zigzagged down the mountain ridge and at the bottom while heading to climb another smaller ridge, we became stuck in a wet swampy area.  A few more hunters came down the trail and we all attempted to get the vehicles out.  They became stuck too.  Failing this, two of the nine guys who were now there walked out to the highway to get a bug swamp buggy to pull us out.  As we sat there talking, we saw and heard another jeep coming along the ridge.  They became stuck on the top of the ridge.  We could hear them pushing and pulling but they gave up and two of them walked down the trail to where we were.  The other two stayed with their jeep and meat.  When these two were about half way down, we saw another light coming along the top of the ridge toward the stuck jeep.  The vehicle made no sound, no engine noise whatsoever.   The vehicle stopped some distance behind the stuck jeep and sat there for about one minute.  All at once this object dropped or sped straight down the mountain ridge in seconds and it stopped instantly about ¾ of the way from the bottom and began moving on in the same direction it had been going while up on the ridge.  It passed below the two hunters walking down the trail and continued on out of sight.   We could distinctly hear the men talking on the ridge with the jeep and the two who were walking down the trail. Yet we heard no sound from the object. It had a steady reddish orange light which did not blink or pulsate.  The moon at the time was full and the sky was covered with a thin overcast and scattered clouds moving below them permitting some light reflecting on the snow.  So it was not completely dark.  We could just see the outline of the jeep against the night sky.  None of us could tell the shape of the object which had sped so fast.  The two men on top of the ridge did not see the object at all. The side of the ridge was at about a 45 degree slope.  The terrain was full of scattered alders and there is no way a vehicle could make that vertical decent at that speed through the alders and stop instantly and continue on a horizontal path.  None of us heard a sound of any type other than the jeep idling up on top the ridge and the other men talking.  I think all of us had the hair on our necks standing straight out. None of us had any idea of what this object was.  We could not tell if it was on the ground or if it was above the terrain.   And, yes we eventually were pulled out and got safely back to the highway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,,

Noticed a light moving very slowly at the far end of a flat farm field while parked facing east on a dirt road at a rural intersection waiting for a friend to meet me.  It was so low that I assumed it was a farm tractor working until it got closer and there was no sound (quiet late dusk with car windows open, wind calm, warm).   As it neared at perhaps 5-6 miles per hour, the light was no longer showing on the huge dark oval and it still appeared to be just above ground level, and I realized crickets and other night sounds stopped.   The object drifted to a stop near a large old tree about 400-500 feet east of me along the road. Relating size to the old tree which was perhaps 40 feet tall, the object was easily 3 times taller and at least 10-12 times further across than high...a smooth oval with a flat bottom, too dark to find any detail at all.   But no dome on top  It just ""hovered"" for a couple of minutes.   I heard a car coming before headlights appeared over a small rise in the interesection road.  The object began to move in its original direction (south) but rising and the dark became a white light again as it silently accelerated, and the night sounds resumed as it banked to a southeasterly heading.  The light got smaller and smaller and disappeared into the distance in less than a minutes (still climbing at an estimated 30 degree angle.  The approaching car was my buddy, and his observations of the part he saw matched mine.  We discussed it excitedly as we drove in one car to a nearby town, and we did tell our dates a very abbreviated version.  They didn't react much, probably because we were so matter of fact about it, and we never mentioned it to anyone else. I don't remember even thinking of it for quite a few years.   I lost touch with him a few years later, but the incident's been on my mind a lot in recent months.  The memories are still vivid and wonderful...but  I'd really like 2 questions answered...(1) why haven't I ever heard of an even remotely similar experience, and (2) how on earth could I have dismissed it so matter of factly as I was (and am) an avid UFO fan?   The craft shape was unlike any photos and drawings I've seen (the uninterrupted arc, no dome or anything) and the total lack of anything dramatic happening.   Didn't land, but was less than 3 feet above ground until it departed.  The immensity of the thing.   Apparently it was unaware of my presence but left when the approaching headlights were approaching.   PLEASE NOTE:  This was nearly 50 years ago, so the dating shown may be very inaccurate.

We would stomp the wheat down to make square rooms, round and rectangular shaped rooms and we would connect the room together with hall ways.  One night I looked out of the kitchen window and saw a White cube that glowed like a light bulb.  It had a red light glowing on the inside of it.  The area was north of Great Bend, Kansas. There are or were quite a few radio towers there and one huge TV 2 tower.  The cube shaped thing flew around that radio tower like a moth flies around a light bulb of all things, only slower than a moth and it never hit the tower.  I ran to the bath room to get my dad but he said don't brother him.  So I ran back to the kitchen yelling for my two brothers to come here.  When I got back to the window it was still flying around the tower.  Just before my brothers got to the window it came across the field towards me in a blink of an eye it was hovering around 75 feet above the ground.   That is when my two brothers made it to the window and started saying what is that, what is that.  The thing hovered there but very slowly turned for 20 sec. or so.  Than it spun so fast that it turned into a ball and was gone in a streak almost straight up but a little angle towards the n.w.  True true true story.  Also, I might add that the red light was fading on an off like the tower light was.  I believe it was trying to communicate with it and that it was surprised when it finally noticed me or us. I also think that it was some type of probe or something.  The work you are all doing is good work.  We saw what we saw so because of that I know we are not alone.  Sure makes you wonder why that thing was flying around that radio tower?  I don't think that making those forts in the wheat had or has anything to do with it but then again you never know like anything there are more questions than answers.

The two lights were the size and intensity of the bright star Sirius. The night was beautiful and clear, the moon was hanging large and low on the horizon. These objects or object turned southeast and flew directly over my house and then suddenly vanished.  I was standing at my open rear door of my house when the sound of an approaching helicopter caught my attention, As usual with any low flying aircraft, I would go outside to watch for it. As soon as I stepped out onto my rear deck my attention was diverted to two bright lights approaching from the north. At first I thought the lights were stars and stationary, but then I soon realized they were moving in my direction. They were moving slowly in tandem as if two planes were flying in formation, one in front of the other. This struck me as very odd so I continued to watch them. The two lights were approaching me from a slight angle and they never once deviated laterally from their position. They continued heading in my direction. I stood there trying to understand what it was that I was looking at. As it over flew my house, I ran through the house and called for my teenage son to come to the front door to observe this as well. The two of us stood watching this thing cruise overhead silently and almost effortlessly. We both stood motionless trying to understand what it was we were watching. Within a few seconds the two lights flashed off in unison and it was all over.  The object appeared to be close; however, it had no discernable shape. The object made absolutely no sound. The space and distance between the two lights can be measured by extending one full arm length and turning your hand at a 90 degree angle. one hand length. The area in which this thing traveled penetrated heavily regulated airspace, (class Bravo airspace) for DIA. This portion of class B airspace has a floor of 8000 feet MSL and a ceiling of 14,500 MSL. The object was in this air space and had also flown in between Centennial (KAPA) and Buckley AFB airspace. All three are manned by radar.  I am an instrument rated Private Pilot and I think I have a pretty good understanding of what airplanes look and sound like. This was no airplane, as this object had none of the required position lights / navigation lights or strobes that one would recognize as local aviation. The object was not a small dimly lit fast moving satellite, nor was it a commonly observed meteor streaking across our celestial heavenly body, and no, it was no weather balloon. I don’t know what this thing was that my son and I observed, but it left a bad taste in our mouths. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I made the report on 7/19/05.  This is an update. I made a past report, in 2005 about a UFO I saw in Benbrook Texas.  I have an update. After seeing the UFO, I immediately had to turn off the highway and drive down a dark, hardly used road, with nothing but trees and a couple of buildings. I was scared to drive down it after what I had just witnessed, but I did it anyway. After driving down the dark secluded street, I suddenly slammed on my breaks as there were two huge eyes staring at me. I was frightened and could not figure out what it was. I stared at it, and it stared at me. Then I realized it was a deer. It slowly walked off the road and stood behind the trees and continued to watch me. A couple of days ago, I had my therapist, who is also a nurse practioner, hypnotized me, so I could go back through that night again. Turns out, the eyes did not belong to a deer; I was in fact eye to eye with an alien. It looked just like the typical alien on the front of Communion. I am not a ufo/alien expert. I believe these are called ""Greys.""  It did walk very slowly into the woods and continued to stare at me. In my hypnosis, I had a panic attack, and was extremely scared, crying, sweating, and barely able to breathe, so my therapist brought me out of the hypnosis. I have a feeling it was trying to communicate with me, so I wish I could go back and find out, but it was a very terrifying experience for me to relive. I just wanted to send an update. I wish someone could help me figure out what happened, and if this might be a pattern for me, because the alien looked familiar. Thanks so much!

I am a male, and was 37 years of age at the time of this sighting. I work in the printing industry and have a background in fine art. I feel these two facts enhance my testimony and illustration provided.  I noticed two stationary extremely bright white lights, side-by-side horizontally in a fixed position at about 400 feet above the ground, in the sky directly in front of me. At first it appeared to be an aircraft coming in for a landing, the bright lights being standard landing lights.  After several seconds I noticed two odd things about these lights. Firstly, they were a bit too far apart for an ordinary plane configuration and secondly, they were barely moving  closer to me despite my driving towards them. This clearly indicated to me that the object was in fact stationary and not moving forward as an airplane would do.  I slowed my car down considerably since nobody was driving behind me, and started carefully observing the craft.  The two lights remained in their fixed positions for a moment and then began banking slowly and steadily to the left, all the while not getting any closer to me. After tilting to about 45 degrees the lights began approaching me smoothly and steadily.  As the lights came nearer, the object started to pass me to my left at  an altitude of roughly 40 feet, and travelling approximately 20-30 miles per hour. It looked to be about 30 feet in length, and 10 feet in width. It remained tilted at a 45 degree angle the remaining duration of the sighting. The two extremely bright lights had now dimmed, or perhaps were no longer pointed directly at me and only seemed dimmer because of this.  As it drifted past to my left, I got a very good look at it since I had slowed my car down considerably to about 25 miles per hour. At the closest point it was only about 50 feet from my car. The object was sillouetting the lights of the valley and the distant hills and dark gray sky behind it, revealing a distinct long cylindrical shape. There were roughly six white lights on the visible side of the object, with no particular order to their distribution and they were all rather small. The lights were in two slightly differing sizes, with the upper and lowest lights being the larger. There weren't any strobes on this object, or any small colored marker lights which to my knowledge is not the case with conventional aircraft. There were no rotors, wings, cockpit or audible sound. A helicopter would definately have some audible noise at such a close distance, and the rotors would have been visible. There was one large red light on the side and just about dead center, which blinked with a slow on-and-off pattern at one second length intervals. This red light appeared at least a foot in diameter and didn't flash, but steadily faded off and on. This red light was a perfect circle which appeared raised like a dome similar to a lighting fixture one might have on the ceiling of their home. There was a very narrow and bright beam of light emanating from the center of the object and aimed directly in front of it. The beam of light was aimed just slightly lower than horizontally. The searchlight was steady and appeared fixed to the object because it never changed position in any way.  The object continued off toward my left rear and floated over the ground at the same altitude, it's searchlight still shining out and onto the ground below and continued at a south-easterly direction.  Since this time I have observed multiple helicopters at night in order to make a comparison and there are no similarities between any helicopters and this UFO.

I could tell of many sightings. The last sighting however was in Arizona. I work in telecommunications and I do a lot of traveling. This is a little out of date (Nov. 2005; date of the sightings) but I would like to share this with you because I read similar reports that occurred in Arizona.  My account lasted for an hour and a half. I had been out to Parker Dam working and was on my way back to Phoenix. When I got back on I-10 at Quartzsite, right at dusk, I noticed an orange/red light that illuminated out in open desert (South of I-10) that appeared to be no higher than a distant street light. When I saw it I knew that in that area there was nothing but desert. I watched it as I was driving and it faded out and disappeared. I wondered what it could have been but I had no idea. A few moments later on the left side of the highway (North of I-10) at a further distance and higher in the sky I saw another red/orange light, it appeared like it was turned on with a dimmer switch. It came on dim and increased to a bright illumination and inreverse went completely out. At this point I began watching. For the next hour as I was driving toward Phoenix I saw numerous red/orange lights appearing slowly then brightening only to slowly disappear as they appeared. Some of the lights appeared close and a few seconds after one would go out another would appear but at a much further distance and then close again. I called one of my co-workers and was telling him of what I was seeing. I called my wife back in Kentucky and was talking to her as I was witnessing the appearance and disappearance of these lights. Up to this point I was only seeing one light at a time sometimes they would be five minutes apart or as little as twenty seconds and would be miles apart. When I was east of Tonopah I saw one light come on and this time it stayed on. Then a second and third came on and just hovered. This time it was right! beside the interstate and I know others had to see them because there was steady traffic. These three lights were stationary and stayed on for close to a minute then they individually went off in the order they appeared. I stopped after these three came on and got out with my digital camera to see if I could get a picture but they went off before I had the chance. I waited for about twenty minutes and never saw them again that night. For an hour and a half I observed these lights. At first I thought possibly they could have been flares but realized after about the first twenty minutes these were definitely not flares. These lights came on and were stationary and at times great distance apart and seen for a stretch of 90 miles. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I have looked at alot of Missouri sightings in your files on these orange lights, and wonder what they are. Almost all of the sightings are fairly close to where we were on March 3 2007. Well, here's what happened. Me (38) and my wife (38) went to Lake Hanna about 4 miles North of Ironton Missouri. This place is in St. Francois and Iron Counties. We went back to the far lake (Iron County) to see if we could see the lunar eclipse. But it was to cloudy and a little to late. We preceded to look to the south-southwest towards Pilot Knob Mountain and Taum Sauk Mt. (highest elevation in state). The clouds started to clear and we could see a bright star (possibly Venus) and the moon peaking out from behind the clouds. It is very dark out and we were amazed by how much light the moon emitted. Then, around 19:39 we noticed a orange-amber colored light appear in the sky in the same direction (S-SW} between the mountains, then another, and then another. The lights appeared to split in two and then disappear in same order they appeared. Me and my wife looked at each other and said what in the world did we just see? It almost seemed like they came out from over a cloud cover. The sky had cleared pretty much and we were watching the sky in hope of seeing something else. It had been about ten minutes, 19:49 on the van clock. Then it started again a bit different. The lights were bigger this time and appeared to be spinning with other lights shooting out of them. One looked like it shot toward the ground. Another light looked like it split and was making a banked turn on an angle. These lights looked like the size of streetlights (dime size).  We saw 4 of these lights appear and then disappear in same order.  Lasting I would say around 10 to 15 seconds each. It had been completely silent to this point when we started to hear fighter jets. We could not see them. The reason I know they were fighters is because I live a couple of miles from Scott AFB.  Every kind of plane imaginable has flown over our house at all hours of the day.  We go to the lake every weekend if possible. We got out of the mini-van to see if we could see the planes.  To this point we were watching out of the windows.  I called a friend down at the lake to tell him to come out here and what we saw.  Just as I got off the cel phone, it started again. This time the lights were even bigger (quarter size). Five lights appeared in the sky one by one till all five were lit. Then disappearing in same order. With the lights being bigger you could see more detail, it looked to me like the orange-amber lights had little white lights spinning around them in the middle. I looked at the clock and it was 19:57. We continued to watch the sky and saw four jets heading east in a single file line. That seemed strange that they were not flying in formation. Then we saw two more heading north and then two more way up there heading northeast. Eight jets we saw in total. Another strange thing was that the jets didn't have any flashing lights just solid red ones. We watched the sky for about another half-hour and didn't see anymore lights. It almost seemed like the jets scared them off. I know that they say the full moon and lunar eclipes have strange effects on things. I don't know if it had anything to do with that but on the way back to the cabin we saw three deer walk right down the side of the road by our van it seemed like they had no fear. We looked at them and them at us almost to say ""Did you see that too?"" We have gone back the last three weekends to the same exact place hoping to see the lights again. We haven't seen a thing. My wife and I have two children, married 16 years and never saw or believed in any kind of et stuff, but this really makes a person wonder. Me and my wife are both educated and working. My wife told a Air Force Colonel what we saw and he said it was probably the Air Force flying manuevers. I don't know exactly what we saw and probably will never see anything like it again.

In the evening sky there was a huge lentricular cloud formation that looked an awful lot like a ship under cloud cover.  To the right and left of the huge middle cloud were three smaller perfectly saucer shaped clouds on each side spaced at an angle so that it looked as if they were in a V formation.

The object was vertical in orientation with a long, antenna-like object on top with multiple array and wide, round center body and an even longer cylindrical ""rod"" (?) protruding out of the bottom of the object.  It appeared as though the object needed the bottom portion of to maintain balance, though that it speculative on my part, as the object did not appear to be moving.

I was on my way to Albertsons grocery store when I happened to glance up to the hills that crest over the Peninsula area and noticed what I thought to be a huge water tower on the top of the hill line. I was somewhat confused because I'd never noticed it before, and I'm a very observant person. I drove on while keeping my eyes on the object as best I could. I pulled into the Albertson's parking lot. I was able to see the object very clearly.  It was NOT a water tower! I'd estimate that it was perhaps only 6 blocks from me at the most, and by judging the size of the trees it was hovering over I'd estimate it's size at anywhere from 50 feet to 75 feet. As I watched, it began moving very slowly down from the tree line towards me.  It had to have been only 20-30 at the most above the houses.  The object then began to move slowly towards the left.  I noticed that at first the object was very stark and clear, but as it began to move to the left the front edge/side seemed to become blurry/indistinct on the leading edge (in the direction of travel).  It slowly went behind some buildings which is when I lost sight of it. What seemed to me to be the most interesting aspect of all this is that NO ONE ELSE SEEMED TO NOTICE!!! and yet, there it was as big as life for everyone to see.  This was a VERY solid, metallic looking (lead colored) object with no apparent windows, wings, engines. It made absolutely no noise that I could hear.

It was a very clear night, no clouds in the sky, full moon and the temperature was in the mid 50's F.  We were standing on the back porch looking at the stars.  A few small planes were flying in the distance, we could see and hear them clearly.  Also, routine commercial flights were flying to the north of us.  Then, over the trees, coming from the north, flying in a southernly direction was an object.  I put it between 2000 and 3000 feet in altitude.  It looked like a Motorola Slvr phone.  It was black, blacker then the night.  It also had two orbs of light, one on it front underside, and back underside. the front light was white, the back blue.  The lights were odd, more orbs than the bright points normally seen on aircraft.  The also did not blink.  They did not turn off or blink.  It moved very slow, maybe 30 knots.  It took a long time for it to travel over us and down its flight path.  It also wasn't oriented in a direction a normal plane would be in.  It flew with it's smaller sides oriented to the front and back (meaning, it had no wings).  There was also no sound from it, even though it was directly above us.  It was big.  It's length was like a C-5 Galaxy or B-1B. It's width little less than half its length. Large Aircraft Very Low No Sound  At the speed and alt. it was flying at, only a helicopter could mimic it. If a helicopter was flying that low, we would have heard it, and felt it. It also would have been the world's biggest helicopter, too. If it was a regular aircraft, it would have had to have been flying at a great altitude for it to appear to move slowly to us. And if it was flying at 50,000 feet, its actually size would have been like a mile long. I know a lot about planes. I know what all (known) modern American Air Force planes look like and can easily identify them. This was bizarre.

I was at Como Park on top of a very large mound that the kids sled off of in the winter, and ride bikes down in the spring, and locals sunbathe on top of it.  Anyway, my family and I decided to take a walk at the park that day, and I noticed how things seemed to be illuminated.  I don't know expactly how to explain it but I'll try...Flowers seemed brighter, more vivid, I told my boyfriend how absolutely beautiful it was and how great I was feeling, which is unusual, I usually hurt when I've been walking for a while.  Anyway, towards the end of the walk, on our way out of the park, we stopped to relax and fly a kite on the mound. I laid down on the grass, at the top of the mound, wearing my sun glasses, and started looking around, just taking it all in (again this day was different somehow illuminated), and noticed kind of an aura above the trees that line the park.  I'm commenting to my boyfriend all the beauty that I am taking special notice of, and laying on my back I look straight ahead and a little to the left and I notice what at first glance I thought to be birds darting back and forth at each other.  I did'nt think much of it for a few seconds, until a hawk or some kind of bird flew in between my sight of the other whiteish objects.  So I know what I was looking at was very very far away, and thought that birds don't usually, that Im aware of dart aggressively towards one another. Upon focusing on the objects, I noticed one central one towards the top of the almost formation.  There may have been five or six others, I could'nt count them, they were moving too quickly, almost like in training, the top one did'nt do much, but the ones underneath seemed to be following orders or something. They changed from looking white, to opaque when they sped up. I even lost track of them for a few seconds even though there were no clouds in the way, maybe they were moving so fast I could'nt see them. The whole time I'm witnessing this, I'm yelling for my boyfriend to lay next to me to see what I'm seeing, he laughs at me and contiues to fly his kite.  He missed out on a once in a lifetime experience.  I was afraid to take my eyes off the area, afraid I would lose sight of them.  Finally I got my son to lay down and he got to see just as they started to disappear.  I told my boyfriend that if I saw them then someone else had to see them too.  I told him I bet the government knows their there, and I told him that I bet a jet or some type of aircraft will go to that area, and I pointed the area out to him, and maybe within a few minutes, a jet went right past that very area I pointed out.  I believe, that is the other reason my boyfriend believes me, because the jet was probably sent by the government, and he know's I would never make up a story like that, and he knows I don't lie.

My boyfriend and I were driving north of Payson looking for a campground. As it was very late, we picked the closest one to where we were at and settled in. Our site was far from the road in case people might drive by and try to bother us. We decided to forego the tent and sleep in the car as it was so late. I was preparing my sleeping bag which he smoked a cigar and went to the restroom. While laying in my bag, I was looking at all the stars through the sunroof. He was standing outside the car. At some point, I looked into the woods in the direction toward the restrooms. I saw lights that twinkled and appeared to be moving slowly. The best description to give would be that they were similar to when a group of people have flashlights and walk, the lights stay somewhat level, but move back and forth, up and down a bit. The lights also would go off completely and come back on. At this point, I wasn't scared. I asked my boyfriend what the lights were since he had walked over to the restroom a minute ago. He said he didn't know and that we should just leave. That scared me since he is typically not scared of anything. So he jumped in the car and started driving while I was climbing from the back into the front seat. While we drove, I looked into the woods. The lights went off and did not come back on. The easy explanation is that these were hunters, or people who lived nearby. But there were no houses around for several miles, and no cars parked at the side of the road. There were no other campers in the area and many camps were closed down due to the season. My natural feeling what that we should go and explore what the light was, and that scares me. I can't say that this was a UFO. But I can say it was not human, not a building, not a campfire. This area of the woods was very small and there was no way it could have been anything easily explanable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

A week before my partner whom email I am using was outside on the back deck. I noticed he was gazing up into the sky and I was wondering what he was looking at. Approx 20 seconds later he turned to me and said ""look, what's that"". I looked towards the heavens and saw a small bright silver (metallic) object the size of a pin head moving very quickly and horizontally across the sky. He was taken aback and yes we claimed to have seen an unidentified object. It meant more to him as it was his first ever sighting. I however over the past 20yrs have seen several, although I was living in NZ at the time.  Several nights later on March 3rd I was working a night shift and decided to go outside for a cigarette, it was 3am and a very clear night. I was looking at the stars when I noticed a very bright but low star, it was so low it appeared out of place so I turned all the inside lights off to get a better view. On doing that I realised the object was changing colours gold/bluish and orange. I rang my partner hoping he could see it but because of the distance between us this was impossible. I watched it just hovering in the one place for several minutes and on one occasion it seemed to have disappeared only to appear just as quick. My partner rang back and I was trying to explain what I was seeing...  at that very moment and although it may sound very strange I said to him that it looked as though it had a light coming from beneath (as though it was beaming something up) after 14 minutes it disappeared completely.  I have worked several shifts and have made a point of looking in that same direction at around the same time but to no avail.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

There were four individuals in the car at the time of the sighting and I interviewed each of them separately.  They went on a late night drive to Border Field State Park (this park is located in the extreme SW corner of the continental United States, on the border with Mexico).  After a run-in with a Border Patrol officer they drove east on Monument Road, which turns into Dairy Mart Rd as the road turns to the north.  It was along that road that they noticed a building with a sign that read “Area 50” and another with a sign that read “Area 51”.  Some references to the real Area 51 were made as they continued north.  When they reached Camino de la Plaza road they turned right, and began to head slightly southeast.  It was my coworker (a passenger in the car) who noticed lights to the northeast.  Later holding his hand out at arms length, he guessed that it would’ve taken four fingers to block out the lights.  He thought that there were five yellowish white lights, but all the other eyewitnesses believed there to be only four white lights.  My coworker at first jokingly shouted to the others that there were the aliens.  The lights were positioned in the sky horizontally and parallel to the ground.  They were equidistance from one another.  The lights then moved in unison higher into the sky, keeping parallel with the ground.  It was what the lights did next that surprised everyone and made them take what they were viewing more serious. From one end of this chain of lights, they pivoted like the hand of a clock and moved into a vertical position, now perpendicular to the ground.  The lights continued to go straight up.  They all got the impression that the lights began to twist once in this vertical position.  As it began to twist, the lights completely vanished.  My coworker was so amazed by this display that he called his aunt at 12:30 in the middle of the night to tell her what they just saw.  One eyewitness believes he could see the outline of a craft behind the lights.  They also told me that the area near the border is a no fly zone, so this was indeed strange to see something like this.  My coworker said the lights were over a residential area and from looking at a map, he believes it was north of Route 5.  It was this vertical trajectory that defied any logical explanation for the eyewitnesses.  They are completely baffled by what they saw and plan to go back and see if they are able to see it again.  They did drive down Camino de la Plaza road to see if they could see it again, but they had no further sightings.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,32.552,-117.04310000000001
