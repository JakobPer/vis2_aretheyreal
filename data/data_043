I'm now 65 and want to leave this report before I can't.  This would put the event in the very early 50's.  I lived in a south suburb of Chicago (on a small farm), about 20 miles SSW of downtown.  The township was Calumet Park, IL.  One afternoon I was standing in the yard looking due North.  Suddenly coming out of the west there was a very high, extremely fast round object moving west to east.  The speed was unlike anything I had ever seen.  Many times that of the fastest plane.  From the ground the view angle was probably about 60 degrees.  From my distance it appeared to be about three or so times the size of a pin head held at arm's length.  When it was due north of my location it suddenly came to a stop, motionless.  It remained that way for several minutes.  Then another identical object came from the East at the same blazing speed.  It came to a stop right by the other one.  Now there were two of the round objects together.  They hovered for a few minutes.  Then they went straight up, got smaller and smaller until I couldn't see them any more.  There was no sound, no vapor or contrails.  The day was bright and clear, not a cloud in the sky.  No wind.  Just a perfect summer day.  I remember the temperature being plesant too, which would normally mean early summer or late,late spring.  In the above part of the form I'm only guessing month-day-year.

It was a very hot summer evening and seeing as how we did not have air conditioning my older sister, younger brother and I were permitted to sleep on our front porch, since it was cooler than our bedrooms.  Since this occurred so many years ago, the actual year could have been 1954 or might have even been 1956.  In any case, I was 8 or 9 years old at the time.  Around 1:00 A.M. in the morning, I had to get up and use the bathroom.  I know it was around 1:00 A.M. because our clock struck the hour before I went back out onto the front porch.  As I was settling back down to go to sleep, I heard what could be likened to the sound of an 18 wheeler when it shifts down to a lower gear, and there was also a hissing sound like steam.  I sat up and since I thought it was a truck coming down our little side road, I wanted to see that unusual sight.  Imagine my shock when instead of a truck, there in the sky was a fireball.  It was skimming along just above the trees lining a creek on the other side of the road.  It made a sharp right angle turn, and after it moved off perhaps 75 feet or so, it looked like it was dripping something flammable from beneath it.  Suddenly it stopped.  And just as I thought to myself....""uh oh, they see me""....  The next thing I remember is sitting on the front porch, and somehow the craft had already moved off some distance.  I tried to wake up my sister, but by the time I got her to wake up, it was out of sight.  The strange thing about this whole ordeal, was that it was already beginning to get light outside when I watched this craft move off.  I went from 1:00 A.M. to daylight without any memory.  I told my mom about what happened, and she only suggested that I not tell anyone about what had occurred...and I haven't until now.  I am now married, retired, and no longer live in Missouri, and I don't see where this information is going to hurt anyone; and perhaps someone will find it useful or interesting.  If not, that is okay too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",,39.07880845410628,-94.38608574879227

At the time of the sighting, I am guessing my age to be eight or nine years old.   My nephew and I were outside in front of my home at dusk. We were lying in the grass beside the road.  We would jump up as a car drove by and attempt to scare the drivers.  We were children and weren't being watched closely!  While waiting for the next car, a ""flying saucer"" slipped from NNE to SSW at tree top level.  I can still see that saucer clearly in my mind after all these years.  It made no sound.  It made a Z movement as it slipped through the air. That Z movement impressed me, because in 1995 when I saw my second UFO, it made that same Z movement.  My nephew was no younger than two but probably not yet four when we saw the saucer.  He remembers it. He had to be old enough to talk, because when we saw it, we turned to each other and yelled, ""UFO""!  We also had to have heard ""UFO"" on the television or radio for us to know that term!   We ran into the house, but neither of us remember what happened after that and there is no one left alive who could tell us.  The only difference in our memory of this sighting is that he remembers windows in the saucer and I don't. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",,,

The altitude at a guess at 2,000 feet high. This was seen on September 4, 1962 at 3:30 pm Central Standard Time. Location of sighting was 2.6 miles south of St. Louis Lambert airport. The sky was clear and wind was calm. My mother was hanging clothes out to dry, and called out to me to come out and see the object. I rejected her offer for some time, but she insisted that it was  something I should see. When I finally went out and saw the object we talked and she asked if it could be Venus? I told her that it could not be because of the time of day and direction was eastward. I was a member of the St. Louis Astronomical Society at this time. My mom said I should get my telescope and take a look. At the age of 15 I wasn't totally coordinated yet, and I broke the front glass out of the front screen door. Trying to get the telescope out the door. I'm adding for the time frame. It took a bit of work to gather the broken glass up before a got the telescope to the back yard. Setting up the telescope. It was a Tasco refractor 60 mm objective lens, with a alt-azimuth mount. I first used the wide angle eyepiece to spot the object. I found it magnified well, but still rather small. I let my mom look through the scope and by this time we had the next door neighbors over also. So now we have our own star party. Three adults and one kid. I let everyone take there time and look. Of course they all asked if I could get it bigger. I set the 3 X barlow and the strongest eyepiece. This set the magnification of 525 power. When I looked at the object it nearly filled the entire field of view.  I can only explain that I had it focused perfect!  It looked like a cue ball.  No markings.  Perfectly smooth and rather off white, not shiny.  It did not give any glow off.  No sense of spinning motion, and no noise at all. This is important. This object has not moved one nanometer in an hour of time. Nothing in the heavens or earth can do that!  When you view the moon at full power with that telescope it's like a big train moving by. This didn't move. I expected it to move and was in total disbelief at what I was seeing. I let my mom and the neighbors husband and wife both take long looks at the object and we all agreed that it was not moving. I kept saying this can't be happening! No one is going to believe me at the next Astronomical meeting. But I got witnesses!  Better yet I've done lunar eclipse photos, and said I will be getting my camera and special eye mount for it and I'll be back. Never had a chance to move. When we look back at the time in history, it was as one of the worst in nuclear confutations. The ""Cuban missile crisis"" was happening. I no sooner said that I was going to get the camera when I hear a very load jet aircraft take off. Living for many year near the airport we grew accustomed to the different sounds of the commercial, and air force aircraft flying and even crashing near by as a F-86 did a mile down the road. This was the sound of afterburners and full throttle. As soon as the plane came above the tree line I spotted it as a B-47. She was doing a tight circle as we literality turned our bodies around as it circled and climbed for altitude. On the second sweep around I was beginning to wonder if it had something to do with our visitor in the sky above. I was a lucky hunch, because at that very moment I scream! Look it moved! What had been stationary for an hour did a sudden straight vertical movement to twice the altitude in a split second and stopped. The B-47 was still in hot pursuit with all engines at full throttle. It kept a circular pattern as she climbed up toward the object. After about the fourth revolution around the B-47 chase was over. I saw the object go from that second position to ascend straight up out of sight. My mom insisted that I report this to the Air Force base at Lambert Field. I looked up a few numbers that sounded official and dialed them. When I mentioned I wanted to report a UFO, they responded I could get in a lot of trouble doing this. Did my parents know I was doing crank calls to the US Government? The last call I made I did get through to an Air Force official and said I wanted to report a UFO and it was being chased by a B-47. He said that's ridicules there's no B-47 aircraft in the air. I said if you don't believe me look out your window. He hung up quickly.  No report was ever made to the papers that I could ever recall. Iwould like to know if anyone in the St. Louis area saw this object also.",,38.62382493417588,-90.30852769878884

It's very hard to describe but it was odd-looking to me.  I noticed chemtrails earlier that day and thought maybe those odd wavy, I don't know if you can even call them clouds, streaks across the sky could be caused by whatever they're spraying up there.

We went there because at the time it was being renovated, and the fields were being partitioned and fenced. This gave us some confidence to allow the dog off the leash to run free for a change.  The Parade Ground is just across Parkside Avenue from Prospect Park. It is August, 1965. I am ten years old.  The dog was having a good run, and once we saw that he wasn't about to run off completely, we relaxed and gazed upwards to view the night sky, trying to find various constellations.  In those days, the street lights in Brooklyn emitted a white light, and not the beige-looking type now in use. If you went to a park, you could get a decent view of the stars, but of course not anywhere near the view if you were upstate in deep woods.  Suddenly, as I looked to the left of me, I saw what I first mentally equated as a submarine perhaps two storeys off the ground higher than the six storey buildings beneath it.  ""Hey Mom, do you see what I see?"" She did.  Here comes this thing, slow and steady and silent. It is huge. It is dark grey - not ""battleship grey,"" but as grey as can be before you rule it black. There is no shine to it.  The front of it was round; I'd seen pictures of submarines, and that is what came to mind. It is actually shaped more like a very long medicine capsule.  As it  proceeded to float past us, we observed its right side. It is solid. It is a perfect and very long dark grey cylinder, and it just keeps coming very slowly and steadily.  Obviously, we can't see the top of it, but so far, we see that even though it is almost black, we sense a light behind the darkness. This does not make sense, as my mother and I later reckoned. The best I can come up with is that my eyes saw dark grey, but my mind knew the cylinder was emitting light. Dark light!  This was no blimp. No lights. No sound. No windows. No gondola beneath. No visible markings. No nothing! It is just a cylinder 300 feet longer than the Intrepid aircraft carrier now docked in the Hudson River going by!  This thing was so huge, that even from the height above me, (200 Feet?) it was clearly visible; visible enough to see even the slightest imperfection clearly, if it had any.  At the same time, we are not in any panic. We are unusually serene. As if it's no big deal somehow. Maybe we were in a stupor beyond awe.  Finally, the end of the ship passes. I ran to see the back of it. I see it is as round as the front with an opening in the center. To this day, I'm not sure if it was square or arch-like. I am convinced that at least the bottom of the opening in the back of it was flat, so it was square or arched. I remember thinking that 3 buses could easily drive inside at the same time. On the other hand, I've seen jets low to the ground on approach to JFK Airport, and thought that ""my"" cylinder was at least 3 times wider at the same height.  This is the only time I experience apprehension. I worry for a moment that whoever is flying this cylinder might see me.  I ran to a to where I could see the other side of the cylinder. It is exactly as perfect and unremarkable as the other side and the bottom.  I have been struggling with my memories for years as to whether there was a single tiny light, blue or red atop the opening in the back. I add this item, but I am not sure. Inside the opening it is absolutely pitch black.  The cylinder was in the order of 1200 feet long. I did not know this at the time. When I saw the cylinder completely, it was ""crossing"" Stratford Road, and the back of it was at Buckinham Road. The distance between these streets on Caton Avenue according to street maps is about 1200 feet.  I rejoined my mother in the original field, and we watched this thing float over the Prospect Park POLICE STATION, heading west until it faded from sight about half a mile west of the Parade Ground. No newspaper, radio, or TV station mentioned it. For that matter, we didn't even tell my father!  As I first accessed the Internet, I ran a search for ""cylinder ufo,"" and plenty of links came up. Even pictures! I wasn't too surprised, because I know damn well what I saw was real, and other people MUST have seen something as well.  I told some close friends. They gave me the jaundiced eye. I could hardly blame them. I guess its just one of those things one must see to believe.""  Notes:  The Cylinder crossed over Parade Place, and was equidistant between Woodruff and Crooke Avenues.  The Cylinder was about 1/4 the width of the Parade Ground, and travelling in a straight line over the road that runs nearly the length of the park.  Why these single lane streets are designated Avenues is a mystery to me, especially Crooke Avenue, which runs only two blocks.  Modern street maps have re-named Buckingham Road as East 16th street. The equivalent for Stratford Road would be East 11th Street, so by my point of view the cylinder was at least five blocks in length. I need to remark that some internet-based street maps would put the length of the cylinder at 1500-1700 feet. I really should go back there and take measurements myself.",,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

As we reached the crest of the hill that led down to our home, I noticed a white/silvery light in the distance over the trees as we looked almost due east (or barely southeast). There was nothing else in sky as it was a clear summer day and I called attention to this unknown light to my mother.  She was surprised at the light and pulled the car over to the side of the road and we began watching the light in the distance(it was off in the distance but I can only guess 10-20 miles away.  When I first spotted this light what caught my attention was the fact that it was at times stationary but would then move up in a direct perpendicular line and would then sometomes move sideways in a direct horizontal line. These movements were in the blink of an eye and guessing at the distance I would say these horizontal and perpendicular movements were many miles in seconds.  We watched this movement for about 15 minutes and the mental image I have is of this unknown light/object making a cross or plus sign in the sky.  As we watched this movement we both commented and agreed that there was nothing we knew of on this earth that could move and change directions so quickly and stop in an an instant.  As we were watching this movement for about 15 minutes all of a sudden the light blinked out. This surprised us and we were going to proceed on home when the light blinked back on and reappeared in about the same spot as we originally saw it.  It made a few more horizontal/perpendicular movements and blinked out again and did not reappear. The total duration of this event was about 20 minutes.  My mother and I were perplexed at this event because we had no explanation for what we had seen.   I was 16 years old at the time and never forgot those amazing 20 minutes.

We did not reportit at the time beause the police would assume that we were a couple of stoned teenagers.  Side note;  Many many years later I brought the subject up to my parents again. My father mentioned that he as a youth had seen a UFO in Illinois. I asked him to describe what he saw and he described the same object I had seen. Parents particulary fathers are not inclined to remember the ravings of a 16 year old girl.  I can only conclude that we saw the same object several decades apart.  I apologize for the very delayed reporting of this but I only just found out about you. thank you so much for all of your hard work and dedication. As for myself all I can say is the question of whether or not there are UFO's is one question I do not have to wrestle with . The answer is yes and it was not a UFO for I identified it.

Although I'm not sure of the exact date (1964 or 1965), my brother and one of his friends were wrestling in our front yard - I was about six or seven years old and my brother and his friend would have been 9 or 10.  I walked around the corner of our house to where they were wrestling on the lawn.  All of the sudden they stopped wrestling and stood straight up.  At the same time all three of us looked directly above us.  There, hovering, was a large, round, silver object directly above us.  It was low enough that I could make out what looked like dimples in the skin of the object - almost like hammered metal.  Since it was right above us, I don't know whether it was a sphere, or whether we were just looking at the bottom side of a saucer shaped object.   As we watched the object it slowly moved behind a cloud. We watched the cloud for a long time and as it dispersed we realized the object was gone. My entire family loves airplanes and anything to do with space. My parents used to wake us in the middle of the night when important things were happening with Mercury/Gemini/Apollo, and were being televised. I knew that what we saw that day was very strange. At the time I don't know whether we had ever heard the term UFO, but have realized in my adult life what we saw. In the following years my father also saw very strange objects on two different occasions. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",,42.2796,-104.8028

When the craft stopped moving we noticed small bright drops falling from the craft every two seconds if I remember it was about four of them.  At this time we woke up two other households. They witnessed the same movement we saw earlier with the up and down side to side. Before the craft vanished it turned a bright orange color and then vanished.  I saw the same thing a few months later in Sunriver Oregon on New Years Eve working the late shift.  about five minutes after 12:00am in the NW part of the sky, the same location the first sighting was seen I noticed a star that should not have been where this was.  I radio'd other people working ""Want to see a UFO""!  Most on the evening shift came running out and saw what seemed to be a UFO. A small group of the bar croud whitnessed the same thing.  A bright object moving sporadically then dropping small bright lights out every two seconds, turned orange then vanished.  This lasted about 10m minutes after we first sighted the craft.  The final UFO sighting was in the summer of '07.  I had to respond to an alarm at one of the golf courses at approx. 1:00 AM.  I showed up the same time as the local police, we checked over the club house to find a false alarm.  As we were wrapping thing up I saw a very fast moving bright light moving from West to East and asked the officers ""What do you think that is""?  She said a satalite, Jet, and by this time it had moved from the Cascades to Easten Oregon and the final response! ""Don't know"".  I'd like to know if anyone else has seen these objects during these time frames.  Warmest Regards Central Oregon Sightings",2008-06-12T00:00:00,44.022083283582084,-121.28018388059701

I brought is to the attention of the one the correctional officers and they agreed with the same sighting with no action taken.  These sighting happened only during the evening hours until morning. I saw during the evening hours several crafts that are cone/sphere shaped, each with it’s own color being, orange, red and white.  They land and take off in the middle yard surround by the jail located. I saw small alien like creatures enter in the facility via ports in the walls  (meaning corners of the walls) of certain jail cell where inmates were kept. I also, experience entry into my body via moment like a pushing feeling.  I felt something enter my body and my urine turned a strange green color and my legs were cramped. I still feel the cramping today. In March 2007, I saw a beam of light leave landing site going toward space. During my stay, I heard one of the inmates claim that they went to a planet number #32.  The guards at the facility seem to change in tech and uniforms as to the actual launching of the facility itself.  The entire building would shake as if it were landing and hitting the ground. I saw that the elevator would go down stairs underground and I still was able to see the lights of the cone/sphere crafts outside my window which would lead me to believe they we went up rather than down stairs. I showed the guard the lights outside my window and they seem to be aware of  their landing. I asked a female guard if inmates here at Solano County were taken to outer spaces and they replied, “Yes”.  They seem to negotiate over everything the inmates do, which did not seem like normal human behavior. I was located in mode B which seems to have a lot of traffic from the cone/sphere like craft to land. This is a serious sighting. This facility is paid with tax payer dollars.

Multiple close encounters. 2006 UFO Sighting in Gallatin County Montana Multiple unexplainable sightings through the night. August 29, 2006. Bozeman Montana. Skies, Clear, Cloudless Night. Temperature 40 degrees. I was camping, with sleeping bag only, behind a burm in a grass-less construction lot.  It was about a quarter mile square.  Mall to the south, treeline to the north, townhouses to the east and the highway to the west.  I was told later that there is a military base of some kind near this location. 12:30 AM While camping out in an empty dirt lot behind Bob Wards Sporting Goods noticed what thought was a plane or planet (too low to be a star), blue-white. It began blinking/flashing noticed several other blinking/flashing objects low in the night sky as well. There is an airport in Bozeman so figured it was a few airplanes, but kept looking anyway. This went on for some time, I'm guessing 15 minutes. 12:45 AM Suddenly one of these ""planes"" began to move through sky at will, whimsically even--gaining losing elevation, making impossibly sharp turns. The flashing became frenetic. Then other two flashing objects began moving similarly. They behaved like this for about 30 minutes. They disappeared searched sky but they were nowhere to be found  2:15 AM After an hour searching sky my heart slowed down and I decided to turn over go to sleep. 3 ""meteors"" streaked from sky (west to east) to the ground behind some new townhouses, one-at-a-time in short intervals. ""Okay,"" I said to myself, ""I'm awake again."" I kept watching the townhouses. In a few minutes I noticed movement around the townhouses and 20 feet above townhouses, two unrecognizable shapes (because they were dark against a night blue sky) moving silently in a circular fashion. Gradually they began to emit light began to see them clearly. My neck hair was standing on end. 2:25 AM They were two, sometimes three playfully eminating, green, misty, dancing globes above aforementioned townhouses almost cracked a smile watched dancing lights until they stopped, just before sunrise. *That was it for that night.***  I camped here for the next couple days. I saw the dancing lights above the town houses every night. Then on the last night I was to camp here, I was watching the dancing lights and suddenly a room in townhouse was brightly illuminated for a fraction a second, as if someone had a flash light (stark, cold blue-white light), then another, in sequence--as if someone was going room-to-room. But quicker than a human could run to each room. I wondered if there was anyone living there and hoped they were alright. There were cars parked out front, but no sign of human activity. I wondered if this was some kind of signal. I was afraid. 3:00 AM It took me a while to calm down but, I turned over, my back to the townhouses and tried to sleep. I looked out toward the treeline. Trees relax me. That's when a red light amidst the trees turned on at ground level. I figured it was the brake lights of a car. The light slowly and silently rose 15 feet into the air paused and began moving toward the highway, dispelling that thought. ""Okay, it's a helicopter far away, it's just further away than I think it is"" I told myself. I kept listening for rotor wash. I heard none and under close observation I could tell it was in the stand of trees and I knew there couldn't be a helipad behind a landscaping company. By this red light reached the edge of the stand of trees. I was on my feet, putting my shoes on, I was really scared and wasn't sticking around for this, but I couldn't take my eyes off of it. 3:10 AM It hovered there momentarily. Then a white light seemed to turn on, but I realized that this object had simply begun to rotate. It kept rotating slowly and began a slow pass of the field along the highway edge. I knew it was a triangle now because I could see it's bottom now. It had 3 lights, 2 white-ish and one red. Before I could collect my things it was directly over my head not more than 20 feet in the air. I could see it's shape clearly now; only because it blacked out the stars as it went. It was a triangle with rounded corners. About 20 feet on a side. It did not stop as I recall. Slowly spinning and swinging it's course around me, as if to say hello then off in the direction of the town houses. As it passed I noticed a low-rumbling sound, like a muffled V-8 at idle. 3:12 AM That's when I ran. I ran as hard as I could with 60 pounds on my back in the opposite direction and hitch hiked out of there. If anyone has information on this or has seen anything like it PLEASE contact me ASAP!

I would testify to this in a court of law before God. Myself, Philip Burke, and Wesley Jinks, all eagle scouts and college students, witnessed strikingly similar events. I won the poker game and we stepped outside so Phil could smoke a cigarette. Phil was smoking under the porch by the basement sliding door. Wesley was walking back from his car after getting his wallet so he could pay up for his poker loss and was turning the southeast corner of the house when this incident began. I was completely sober because the antibiotics I’m taking react violently with alcohol. It was between 2:55 and 3:00 AM, December 24th, 2006. I was centered on the east edge of my back patio off the basement. I was looking almost directly up at the northeast sky at maybe a 75 degree angle, attempting to look for the stars. It was evenly overcast that night with no rain and very little wind, about 40 degrees F and relatively calm outside. Very low level clouds in even formation meant that no stars could be seen. All three of us encountered two distinct identical waves of energy that streaked the sky with associated noise, light, and perceptible electric and magnetic energy unlike anything we had ever seen, heard or felt in our experience. I consider myself to have a sharp perceptional awareness and to be in touch with my senses. I was once missed by a lightning strike by 10 feet in a rainstorm and felt incredibly jolted, but this experience shocked or jolted me electrically ten times more than this previous lightning incident. I could tell the pulse was also very magnetic in nature, having had an MRI less than two months ago, and several in the past two years. I was mid sentence and went instantly silent when I was frozen by a sudden blast of energy coming from the sky. The blast originated in the west-northwest sky and moved east-southeast, crossing the entire sky from horizon to horizon in maybe two seconds, no idea as to altitude. There was initially no light associated with this blast, only pure energy. I could feel this energy. It coursed through my body. It felt like a concentrated pulse of electric and magnetic energy. This wave of energy that hit my body felt like the rush from jets doing a low altitude fly-by at an air show, only instead of wind, it was a burst of electric and magnetic energy that grew gradually, drastically spiked, then trailed off. As this pulse moved directly over my head it seemed to convey my entire body with it in the direction of its path. It was strongest at this point. I was frozen still in fear and my upper body wavered east-southeast as if I were getting pushed and pulled at the same time, only nothing physically touched me except energy. I moved my foot to keep myself from being pushed over, otherwise I feel as if I would have been knocked down. As this pulse approached, the associated noise quickly turned from a low drone or buzz to a tinny screech that was deafeningly loud for a fraction of a second then returned to a low drone. It was louder than anything I’ve ever heard for that brief fraction of a second when it seemed to pass overhead. I covered my ears but kept my eyes wide open. As this pulse approached and the drone got louder, the sky filled with an ambiance of alternating green and blue waves that seemed to radiate linearly and at short regular intervals out from the path of travel of this pulse. The waves lit the overcast sky more and more brightly during the pulse’s rapid approach, like they were being projected on the clouds from above the cloud ceiling. The brightness approached the brightness of day but everything around me had an eerie blue-green cast. An instant after the noise got unbearable, immediately as it began to subside, the entire sky filled with an array of every color in the visible spectrum for a brief instant, brighter than anything I have ever seen in the atmosphere, including the light of day at high noon. At this point I was facing east, looking up at a 45 degree angle. It seemed as if the pulse just passed. The sky was splotched with every color in the spectrum shining on the clouds in an instant dazzling array, predominately oranges and reds. It seemed as if a 3D electric matrix of visible fine lightning-like electricity filled the sky and approached from the east, went over my head. This matrix of many hundreds of tiny electric bolts, blue green in color, may have entered the lightning rods of my house. This is unclear because my eyes were still recovering from the brightness of the flash. The previous blue green waves mentioned may have lasted two seconds and grown in intensity, but this rainbow colored flash with the electrical matrix lasted maybe a quarter of a second. The power in the house then went off completely with no associated surge or fade. It just cut out then came back on about a second later. ! The neig hbor’s floodlight remained on. All was calm and quiet for a second or two and my fear caused me to begin to turn towards the house to seek cover as I still looked at the sky. I then remembered Wesley was out front and I stayed outside to see if he saw anything. As he was approaching from the southeast corner of the house, maybe 75 feet away, ALL OF WHAT I HAVE RECOLLECTED THUS FAR WAS REPEATED IDENTICALLY, only we were paying closer attention to the sky now, so it seemed more extreme. I’m uncertain whether it was or not. Both sets of pulses, flashes, buzzes, and power outages occurred in maybe ten or twelve seconds total. During the hour following this incident my ears hurt as if I had been at a rock concert that lasted for a week. My eyes hurt like I just walked out of a pitch black cave and stared at the sun. The cable TV and internet did not work until the next day. Once I regained my footing after the first blast, I felt like I was in instant shock, not from disbelief but from the actual energy inside me. I felt like I was filled to the brim with free electrons. My heart rate instantaneously spiked to its maximum and stayed there for quite some time. My body did sort of a hormonal dump, not quite like going into shock, but similar. It felt wonderful and terrible, as I imagine trying crack cocaine for the first time would be. These feelings gradually normalized over the course of two hours. Immediately after we came inside following the second pulse, we all confirmed something very, very weird just happened. I insisted no one speak of it and we all write separate personal accounts. Before we started writing, I ventured back outside and gazed at the sky for a couple minutes to find out if I could see anything else. The once thick cloud cover had opened to a strip of clear sky. This strip of clear sky was bordered by parallel lines of cloud cover on each side. The strip of clear sky appeared exactly where I sensed the two blasts had traveled horizontally through the sky from west northwest to east southeast. It looked as if the strip was opened by parting winds in opposite directions in the atmosphere. It stretched from horizon to horizon. I noticed Phil had dropped a lit cigarette on the ground. As I gathered paper I felt like I was on a mild dose of ten different drugs at once and my heart rate would not move from its peak. Wesley agreed to write an account, but Phil was ghost white and looked like he was about to have a heart attack. He noticed the cable TV signal had been lost (it worked fine before this incident) and opted for bed instead. Wesley and I did not speak to each other at all as we wrote, and only when we both finished did the results appear incredibly similar in every detail. While writing, I tried to relax and slow my racing pulse. As I did this, I experienced a euphoric pain free sensation originating in my spine and neck. I felt like I was five years old physically, except my heart ached like I was 80. As I wrote from maybe 3:10 AM to 4:30 AM this euphoric feeling gradually shifted from my spine to my muscles where I experienced major muscle relaxation. It seemed as if the electricity left me in waves starting at my core that rapidly moved to the surface. Each wave lasted about four seconds, and there must have been hundreds of them. As these hundreds of individual waves of electricity made it to the skin, I would get the strongest goosebumps I’ve ever had and my hair would stand on end, noticeably on my arms. The feeling of muscle relaxation progressed to the point where I collapsed with my arms and chest on the table for about ten minutes where I could not write. I was motionless, simply enjoying the feeling when I was suddenly overcome by a strange migraine centered immediately behind my right ear near the surface of the skin. It was intense and piercing, and caused me to pick myself up, no longer experiencing any positive feeling symptoms. This migraine was very short lived and disappeared completely after only a couple of minutes. I have no history of headaches and have been routinely staying awake until 2-4 AM for about a month straight, so I felt no undue fatigue during any of this whole experience. The headache was enough to convince me I should go to bed. I tried to think about other things and eventually fell asleep. I slept through the night and woke up the next day with a sunburn on my face and hands, with redness and mild pain. My medication makes me very sensitive to UV radiation and I have been avoiding the sun completely. I ate breakfast, but could not keep it down. The cable TV came back on suddenly at about noon. Let me know what you think. THIS WAS THE WEIRDEST OF THE WEIRD.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

I am entering a very old sighting now, because until today I had nowhere I knew of to report the sighting which has affected me since it happened, almost 40 years ago.  I was 17 years old. This occurred on a late October early evening in 1967.  I was driving in a convertible car with a fellow on our way to a party.  It was just past dusk, I'd say around six thirty or so.  We were driving on a town road past a park where the railroad tracks run parallel to the street but up a hill.  As we approached a steep hill running alongside the tracks we saw a huge disk hovering over  the tracks and the electric wire towers.  It is difficult to determine size because we couldn't determine how close it was to us or the wires.  It seemed to be 20-30 ft long.  It was blueish in color and seemed translucent.  Small, evenly placed square or rectangular windows lining the front edge were visible to us.  There was absolutely no noise or flashing lights.  The front edge appeared to be about 50 ft from us and about 30 ft up from the street level.  As the two of us started to point and shout about what we were seeing, in a flash it took a quick jolt westward and then took off that direction so quickly that it could not be tracked.  We sped up the hill in front of us to try to follow but saw nothing.   Over the years I have been tempted to undergo hypnosis to ascertain if there had been any further contact between myself and the UFO that evening, but I was afraid to learn anything new.  I was already affected by the sighting and didn't want to become obsessed with it.  About 15 years later I happened to see the fellow I was with that evening and the first thing we both said upon our chance meeting was ""Did that really happen?""  So I know that he was similarly affected.  Years later, in the late 1980's my then husband and I had a sighting in the evening skies, but that was simply lights seemingly flying in formation, again soundless, and then suddenly disappearing.  This occurred over Norwalk, CT in the late '80's, not sure of exact dates.  We did not report anything.  I realize that this report is long after the fact, but it is important to me to have some record made of this sighting.  I would love to be contacted by anyone else who might have had a similar sighting at that time in SW CT or Westchester County, NY, area.

However I am unsure of the date.  It’s approximate.  However I am very sure it was during a Halloween Carnival which makes it even more weird.  So it was probably late October.  I saw two round and very bright objects.   They were both white in color.  They were traveling in parallel on the same path and trajectory.   They were flying from south to north at about 45 degrees above the western horizon.  They made no sound.  It’s hard to describe their size.  They were definitely a lot bigger than the brightest star or planet.  They were definitely a lot bigger than any aircraft lights at any altitude.  They were definitely smaller than the moon.  My first impression was that they were flying at low altitude because of their large size.  However I later decided that they could be at any altitude.  It’s hard to get some frame of reference when there is nothing else nearby to compare to.  So I really don’t know what their altitude was.  It took me years to figure out what I saw.  At one time I thought they were car headlights reflecting off of power lines.  Power lines are strung in parallel.  However there were no power lines.  Finally about 25 years after the event I came to the conclusion that it was a meteorite that had broken into two pieces.  Both pieces were still flying on the same course and trajectory as the original meteorite would have been had it not broken up.  It seems very reasonable that this is in fact what I saw.  No one else was with me at the time so there are no other witnesses. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)),,31.994822560975607,-102.09599847560976

I had not been asleep. I saw what at first I thought was a falling star.  It became larger, and then I thought it was a meteorite. It didn't hit the ground, but rather shot back up at what I recall as being a 45 degree angle.  Then, It darted up somewhere over or on the other side of our house. I remained in bed and watched the sky.  Several seconds later, it returned and darted over to an area where there are trees and a creek.  I remember it as being a rather large white light and approximately the size of a one of those big therapy balls.  I didn't hear any sound.  It moved along about half the heighth of the trees.  It then zipped through the air very quickly over to a hill located from the same field that I first sighted it in.  It did not land.  I saw it spin several times for just a few seconds.  It then darted back up into the sky at about a 45 degree angle at about the same location as it first appeared.  I went and woke up my mother and told her about it.  We watched the sky for awhile, but it never returned.  I remember that there were other reports of sightings around the Malvern, Iowa area in that year also.

While I knew a bit about UFOs and had heard about lenticular cloud formations in college science classes, I had never seen such a formation, however (other than pictures). Then, in 1968, I was assigned to an Air Force 'outpost' in Trabzon, Turkey. Trabzon is an old city with a harbor, located on the Black Sea coast within 'striking distance' of the border between Turkey and Russia. Our facility was on a high mountain (Boztepe) that overlooked the city below and had an unobstructed view out to the Black Sea beyond.  One afternoon in late spring, I was walking somewhere and happended to look up/out toward the sea (view was toward North). I saw a dull metallic looking 'disk' shaped object hovering in the distance. While I had little to judge size and distance by, it appeared to be pretty good sized and several thousand feet up in the air.  As I watched it, I became sure that I was seeing an actual lenticular cloud formation. I did not see anything like ports or windows, and did not hear any engine sounds, etc. There were a lot of clouds on the horizon...clearly, a significant weather front was moving in...and the light / sun angle / etc. was a little 'off'. Everything had that 'pre-storm' look, if you know what I mean.  Then, after several minutes of observation, during which the object hovered in one spot, it pulled the same maneuver the United Airlinea employees observed at O'Hare. Suddenly, it shot off at an upward angle...against the prevailing wind direction...directly into / through the approaching front. Punched a hole clear through it, like drilling a tunnel.  I was dumb-founded and realized this was no 'lenticular cloud'. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,,

Scorpion and subsequent search operation. I was aboard the U.S.S Monrovia APA-31, which was in route to Norfolk, Va., from a six month deployment in the Mediterranean.   At approximately 9 PM a large submerged object was sighted on the starboard side, just aft of the stern.  The object was an elongated ovoid in shape, luminescent orange in color, and appeared to have a translucent quality.  The USO matched several course and speed changes, and rendered compass, radar, and radio equipment inoperable. As quickly as the object seemed to have appeared, it disappeared. The length of the sighting was approximately 90 minutes and was witnessed by 1100 members of the crew and a contingent of US Marines. ((NOTE FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC SITE)) I was on board the USS Zellars DD777 and my ship departed April 4th 1968.  My ship arrived in the Med. sea  before  the Sub USS Scorpion exploded and sank.  The USS Monrovia was side tracked and participated in the search for the Scorpion.  There is still a lot of secrecy of how the sub sank.  Maybe connected to the object that Monrovia crew members saw? I thought this might be of some interest. Many things can be seen on the open sea.

At first I thought it was a Shell gas station sign that was five miles away.  That particular sign was very tall and located next to an interstate hwy.  Then as I thought about it, I realized that it couldn't be that sign it was simply too far away and I had never noticed it before. This was a rural area with open fields and scattered houses.  As I paid more attention, I could see this round orange ball, which must have been 75-100 ft. in diameter and maybe a mile away, was gradually descending to the ground. I thought there should be a logical explanation even including a hallucination, but as it descended (very slowly)it started to change shape from round to elliptical.  As it decended it's light filtered though distant trees as it apparently settled in a field. At this point I knew it was real but I was totally puzzled as to what I saw.  The change in shape has fascinated me.  I ruled out a hot air baloon; I have see those at night and the entire baloon is illuminated.  I have thought that the orange color was produced by heat.  Until now, I have only told a few people about this. In those days there was even more stigma and most people just laughed it off. I now know others have reported seeing something similar to this, and that is why I am offering my account - to support this mounting evidence.  That early morning I simply went home to bed and never investgated it further.  I wish now that I had explored the area where it landed.  Whether it was from this world or another, I can say it was not natural, it moved in a very slow and controlled fashion. The color was not glaring but more diffused almost like a harvest moon would be. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It began very high in the sky as a bright light (apparently the setting sun reflecting from it). Many of us were outside because it was warm weather, didn't get dark until late...us kids playing back in the days when you had three channels on TV and all doors and windows open because no one had air conditioning.  The object descended very slowly, but was in a straight down descent...no shaking or moving otherwise. It eventually settled right over our street (Phillips Drive) and was huge. It sat there for several minutes. Strange how there were no airplanes going to Weir Cook Airport during the duration of this sighting...usually, we could expect a jet to fly over every 3-10 minutes...they would get low enough to rattle the windows because we were very close to the airport.  Many adults and children stood in their yards watching as word spread quickly.  This craft was directly over my front yard. It was silver in color. At one point, I distinctly saw what looked like six dots (we didn't have computers then, but now I know it looked like computer data) emitted from the left side of the vessel. They were in perfect order.  After the dots were emitted, the object began a very slow ascent, in the same pattern it had followed downward: straight up, gradually.  Eventually it ascended from our sight.  I think everyone on our street made phone calls trying to find out what it was. Dad called the airport and they said it was a weather balloon.  But it wasn't a weather balloon.  I'm now 45 years old and I have never forgotten this experience. I'm a lifelong community journalist and have seen a lot of things, but I have never seen anything to match this.  I wish I could find someone in the old neighborhood who remembers it.

One of my friends pointed out a bright ""starlike"" light at about the zenith.  It was about the brightness of a zero magnitude star.  It was a single steady white light.  There was no apparent sound.  The light appeared to be a great distance away.   As we watched it, the light moved around the central part of the sky in a random path.  It sped up and slowed down.  It made abrupt turns at about 90 deg.  It moved around an area of sky about 10 degrees.  We watched it for a few minutes.   My friend ran into his house to bring out his telescope which was a department store 2 or 3 inch refractor.  Once he got the scope out and set up we lost the object in the sky.  We watched it for about 5 minutes total time.  Its brightness did not change.  Its movements were erratic and unlike an aircraft would make.  The turns were sharp, not like an aircraft.

It was oval from what I could tell, with yellow light comming from what looked to be windows around the center of the craft. The craft was at 50'to 70' altitude judging from the tree height over which it was moving.The craft was at a distance of 150' to 200' from our house. I yelled for my family and they moved to the windows and saw the craft too. We then ran upstairs to get a better view of the craft. It moved slowly taking perhaps 20-30 seconds to move out of sight over the woods that bordered church property. While we were watching the craft a figure was seen inside who looked to be working controls of some sort. The figure was backlighted by the glow and I only was able to make out a dark human type shape. The following morning my brother and I went back in the woods where the craft had dissappered. About 200' inside the woods there was an area of crushed brush and even a couple broken saplings the largest being about 2&1/2 inches in diameter. This area was about 50' around, circular. And about 20'to 25' apart in the center there were 4 holes. These holes were about 3"" wide and 6"" to 8"" deep.

It kept along down through the hollow, on the other side of the hollow it met with the rising of the hill covered with woods and tall trees, there it took a sudden rise and went just over the tall trees so as not to touch them, and on over a kind of flat or level ground, until it met with the foot of the noted hill, by the Indians called ""Owelus Sowless,"" then it ascended higher, ascending as the ground rose, and went over the hill where I could not watch it farther.  I had had a view of it about a mile and a quarter.  It moved about as fast as a common horse in a horse race.   The meteor as I shall now call it, was about 300 yards long in a serpentine shape, excepting the head which resembled the root of a tree plucked up by force.  It had no appearance of a neck, the body was thick as a bullock, tapering off like a serpent at the end of the tail.  The appearance was similar to welding hot iron and sparkling like it.   The immense heat warmed through my whole house, and left a stench like burning tar and sulphur, which was smelled all the next day.   Traditions, superstitions and fabulous stories are often told of meteors, apparitions and ghosts, wherein I place but small confidence for want of confirmation, but for the above, mine own eyes, and sound mind and body bear witness of the truth I have here related.

We were in a DC-3 at 8,000' on an IFR flight plan and about a thousand feet on top of all clouds.   Around 10:15 and about 110 miles East of Pittsburgh, my copilot spotted a strange object flying with us and about 500 feet off our left wing.  It was a black, shiny cylinder round on each end and it had no wings, empennage, engines or windows.   We called Pittsburgh Radio and asked if they had any aircraft in sight near us.  They reported none.   We called our passengers up. one by one, and asked if they could see anything.  They were shocked to see the object flying beside us.   The object shot ahead of us and waited for us to catch up.  It zig-zagged across our course for half an hour.  One of the scientists calculated its speed at 1,500 mph.  It ultimately disappeared ahead of us.   We were all sworn to secrecy by the ((senior company officer)) on board, ((officer's name deleted)), because we were on our way to secure the largest research contract in ((company name deleted)) history from the Air Force and, at that time, just about anyone reporting an UFO was considered to be a wacko.

My copilot and passengers are all deceased.  I simply want to go on record that I and seven cool, competent observers calmly observed this object and never reported it.

They were just falling asleep when the backyard was lit as bright as noon on a sunny day. My fiance also told me all three guys mentioned that their zippers and/or metal buttons on their clothing and sleeping bags got very warm. There was no noise, just the intense light.  They darted into the house and tried to watch whatever it was out of the patio door. They never saw a ""shape"", just the light beam at that point. After it moved away, my fiance ran down to the house where I was staying while my mother was at my grandmother's funeral.  He tapped on the window and when I awoke, he told me what they had just seen.  I got dressed and joined him in a grassy field across from his house and we watched as this bright light moved slowly around the Orangevale area (very rural in 1969).  As it moved, it shot a beam of light down every once in awhile.  We heard various animals make noise in the area the beam was shining.  We watched this for several minutes, then I told my fiance to call McClellan AFB in North Highlands, CA since that is where my step-father was currently stationed.  He did but they claimed they didn't know anything about the object we were seeing in the sky so they referred us to Mather AFB. We called them but they claimed the same thing.  We no sooner got back outside and all of a sudden there were 4 jets flying in from 4 directions, directly at the light.  As they approached, the light became brilliantly bright, then shot straight up in the sky and disappeared. The jets circled for a couple of minutes, then left. About one minute later, the light came slowly back down and continued its slow progress around the countryside. Every time it made an abrupt turn, it became brighter, then after it turned, it dimmed to ""normal"" again.   BTW, there was no moon that night so it was pitch black outside and all the stars were clearly visible, and if anyone claims it was Venus, well, it doesn't move - at least not very fast! No helicopter whump, whump, whump. And besides, helicopters - even today - can't do what that light did. And whatever it was, it out flew 4 jets.

On a quiet warm summer night I pulled up to my parent's house where I still lived while finishing my second college year. Across the street there was a high school football field with an old wood grandstand on the opposite side that faces the field and across to our house. Getting out of the car I heard an intermittent buzzing sound which seemed to come from the field. I thought it might be new sprinklers but the sound was odd so my curiosity was aroused. As I attempted to focus on the sound it shifted from the left to the center of the field and it also echoed off the grandstand. Audibly I realized it was off the ground. I looked up attempting to identify the source of the sound and I saw an object with multicolored lights that were flickering in a sort of rotating pattern.It appeared to have followed my car and was maneuvering in a tightening circle thus shortening its trajectory directly at me, and it was descending. I was awestruck long enough to observe subtle lights of green, red, blue and white on the bottom of the object. I have piloted a plane, boated, and I understand navigation lights well and these were not regular navigation lights. My hair stood on end as I was aware that I was likely witnessing a greatly advanced mechanical object. Suddenly, in sheer animal panic, I ran to the back porch of the house. I was really shaking as I fumbled with the key to unlock the door and the buzzing got louder indicating that it was getting closer yet. I rushed in and yelled at my parents who had been in bed a little while. They came out to the kitchen by the porch but the sound dissipated and they didn't hear it. Reflecting back, the object seemed rather small, perhaps smaller than my car. I am a sane and logical person and I truly believe what I experienced was not of this world, or at least anything mankind has created.

Oklahoma, 1971. One fairly clear evening (~8:45) at dusk, in the summer of 1971, my brother (11) and I (male, 13) visited our 3 friends [Female(14), female (12) and male (8)], who had relocated from the Houston area the previous summer. We were outside Broken Bow, OK. We were west (~5 miles) and somewhat south of the city and in a very rural area. We were walking north to see their church at night -- an exciting/scary thing to do! The birds had stopped singing and the crickets had not yet started, so it was very quite. I noticed that there were three lights toward Broken bow that were not blinking. I asked if they had any towers out there and they said they didn't know. And something was mentioned about their living in that particular location (on rural acreage in a mobile home) only since December (~7 months). So we just kept walking toward the church. About a minute or so later, we looked up to see a very large opaque trapezoid (triangle with its head cut off) with three lights. It was moving very slowly toward the sun that had already set. The narrow end of the trapezoid led and the wide end followed. It blocked out the atmospheric haze that was still aglow because the sun was not quite completely gone. It continued westward until it was obscured by the wooded area to the west of us. The lights were as such, two in the front on each corner and one in the north corner only. I do not remember their colors. The amazing thing is that it made no noise. There is no way to be certain of its size/height, although if I had to guess, since I thought the lights were towers, then it must not have been too high, assuming it maintained its height. If it was that height, I'd guess it to be about 1/3 the size of a football field.  I was elated to hear about the one in Phoenix in the 1990's. Although it was chevron-shaped, and had more lights, like ours, it was hovering, expansive and silent. I assume the aliens have changed their designs over the years; either out of boredom or out of necessity, scientific or economic - gotta keep up with the Joneses-Snergabloids. LOL.

The object I saw appeared to be a gigantic ball of fire perfectly spherical , approximately 100 meters in diameter displaying red,orange,yellow, and green flames. No blue or white flames. It appeared to have no tail such as a comet might display. It appeared to be elevated 175 feet off of the ground travelling at over 1005 miles per hour. It passed over the service school barracks # 519 and proceeded in an E-NE terly direction over the service school buildings, the base swimming pool and missed the water tower by an estimated 25 feet to the right of it ( Eastern side ) then proceeded over the hill and disappeared. I watched the sky over that area for at least 20 minutes and it appeared to NOT return to space. I checked the newspapers and radio stations the next day and apparently I was the only one who saw it. I reported it to the MAA but no effort was made by the Navy to investigate the incident The place was Bainbrige Naval training center in the southwest corner where the service school barracks are situated. I was standing the mid watch 0:00 to 04:00 the time was 2;00 AM on August 4th 1957. the direction was along a line from the NE corner of the junction of rte,222 and rte 276 at Port Deposit MD. to the center of Asbury Park N.J. in a north easterly direction. For closer references on the base, the water tower and the swimming pool might still be there but I understand that all the buildings were torn down because they were constructed with asbestos board. I estimate that the object entered the ocean somewhere about 12 miles east of Asbury Park and 24 miles south of Long Beach, Long Island along the line I just described. According to my calculations it would have had to pass over the village of Churchville, MD. before reaching My Location. Considering the estimated metalic content of such objects I believe that a submarine or even a surface vessel with sonar should be able to locate this object by following the direction of that line starting at the point of observation longitude 76 deg.6' and 15"" by Lat.39 deg.36' and 15"" and proceeding 23 degrees E-NE toward Asbury Park. Or they could start at Asbury Park and proceed 23 degrees E-NE along long Island. Considering the apparent observed rate of decelleration not allowing for distance the object might have burried itself in the gravel bank just beyond the boundary of the Naval base. I would check there first before organizing a sea expedition.. If you intend to look for it, any additional help I might be able to provide, feel free to contact me.

I did not check ""I would like to be contacted by an investigator"", but you may call any time you wish. ((name deleted)) REPORT:     In late 1960, I was assigned to the 30th Air Transport Squadron operating from McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey.  I had my navigator's wings, but every command had its own types of aircraft, methods, and secrets of navigating, so I was provided with an instructor until I was ready to be checked out by a flight examiner.  We were flying in Douglas C-118s, mostly the 1953 model, but with some 1951 models.  The C-118 is the same as the DC-6B, but with a reinforced floor (higher floor loading) for carrying cargo on occasion.  Usually, we carried passengers.  The 30th Squadron was one of several who comprised a group which was part of the 1611th Air Transport Wing. The first sighting of interest that we spoke of when I was in the Air Force came from an F-106 pilot who was the next door neighbor of the man who related the details to me.  In chronological order, this is what happened. On the night of March 12, 1961, two ocean station vessels found an object hovering off the east coast of the U.S.  By way of explanation, an ocean station vessel at that time was a ship which was kept at a particular latitude and longitude off one of our coasts or in mid-ocean. They acted as picket ships with early warning radar during this cold war period and as rescue vessels if a plane needed to ditch near them. When two of them off the coast of New Jersey picked up the hovering object on radar, they were able to calculate its precise altitude and geographic location.  This information was fed to NORAD (North American Air Defense) and to the ADC (Air Defense Command) contingent at McGuire AFB where I was stationed.  Consequently, two F-106 interceptors were scrambled. They climbed to the altitude of the hovering object and closed on it.  As they closed, they both picked up the object on their airborne radar sets and saw it visually as a glowing green ball. As they closed, the object began to move straight upward.  The F-106s followed. In a very short time, the interceptors were left behind and the object disappeared in the distance. There was a mandatory form we all had to fill out (an intelligence report) when certain things were witnessed (things such as encounters involving electronic ""warfare"" with Russian trawlers, Soviet ground stations, etc.).  At the debriefing, the 106 pilots were required to fill out and sign this form (one form for each of them).  This process could take a long time, especially after a tiring mission (something I discovered later on).  The debriefing officer kept insisting that (1) their radar sets were malfunctioning, (2) that the lead pilot saw an reflection in his windscreen, and (3) that the second pilot saw the exhaust of the first F-106.  Since, the pilots were honest individuals who hated to be pushed around, they refused to recant what had happened and filled out the forms and signed them correctly. The base housing at McGuire at that time largely consisted of units in a row with one ""apartment"" wall being the same wall for the adjacent ""apartment"".  A navigator named John Gargus (confidential information) who was part of the 1611th Air Transport Wing lived in one of these apartments.  One of the F-106 pilots lived in one of the two next door to John.  After the 106 pilots were released, the one next door to John (who was friend of John's) came over to complain bitterly about the incident and his subsequent treatment. On March 13, Neil (my instructor) and I left with John and the rest of the aircrew on a mission to Rhein Main Air Base near Frankfurt, Germany.  We landed at Rhein Main on the 14th.  After we had checked in to our quarters and were cleaning up (about 3:15 PM local time),  I overheard John talking to Neil.  I asked for John to repeat what he was telling Neil and he did so.  The story he told is the one related above. No one seemed to be particularly amazed at this story, but took it matter of factly.  There was some sympathy for the F-106 pilot that was forced to disclose this sighting.  From this and other indications, I realized that there was danger to one's career should one happen to ever mention  seeing certain things in the sky.  In the years that followed, it was evident that the Air Force ""first line troops"" had an underground that knew about certain supposed visitors while the top brass did all they could to sweep things under the rug. I have no idea where to find John Gargus at this time and no idea whether or not he would be willing to tell where the F-106 pilot is - and odds are he may not know.  However, I will try to see if I can discover anything without going to excessive trouble.  At that time, John was a first lieutenant assigned to wing headquarters. The second sighting I would like to mention was related by my flight examiner navigator, then a Captain, later a Major, named Jordan W. Grant.  We called him ""Pappy Grant"" and he was probably in his forties at the time. On December 5, 1962, I was given a line check from Pappy, again to Rhein Main. During our two-day crew rest in Germany, we had several meals together and at one of them, Pappy related the following story. It was during a mission in over the Pacific and Pappy was navigating.  It was daylight and Pappy had the LORAN set on as well as the radar (which was always on when it was working correctly).  Suddenly the display on the LORAN scope and the display on the radar scope shrunk, leaving only a dot in the middle of each scope.  The compasses began to gyrate wildly. Pappy stuck his head into the cockpit and found the pilots gibbering incoherently and looking fearfully back as best they could from their side windows.  Pappy asked what had happened.  Finally, they calmed down enough to tell him.  One told him that a flaming red ball had just nearly hit them head-on and that he was afraid that it might return.  The second said the same thing but claimed that there were four balls instead of just one.  The ball or balls had been at the same altitude as the airplane and flying straight and level. Eventually, the radar, the LORAN set, and the compasses returned to normal. Chances are Pappy is no longer alive.  He had a master's degree in marine biology and worked on his own blueberry farm with his wife between missions.  He would eat two large steaks whenever he could and enjoyed good food perhaps more than he should have.  If you have any suggestions on how to find either John or Pappy, please let me know.  A search on line might help.  Pappy was more than just a flight examiner with a higher rank than most of us.  He was a valuable friend to us all.",,,

While playing with my cousins in the front yard of my grandparents home at night, I suddenly was overcome by a fear response. The hair on my neck and arms stood straight up and I suddenly became very afraid.  I stopped playing chase with my brother and cousins.  I was being observed by strange looking creature in a transparent bronze sphere, fifteen feet across, approx. thirty feet in the air.  The craft was positioned next to the power lines and was completely silent and motionless.   I could not see the top half of the craft because the night sky was very dark that night.  The interior of the craft was illuminated and I observed instrumentation racks, three layers with space in between, a red led type light was on the middle panel on the left interior side (my left).  Left front midline was a stair with round pipe handrail, this handrail came across the middle of the craft to the right.  The creature appeared to be seated at a control console, but I could only see the upper torso, arms and head. The bottom area, from the stair to the right under the midline center area where the creature sat, was dark except for two small white LED type lights.   I saw no movement in there.  My focus came back to the creature, and I just stood there staring at it. This lasted three to four seconds and then the creature turned and our eyes met.  It knew I was watching and I observed a panic type reaction from it.  The eyes widened, the head and shoulders moved up and back, the arms came out to each side, it looked left and then right and then down at the control area.   Now this is where it gets interesting.  Its eyes return to stare at me while each arm independently performs eight to ten adjustments to the controls, in front and to the sides of the creature, it did this without looking where the hands were,and at speed almost to hard to follow.   When it completed the activity it just leaned back slightly and we stared at each other.  My brother ran up beside me, I grabbed his shoulder, and for the only time took my eyes off the craft, pointing up I yelled ""look"", he turned his head side to side but did`t look up. The craft was moving now, due north above me at about forty feet twenty mph and in total silence.  It was still transparent and as it disappeared into the darkness the pilot turned and looked at me, t did not return.  When I ran into the house shouting, ""I just saw a flying saucer"" all the adults just laughed.

I could hear water striking the hull of the object as it went very low across the water.  There was no sound other than the water hitting the object, I could hear no engine noise at all. I could not see a shape as it was dark and I could only see what appeared to be a bright light. I estimate that it traveled perhaps 300 feet across the water. It then went up at approximately a 45 degree angle straight into the sky.  I watched it until it was so small that it appeared to be one of the stars.  I was completely astounded, and just stood there a moment looking into the sky. I finally ran into a nearby building and called the Officer on duty to report what I had seen. The operator on the phone told me that I had not seen anything, and told me to forget it, as I would be in big trouble if I said anything further. I hung up the phone and never told anyone else about it because I thought I would be called a kook. I know what I saw was not a weather balloon, or a helicopter, and I have never seen a craft that could go straight up into the sky as fast as this thing did. I was in the Marine Corps air wing at the time and was used to seeing jets take off. I have never seen a jet fly without making any noise at all, so this in my opinion was not a jet either. I simply do not know what it was. I have never forgotten that moment.

Object seen skimming across bay in Iwakuni Japan.,Iwakuni (Japan),,,light,2 minutes?,"Occurred : 6/15/1965 22:00  (Entered as : Jun 1965 22:00) Reported: 8/29/2007 4:29:57 PM 16:29 Posted: 10/8/2007 Location: Iwakuni (Japan),  Shape: Light Duration:2 minutes?",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58442.html,"Object seen skimming across bay in Iwakuni Japan. I was on guard duty on the causeway in the Marine Base at Iwakuni Japan.  The causeway had a two story building on it and there were several shipping crates on the deck about 100 yards away from the building.  We were supposed to walk around the shipping crates during our watch. The sun was to my left when it was setting. I believe I was walking approximately north and south as I walked around the boxes. It had gotten dark and I was standing next to one of the boxes when I saw what appeared to be a white light come out from my left.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter light, but it was too big. It came down to the water to my left, and skimmed across the bay from my left to my right.  I would have been facing north-east at this point if my memory serves me right. The object made no sound, however I could hear the water beating against the hull of the object as it went across the bay.  When it got to my far right, it shot up at a 45 degree angle.  Within seconds it was so small that I could not tell it from the stars that were visible on that night.  It was nearly cloudless and I could see quite well. Once I got over the initial shock of seeing something that I could not explain, I ran to the building as fast as I could.  I got inside and told the clerk sitting behind the counter that I needed to call the corporal of the guard.  I was so excited felt flushed and could hardly talk. I called and told the corporeal on duty that I had seen a UFO. He immediately cut me off and said that I had not seen anything.  I tried to explain to him that I in fact HAD seen a UFO and he cut me off again.  He told me that I would be given a section 8 if I tried to report this incident.  He told me that for my own good, I had better keep what I saw to myself and not report it. I reluctantly told him, ""Okay!"" and hung up the phone.  I didn't want any trouble and surely didn't want to be drummed out of the service over it.  A section 8 means that they would send me to the nuthouse. I didn't tell anyone about this until recently.  I was 18 when this happened. I am now 60. I am a former Law Enforcement officer and know what I saw.  It was not a plane or a helicopter.  We did not have any planes on that airbase that could shoot up into the sky like that and disappear that fast.  At the time, I believe we were using the A-4 Phantom Jets, but I could be wrong about their designation.  I was a marine in the airwing at the time.

Suddenly an object came over the treeline along the right edge of the field at about 200 meters from me and 100 feet off the ground. It was a bright shiny silver disk about 50 feet in diameter making no sound other than that of it splitting the air.  I distinctly remember seeing a slight vapor coming off the edges of it as it moved through the air at perhaps 350 mph. It passed out of my sight over the woodlot  at the left side of the field quickly, but I had seen it and gotten a very good look at it.  I didn’t tell anyone about it for more than 30 years.

I didn’t see any writing of any sort. It seemed to be moving slow or just gliding through the air, but at that size and bulk it could have been going much faster.  It seemed to be solid and a bit metallic white. There was also no noise that it made. This Cigar shaped craft was flying really low. It was 70-85 feet in the air just over the tops of the tallest trees The Tallest trees being 45-50 feet tall. It was a sight no one would forget. I watched this craft for 4 and half minutes!

I did not take down the exact time but it was daytime and about twenty to thirty minutes before sunset. The driver of the van we were in saw the UFO and said, ""That is why people believe in UFO's"" and then said, ""Look at that!"" Three of us saw the saucer to shaped UFO that filled the saddle between two mountains to the West. The fourth passenger is visually impaired and could not see the UFO.  The UFO was up off the ground about 100 feet. It was the shape of two symmetrical wide shaped saucers with a small (1/3rd the size of the top side of the saucer) top hat looking top. The sides of the top were vertical and the very top was circular and flat. The coloration was a shade of silver that looked liked machined steel in coloration. There were no other visible markings, windows, lights, or anything else that wwere observable. It was daylight and the sun was shinning down on the top. On the bottom the UFO was dark but distinct against the skyline.  The size of the UFO had to be very large. I am guessing the size of a WWII battleship but perhaps it was smaller. It filled the center of the saddle of two mountains about two miles away.  The driver continued driving while we were trying to figure out what to do. We drove for about a minute with the UFO still in sight and we all began to pull out cell phone cameras. We pulled over and got out of the van but the UFO had moved North about ten miles away in one moment and stopped slightly above the horizon. By the time we took pictures it had moved again only slightly more Easterly direction and another ten miles or so away. The UFO was small but distinctive on the horizon about twenty miles away but could not be distinguished on my cell phone pictures.  I would have made a report of something sooner if I had a good picture of this daylight sighting of a UFO but with all of the news about UFO's in West Texas, I thought it might be a good thing to report. I looked all over the internet to see if any of the pictures of UFO's matched the one we saw but none were the exact symmetrical shape or the top was rounded top where this UFO’s very top was flat. I hope that reporting this helps.  There was a tornado near Fort Davis on April 29, 2007. I doubt this is UFO related but I thought I would report it as well.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,30.7587,-103.9249

There are small wavy ridges that make up the shape of the body.

They look like bright stars, but move incredibly fast (changing direction suddenly).  We did research on the internet and some speculated that they were the ISS and/or satellites, however neither of these are applicable simply because of their rapid movement and extreme course changes.  I have no idea if we are seeing these due to our proximity to White Sands Missile Range, and this is mere coincidental speculation anyway.  My wife used our admittedly lower quality telescope, and the objects moved so fast they were leaving a 'streak' and very difficult to track and focus.  We are and have been avid skywatchers since childhood.  While I would like to find a perfectly logical answer to this, the simple truth is that in my 54 years I have never observed anything like this.  The 'stars' are unusually bright.  What my wife did glimpse is that the object looked round at first, and then changed shape (at this time she could not be more specific, however we will continue to watch and hopefully be able to provide more information).  A higher quality telescope will be in the future as well.  The most interesting of these objects appeared left of the moon last summer (June).

It got very hot at night and we used to sleep every night in tents in the back yard to stay cool. We were sitting beside our tent and I looked up at the stars as I always loved to look at them. There was a red star that caught my eye and all of a sudden, a red light about the same size of the star came from it and moved at least 5 time faster across the sky than any plane I ever saw to this day. I ran in the house to tell my grandmother about it. She came out within seconds and it had already reached the other side of the house. We were all in awe over this and then all of a sudden there were many of these lights all looking like they were coming from every star in the sky. It was really weird because they all looked like they were the same color of the twinkling star they came from. This was definately not a meteor shower. I watch them every chance I can. All the lights moved from one end of the sky to the other crossing each others path as if they were just missing each other. They never left a trail and just looked like stars moving across the sky. The lights never went out and it lasted at least a half hour. They never blinked like the stars they seemed to have came from.  It kind of freak my other family members and after a small amount of time they would not even admit it happened. There was a write-up in the paper shortly after that, that many people had saw the same thing. I can't remember exactly what the article said but I know they didn't have and explaination of what they were.  After awhile they started to get dimmer until they all disappeared. It was definately an experience I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2007-02-01T00:00:00,42.09974517647059,-80.07763388235293

Since this sighting I've not really had a venue to give my story, until I happened upon the Chicago story. So here goes.  I was a high school senior with my boyfriend and another couple driving out one summer night to my boyfriend's family farm.  As we approached a hill near the farm I noticed a very bright light ahead of us up the hill slowing moving across the road.  It was so bright and unusual that we pulled over, stopped the engine and watched.  Scary as it might seem now, we were just in awe of what it might be.   In what seemed like eternity the object made its way across the road almost directly in front of us just above the tree tops with no sound at all coming from it.  By this time the object, which my memory now thinks of as a fat (in height) oval, was not as bright.  We had also at some point gotten out of the car just staring at it, not believing what we were seeing.  And there were maybe 3 or 4 other cars that had stopped and parked as well on both sides of the road watching the same event, but I don't recall talking to any of them. I don't know how long we stood there, but the thing I remember most is that the object made absolutely no sound and just hovered there with some kind of colored and white lights revolving on the top very slowly.  I felt then and still do now that whatever it was, it knew we were there.  Then the object started very slightly backing up away from us.  Just a moment later it backed away much faster then stopped again.  Before we could blink it was gone!  A massive object was a small dot in a matter of seconds!  Gone.  What is amazing to think of today is that everyone watching that night just got back in their vehicles and left without a word!

As we approached Ft Rucker near dusk (approximately ten miles out), the tower asked us to turn on our landing light so they could verify our position. This was done and the tower reported seeing our landing light and proceeding to give us altimeter and wind direction. Skies clear.  Suddenly, cockpit covered in clouds and through the clouds a faint red light (blinking) about the size of an orange was approaching the craft.  The light as it approached became brighter and more distinct.  It broke out of the clouds and came directly at the cockpit.  The pilots dove the helicopter down and to the left.  Pilot and copilot called tower to ask if any traffic was in our area and they said no.   All of us, Pilot, Copilot and myself thought we were going to collide with something.

I was flying home for Christmas from Florida via Dallas/Denver on a commercial aircraft probably Braniff or American. We were at cruising altitude (30,000 ft?) between Dallas and Denver. I was gazing out the airplane window towards the west when a light from behind the plane caught my eye. I looked back and saw a saucer/disk flying parallel to the plane a couple of hundred yards from the plane and slightly lower. I watched while the disk caught up to the plane, passed it, and continued on ahead of the plane until I lost sight of it due to the angle of my line of sight out the plane window. The disk was fully visible and relatively close so that I had an unimpeded view of the side and top of the disk. The disk itself was a silvery, metallic color and was shaped very much like an upside down saucer. Around the circumference of the disk, there were rotating bright orange lights and stationary orange lights, looking very much like the wooden spokes of a vintage car when it travels at a certain speed and it looks like the spokes are stationary. There were no markings or external features of any kind on the surface of the disk and no signs of a vapour trail or obvious propulsion system. My feeling at the time was that the disk was about 40 feet across and 15 feet high. During the sighting I glanced around the cabin of the plane to see if anyone else had seen it, but there were very few passengers aboard and of those, no one seemed to be looking out my side of the plane. I would be thrilled if the captain and airline crew on this flight contacted you and made a report of their sighting because they could not have helped seeing this disk. I'm only sorry I didn't talk to them after the flight or remembered the flight number but at the time I was quite satisfied with the fact that I had seen this disk. I thought at the time that this could be some kind of experimental aircraft but I have to this day not seen anything like it. I submitted a report to one of the UFO agencies back in 1983 or 84 and it was published in their journal, Alan Hynek wrote a little comment on it. But since it isn't in your database I thought I should send it to you as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

Back in 1976 I had just been out of High School for a couple of years, and was still living at home.  Our home was located several miles outside of Scottsville, Kentucky in a location named Petroleum near the Tennessee border.  We lived on a hilltop,  and could always clearly see anything up in the sky.  I remember the following unusual incident clearly.  One particular night we were all in our living room watching television, and it was around 11:00 PM.  My Dad decided to go out into the back yard to check on our well pump that we were having problems with.  The night was dark and clear, and no stars were visable at all.  Dad went out the back door and all was quiet for a while.  All of a sudden Dad came practically running back into the living room and told us to come outside and see ""this"".  He said, ""Get out here because you have got to see this"".  My Dad was a U.S. Army veteran, and I thought nothing could scare him - but ""this"" did.  We could see the scared look on his face, and we wondered what ""this"" was.  We all hurriedly went out the back door to the yard.  Dad then told us to look up in the sky, and what we saw was truly amazing to say the least.  Directly up in the northern sky was a very large glowing white cross.  Trust me, there was absolutely no mistake about it - it WAS a CROSS, and it was glowing really bright with sort of a halo around it.  The cross was clearly visable.  The whole thing was solid white.  The object remained stationary and never moved at all.  As I recall our neighbors heard us and came outside to see it for themselves.  We were all just staring at this large white cross that we all could clearly see.  We stayed outside for thirty minutes or longer just staring at this beautiful white cross.  Later on we heard on our local regional news about many other people who had also seen this enigmatic cross object.  It was reported as an ""unidentified sky object"".  Why didn't they say it was a c! ross?  W ere they afraid of something?  I always wondered.  My family and I are honest people and don't make up tales.  This story is one-hundred percent true as I have told it.  I know that we all saw something amazing that we were intended to see in my opinion.  Somehow I felt blessed to have seen this.  People may think that I am crazy or made this story up, but I did neither one.  What we saw that night back in 1976 was something somehow beyond our comprehension to understand.  As I have gotten older I now realize that their are things that are really seen or observed everywhere that people cannot understand - such as UFOs.  This is one such case, and if it was a UFO then it was quite real.  I just felt that now was the right time to share my unusual story with others.   Thank you, and keep up the good and important work. ---- ((initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I went upstairs to my room to get something, and happened to look out the window to see what I thought was a C-141B on approach to McGuire AFB. The approach pattern would have plane fly directly over our house at times. I noticed the plane appeared to be extremely low and barely above the tree line behind our housing area, ( Lake Valley Acres ). This got my attention and I watched the plane get closer and closer, but it was moving too slow and low to be a large aircraft. I turned my light out in the room and closed the door so my eyes could adjust to the night time sky. The whole time I was watching this craft, It had a bright, almost spot light like light on it that I mistook for a landing light, but their was only one. As it got closer, I noticed it was only slightly above the roof line of the two story houses, maybe 20-30 feet higher. I was really getting scared now because it was almost over my friends house directly behind our house. I went to open the window to hear it, but the window was already open. It was completely silent, flying at about 5-8 mph. It had a very bright half circle shaped light on the bottom of it, that was bright enough to prevent me from seeing details of the top of the craft. I could see the outline and it was about a 35-40 foot diameter circle with the light about 15 feet in diameter and about half that in depth. As it flew directly over our house, I could see the outline better as it passed. When I could nolonger see it I ran out of my room and frantically ran into the kitchen to ask where the Polaroid one step was. I think my mom gave it to me, but of course it had no film. I then ran full speed out of the kitchen, disregarding what ever my mom was yelling at me, and cleared the entire flight of steps, hitting the screen door handle at the same time and running into the front yard. I could see it real good now it was just crossing the street. I grabbed a couple o rocks out of my ! mom's fl ower bed and got ready to throw a few rocks side arm at the craft. Yes, it was that low, and yes, at the time, I was that good!! Just as I got ready to throw my first rock, and it was just over our neighbors house in front of me I thought, ""what if I do hit it and it stops?!"" Visions of disintergration, ( 10 years old, remember ) flooded my mind and I dropped all of the rocks and watched it fly towards McGuire AFB at roof top level until I could nolonger see it. I ran back in the house to tell my mom I just saw a UFO and she just said, ""That's nice, it's time for you to get ready to go to bed"". I repeated my self and she repeated her self. I asked her why she didn't believe me and told me again to go to bed. I went to my dad down stairs and he listened to me but I think that was just a parent humoring  a child. I went to bed but did not go to sleep, occasionly looking out my window for another UFO. I think I finally went to sleep at around 3:00 or 4:00 am. At about 7:00 am my mom runs in my room, shaking me saying, ""Look what's in the morning paper!!"", ( Burlington County Times, or Philadelphia Inquirer ). There was a picture of a man with black hair and a close beard and mustache with glasses smoking a pipe. The caption above read, ""Moorestown Man sees UFO"" I read the article and his description was just as I described, except it had multi-colored perimeter lights on when he saw it. The paper said McGuire was asked If they had tracked any UFO last night, and a base rep of course said their radar picked up nothing. I looked at my mom with a angry glare, and told her, ""I told YOU I saw a UFO!!"" She looked at me and her eyes where staring to well up with tears in disbeief. To this day, when I tell my mom to tell my friends about the UFO, she walks out of the room, or says, ""I don't want to talk about it"", or says absolutely nothing. I wish I could find ""The Smoking Man"" or find the news paper article to prove to my friends and family I did see something.

We were in a car driving my grandmother back home.  My grandmother, I (in the middle) and my mother sat in the back seat.  My parents friends sat in the front.  We were driving north, about four miles from town on a major road.   The driver (male) noticed three bright objects 'hanging' or 'hovering' above the green wooded hills east of the road.  The objects were not far above the hills.   The driver commented something like 'Do you see that?'  The adults said 'yes.'  The driver pulled the car over to the side of the road (facing north, east side of road.)   We ALL got out and stared at the objects.  (They were appx. 3 miles east & a few hundred feet above the top of the hills).  The three objects hung in the sky for minutes while the adults made brief comments and stared.   The three objects were hanging at various altitudes.  One on top and to the north of that one and somewhat lower the second object and the third to the south of the first and slightly lower than the second.  No sound was heard.   After minutes, the top object suddenly flew up and out of sight.  The two lower objects remained unmoving.   After a few seconds one of the lower objects also flew up and out of sight.  And a few seconds later the third and last object shot upward and out of sight.   My mother said these objects were silver in color and oval shaped.   At times the sun glinted off of them. (They would have been east of the sun which was facing their front (behind the road and car) during that afternoon time.   I was a child (4-6 yrs. old).  My parents owned an electrical contracting business and were prominent in the local country club social group.  We lived in the best part of town.   Our friends also owned a thriving photography business and all were prominent in city society.  My grandmother came from Europe and lived on a 5-acre estate. Our photographer friend went to the local newspaper to report this sighting.  An article appeared in this newspaper.  Also...this photographer friend of our family was very close to an! inventor in this locale who had a great interest in aviation--and the sighting discussed above was talked about in great detail over the years.

If you saw a dime about 15 Feet from you, that would be the size it looked in the air. It may have actually been about the size of a small plane.  The Afternoon sun shined on it and it was clearly a silver disk, or baloon shaped object. It didn't move for as long as we (my family and I) looked at it. My mother dismissed it as a weather balloon. But this was a warm summer day, no clouds at all. Completely blue skies. Why send up a weather balloon? Also, balloons drift with the air currents. This object didn't drift at all. In fact, it stayed exactly in one spot. We looked at it for about 10 minutes, and then went back into the house. We didn't see it leave. Witnesses were my mother, a nursing proffessor at the University of Iowa, myself, and my brother who was about 13 at the time. It was too high to be a teathered balloon. Plus it was directly over the town, can't have a teather over a town with an airport. Not a blimp either. Too high and stationary. Not a plane, it didn't move at all. Not a weather aberation.

They have long arms, wavy silver-color-hair, and some of them have beard.  They wore blue clothes with high collar, belt with some gray cylindric stick and shoes that look like black military boot.   Some inhabitants said that they searched for something.  A report said that a six-year-old kid was kidnapped and be returned in confuse in some field area.   Finally, some policemen waited and soon met with them.  The police then shooted them (around 13 metres at distance) but they realized none of them were bleed, nor dead body found.

This is a second party report of a UFO abduction which occurred in about 1963.  The abductee was about 22 years old at the time. He told the story to another person approximately in 1965, who first recounted it to me about two years ago. It is of high interest because the abductee apparently was able to remember the event in extreme detail. He worked as an outside salesman at the time of the abduction event, perhaps the reason he was not noticed as missing by person who knew him. The abductee said he was missing for three days. He described the abductors as being small ""people"" with large heads and large eyes. He considered them to be performing ""medical experiments"" on him. Evidently, he believed the abductors to be able to communicate telepathically, and reported that they conveyed to him that they would be contacting him again every 10 or 15 years. The abductee told the person who reported this story to me that his father owned a drugstore chain in San Francisco. Recently, my source talked to me again about this story, and recalled that he said that his family attended Temple Baptist Church in San Francisco. Evidently, he got married at Temple Baptist Church about in 1966. He was described as being of medium height and slim build, and a Scandanavian ethnic type with blond hair. I am not personally in a position to investigate this story since I do not live in the San Francisco Bay Area anymore or in California at all, but I think a good investigator could make quick work of finding out who this person was. If he is still alive, I imagine he would be willing to talk. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

A friend of mine and I were throwing a football in his backyard around noon on a perfectly clear October sky.  We started to throw high passes to each other when I saw a tiny silver object at a high altitude.  I thought nothing of it because at that time there was a U.S. Naval Base located just North of New Iberia and seeing aircraft was a frequent everyday sight for us.  We continued to throw the football to each other and I decided to throw a high pass back to my friend.  We both looked up at the ball and we both became nearly speechless.  There was a huge circular chrome craft with a circular shaped bar going from one side of the craft to the other.  It had a clear glass looking globe in the center.  I told my friend to get his dad, quick.  His dad came out of the house and saw it.  When he came out the craft rose in altitude until it was out of sight.  It took it maybe a second or two to do this.  The strange thing about it was it made no noise at all.  His dad who was a Naval officer in World War 2 went inside immediately and called the Naval Base.  He spoke to the radar personnel and asked them if they had seen anything strange on their radar and he gave them the approximate time we saw this thing.  They told him it was probably just a weather balloon.  He then told them about his Naval career and told them no weather balloon could have traveled that fast. Every time I go back home and run into my friend I ask him if he remembers what we saw and he says yes.  I asked him to draw it to make sure it was what I remembered what it looked like and his sketch matched what I saw.  I don't tell anyone about this anymore because they don't believe it and think I am crazy.  Some say they have seen strange lights at night but my buddy and I saw this craft on a cloudless day.

I was 7 months pregnant and got up to take a water pill.  I noticed it was very light outside my kitchen window.  I thought there must be a full moon.  As I sat my glass down on the counter the room began shaking.  I had been in aftershocks before when I lived in California and I thought I had experienced a small quake. I started back to bed but then I heard the noise.  It was a humming like telephone wires, but more insistent.  I checked the oven and the refrigerator but couldn't find the noise. Never mind.  This is going to take all day and I already tried to send you a report on e-mail that didn't go through so I've already written this once and don't want to do it again. Suffice it to say I watched this craft for some time, even walked over to the fence, but it has a strange ending.  I went back to bed and didn't remember seeing it until months later when I went to my surprise baby shower.  My friend had just read a book on flying saucers and when she said the words ""flying saucer"" I blurted out my story. I didn't think I had missing time but perhaps I may be wrong and since I'm not getting any younger I thought I'd talk to someone and see if it was worth pursing from a scientific angle for information.

After 2 morning job interviews in Pittsburgh a light rain had stopped with only clear blue sky and some low white cloud rolls were left not very high over the small hills beside the highway.  While driving south on PA Route 51 just a few miles from downtown Pittsburgh a movement toward the end of one cloud caught my eye.  When I looked up and saw it I figured it was a puff of black smoke and looked back at the road.  Then the movement which I could see out the top of the windshield on the passenger side caught my eye again and when I looked up I witnessed a round disc shaped object slip slowly from the cloud  into clear blue sky.  It was so obvious what it was I laughed and said aloud, ""Hey, you lost your cloud cover.""  Judging by the size of a small plane's wing span of about 30 feet I'd guess that to be the same distance across this craft.  The craft was moving as if following a beam and was moving very slowly  sideways tilted away from me so I was viewing the bottom I'd think.  Shortly after losing the cloud cover and being only around 500 feet up it suddenly went to a higher altitude which would be about twice the height it was at or approximately 1,000 feet. There was no wavering or turning when it went higher, it went up at the same angel it was slanted at and moved in one motion, it did not start out slower, get faster then slow down to a stop.  The speed up to the higher level was at the same more accelerated rate, this movement took the craft away from where I was on the highway. I was now looking at it in the top middle of my windshield and where it stopped at it still had the same slow sideward movement.  It proceeded to go across the highway where I was watching it out of the top left of the windshield.  Then as suddenly as it went to a higher altitude it came back down to about the same level it was at when I first saw it but still had the same slant.  I watched out the driver's side window and observed it slide right into the end of another cloud.  This craft looked gray wi! th no li ghts or other distinguishing features and never changed its tip or slant and did not turn to go to a higher level or back down.  I think the most obvious thing about this sighting was the perfect lines or beams it was following with no wavering at all.  I received very good grades in Physics and I know even to this day that we do not have any type of propulsion system to make a craft fly like what I observed.

I lived in the countryside back then in Les Escoumins, a small village in the province of Quebec in Canada.  The first  time i was about 5 years old . I am now 38 years old. The second time it was about 2 or 3 years after that .  The first time we were several people who saw it. We called neighbours and they saw it as well. It was a huge round orange fireball crossing the horizon line.  The sun was on the west side and that fireball was going towards Maine ( so it was going from north to south when looking into the west direction).  We all saw it for a few minutes untill it desapeared ( some peole said it plunged into the st Laurent river so if it did, it changed it's directory to go down). Some other people said that an army aircraft tried to chase it but i haven't seen any aircraft at that time.  It must have been at least 5 times bigger than the sun.  It was just amazing an no one ever knew what it was. It left no trace of smoke on it's path.  The second time, i was back home after going to see a car accident that happened up the street from where i lived ( there must be a report somewhere at the police station about that accident if i ever want to know the exact date of ny sighting).  At that time , it was peach dark and there was no light post around.  I saw the exact same fireball on my way back home.  This time i was in the north direction and the firewall was heading West.  Same fireball, same speed, same everything but it was much furter.  I've seen shooting stars many many times before and after the events and i can tell that it was not one. The movement was constant. Both times, they were not going in an angle but on a straight horizontal line.  No noise, no crashing ( that i saw) , no reports in the medias.  What strikes me the most is when many years later i saw the movie about the Allagash Abductions.  The fireball looked a lot like the object in the movie. Was it the same object? I don't know.

Strange lights,Cold Lake,AB,1973-04-15T21:30:00,light,3hrs,"Occurred : 4/15/1973 21:30  (Entered as : 04/15/73 21:30) Reported: 4/6/2006 8:24:26 AM 08:24 Posted: 5/15/2006 Location: Cold Lake (Canada), AB Shape: Light Duration:3hrs",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49989.html,"Strange Lights Indeed  Upon returning home on a beautiful spring evening, in the approximate year of 1973, rounding the corner to my country abode I saw 3 lights above the forest. It was evident that these lights were round in shape. The time was approximately 9:30pm - it was dark by now. The colour emanating from them was like bright headlights, white with a slight yellow hue, yet they were above the trees. I am a mother of 6 children and of sound mind and character. I don’t make stuff up. I live near a very large, deep and pristine lake in NE Alberta, Canada.  My home is nestled in a forested area adjacent to one of the many bays of this lake, named Cold Lake. To the west of my home, approximately 4 miles, is the largest jet fighter Air Force Base in Canada. I am very used to and familiar with seeing and hearing these jet aircraft on a regular basis. What I witnessed this night was very different. After a few minutes of gazing upon this anomaly, one of the lights sped away in a westward direction. Its take-off or acceleration was like nothing I had ever seen in a conventional aircraft, jet, helicopter, prop-plane, whatever.  One could compare its take-off to the release of an arrow from a bow.  Also, there was absolutely no sound. I would estimate their distance away from me at ½ mile or less. This left 2 lights still in place above the trees. Given the estimate of ½ mile distance away, the actual size of the lights would likely be somewhat larger than virtual headlights. No structure, definition or appendage to the lights was visibly evident; it was a dark night. Upon my arrival home, one block from my initial visual, my son, very excited, asked if I had noticed the lights above the trees over there? I responded with, ""“yes"", of course! We discussed the matter briefly, including the one that got away and decided to investigate further. The lights were hovering over a marshy area. The water was lit up due to the proximity of these lights emitting upon it. The light would pulsate seemingly on a timed or regular basis. It is important to note that there are no roads where these lights appeared; the only road is the one to my house. I state this so that no one will have notions that they were motor vehicles; how could they be?  At the time of this sighting we had 5 dogs. Don’t ask why, we just did. As the light decreased from full intensity to zero light or pulsated from normal to no light, the dog’s hair would stand straight up on their backs and they would bark, acting erratic in nature. When the light returned to normal the dog’s behaviour did too. I said that my son and I were going to investigate further and so we did.  At approximately 10:00pm we decided to drive around to the top of a nearby knoll hoping to get a better view.  The lights were still visible but somehow appeared to have moved to a more distant location.  We watched them (the 2 remaining lights) for about 10 minutes and then decided to go home.  Upon attempting to start the car it was discovered that it was unable to turn over; it was ""dead,"" so-to-speak - very uncharacteristic of this vehicle because the battery was new and maintained regularly.  We supposed that somehow these lights had an effect on the operation of our car.  So, we had to walk home. As the evening progressed we would periodically look outside to see if the lights were still present.  It was midnight when we finally went to bed and the lights continued in place. I must say that the whole experience gave me what I would define as a spooky or unnerving sense of emotion. We returned to our car the next morning; it started without incident. Strangely enough, I spoke to a neighbour about this event.  Earlier in the evening, at about 7pm, he was travelling to his home and witnessed a light or lights travel immediately over his car at a high rate of speed.  Perhaps these lights were related or of the same group. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,54.4502,-110.2017

It apparently was not received, as it is not in the website database. Since that submission, my recollection of the event has improved and therefore changed somewhat.  This is a recollection of a sighting of unknown lights in an unusual pattern sometime in the early 1970's, perhaps 1973 or 1974. I have tried to remember details and circumstances as accurately as possible. I am no aviation expert but I have grown up around aircraft, living near Reid-Hillview Airport, well before it was purchased by Santa Clara County and became a FSS, and I was acquanted with the former owner, his daughter and her family, as well as others who worked there or had tiedowns or hangars, so I know more than a little bit about aviation. There are some explanations for those who are unfamiliar with aviation as well as to explain why I do not believe that the lights belonged to any ordinary aircraft.  In the early 1970's I was at home during a late spring or summer evening and looked up to see nine orange/amber lights arrayed in three equilateral triangles which were themselves arrayed as one large equilateral triangle. Each orange light was at the point, or vertex, of each small triangle which themselves were at the points of the larger triangle, nine lights in all.  The night was warm and the smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen. There was no moon. Typically, above the smog, I am told there is a strong Westerly wind in the evening and into the night.  The array maintained perfect equilateral triangles as it headed roughly north-northwest in a straight line, It appeared to move slowly, like a light airplane but seemed to be silent. I watched the lights closely for some time, from when it was almost overhead, as it passed overhead and then was lost in the smog and reflected city lights somewhere over the north part of the city, trying to see the outline of some object and watching the lights to see if any moved independently, as well as for any lateral drift. I never could see any object, just the lights, none of the lights moved relative to the others and no lateral drift was observed. I estimated it could be seen for at least fifteen minutes.  The array was unusual as no navigation lights were seen: No red, no green, no white, no strobe or flashing lights of any kind, just steady orange/amber lights, which I realised later had the same color as low-pressure sodium street lights.  I know what aircraft look like in the sky at night, as I lived next to a small civil airport at that time and lived directly under the southbound departure route for the city's major airport and I often watched aircraft go over, trying to guess what kind it was. Sometimes, because of the smog, all that can be seen are the navigation lights. I have never seen such lights on any aircraft before or since. It occurred to me that the aircraft might have been some of the new SR-12's recently made public but the lights never moved relative to each other, they never drifted from course and there were no navigation lights, as would be required near the airports under VFR rules.  There was no engine noise. At the time, jet engines were still quite loud and some DC9's, 727's and 737's, as well as DC8's from Mexico were still using turbojets instead of the quieter fans. Neither turbine nor piston engines were heard.  The array was viewed through smog which reflected the streetlights so there was only a view of the orange/amber lights. No solid object was seen, no reflections. The smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen, neither could any aircraft from either airport. But somehow those lights could be seen.  Because of the smog,  the exceptionally slow speed and the lack of any visible shape I could not determine the altitude or the size of the object or objects attached to the lights.  I asked around to see if anyone else had seen the aray of lights; no one had. The FAA and the local newspaper both pointedly expressed their lack of interest in the event. It remained forgotten until I saw another very unusual sky object while in Monterey. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Basically, I traveled throughout Germany, wearing civilian clothes and pretending I was a former soldier that now resided in Germany dealing narcotics.  My codenames were Porkchops or Frisco, depending on what part of Germany I was at.  I went after what was known as the ""Khaki Mafia"" that originated in Vietnam.  The perpetrators recognized me, because I was known to wear a black trenchcoat, sunglasses, dark clothes and at the time I was sporting a beard and mustache.    But, before this excitement took place, I was in Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, in 1974 on a training exercise.  One night, two other soldiers and I were in Columbia, South Carolina, checking out the sights and we looked in the sky and saw 6 glowing blue discs in formation.   As we watched the UFOs dispersed in erratically zig zagging movements and disappeared quickly.  The first thing that came out of one soldier’s mouth was ‘geese?’  We looked at him and said ‘no way!’.

The time was 07:40 and I saw what I thought was a small odd looking plane flying across the large open field southwest of our home. It was first seen at about 2500 Yards distant and only about 600 feet in height but continued to get closer, as the distance decreased I quickly realized this was not any aircraft of our technology. It was a crystal clear morning with no clouds and the sun was low in the east as it hit this object it looked like polished aluminum or stainless steel, it was not real large my best guess as to its size would be about 45-55 feet round but slightly cone shaped it had lights around bottom edge and they were rotating what looked to be in the opposite direction of the crafts rotation.   It came to within 120 yards of our home and then just stopped and hovered over the roof of our next door neighbors home and stayed in that spot for about 7 minutes and that’s when  I called my mom and sister to also watch this object and we all observed it until it decided to leave.  It went straight vertical and went out of sight with no sound of any kind.

As I was walking along the base alone I noticed a shadow pass over me.  I looked up expecting to see a cloud.  Instead there was this large black triangular craft silently moving overhead very slowly.  It wasn't very high above the trees and I looked for identifiable markings but saw none.   I was familiar with most military aircraft but couldn't identify it so I thought maybe it was the SR 71 Blackbird which was still relatively secret.  My thought then was it couldn't be the Blackbird because it was as big as a B-52 and completely silent.   As I watched, it ascended straight up without pointing the nose of the aircraft up and disappeared in the clouds in an instant without any noise.  I've seen many aircraft flying at top speed including the F-4 Phantom during combat in Vietnam and this craft was much, much faster than any other.   I didn't report it because I had about 2 weeks left on my tour before going home and I thought I had just witnessed something I wasn't supposed to see.  I didn't want anything to delay my departure so I kept silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

What troubles me the most is the first time I saw the alien was at a very young age on my way home from school.  But the siting was while myself and two friends were on our way from elmira up the road through elm hghts to purchase beer.  I was 18 at the time and I am currently 48 years old.  Anyway, as heading down the road(Iwasin the back seat leaning between the buckets) and this light in the sky was coming right towards us as if it were following the road. We immediately pulled over and got out of the car, there it was hovering above (bout 15 feet above) the telephone pole.  It zigged zagged acrossed the sky east to west 3 or 4 times like it was showing off or something.  Then headed up the road the same direction we were going to travel.  As you probably can imagine we were yelling and screaming like three girls. ((deleted))  and the like.  As it traveled up the road it was like it wanted us to follow it cause the speed of this was never seen on this earth.  After about 1/4 mile we were at the Chemung County Fair grounds where we pulled over again and it hovered over us and just kinda like it was taunting us.  My two friends stayed next to the car (as I recall)  I went into the road and was screaming to cars passing ""stop stop look up look up""  people just looked at me like nothing was happening.  This haunts me to this day cause I know they'll be back again soon it has been a while since the last time.  We went directly to the police dept in Horseheads to report this and the officer said ""go home and sleep it off boys"".  I wanted so bad to get some kind of evidence I called the local airport which is 10 minutes away and asked for the tower.  They said because of the low altitude they could not verify anything on radar.   It continued to fly over the tree tops then we lost site of it.  The second part that is most troubling to me is a few years later I ask the one guy I was with "" hey remember when?""  He had no recollection of the event even happening, this really really disturbs me.  I know I wasnt dreaming and I know we got that ((deleted)) beer after that had happened. I was ready to get lit then.   I havent spoke to the third party in this event cause I was afraid too after what already occurred.  BTW_ NONE of the ((deleted)) pics match the craft ""WE"" saw.And the ((deleted)) aliens arent little gray men cause the ones that have visited me are 5 1/5 to 6 feet tall and are flatt black with no whites in thier eyes.  The one time they visited me I was able to take my right hand and pinch my left arm sooo hard there was a black and blue mark when I awoke.

I lived in Oxford, Michigan and for an unknown reason I woke in the middle of the night, I do not know the time, however I was drawn to the window.  I looked out the window and saw a very bright light land in the gravel pit behind my house.  I figure it was about a mile out… Once the bright light landed it did illuminate enough to see a glow in the woods. (Just beyond the dig section of the pit).  I honestly cannot remember how I was drawn, but I was drawn outside.  If I had to guess, I would say it was a ""sound"" or frequency that drew me outdoors.  I remember knowing I was not supposed to be out of bed let alone outside, but was heavily drawn.  Upon entering the backyard, I was greeted by a Being.  It was slightly taller than me with a long neck, oversized head and large oval shaped eyes, long fingers and toes.  The feet were bear, but honestly do not recall clothing.  The overall color of the skin was grey/green.  When I came upon it, it took my hand and we proceeded across the yard to the back fence.  Once I passed the fence into the woods heading out.. I do not recall a thing.  But what I do remember is a feeling of warmth, friendliness and curiosity on both our parts.  I felt no fear and felt hugely curious.  I remember that my feet felt cool and damp and I remember very clearly the sounds of the night, and the feel of the warm yet slightly cool damp air.  There was very little breeze.  It must have been mid to late summer.  I had not thought of that night until I was around 15 or 16 years old when my mother and I went into a book store and I saw the book Communion for the first time.  I started hyperventilating and feeling dizzy and week in the knees as the memory flooded back.  The major difference in looks is that the ""grey"" on the cover of Communion is a sinister looking being, when my experience was much different.  I petty much put the whole thing out of my head and avoided anything regarding Alien abductions, whether it was books or movies for years.  I now feel so far removed from the experience that I am comfortable relating it.  I don’t know what it means or if anything happened or even if it really happened.  Was it possible it was a dream?  I did once talk to a hypnotist when I was in my early 20’s and described my memory to her.  She was a Stop Smoking therapist and did Abduction Hypnotherapy also.  She indicated that based on her experience, my details were too heavy and too much physical memory for it to be just a dream.  She wanted very much for me to follow up with her, but I never did.  I have done very little research, as I was checking out sites on the web I came across you site and decided to throw the information out there and see what came back.  Perhaps this is the time for me to do further investigation on this and determine if it were real or not.  I see that in 1966 there were a number of sightings in Michigan.  However that was years before my time.  So here is your information.  Do with it what you will.  If it ties into other types of reports, perhaps this will be of benefit.

I have seen many strange things over the years,and I am 51 years old now. this sighting occured when I was 16 years old.I lived in a small house on a side street in Allentown Pa.it was around 10:15 pm,when I went outside to observe the stars.as usual the pleiades were almost directly overhead.the street I lived on ran east/west,so in the spring and summer pleiades seemed to rise at the east end of emmett st. and set at the west end.well this night I had been watching them for about 15 minutes and looking around the sky in the hope of sighting a meteorite or two.when to the west I spotted movement in the sky.it seemed to be very high up. if it was the size of a 747 jet my guess would be that it was flying at 30000 ft.but I didnt know the size of the thing,however what really caught my eye was not size but color and shape.I had seen many planes fly across the night sky but none like this one.boomerang shaped and glowing hot pink like poster paint.it seemed to be directly over emmett st. heading west to east.from my position I watched it approach, pass overhead and then depart.which took all of 5 minutes.it did not seem to be moving very fast.only like any other aircraft I had ever seen go across the night sky.except for that weird shape and color.I dont know if I saw a ufo or some strange military experiment.I like to think that yes,it was a UFO.

I asked my Weapons Systems operator behind me if he happened to notice that and he responded very positively that he did.   It was a clear and beautiful evening with no clouds and a bright moon.  I told my back seater that I would maneuver to try to intercept what ever it was doing that.  It wasn't long before what ever it was was seemed to be playing games with me for it would be here and there and when I would go towards where ever I thought it would be, it would be gone.  We continued this for maybe a few minutes and by this time were somewhere Northwest of Austin and somewhere around 10,000 to 15,000 for our directions and altitudes kept changing due to this light in the sky I was trying to catch up with.   Suddenly in the distance before me the light made a tracking 180 degree turn and was obviously returning directly headon into us.  I made a comment to my back seater ""Damn ""___"" I think we've pissed it off.  I pushed the stick rapidly forward to avoid what I thought surely was going to be a midair collision. The instant I knew we had avoided the collision, I immediately went into afterburning to initiate a high g turn for that really angered me.   It may have just been my imagination, but as whatever it was we had just missed seem to give our aircraft a compression push downward.  That may have been from my own action of abruptly pushing the stick forward and then going into afterburner.   To continue, craning my head back during the high g turn, there is no doubt to me I saw an eerie blue glow quickly fading away from me.  For a brief a moment I thought the thing was gone and my back seater and I began a rather spirited conversation about the preceeding events.  I made calls to other aircraft in flight as well as both control towers in the area, BUT none had seen anything unusual.  Had almost called it a night when we both saw what looked like a firey crash just off of Robert Mueller airport.   I immediately called the control tower, but they said that all was normal and they saw nothing.  We circled just north of the airport for we both confirmed with each other what we had seen.  Suddenly, from off the airport the way it went in, we saw a spectacular show of something shooting into the sky to the north.  I again called the control tower but they saw nothing.   I pushed the throttle forward and flew in the direction of the thing we saw leaving the ground.   Suddenly before us and about over the city of Georgetown, the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life happened.  This thing we were pursuing stopped in mid air and lit up like with flashing lights and what looked like a classically described UFO, Oval in shape with portals and flashing and beaming lights coming from it.   My backseater and I confirmed together all we were seeing.  I told my back seater, as I remember, ""---"" this is too much. We need to bring this thing down -- it is too important to let it escape.  I am going to try to give it a glancing blow and think we will be ok, but be ready to eject if you have to.   I again went into afterburner and aimed for that UFO.  It suddenly went completely dark and the next thing we knew, we watched as it left an almost vertical path upward and we knew at the speed it was going, there was nothing we could do about it.  Within a few seconds it was gone and mixed in with the heavenly stars above.  Our fuel by this time demanded we land.   We did not make a report.  What was there to report that just the 2 of us experiencedd???   YES, we are being monitored and examined by a superior existence somewhere in this Universe.

It then dropped straight down in a blink of an eye. From there it shot back across the sky and stopped directly under where it first stopped. It then shot straight up to complete a perfect rectangle. From that point is shot back out into outer space so fast that you could barely see the light trail from where it left. I would say this object was moving at the speed of light. The human eye could not follow it from point to point. These points were not close; they covered a wide area in the sky. It turned out that my oldest brother and a couple his friends witnessed the same thing from a different part of town. I swear to God there is nothing on earth that can move as fast as this object did. And the fact that it formed a perfect rectangle proves to me we are not alone.

((HOAX???))  Wedding Cake Ship Sound was heard.,Tulsa,OK,1974-06-08T05:00:00,unknown,25 minutes,"Occurred : 6/8/1974 05:00  (Entered as : 06/08/74 05:00) Reported: 9/16/2007 10:15:03 PM 22:15 Posted: 10/8/2007 Location: Tulsa, OK Shape: Unknown Duration:25 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58855.html,"Wedding Cake Ship Sound was heard 51st and Memorial Drive, South West corner behind what would someday be Skaggs/Albertsons but at the time was an open undeveloped field boarding my neighborhood.   It was very early in the morning, approximately 5AM.  I was awakened by a female presence from my bedroom and I had this desire to get my bicycle out of my parents garage and go riding. The sun wouldn't be up for another hour.   It was the summer.  It was in the 70's, within a month or two of the June 8th, 1974 Tornadoes which destroyed Tulsa, Oklahoma, my home town.  I was outside riding my bicycle in my neighborhood, just 300 yards from my house.  The sun was just coming up.  There was this very unusual popcorn shrimp like cloud formations in the sky.   Just thousands of clouds which were white and puffy alto cumulus like clouds which were spaced out widely in the shape of curled up popcorn shrimp.   The local media weather personality on Channel 8, Don Woods, commented on how rare this day was because Tulsa had never had this kind of weather clouds before in it's recorded history.  I am to believe that this incident may have been just before June 8th, before the T.V. stations were knocked down by the tornadoes.  I have searched and searched for the exact name of these clouds and their exact date and history has buried it.  I can't find it.  Anyway, I'm riding my bike on dark streets back and forth, back and forth, until the sun rises for one hour when I see these clouds.   Their startling clouds.  I can barely find information on the June 8th 1974 triple twister storm which almost took my life and my family's life and left us in ruin for the balance of the year of 1974.  It was truly an awful time with not running water, no gas, no electricity, no phone and no T.V.   All we had was KRMG AM radio to inform the community for quite a while.   AM radios and batteries and lots of kerosene burning Coleman products to make light and cook our food.  As I rode my bike, the sun came over the horizon and you could see all these very strange shaped clouds.   And there were no cars running nor jet aircraft landing.  It was as if Tulsa was frozen. No noise outside at all, not even birds.  And I heard this one noise growing and growing as if it was coming from an aircraft or something up in the air and I began to point my eyes to the direction of this very unique, unearthly noise.  I would hear where it was coming from and move my eyes to the noise as it moved through the skies above me yet I saw nothing.  It flew right over me I would guess at the altitude of a landing jet aircraft and proceeded off to the east.   I kept peddling my bike eastward following the sound and looking up and continued to see nothing as the sound faded away.  This whole encounter did not take just 3 minutes, it was like 25 minutes. It moved as slowly as a Goodyear blimp from the sound as the sound moved in the skies as my ears could track that sound yet I saw nothing and it didn't wake anybody up in the neighborhood. When the sound finally disappeared in the east, I was standing on the ground straddling my bike. Not 5 minutes passed and the entire neighborhood woke up and came to life.   People went out to get their paper, started mowing lawns, dogs started barking, tire sounds of cars were heard on Memorial drive, all the noise of life returned as if somebody just threw a switch.  It was really weird as a 13 year old I actually recognized this and knew major things were wrong here.....  And for some reason, I forgot about this sound.  I just shelved it in my mind and never ever thought about it again.  I never spoke with anybody about it.  Never made it a bid deal.   I also had at the time dreams of being a bird and being able to fly in my own back yard.  I used to dream somebody taught me to flap my wings and I would actually fly around up to 1000 feet high.   And this female person would talk to me then and was like my foster mother if you will. I was encouraged to fly and remember topping the chimney on my parents house and actually flying just above the cloud cover of the town and hovering there for hours at night.  It was always at night. It was a female but I never could remember her face.   But she took a liking to me as a child. And then I never heard anything more from her again.   This whole thing probably spanned just 4 months as I remember.   But I shelved the entire thing and never told anybody.  I also remembered looking into the neighborhood houses for open windows of known Rock and Roll stereo freaks who might have a stereo playing but all windows were shut that I could see and besides, the sound was from above me and slightly to the south heading west to east in direction as it moved.  It also wasn't the kind of sound which was played back from a recording with hiss or scratch sounds like a record does, it was the REAL THING SOUND.  It had the decibels of a powerful engine or something like that.   There was no stereo which could make a noise that loud which was obviously far up in the air somewhere up there.  It also gave me the feeling that somebody was looking down on me, the one kid outside with the bicycle chasing this sound and not being able to catch it and I felt this terrible, awful sorrow coming from somewhere as if a family member was either just abandoned or died or perhaps the feeling you get when your best pet dog is killed in a violent way.  A very sorrowful, sad feeling which actually made tears come to my eyes finally as the sound finally went away to the east and was never heard from again.  I had the feeling that I was just abandoned like a mom would say goodbye to here child for the last time never to see him ever again.   There was a sense of concern and fear and I remembered now, at the time I was led to believe I was going to have a very hard and challenging life.  I was 13 years of age at this time.  Lost in space had been on T.V. and the sound of that spaceship in that T.V. series was Erie but not similar to this sound.   This sound was not man made it was real.  And so I grew up, and time just buried all of this.  I never heard this sound again and forgot about all this until recently.  I'm 46 years old now.  I'm driving across country and the AM radio is on.   Coast to Coast AM is playing and George Noory.  He's interviewing Michael Horn.   Michael Horn is supposed to be the U.S. press representative of Billy Meier from Switzerland.  And I listened to this interview they did and somewhere in the middle of it they played the wedding cake ship sound.  I said to myself as soon as 10 seconds of this sound was played that I've heard this before somewhere??? And I began to ask myself which T.V. show or Movie did I hear this sound on before so I could know where these guy's ripped this sound off from.  I eventually went to the website and downloaded this sound and played it a few times and it all started coming back to me.  I was asking same question back in 1974.  I remembered that morning.  I remembered the weird bicycle ride I took that summer morning.  Asking the question is this sound was coming from a neighbors house, what T.V. show or movie  did they get it from.  Yet I knew it wasn't coming from a neighbors house or some passing car's 8 track.   This is 1974 you see, not even the cassette tape was popular then.  Microwave ovens and cable T.V. were years off.  Color T.V. was just getting popular.  FM stereo existed but not widely used in cars yet.  Cars still typically had noisy AM radio with 8 track players bolted on.    We didn't even have synthesizers in that era to manufacture a noise like this.  But I heard this damn noise.  I felt those feelings.  I had those dreams in my sleep of flying with my other mom.  I felt some love from this person.  And I have some post comments to make to this female person, whoever it was. After having done some years research on Billy Meier and the Pleiadians and finding out that these people frequent all of our media and are somewhat experts on Human current events. If what I have read and felt are indeed true, then I'm dealing with an emotional being who's not learned to separate herself from her science projects....    And I'm sorry you never had a child. And while it's sad that you people actually read the contact reports from this very website, maybe you'll read this one and remember what you did back in 74.  I know it was you and I shake my head and ask the question if you leave that much concern in a 13 year old childs mind how are your possibly going to help mankind?  It was the certain knowledge and admission that this sound was the Wedding Cake Ship. That the Wedding Cake ship was commissioned at around this time.  And I'm left with the question, why Tulsa, Oklahoma?  Was it the knowledge we were about to be greased by a large group of Tornadoes?   Was there something special about me? All I'm personally left with is she decided to adopt me as her son for a few months and perhaps study me, I guess...  I dunno....  But I did hear that Wedding Cake ship sound on that popcorn shrimp cloud day which we have never had again, ever.... ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

They were afraid to drive the rest of the way home alone, so I followed them in my car. When we reached their home and looked to the east, we saw three objects hovering above a field behind our grandmother's home.  They were in a triangle formation, with two on top and one on the bottom. We sat on my cousin's porch and watched them for a few hours. During that time, every so often they would swap positions, reversing the triangle. They had mainly white lights, but those changed periodically to orange.  When I left, one of them broke away and stayed parallel to my car the entire length of the road (about a mile). I turned right, and it did the same. It remained beside me, just above the trees, until I met a car a half a mile later. Then it did a 180-degree turn and followed that car.

What could have been the most remarkable encounter of the first kind, was over and done without even a single photo.  The heavily used camera was out of film.

I was staying at my aunt and uncle’s home for a few months.  I don’t remember the exact address, but know it was near West Point Academy. One night I went to see a movie with a friend.  The night was very clear, but extremely cold.  On our way back to the house (between 11:30-2:00 AM) we noticed a star-like round shaped object in the sky with a long red glow under.  We thought it was a star because the thing was not moving and was far away. After a few minutes, we realized that we were approaching the object, and that it was actually in our atmosphere, stationed in mid air.  The closer we were getting to the area, the less we could see the red glow, but the object remained lit (white light), and in the same place throughout the entire time. My friend became very agitated and began to drive very fast as we got closer.  I don’t know how big this thing was, or how many feet high it was from the ground, but I do recall that the size was as big as a quarter (coin) from where we were.  It was a disk-shaped craft, but not flat. The top was round and all the bright white light was coming from there.  I rolled down the window and exposed my head out of the window to look up. The only sound we heard came from my friend’s car engine, and not from the craft. I saw the round shape of the machine, and inside the circle it had a frame-like in the shape of an octagon.  I don’t remember if the octagon was protruded, but do remember very well that inside the octagon were several tiny lights (yellow and some red) blinking very slowly.  I remember shouting at my friend to stop the car, and to please look at the craft, but he began to yell at me to get back in the car. He was driving very fast, and I pulled myself back inside the car only because my face was hurting from the cold air.  I was screaming from excitement and nerves, and could not believe that we saw the most incredible flying machine.  It was right up there, stationed in mid air, and we were so lucky to have had the opportunity to see something like that.  I remember being so mad at Michael for rushing away, but after few years realized that even though he was thirty years old at the time, he was dead scared and wanted to get away as fast as he could. I don’t know if that UFO was man-made or extraterrestrial, but I have never seen anything like it in my whole life.  The duration of the entire sighting was about ten minutes, and the only reason why we lost sight of the craft was because we drove away.  The UFO never moved.  I must say that aside from seeing the craft, we didn’t experience any other anomalies such as: electronic problems with the car; lost of time, etc…  The next day I told my family what happened the night before, but my friend refused to talk about the subject.  I wanted to tell everyone about my experience, but decided not to do it since my family discouraged me from saying anything; stating that since I was nineteen years old I would probably be treated like a crazy person, or a charlatan trying to get attention.  I limited myself to discuss the subject only with my family and two other closed friends.  I have never again seen another UFO, and to tell you the truth I don’t need to because what I saw was as real as the computer I have in front of me right now. Besides the fact that I am older and more comfortable talking about UFOs, the reason why I am reporting this sighting for the first time in twenty-seven years is that I really would like to find out if other people in Upstate NY, or any other place, have reported stationary UFO sightings with similar descriptions of the craft.  I have visited several websites on the subject, but haven’t contacted anyone until now.   Another reason I have to share my experience with you is that I am overwhelmed by the amount of information disclosed from many reputable and honest people throughout the years.  It is definitely a fact that the media has been used, by those in power, as a tool for social control. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

PD)) ((2012 ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) Correction on wrong date of sighting Hello: I would like to make a correction regarding a UFO report I made approx 2 yrs ago. The information on the original report is correct except the year.  I reported that the UFO sighting occurred in 1975, but it was in 1977.  I just came across an article about Freddie Prince (Sr.), who died in 1977, and remembered watching the news with my aunt and uncle in Newburgh.   So, the year I was living in Newburgh was 1977 and not 1975.  I apologize for the inconvenience, and would greatly appreciate if someone could make the correction. I will never forget this great experience, and continue searching for people who may have seen the same machine we saw stationed in mid air with an octagonal thick frame in the bottom. Thank you.

Our family has been coming to Trout Lake since the family settled there in the many years ago. We always camp in my uncles back yard during the Trout Lake Fair and on Friday/Saturday nights we play guitar, sing, and stargaze. Often we are up until 2:00 or later watching for shooting stars and we did so again this weekend.  Sunday morning 8/6/2006 at 2:30 am my wife and I were in uncle's yard looking up at the Milky Way and facing east. The weather conditions were perfectly clear and great for watching shooting stars. Out of the South appeared a triangle pattern of stars from behind the trees at the edge of the yard. This formation about was about eighty degrees up from the horizon and slowly began to cross our wide open view of the sky from South to North in the direction of Mount Adams.  We first thought this was our eyes playing tricks on us because the lights were the same intensity as most of the stars except they were all three moving North in a formation that moved without deviation of speed or shape. This was not a solid object but rather three points of light as we could see the other stars in the middle of the triangle as it moved.  This was a large Triangle, lead across the sky by two stars and the third one following at spacing slightly larger than the other two, but exactly equally spaced in relationship to the first points of light, then forming a triangle.  Since there were several friend and family all camping in my uncles yard I began yelling for a friend Buddy to get up, knowing he had just went to sleep in the back of his pickup truck next to us. He got up and came to where we were standing and we asked him what is that? Do you see what we see? He said yes, those three stars are moving!  At this point the formation was crossing the Milky Way but still bright enough to watch them. Buddy watched them with us until they were blocked from our view by trees to the North. The entire time it took the three points of light to cross the sky took about two minutes. I have looked at the night sky for years and I have never seen anything like it. It left my wife and me with an uneasy feeling about how weird it was, and then we went to bed",2006-10-30T00:00:00,45.9798,-121.5312

The next was harder to see, as it was further away, but it appeared to be the same as the first one, only slightly shimmering (possibly due to vantage point and shimmering city lights?).

At the top of a gentle hill I looked straight down the road running through the condo complex to the Pacific Ocean.  At the foot of the hill there are tall Norfolk pine trees on both sides framing the Pacific Ocean beyond.  Between these trees, over the ocean (cannot judge how far out) in the dark starless sky I saw a gigantic bright emerald green object that looked like a beach ball crushed from top and bottom into a shape like an oval with very narrow sides.  It was deeper green around the edges of the object.  It seemed to be floating over the ocean but I could see no reflection on the water.  I was quite fascinated by the vibrancy of the green color one the outer edges of the object.  I stood there watching it possibly two and a half to three minutes and then it shot off straight out to sea, not up, as best I could tell and disappeared immediately.  No afterglow as it disappeared.  It was just gone!  I rushed inside and called the Santa Barbara Sheriff's office and asked if they had any reports on green foreign objects in the sky.  Non emergency calls were being picked up in the Santa Maria Sheriff's department for some reason and I was told I could not get a contact for a non-emergency here in Santa Barbara.  The woman who answered informed me, ""Whatever you think you saw it's three days before Fourth of July.  If you really did see something it was early fireworks.""  I am 79 years old and I've seen fireworks all my life from Los Angeles to Washington DC to France to China.  I know fireworks when I see them.  This had nothing to do with fireworks!

It was then that we were able to detect a huge bell shaped object with one light in the top of the tallest area. The bottom of the had a light at each corner.

It was black on dark you could see the shape but see no detail, as we made the trip this thing paced our speed and direction from 50 mph to 75 and once we stopped to see what it would do... it stopped we shut the car off and watched for a moment, it just remained there waiting, well we had to pick up a car and there really was nothing we could do about""it"" so on we went, as we pulled into the repair shops lot the craft when overhead and headed in the direction of Scott AFB.The craft was large maybe 200' on all sides, it's flight was around 500'up and it did not make a sound.

I really should have reported it - but in 1976 in London if I mentioned it peoples assumed I was mad.  There were about 12 of us - I can't remember - squatting in St Johns school (disussed), Richmond London, England, in the heatwave of 1976 London. These people had been telling me they had been seeing UFOs in the sky, and I did not believe them - I thought they were seeing shooting stars, satellites, aircraft etc. So I agreed to sit up with them and watch..  At the time I was computer science student at Kingston Polytechnic.  We dragged chaisse-longes / sofas into middle of what once was playground. The site meant that the incident lightiung/light pollution was unusually reduced for London area. Also in this heatwave the visibility was exceptional - I could see whole of milky-way clearly.  For a couple of hours nothing much happened. We saw a few shooting stars and also some satellites which I think I identified correctlly. ACtually we saw a lot of satellites - the conditions were that good.  At this stage I was convinced I could explain everything and they were mistaken. Them suddenly something looking like a dull orange ice hockey puck slid over from one horizon to the opposite. I thought that a bit odd but wasn't freeked. A bit later there was another similar in different trajectory. Someone claimed it was a pidgeon. I didn't think so but wasn't too impressed.  Shortly after that the main event happened.  We could see the consellation very cleary. It seemed an extra constellation appeared - accompanied by vague red steaks in sky according to some. The new constellation was mostly symetrical but not quite.  It suddenly moved off - in formation and pointing ""forward"" (it was basically diamond-shaped but I would need to draw diagram). There was no accelleration I could see - it went from 0 to something serious instantaeneously as far as I could see.  This formation then went clean through an angle - I'd guess about 45% or so Im not sure - with one of the ""stars"" taking over as leader in the change. At no time did this formation slow down during this impossible manouver.  Then the entire formation just stopped dead instantly.  Then the ""wing"" stars of the formation just took off in curved tradjectory leaving red streakes to my eyes, being replaced simultaeneously by similar incoming to make new though similar formation.  They held that for 1 or 2 secs - then the whole lot just took off leaving red streaks to my eyes.  I had about 10 friends with me witnessed this. I got them to write all details down. Unfortunately this has all been lost now. I quickly found if I mentioned it people thought I was mad. Some of my freinds -in fact most - saw slightly different stuff from me. I was watching one particular part of the sky. If I assume my friends were not crazy, then there was stuff going on all over the sky and I only saw one part of it. The reason I think so was that their reports just differed enough - like when we see real events.  After this event I tried to rationalise it. The best I could come up with was lasers or car headlights shining through a temperature inversion.  But the truth is it gave us all the serious impression of the cosmic ""red arrows"" - had intelligence written all over it.  I realise I could be wrong - but I do sympathise with people who have seen stuff because I am one.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

I was a native of Tulare county and my friend is a former British citizen , living in Tulare county .  We were experienced backpackers and were camping and fishing at Eagle Lake above Mineral King Valley . From morning until that evening we could hear an electric pulsating noise coming from a gorge on the south side of Eagle Mountain.  We could tell that  the sound was moving through the area , but we could not see anything .   At 5:30pm that evening , as we were cooking dinner, we heard a much louder pulsating noise coming from Eagle Pass.  We both looked at the Eagle Pass and to our amasement saw a saucer shaped craft with a diameter the size of the opening of the pass,  probably 75-100 ft.  It was the color and skin texture of a grey whale and had 6 - 30"" or larger diameter differing colored lights, all spaced evenly across the side of the craft.  The circular, flush mounted lights were all flashing sequencially with all of the color specrtum . We aimed our Magnalite torch and flashed the light on and off with the craft flashing it's colored lights . We were both frozen with fear that this did not look or behave like anything that we have ever seen . The craft hovered for what seemed like 7 seconds and then reversed it's travel and disapeared behind the Eagle Pass , eminating it's pulsating sound for about 45 more minutes . We did not hear or see it again during our duration of our backpacking trip . I have been on this 8,000ft.+ elevation pass many times and it is very dangerous for any flying craft to move across .  I had a friend at that time who was a senior air traffic controller at Lemoore Naval Air Base . I told him about the sighting event and gave him a map of Eagle Pass with date and time . He was able to access not only the Lemoore Air Base computer , but also Edwards Air Base computer as well , which is on the east side of Mineral King Nation! al Park He said that there was no activity involving civilian , military or experimental aircraft in that area at that time or for that matter that week . He added that the area is off limits for military aircraft becuase of numerous wrecks at that same location . There are too many strong downdrafts with San Joaquin Valley air moving to the east , over Owens Valley . He said that if a military pilot was known to fly there , he would be  suspended from flying . He also said that there is no known earthly aircraft with 36"" diameter flashing colored lights and that the craft was not of this world .  He also added that he has alerted the air force numerous times after seeing on radar large ufo crafts . He mentioned that after seeing f-18 air squadrans chase the large craft on the radar at full speed without catching up and then the craft disappears off the radar screen . He is a believer in ufos now . He said that he would speak to the pilots afterwards about the chase and would hear that the ufo was sighted in front of the chase , but they could not keep up , at that rate of speed , and it would finally disappear in front of their eyes .

As we were heading back to the boat dock there was a light streaked from the horizon toward us as were traveling westward in the boat.  I am not suggesting it was in our atmosphere, it was more like the satellites that we see on clear nights but with exceptional speed.   I drive about an hour each way to work daily and always see commercial jetliners in the sky and if they are traveling at 500 or so miles per hour these objects were traveling at 10,000 miles per hour.

It was flying in front of me; I estimate its elevation was around 1-2000 feet above where I was standing, moving across the sky, from my left to right, towards Dillon Damn. it was around 2000 feet in front of me. The mountains where in the background and it was definatlely flying in the valley. It was traveling fast, but not to fast for me to observe the little portals. The object was very bright. I followed it for probably 8 seconds and it just disappeared right in front of my eyes.  The friend I was with only saw the light of the object, as he was busy with his equipment and just looked up as it disappeared. He did see the outline and the light of the object, but for only a second, and was not able to describe it, only that it did appear.

My husband, who was an IFR pilot, and myself owned our own airplane; at this particular time it was a Cessena 175.  We had spent many hours in our planes and on this particular occasion we were getting ready to go to Colorado; my husband wanted to see if we would need oxygen at (not certain of the exact altitude) 12-13 thousand feet.  (I have his log book at our home in Indiana and I'm at our home in Florida as I write this; this will give the exact date and possibly the altitude)   We drove our ElCamino from South Bend to Plymouth, where our plane was hangered, about 2:00 am, did our pre-flight noticing nothing out of the ordinary.  He needed night flying and also time ""under the hood"" for his IFR rating; so he decided to kill a few birds at one time.  (It's been so long since this happened and my husband would not allow me to talk about it while he was alive; but I'll try to get as close to what the distances are as I can remember)   He was going to do a 5 or 10 mile precision turn up to the 12 or 13 thousand mark and I was his ""spotter"".  The 5 or 10 mile precision turn means that you keep making circles around a central point and climb so many feet per minute.  My job was to keep quiet and watch for any traffic.  The night was clear as a bell and there was no traffic at SBN who we had filed our flight plan with.  We started our climb and the sky was empty; no traffic any direction.  About 20 minutes into the climb I noticed traffic at 1:00 o'clock.  I looked up again and the same traffic was at 1:00o'clock.  This happened the third time and I said to myself (because he had told me to keep completely quiet so he could concentrate); this cannot be happening because we are making a CIRCLE and the traffic is in EXACTLY the same spot.  It came a little closer from the first time I noticed it till the exercise was finished; but not much.  It only appeared as a light coming straight towards the plane.  It seemed too far away the whole time that I never feared of it hitting us.  I felt like they or someone knew exactly what I was thinking.  I felt that it was magnetically ""glued"" to the plane because it NEVER moved an inch.  I kept scooting around to make double certain that it wasn't a reflection of light from any place in the plane; it was not a reflection.  I even put both hands up to the glass and looked at it like that.  When we finally were within 1000 feet of out goal my husband asked me to light a cigarette for him; at that time I finally said, ""We have something at one o'clock"". He said, ""Congratulations, it has been there since 3 thousand feet"".   My husband had gotten the Bronze Star in WW2 and was never one who would become excitable; this is an important aspect in this event.  I asked him to call SBN to see if we had traffic and he wouldn't do it; finally I coaxed him into it and they replied to us that not only did we not have traffic that he hadn't seen any in our area all night.  We broke formation and headed for the airport and it came with us for two or three minutes and when we signaled for the lights to come on in the airport it changed position to dropping behind us; it had followed us down as we lost altitude.  As we were landing it kept getting closer and closer to us; as we touched down it kept very still about 300 feet from us.  We pulled up to the hanger door; jumped out, even left the charts in the plane, quickly put the plane in, we did it so fast we broke the taillight from the top of the tail.  There was absolutely no noise coming from the bright light and we were close enough to have heard any noise from it.   Jumped in the El Camino and drove as fast as we could to the highway; he started to turn north towards home and I screamed ""No don't go that way it's deserted; go toward town"".  He turned south and by the time we came into downtown Plymouth we were going almost 100 mph.  He said ""Where ((three words deleted)) are the police when you need them?""   Trees had kept us from being able to see the ""light"" because they are all along on both sides of the street.  I was able to see that it was following us until we went under the trees.  I couldn't get him to go inside the police station and he wouldn't let me go in.  He refused to report it to the FAA and made me promise not to talk about it.  He said he didn't want anyone thinking he was nuts.  He died Jan of 05.  To this day I have a spooky feeling if I go near there; and will not go at night.

I was driving out to Dennisport to visit my cousin as my uncle rented a house for a weeks vacation. I was about a half hour away from my destination,and had taken the scenic route by mistake, I had not seen another car for a least a half hour before the incedent. It was just getting dark, and I noticed a bright light coming from the East almost in line with the utility poles on my left. The light seemed to be approaching at a steep angle downward and I slowed down thinking it may be a private plane in trouble! All I still saw was just a bright light but as I got closer it was getting lower I slowed down more thinking this (plane) was going to crash! right in front of me!! Then I saw it! it wasn't a private plane at all! and was now turning above me no more than (20 to 30 feet) above me! heading South moving very slowly 5mph at most,no sound noticed at all, it was a dull grey (sandblasted aluminum color object (reminded me of the melinium falcon in starwars movie)(sort of) (as I only saw the side view),alot of probes or antenna like structures sticking out of the sides and bottom! alot of  angles like different size boxes all stuck together in random fashion was what the craft looked like close up.The final and in a amazing and scary way was there was a face looking out the window at me! and it looked more scared than me!! the best discription is of the painting reffered to as (the scream)! As every time I see it I am reminded of that event! I is wierd but I do not recall watching it as it headed away from me, and at first somthing inside me said no way that just happened! When I eventually saw my cousin he said  ""what took you so long to get here"",I said I took a wrong turn off the Highway and must have taken the scenic route,but I realized after is was alot longer than it should have taken. We went to the beach that night,I never mentioned it to anyone until years later, but I know what I saw, and feel privliged to have a close encounter of the (third kind) for the last 10 years I have ! been rea ding about all the information I can get my hands on, and of course the internet is one of the best tools to use.

I was lying in bed looking out the window just trying to get to sleep when I spotted a cigar shaped object with lights hovering maybe 1/2 mile away (Southeast Lawrenceburg, TN).   I watched the object for about 5 seconds before it registered what I may be looking at.  I woke my friend yelling, ""get up if you want to see a ufo"".   He got up, came to the window, and we watched for another few seconds before running out of the room and yelling for his sister to wake up and come outside.   When the three of us got outside, the object was still hovering, motionless, in the distance.  It was close enough that all the lights were clearly visible and a metallic shine came from the surface of the craft.  We watched as it sat perfectly still for another 20-30 seconds.   Suddenly, the craft took off, flew over our heads and toward the opposite horizon.  About halfway before getting to the other horizon, it immediately took a sharp 90 degree turn right, flew about a mile, and took another 90 degree turn left.  It then flew at an amazing speed before disappearing over the horizon.   From the time that it took off until it was completely gone from sight over the opposite horizon was only about 6-8 seconds.  Although at one point it was directly above us and no more than 300 yards away, we never heard a sound. I am a 45 year old mechanical engineer.  With years of study in physics, engineering, and study of the most up-to-date technology, I have never encountered anything that would explain the capabilities that this craft had.

We went down to the lake and saw a pyramid of laser like lights emanating from a vertex 500 to 1000 feet above the lake.  There were six or eight beams of light that had no deflections in them like a flashlight beam has. These were like lasers shining into the water so that the base of the pyramid had to be at least 200 yards across. Each beam was probably 12 to 18 inches in diameter. We returned to the cabin to finish our pinochle game and no one ever mentioned it again.  Occasionally I think of the event and wonder what it could have been.

That would place it in the summer of  1967. My siblings and I often slept outside on an elevated deck in our backyard when the weather was warm. On one such night I was out there with one of my sisters who was already asleep. I was lying in my sleeping bag looking up at the sky. I noticed some lights low on the horizon over Puget Sound. They looked pretty much like the kind of lights you would expect to see on an airplane. I think they were white, green and red. They caught my attention because they were so low and they just sat there motionless. At first I thought they must be helicopters but there was no sound. I estimate they were one and a half or two miles away. It was a calm night and it seemed I should have been able to hear their engines easily. I watched them for a minute or two, trying to figure out what they were. Suddenly one of the light groups shot almost straight up into the sky at an incredible speed. It moved so fast my eyes could barely follow it. In less than two seconds it simply vanished in the distance overhead. It seemed to move in a jerky, stuttering manner, starting and stopping very rapidly. My jaw just dropped.  At that moment I almost pissed in my pants, as children that age are prone to do when frightened. My next instinct was to jump out of my sleeping bag and run inside the house but I knew the door was locked. There were still two of these ""things"" in the sky. Using the logic of a seven year old I decided to hide my head inside the sleeping bag and stay very still, hoping they wouldn't see me. I never saw what happened to the other two objects. I was one scared kid. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,,

(I'm not sure if I remember he noticed lights or not). I laughed and said I would check it out and they pleaded with me not to, but I told them mom and dad wouldn't believe us unless I saw it, too.   I looked outside and up and it was exactly as he said.  A big black triangular void with no noise and no movement and no emissions, yet stars all around it.  I also noticed a complete absence of bugs, birds or pets making any noise and that's when I really creeped out and fear overcame my curiosity and I backed into the house slowly, keeping my eye on the unknown object.  It seemed like it was no more than a couple of hundred feet up which would mean I should be able to hear something!   My parents thought we made it all up of course and suggested it might be a weather balloon or experimental aircraft from Bush Field Airport or Fort Gordon Military Base.  I never believed that.   When I saw the stealth bomber years later it reminded me of it, although this had what appeared to be equal angles (equilateral) but again, there was no noise, no movement, and no emissions.

In August 1968 while working at Boy Scout Camp Benjamin Hawkins, Byron, GA, two fellow scouts and I spotted a craft in the night sky.  The craft produced a sound much like a very high-speed electrical motor, shrill and almost inaudible.  Its shape was that of two bright silver/white saucers placed face to face with a row of clear lights around the center much akin to windows in a commercial jet.  The lights seemed to revolve very rapidly like a gyroscope.  The craft hovered approximately 300’ directly above our heads and seemed to place us in an electrical field, because for a brief time we could not move our bodies.  After a few minutes the craft began to move very slowly to the southwest toward a Niaki Missile base which bordered the camp property.  Just as it reached the tree line it banked slightly and disappeared in a split second, never to be seen again.  The Niaki Missile base located in Byron, GA is just a short distance from Robins Air Force Base, Warner Robins, Georgia.

It was the summer of 1971 and I was spending vacation with my cousin on their beautiful farm in southwest Missouri. I was twelve and he was thirteen. That morning everyone went shopping except us two boys, and am I glad, for I witness something that clear sunny day that I will never forget. As we played football in the front yard, around 11am a mid-sized metallic saucer with a round disc on top silently floated over top of us at about a 70 degree angle and within 300 to 500 feet in altitude. It was large enough to see clearly but looking straight up at it I didn’t see much except some round opaque portal like windows that you would see in the older type sci-fi renderings of UFO’s. After a moment of amazement, I asked cousin if he would get a camera, so he hesitantly ran after one. The vessel continued to float silently above me at nearly 90 degrees for maybe a minute or so and seemed to be interested (?). I climbed upon a stump thinking to get a better look at it as I was in a state of astonishment and curiosity. Cousin came running out of the house with some cheesy little camera that wouldn’t work but by that time it was all over with anyway. Two Air Force jets came blasting over the horizon straight for us and the UFO. The UFO displayed an amazing ability to accelerate!  Judging by the speed of the jets (I have seen them break the speed of sound and our windows in the 1960’s) I would guestimate that this vessel would have reached a speed of over 1500 miles per hour within a 2 or 3 second burst (more like a highly controlled fling with a bit of a slow start). It looked to me like the jets were at about 600 miles per hour (pretty fast being that low). The UFO emitted a turbine like sound as it accelerated, but not loud or harsh and as the jets roared past (they were higher and a further away, maybe half a mile) they drowned out any other noise we might have heard. One jet turned around while the other continued the chase which was clear to see that it was a joke. The UFO disappeared into the blue with the jet dogging behind him. No sooner had the one jet turned around back over the horizon than two more jets screamed over in full sprint the same direction the first jet and the UFO had gone. A total of four jets had pathetically pursued this un-worldly craft. All I can say is our military hardware looked primitive and cumbersome compared to the ability of the UFO. And just that quick it was all over. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

I made an attempt to identify where the light was coming from, but after a quick observation, I decided I really didn’t care because I was anxious to get to my family.  I turned right onto the dirt road, which happened to be where all the cars were pulled over viewing the light.  I proceeded down the road and I noticed within moments that the light was above me.  I looked up through my windshield and this object was following me and was just above the tall pines.  I began driving very fast and it kept pace with my ’69 Camaro. I finally made it to the construction site and pulled into the driveway with object stopping at the entrance.  I quickly left my car and ran into the house. There were about 11others there; being Friday all the contractors were still hanging around, especially since they were all cousins and uncles.   I told everyone with much excitement they needed to see what followed me home!  My dad looked out the window and immediately shouted, “Stay in the house.”  We all stood still and watched as the object floated towards us and then lift up just as it reached the house, at which time my dad shouted, ""“Get out of the house.""   All eleven of us ran out the door at almost the same instant. It was a saucer shaped object, silver with red and blue glowing lights that seem to illuminate from the portals on the top.  It was approximately 50’ to 60’ in diameter.  The exterior had a smooth finish; there were no signs of any joints in the metal, just a few indentions where maybe a door and the lights were.   It was hovering about 20’ above us and bouncing from where our cars were parked to the house.  At one time we were all afraid that it would land on top of the house, it came so close, but it would go up again and bounce over to the fields.  We all watched this object quietly and no one moved.  For an instance I wandered who was watching whom.  The object no longer was showing the bright light that it had when it first began to follow me.  At one time I thought of going to my car and getting my camera, but I did not want miss anything.  It wasn’t long after this thought that the object began to travel farther in the field away from us.  It began to go up higher, still not making a sound, and in a blink of an eye it traveled so fast that in just a second it was a tiny silver dot in the sky. 	We all remained silent for a few moments; still in disbelief of what we had experience.

I remember on night coming home from the store.  It was a full moon that night. Sitting in the car with a friend, listening to his new stereo.  I was enjoying the evening and the light of the full moon, and the shadows it left. Then, as I was looking around I noticed the shadows, were gone yet in the short distance there was still light, and shadows. It was a clear night before and I had seen no clouds, so as I went to look up in the night sky, to see if there was a cloud, covering my moon. I was stunned, shocked, in full AW, could not believe what I was seeing.  Above my home was this round object above our house, at a Maple trees height. We, lived in an old school house, (chiminey was 7ft. tall)  and with the trees right there it was kinda easy to judge height. There was absolutly no sound coming from it.  I got out of the car, and went up to the house and opened the door, and hollared at my mom to come here, she didn't come said she was busy.  As, I stood there holding the, door I again hollared at my mom to come here.  She told me again she was busy.  Thats when I hollared again, mom get your damn ass out here, you have to see this, my dad was mad in the background.  She, came and was she pissed, As, I pointed up, I apologized to her.  we both stood there looking, shaking, nervous , excited and all.  In disbeleif. As, we stood there watching, we seen lights come on, they were around the outside rim, of th craft.  Still, no sound.  Then, it moved away very slowly, and still no noise.  It headed into the field to the west. And, just that fast it was gone, in a flash. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

Often we'd see objects on our radar and on a few occasions NORAD would scramble on them. (That's another topic).   The incident that I'm reporting occurred after the end of my shift. Three of us were hanging around in the parking lot talking.  One controller made a comment that Venus was bright that night.   We then started visibly scanning the sky.  We noticed a brighter light to the North of the ARTCC building and wondered if the other light in the sky was indeed  Venus, then what could that be. (The back door of the center faces east and leads to the back parking lot). The object was standing still and was just visible above the far tree line. Someone made a comment that it was probably a street light.   An airliner became visible climbing out of IAH but farther North of the light we were looking at.  The light then dimmed.  As the plane got farther away on its climb out, the light came back to the full density as we had seen before.  That got our attention.  We were wondering out loud what it could be.   At that moment,  the object moved from our left to our right at an extremely fast speed and stopped immediatley. almost a blur.  As fast as you can turn your head from 10 oclock to 2 oclock was the speed it seemed to move. (if east was 12 on the clock, then the object moved from 10 to 2).  We could not judge how far away from us it was.   The object then just stood still for a minute or two.  Very bright red, blue and green lights starting flashing around the object.  A thin laser like beam of light, approximatley 6 to 12 inches in diameter, lit up part of the parking lot and starting scanning the parking lot.   All three of us ducked behind a car without saying a word.  The beam shut off and the flashing lights stopped.  The   white light on the object then came back on and the object began moving very slowly back to our ten oclock position and stopped at the exact location it was when we first noticied it.  We didn't say a word for about a minute.   When it sunk in what we had just seen, all three of us jumped in our cars and left for home.   The next day, we considered reporting this to a national hotline number in Washington D.C., that the FAA had provided us to report strange occurences that we observe on our radar screens (UFO's)  but no one ever  did for fear of losing our airman's certificate.

My family was watching t.v when the t.v started static and picture problems. The lights started blinking from dim to bright.My dogs were whining and scratching the back door wildly.Keep in mind my German sheperd had been qaurentine twice for biting people riding or walking ddown the alley.As well as a mean standard poodle. I went to let them in the house and when I opened the door they ran me over peeing and pooping as they crossed over me.The noise was very hi-pitched.I was 13 yrs old.My first reaction was to run where they did under my bed. I went as far as the bed room and ran back to lookfor my mom and brother. The front door was opened and I went to the porch and our neighbors and my mom and brother were all looking in the sky. I looked up and saw a huge disk shape houvering above the neighbor hood. It was so huge it could have destroyed at least two blocks if it landed. Now it gets even stranger.It is dark outside the sky is just a shade of dk blue but not quite black. The ship is almost the same color or a shade just lighter from the color of the sky. I'm histerical and run in the room where my dogs are. I grab the phone to call police,my dad anyone because I'm scared but remember I have to go getmy mom and little brother. The sound of the ship is head jolting. I ran to get my mom and brother in the house but they just stair in the sky. I grab my neighbor hand and tell her to run. But could'nt budge her. I ran back to the porch behind the bushes surrounding the porch and look up in ahh. I notice that it is round in shape like a washer that goes on a screw then criss-crossing are bars that connect to the center of the disk which is like a black smoke-glass sphere. It didn't have windows and I would have to guess maybe that the center was like a smoke glass marble and they were watching us. Anyway, the outer part begin to have lights red,green,yellow,blue four in a row from my angle i could see blinking at the front side and back of the ship. They blinked in a harmony like way. Then as it went higher u in the sky it's shape seemed to change and the criss-cross bars went in and the disk was smaaler in size and it went up and shot ahead in the sky so fast it was gone. I ran out into the yard where everyone seem to be calm and alert. I was screaming did you see it lets call someone. And mom said calm down it's time for bed. Pat the neighbor was telling every one good night. I was alarmed that everyone was so calm and non-shalaunt about the situation.The next day my mom the neighbors all of them said they didn't remember seeing anything last night. But they couldn't explain why my legs were all scratched up from the dogs running me over in the kitchen and the back door being almost scratched in too from the dogs. I've told this story to every one I know and they just look at me like I crazy. And as god is my witness, I've been when three of them and together they witnessed again another ufo sighting. Do they keep an eye on you once you spot one of them. I've never seen a allien, but I  have seen at least three other ships since I have seen that one at 13. One had three lights and was triangle shape, one just a blue sphere never loosing altitude and traveled in a perfectly straight direction. and yet another like jacks shaped. You know the jacks and ball little girls played as a child. With light on all five ends. They were at close distances and was also a bit over whelming even as I am now a adult. I had the same fear rush threw me as I did as the 13 year old girl who seen the mother of all ships. Nothing has ever come close to the sighting I seen at the house in Dallas,Tx. Whats even stranger is..... Since 1998 I have had a series of dreams.That seem to be messages from alliens. They were very clear and in color that was so bright. Over a two year period I had five that were so real. I have to question if they are related. One thing I am clear on is this.

This time I was out of the Army and living with my former girlfriend H. L. in an apartment.   One night, she came running back inside the apartment screaming.  I asked her what was wrong.  She said that a UFO was hovering 200 feet above her head.  I didn’t see anything.  I noticed she was hysterically crying.   I drove her to the Sacramento Sheriff’s Department and they had her use their phone to call an 800 number to call Dr. Allen Hynek of the Chicago, Illinois Bureau of UFO Investigations.  Dr. Hynek sent us some forms to fill out, so she could describe what she saw.  Dr. Hynek later called me and asked what I was doing.  I told him I was watching ""Dick Van Dyke’s The Comic"" on TV.  He asked what happened when Helen was screaming outside, I said the TV went on the blink, it displayed static and I was trying to fix the TV, when I heard her screaming.  He told me that when UFOs hover nearby, that they cause disturbances on car engines, TVs and radios.  This was a normal occurrence.  Later I learned that 2 other people in Sacramento saw the same UFO in two different locations and it was reported in the Sacramento Bee. From 1979 to 1986 I was back in the U.S. Army.  This time I joined Military Intelligence and I was stationed at PIC-K (Photo Interpretation Center, Korea).  This time my code name was ""Hollywood or Joe Hollywood,""  I wore a black suit now and I was clean-cut.  I kept the sunglasses though.    My job as a 97 Bravo (Intelligence Analyst) was to work with Image Interpreters in identifying targets in North Korea and Red China, such as T-72 tanks, etc.  I would create what is called a ""sitmap"" pinpointing targets discovered by Image Interpreters, that studied reconnaissance aerial photographs.  I would categorize certain photos.  We would go on what is called a ‘hot run’ from Seoul, Korea, (Yongsan Barracks) to Osan Air Force Base.  The vehicle would display a placard that indicated that the vehicle could not be stopped for any reason.  There was a combination lock on the trunk of the vehicle and a combination lock in the suitcase inside the trunk,  the driver and myself would have ½ of the combination to open the trunk and the suitcase.  We would place the hotrolls (film) into the suitcase and head back to Seoul.   During my time as an Intelligence Analyst I categorized 6 photos taken by reconnaissance satellites of what appeared to be UFOs.  The UFOs moved on their own accord, as if they were guided by some kind of intelligence.  Therefore the 6 photos were significant by Military Intelligence.   The photos moved up the intelligence chain from Military Intelligence to DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) to CIA (Central Intelligence Agency).  From there, I don’t know where the photos went.  While at PIC-K, I worked with Air Force Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, DIA, CIA, Marine Recon, US Army (Green Beret) Special Forces, 101st Airborne, US Army Rangers, 82nd Airborne, Delta Force, Navy Seals.  It was necessary for us to work closely with certain elite military groups.    Another strange photo I once saw was given to me to categorize.  It was a photo of an American POW in Vietnam, taken in 1981.  The photo went into a metallic box with a combination lock and disappeared up the intelligence channel.  The spooks (intelligence personnel) I worked with, would never discuss UFOs.  Most spooks belonged to some sort of secret society, most were Freemasons and I was a Rosicrucian.   When I departed Korea, I signed up for the 82nd  ""Screaming Eagles"" Airborne and Special Forces training and they were ready to send me to Ft. Gordon, Georgia and Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and I was called to do a special assignment.  I received an H identifier and became an Army instructor and taught the Soviet Threat for OPFOR (Opposing Forces).  I wore a Russian uniform, ski mask, black gloves and talked with a fake Russian accent and called myself ""Corporal Dowbowski.""  I would instruct the Soviet Threat, teaching the W.E.F.T. (Wings, Engine, Fuselage and Tail) on Soviet Aircraft, kill zones on Soviet aircraft and land roaming vehicles, the use of many Soviet weapons from the AK-47 to the SVD Sniper Rifle in which I was proficient.   During my time with OPFOR, I learned from Intelligence circles, that the Russian KGB also knew and were aware of what exactly UFOs were and where they came from. To this day, I don’t know the answers to the UFO mystery, but hopefully one day our Government will disclose what they know to the public.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

I have been looking at many UFO sites for years and have even had a photo posted a few years ago of a UFO I got a picture of while in Washington State.  I even submitted photos last year that showed objects in front of me and around me while driving from Texas to California.  Needless to say I have had a few sightings.  What brought me to write today was that I noticed a few reports from the 1977-78 period of pretty much what I saw myself in the city of Whittier.  I am in my late 30's now and at the time I was in 6th grade.. The time was close to 4pm because my friend's mom was the manager of a donut shop and we would go pig out there everyday after school.  We got to the corner of Lambert & Colima when one of the kids yelled ""hey look a rocket""!. We looked up towards the Hacienda Hts area.  There is a big hill you have to go over that leads into Hacienda Heights using Colima Rd.  We saw the object in plain sight but at first all we could see was a flame coming out of something.  It was right above Colima Rd at the top of the hill.  That is a major pathway for planes coming into LAX.  They come in every few minutes so someone had to have seen something.  We continued watching the object and then it started to move high into the sky but towards our direction and settling directly above.  As it got above our heads (several thousand feet in the air), I could see it perfectly, it was a huge  Triangle with different colored blinking lights on the side (specifically blue & red), a flame coming out of the back, and a bright white light at the tip.  It stayed up there for at least 2 hours.  Didn't move.  The time was now way after 5pm and it started to get dark. The triangle was now blending in perfectly with the stars.  I remember still faintly being able to see the red/orange flame coming out the back and not really being able to see the red & blue lights on the sides anymore.  My neck was hurting so badly from looking straight up for all that time that I finally had to take a few minuets rest.  When I looked back up I couldn't find it but all the kids were saying ""it's right there"" and pointing it out to me.. Well I just couldn't find it anymore because it just blended in with the stars so well. I ran home to tell my family but who would believe a young kid saying such a story.  I mean, if it were that big, flying in LAX air traffic space, in plain sight, then why was there no news covereage or any mention of it??  Well I never did hear anything about it but I know what I saw. It is fresh in my memory to this day as if it just happened yesterday.  Who knows maybe since we were kids, the er uh ""visitors"" only allowed us to see them.  But whatever it was, it was huge, it was close, and it was real.   I would also like to add that a few years later (early 80's) I was watching a UFO documentary and they told the story of a man in either Wyoming or Montana that shot at a UFO that was chasing him.  Well guess what?  He drew the exact same thing I saw that day.  The triangle, flame coming out the back, bright white light at the tip, and different colored lights on the side.   I got excited and called my brother to come watch and asked him if he remembered the UFO story I told him about a few years back, I said ""that's exactly what I saw"".  He just basically said ""are you sure"" and I said ""I'm positive"" (to which he replied ""what a trip"").   I guess I got so excited because someone other than the group of kids and myself actually had an encounter with this thing and drew it in all exactness of what I saw that day.. I read about the enormous Chevron craft seen by a woman over the 605 fwy that same time period as well as another story relating to the same info and I knew I had to include my experience as well.  The area over Colima Rd is a sort of UFO hotspot.  In 1998 after leaving a friend's house just before midnight, I drove up Colima Rd coming from Hacienda to Whiiter, and as I neared the top of the hill a White light just shot across in front of me.  I sped up to try and get another look but it was long gone.  It was just like a Blip but I saw it and it was not a reflection from any other lights because for those who know that hilltop, there is a small area where there are no street lights, that's where it flew across.   I feel relieved in a sense to hear that other people have come across what I saw that day back in the late 70's.  Although I know what I saw, it's just so relieving to know that I wasn't alone and that others came across some big, weird stuff they can't explain either.  I gotta tell you, seeing something like that is better than getting your first bicycle on Christmas - it really is. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I do not have contact information for the witness presently, but I can get it. In 1977 the witness (age 17 at the time)and his cousin were returning home to obey their 12 a.m. curfew.  As they were heading up a road towards the Heights in Montgomery Village, MD, near Gaithersburg, the witness saw a light through some trees at the top of the hill and asked his cousin ""What's that?"". His cousin replied ""They're digging a lake up there; it must be some construction lights.""  They continued up the hill, came around a bend in the road, and saw a cigar-shaped object hovering over a telephone pole approximately 40 feet in the air and 50 feet in front of them.  The witness and his cousin stopped the car and got out to look at the object, which he described as shaped like a ""one-manned submarine"", being about the size of a school bus, and as having a metallic skin, 2 beams projecting from the ""front,"" and a row of ""portholes"" and non-blinking red and green lights around the circumference.  The object was completely silent and stationary for approximately 20 seconds, then made a soft, mechanical ""verrrt"" sound and began to move slowly away.  The witness emphasized 2 things: how ""man-made"" and ""nuts and bolts"" the object seemed (""like an airliner with no tail, wings, or jet engines"") and the strange way that it appeared to move away slowly, yet diminished rapidly in size until it disappeared.  He had a difficult time describing exactly how the object departed.  He said that the surface of the craft was visible from the glare of the projecting beams (""kind'a like laser beams, not spreading out like headlights""), and that it was metallic.  There were also dark patches above the view ports where he thought there was some movement visible (as in something moving inside the object).  The witnesses' car exhibited no electromagnetic effects from the close proximity of the craft; the engine continued to idle and the headlights remained on, and neither witness suffered any physiological effects.  He said that he and his cousin were open-mouthed in amazement, but never felt frightened during the encounter.  What also astonished the witness was that this sighting took place shortly before midnight in the middle of a suburban bedroom community with many houses in the area, but no one came out of their home to investigate the bright lights above their neighborhood.  He looked in the newspapers, but failed to find any reports of UFO sightings in the next several days. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was riding bikes around 8:00pm on the Ocean City, NJ boardwalk with a friend.  There were about 20 other people walking on the boardwalk.  At about 4th street, we all stopped to look at some extremely bright lights out in the ocean near Atlantic City.  In a matter of seconds, the lights were directly above the condominium complex at 4th Street and the boardwalk in Ocean City.  They were three lights in a triangle shape.  There was absolutely no sound.  We all just stood there in shock, looking up at the lights, trying to discern a craft or something.  The lights hovered there for about 10 minutes  Suddenly, the lights took off at an incredible speed in a southwest direction.  No one said anything - there was nothing to say because it was unexplainable.  I wish someone could explain this experience to me.

We were heading East to Santa Rosa County. The sun had gone down as we traveled on Interstate 10. As I was driving, I was close to the water tower that is on the interstate which is just before the bridge going over Escambia Bay.  All of a sudden and out of nowhere, a space ship was suspended over the interstate before the bridge. There was no sound eminating from the spacecraft however, it was extremely large; almost covering the width of the interstate.  Also, it was vast in height in comparison to a five or six-story building.  Underneath the craft, the structure seemed to be comprised of steel girders with a circular area in the middle of the bottom of the spacecraft. It was lit up so that one could see the structural design of the craft. The main superstructure was very large with colored panels lighting up at times. I recall a red, blue or green, and yellow panel lit up as if the space craft was tying to communicate something using color and the sequence of when the panels lit up. There was no sound coming from this sighting. It was just suspended in space. It was so close to my friend and me. Then all of a sudden the lights went out and in total darkness and without sound, the craft moved over the water tower. It was hovering over the tower when out of the circular area located at the bottom of the craft, a light shown down on the water tower. It was as if the light was searching the tower and nearby land where the tower was built. Again, the lights went out and without and trace of sound, the spacecraft moved a little west and farther into the sky. Again, it was suspended in the sky and the only lights eminating from it were white lights. If I am not mistaken, the lights seemed to be outlining the perimeter of the spacecraft. It has been several years since my friend and I saw this sighting. If I am not mistaken, once the craft had allowed us to see the white lights surrounding the perimeter, it fled in an amazing speed towards the southeast. That was an incredible evening for both my friend and me. Once arriving to my home, excitedly, he and I ran into the house sharing this information with my parents. I called the local newspaper and radio station(s) explaining what we had seen and asked if anyone had seen the same thing to please get in touch with me. However, as was in a lot of cases back in the 70's, the receiver(s) of my inquiries laughed in unbelief. Today, I know this sighting was real. I don't have to prove anything to anyone to the reality of this matter because I, as well as my friend, know what we saw was truth. I only wish I could have communicated with the intellectuality of the spacecraft to understand more. But yet, maybe another time will take place so that intelligence can share and learn from other sources within the universe.

I was piloting a Piper Cherokee 140 airplane returning to the Gadsden Airport after some recreational flying approaching from the north about 5 miles out, when I passed the object at about 1000 Ft. above ground level.  It was about 20 ft. off of my left wing.  It was about 3 feet in diameter, tan in color, and looked like a weather balloon except that it had no inflation nozzle, no radiosonde attached to it, and it was perfectly round.  Weather balloons have a teardrop shape to them when strapped to a weather gathering payload.  I circled back to get a closer look and noticed what appeared to be a red crecent moon or a hammer and scycle shape on it reminiscent of the emblem on the former Soviet flag.  As I circled around a second time to get closer look, the object moved away from me and maintained a distance of about 50 to 75 yard spacing between itself and my plane. When I became aware that the object could manuver, I was certainly rattled.   I tried to pursue the object about a minute or two but it accellerated away to the point that I could not keep up with it.  I was traveling at 120 knotts.   Scared, I opted to return to the Gadsden Airport.  When I arrived home, I reported the sighting to the Anniston Flight Service Station.  I believe the attendant at the FSS was unofficially impressed, but I don't know weather or not he officially filed my report.  I believe the UFO to be either alien, a Top Secret USA probe, or the Russians aren't telling us something.  I maintain that what I saw was not a weather balloon and flew under its own power.  I strongly believe the markings were used camoflage the UFO to be from Earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was looking at this web sight for the first time and saw an event entered 5/1/2005 that must be the same event that I experienced.  The writer dated the event 5/12/1980 but said he wasn't sure.  I think the event was approximately September of 1978 or 1979.  I was 16 or 17 and driving home from work on interstate 70.  I was headed east from Indianapolis to Greenfield.   I would say somewhere between the Mt. Comfort Rd. exit and the Greenfield exit, I saw 3 lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were primarily white but I do remember some occasional red and blue.  It would have been around 9:15 based on where I was on my trip home.  The lights moved in relation to each other and formed different sizes of the same triangle. I exited interstate 70 at Greenfield and turned north on highway 9.  I then went approximately 1 mile until I reached 300 north and turned west. (I was still headed home)  Very shortly after I turned onto 300 north, I could see something above me.  I have always described it as a ""density"".  It was too close above me to make out a shape.  When I looked up, it was big enough that I couldn't see sky on any side of the object.  I have also always said it was probably bigger that two 2 story houses.  I have also said it would be like standing under a large passenger jet, that is on the ground, and looking up.  You could just see the underneath.  I couldn't see the lights at that time and I could not make out the color of the object, just that there was something above me. There was no sound. I am guessing this lasted for just a few seconds until I drove past it.  I went home and made it by my normal time which was approximately 9:30.  I told my parents and they could tell I was visibly excited.  The next morning, I was sitting in my high school home room and they came over the intercom and said the National Enquirer was in the office and wanted to interview anyone having seen a UFO.  I did not go because I was too embarrassed to get up in front of the home room.  I do not know if anybody went.  That evening, the Greenfield Daily Reporter ran a front page article.  In that article, it reported finding markings in a field.  These markings were found somewhere on the opposite side of highway 9 than I had turned.  I turned to the west of 9 and these were found on the east of 9 and at about the same area as 300 north.  I feel it must have been headed east when I saw it.  I match my dates due to where I was working.  I really felt it was in the fall because of feeling new in the home room class.  I did go back to the Hancock County Library a couple of years ago and tried to find the paper.  I was unable to find any article, but I did concentrate on the fall only.  I will make an attempt to go back soon and start checking all of 1978 and 1979.  I will also check to make sure that all of the papers are there.

Any way..... I am SO glad to see someone else come forward like yourself, and I am SO glad that I posted my UFO experience in this weird forum.  I simply went to Google and typed in UFO NATICK CAR WASH to see if there were any follow-ups...and SURE enough, there was your experience.  I know EXACTLY what you were referring to when you said about the ""Water Tower""....  I had been up there on an ATC (all terrain cycle) 3 wheeler plenty of times back in the mid 1980's with some local friends my age that lived there in Natick...so I know the location you witnessed the same UFO that we saw.........and that water tower...I was at the water tower in 1984-1985 and I knew it was a stone's throw from where me, my Mom, and my brother saw that UFO in 1978.

I talked to my mother, and we plan to do a quick documentary with my digital video camera of driving the EXACT road in Natick where we had our 1987 UFO encounter.  My digital camera has sound too, so we will both be recalling and talking of what we saw that night of early 1978.  I think a lot will be explained a lot better once my mother and myself re-track our exact steps! that we took, describing everything on video that I'll post on YouTube this month in late October of 2007.

My mother must have read your story 50 times..... Please, keep your eye on youtube around late Oct of 2007 for a more detailed experience, re-tracing our steps that night with my digital video cam w/ sound.   IDE like to perhaps chat some day....and does NOT have to be in person.  Maybe will bring some sort of closure to that flying freak show that we both saw that night.

To Whom It May Concern,  First of all, let it be known that I am not a UFO ""believer"" per say.  Although this occurred approximately 27 years ago, I thought it's time to report to various UFO investigation organizations. I hope this is worthy. Thank you.  Around the winter of 1980, January perhaps, I just got off work at 9:30 P.M. from the auto dealership. I was a car salesman at the time. I started driving towards the city of Toronto, Canada, on the QEW (Queen Elizabeth Way) eastbound to meet some friends at a bar on the Esplanad (a street lined with nightclubs). I didn't have anything to drink and didn't smoke any pot on that day/evening.  As I was driving, I noticed a string of lights slowly rotating counter clockwise over the city of Toronto, at about the ten o'clock position from my point of view. This caught my eye because these formation of lights were very unusual. The lights were evidently in a circular pattern with about two thirds visible as the other third rotated out of view. Imagine a pie plate with about 25 lights around the circumference of it. As this ""pie plate"" would revolve, a third of these lights would be hidden from view as if they were obstructed by a solid body. It was at night so all I could see was these rotating string of lights but they were definitely on a ""fixed"" platform as the lights were revolving in unison.  Although I've heard of UFO's and was curious, at that time in my life, I didn't really give that much thought about them. I've always been interested in nature and especially about the universe. I've seen all kinds of aircraft and advertising blimps at night before. I drove taxi's off and on for fifteen years on the night shift and have seen countless meteors, lightening, satellites etc. On two occasions I've even seen extremely bright, slow falling, green fireball meteors lighting up the ground, for a couple of seconds, as if it was daylight . I've read, in later years, were other witnesses reported green fireballs as UFO's. I chuckled to myself thinking how easily ""UFO believers"" can be fooled by natural phenomenon.  Anyway, these circle of lights were slowly descending and approaching towards me (westbound), while I was driving about 115 kilometres per hour on the highway eastbound. These lights were getting closer and closer as ""we"" approached each other. I recall thinking to myself that this must be some kind of advertising balloon and those lights were letters. As I kept driving, I was paying more and more attention to this object because the closer it was getting, the more unusual it looked. I kept glancing at it, while driving, waiting until it was close enough to read what these letters were saying, still thinking it was some kind of advertising blimp. The closer it got, the more I looked at it. Now at my nine o'clock position, the string of rotating lights started to bank left like an airplane would ""turning right"" At this point, I realised that these lights were not letters at all. They were different shaped, yellowish white lights. The reason these lights were different in shape was because they were ""ingrained"" into some body. When the lights were seen head on, they were circular. But as they rotated out of ""direct"" view, they changed shape like the different crescents of the moon. That's why they appeared to be all different shapes.  Anyway, during the time when this object started to bank left, from my point of view, I was struggling with myself trying to understand whether this was a plane or a balloon. It was flying too slow for a plane, yet, too fast for a blimp. Also, it didn't appear to be flying or floating. The best way I can describe it's motion is that it looked like it was ""sailing"" in the sky.  What's interesting here is that the human brain tries to associate what the eyes are seeing, to something already seen or experienced before. That's why I was at war with myself trying to decide whether this object was a plane, blimp or a balloon. Every time I resigned myself to what I must be witnessing, I jumped to another conclusion. This jumping from one conclusion to another occurred during the whole experience. I was imagining all kinds of things. For example, if it was a plane, the only way these lights could have been positioned was in a circle because this plane must have had some kind of supporting structure in a circle from wing tip to wing tip. This didn't make any sense at all. I've seen advertising planes before. This was nothing like this. Not even close. Than I was trying to imagine a ""Goodyear blimp"" with these letters going across it's side. This was nothing like it either. So here I was, trying to drive and watch this object at the same time. As I was driving, I started to slow down because I kept looking at this circle of lights more than the road ahead of me. In retrospect, I don't even know how I kept my car on the road because I was so awed by this display in the sky.  Here is the killer.  As the object kept banking and banking more and more, it eventually ended up totally perpendicular to the ground! The first thing that came to mind was a big ferris wheel rotating in the sky. At this point I slowed down to about 50 KPH (30 miles an hour in a 60 MPH highway for my American friends) and put my four way, flashing hazard lights on my car fearing that another car would smash into the back of me for going so slow on a 100 KPH highway.  Here is the shocker.  As I was mesmerised by this UFO, a surge of adrenaline hit me like a ton of bricks. I didn't realize how BIG this thing was. At first I thought it was the size of an airplane fairly close. IT WAS GIGANTIC! At least twice the size of a football field, bigger than an aircraft carrier!!! I don't know what gave away it's size. Maybe the reflections of light on the ground. The best way I can relate this sudden realization is like one of those illusions most of us have seen. You know, when you look at a pixel drawing with an image you can't see until you stare at it for a while? After a period of time, you make out the face of a women or something like that? That's kind of the transformation I experienced. At first I thought the object was the size of a large plane than suddenly I REALLY saw it. IT WAS HUGE!!! I yelled out loud to my self, ""HOLEY F**K, IT'S HUGE!!!"". I DON'T F***ING BELIEVE IT, IT'S F***ING HUGE!!!. I thought it was fairly close at first, than bang!, it was much farther away and larger than my brain first comprehended it. Speaking about this surge of adrenaline. Have you ever had a really close call having a car accident? When your heart rate skyrockets to about 180 beats per minute? That's what I felt when I realised how GARGANTUAN this object was! I could literally feel my heart pounding like crazy. To be frank, It literally scared the hell out of me, when I realized how big it was. At this point, I rolled down my window and pointed to this giant ""ferris wheel"" in the sky to the other motorists, but it appeared no one seemed to notice as they screamed by me at regular highway speeds. I remember how cold it was when I rolled down my window. It was something like minus 30 Celsius below zero.  After, I don't know how long, probably only a few seconds of rotating in this perpendicular position, this thing started to climb and right itself and ""sail"" back to the direction it originally came from. I rolled up my window, turned off my hazard lights, and started to speed up to chase it. Still it seemed other motorists didn't notice this object. It still irks me to this day. As I was approaching the city limits, this object was in it's flat position again climbing over the city. Then, all of a sudden, the rotating lights turned off except for a red ""aircraft like"" blinking light (which I never noticed before). After a few seconds, the rotating lights turned on again. It was like in the movie ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"". The lights just blasted on. Than after a few seconds they turned off again as it seemed to be right over the city. Strange behaviour. Now I was exiting off of the highway on to Spadina Rd. I lost track of these lights because of the tall buildings. When I was on the street where I was going, I saw a cop parked on the other side of the road writing a parking ticked. I stopped in the middle of the road and ran over to him. He was quite taken aback by my seemingly aggressive approach. I asked him, ""how long have you been here?"" I forgot what he said, but I asked, ""did you see that big circle of lights flying in the sky? He said ""no"". After parking my car, I met my friends at the bar, ""Baily's"", and told them what happened but they didn't take me seriously as they've already had a few and were more interested in the ladies.  After ""sitting at the bar by myself"" for a couple of hours I went home. I was living at my parent's house at the time, temporarily, so when I got home around 1 A.M., I called the police. I didn't know who else to phone at the time. They didn't take me seriously of course so after that, I phoned the Toronto International Airport and managed to get through to Air Traffic Control and asked them if they had anyone call in with a UFO report. Nothing. So I called the police again and convinced them to take me seriously as I wanted to make a report. They told me they can send a couple of officers to my house. As it was late and my parents were asleep, I told them I'd rather come to the station the next day to report. Next morning, when I contemplated going in I decided not to, fearing they would think I'm some kind of wacko.  As the days went by, scanning the newspapers looking for a ""UFO sighting"" to no avail, I started doubting myself. I was trying to convince myself that perhaps I was somehow mistaken. Maybe it was something not out of the ordinary at all. Maybe it was a balloon or airplane of some kind. Maybe like thousands of others, I witnessed something that I misinterpreted for something else.  And now the conclusion.  About a week or so later, on or about the tenth page of the Toronto Star, bottom right hand corner, there it was! A short article. ""Dozens of Mississauga residents reported a UFO as big as a football field!!!"" I don't recall the whole article. I'll never doubt myself again no matter how much ridicule I'll be subjected to. After about 27 years, I just had to let this out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2007-10-08T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

In the summer of 1979, when I was 21 years old, my former husband and I were attending a party on a farm in Powell County, Kentucky.  We had gone up to the house to use the restroom and were on our way back toward the stage, where the crowd was listening to Bluegrass music, when something caught my eye. My husband was a bit tipsy, having had several beers, but I wasn’t, because I didn’t drink. When I looked up into the clear night sky, I was astonished to see a huge round object hovering over the field at about 2500 to 3000 feet above.  The sphere had multi-colored flashing lights going around its perimeter of green, yellow, white, and red and was making a very faint whirring sound. I believe the lights were moving counter clockwise, but it has been so long that I am not sure of that. I got my husband’s attention and had him to look at it, too. He sobered up pretty quickly! The object hovered a few more seconds (approximately 15) and just as if it had seen us see it, it darted amazingly quickly away in a zigzag pattern in a due east direction.  Within 2 or 3 seconds, the object had completely disappeared with no trace. (I grew up the oldest daughter of a career Marine that taught Avionics. I had been to many Blue Angel Shows, grew up around aviation, flight simulators, etc., and I had never seen or heard of anything that could move that fast.)

In North Platte, Nebraska the stars that can be seen in the nights sky are brillantly luminated.  Watching the sky counting the meteors and meteorites as they passed over our heads. Meanwhile, my friends sister was just inside attending a birthday party at the skating ring, we were her escorts that for the night.  All of us are walking towards his house and, at the intersection of Custer Ave.and West 13th street, the background sky nearly Jet Black it was late in the evening shortly after 10: 00 PM which was nearly solid black and I'm looking Northward up about 30 degree in the sky, when a massive Pitch Black rock shaped and jagged edges the size or mass of three football fields.  Directly, behind the leader in formation two seperate objects split apart about half the mass as the leader combined the same shape and color.   Another pair exactly the same just smaller than the first pair directly behind the first pair. Directly, behide the last pair was a single object exactly the same as the others only smaller yet.  So they went from enormous leader the first to a pair that were exactly the same size objects too another pair exactly the same size each only smaller in size to the first pair.  The sixth object same shape and color just smaller than the second paired objects and directly behind and in the middle making up what would be the star of David formation.  However, it was solo and directly behind but in the center of the last pair.  The final object was out of formation and off and well behind the pack just smaller than all the rest of them.  It was like it struggled to keep up with the rest of the objects.  As these pitch black objects the shape of giant boulders with jagged edges raced across the night sky from North to South in my window of the sky view I shouted to my friend to look at these objects and pointed them out he could not see them because the were nearly the same color as the background sky,  If anyone including me would have blinked an eye you would have seen nothing, Moving extremely fast they were like a blurr only darkening out the stars as they passed over us like a shadow with pure silence.  Then, I took my eyes off the pack for just a second to aid him by pointing them out with my finger and in doing so I had difficulity trying to re-aquire the group because the speed was out of this world.  Finally, as I reaquired them on the flight path I was able to point them out again and he saw only a glimpse of a second or two before they vanished into a massive puffy white anvil or mushroom shaped clouds that were roughly one hundred fifty mile to the South at an altitude between 30,000 to 40,000 feet. They came out of the North on the same level flight path the moment I saw them dash  through my window of view.  I went home and told my parents what I saw and the were the least but interested because they were watching Ronald Reagan giving his exceptance speech for nomination of the Republican Party for President that Friday evening which is my Fathers birth date.

Cylindrical craft crashes near Aberdeen WA,Aberdeen,WA,1981-06-15T22:00:00,cylinder,1 hour,"Occurred : 6/15/1981 22:00  (Entered as : 061581 22:00) Reported: 10/6/2007 2:13:57 AM 02:13 Posted: 10/8/2007 Location: Aberdeen, WA Shape: Cylinder Duration:1 hour",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59115.html,"Cylindrical craft crashes near Aberdeen WA I am estimating the date and time of this event due to the amount of time that has passed. I do remember that it was shortly after I graduated high school (1980), and had landed a job at the local mall as a maintenance employee.  I remember leaving work and proceeding north through south Aberdeen, and had to stop at a red light before proceeding over the Chehalis river bridge. To my surprise, a long convoy of military vehicles was headed south over the bridge, pulling trailers, some covered with tarp, others obviously diesel generators, along with one truck pulling a piece of heavy equipment (bulldozer). I just thought there were military exercises taking place somewhere and thought nothing more about it.  Later that day, I heard local radio, reporting that a cylindrical shaped object was seen over interstate 5 near or at Olympia WA, and that the craft was headed West. This craft was witnessed by hundreds if not thousands of people already.  The craft was now reported by eye witness accounts to have been following State Route 12 West towards the coast. The craft was witnessed flying low, not very fast, and was on fire, but emitted no smoke and made no noise The craft was under some sort of control, as witnesses reported that it followed the highway, making turns to correct course.  It had flown over sparsely populated areas, and was later seen flying ""along highway 12"", through the vicinity of Central Park, a outlying area East of Aberdeen, and again witnessed by hundreds, (motorists and residents of Central Park).  Before the craft entered the city of Aberdeen itself, it took a fairly large turn to the left, flying over Junction City, across the town of Cosmopolis, and was now headed South West towards Westport WA.  Witnesses reported the craft to have followed the Westport highway to the point of the Elk River bridge where it turned abruptly to the left, flying directly over the bridge and followed the Elk River South East where one witness reported it crashing with a white flash on the visi! ble hori zon.  The area of the crash is forest land accessible only by logging roads.   No explanation was given as to what it was by any Government agency.  Residents in the vicinity of the crash site reported that the military cordoned off the area and installed road blocks into the area denying any entry. Reports by residents, (rumors) that some of the teenage boys took dirt bikes out and rode as close as they could,”after already trying the roads and having been sent away by armed soldiers”, and hiking through the timber, where they reported seeing tree tops broke. They reported seeing a roughly 70 foot long cylindrical craft, lit by flood lights, with men moving about the craft in protective clothing, “obviously what the diesel generators were used for”. About 10 years later, while working another job, I had the opportunity to speak personally with one resident who lived in the area of the site, who was a fellow co-worker of mine. He told me, “one of those teenage boys on the dirt bikes was his”, and that many days after the event, “government sedans had stopped at many of the residents homes to ask what they had seen, and to not continue to spread rumors”. He also said that some residents had been “threatened to shut up or else”. This was big news for about a week in the area, but died out just like the rest. I recall my co-worker telling me that they flew the craft out, wrapped in canvas tarp towards the ocean slung under a sky crane helicopter. Weeks later, after many calls to the local authorities, the local radio reported that the government reported  that it had been a small airplane that crashed. Nothing more was ever reported, but to this day I believe what I saw (the convoy), and what the neighbors in the area saw to be true. I truly believe, if this was not a crash of a then new cruise missile, to be a craft from another place, and another Roswell, but due to the time and place, receive much less publicity. This incident happened in the evening, while I was working, my shift ending at 07:00AM, so the m! ilitary response was pretty rapid since the heavy equipment was assembled and in the area in less than 9 hours, as witnesses in Central Park were calling in reports to authorities around 22:00 hrs. Fort Lewis WA is less than 2 hrs from Aberdeen, and probably less than 3.5 hrs from the actual crash site. No other aircraft were reported in the air visually, with the stricken craft. All witnesses reported seeing flames emanating from the craft and they also reported that it made no engine noises, or any noise at all. If it was a cruise missile it would have been emitting sound.

It was a very clear night so we were able to see an incredible amount of stars that evening, it was really very beautiful.  Around 10:00 PM, I noticed a red light moving across the southern hemisphere at an attitude of about 11:00. The object appeared to be moving slow like an airplane from west to east, but its altitude was very high as if it was in the upper atmosphere somewhere in the neighborhood of at least 80,000 feet. At this altitude I imagine that its ground speed had to be tremendous, and it was probably pretty large if I could see it that far away.  We watched the object move across the sky for about three to four minutes and then it simply stopped and loitered for five to ten seconds before it made a 90 degree right turn and departed at lightening speed out of the atmosphere. Even though the red light was probably the sun reflecting off of what ever it was, this was not a shooting star, they don’t leave the atmosphere once they enter it and this was not another planet, they don’t move like that.  I am retired military and somewhat of a UFO skeptic, but I am not aware of anything in our inventory that is capable of flying at such a high speed then come to a dead stop, loiter, and then make a sharp turn and accelerate out of our atmosphere in less than a second.  It just doesn’t exist.  On one other occasion I made a similar observation during the early 1990s. I was on an at sea deployment with the Marines between Hawaii and the Philippines when I saw the object.  The Navy usually operates under what they call “darken ship” conditions at night so it gets very dark out there and you can see are the navigational lights. Because of this, you can see stars like you’ve never seen before under these conditions.  Anyway, I can’t remember all of the details, but I do remember that the events that occurred that evening were almost identical to the ones that occurred in 1982, which is why I have remembered them even after all of these years.   And yes, there were others with me when we sat what ever it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

She wanted to go to the store so the two of us walked about 2 blocks over to the local bodega. We were walking back and for some reason, I caught myself looking down at the ground. I remembered being told not to look down, and so I shifted my eyes to the horizon. It did occur to me to not only look at the horizon, but to check out the stars while I was at it. We were crossing the street, and I looked straight up as far as I could see. Suddenly, I tugged at my mother's hand and pulled her further into the street; ""Look, Look!"" I shouted as she pulled back on me. What I saw in that moment was a HUGE metal disk with bright lights all over it. It was suddenly hovering right over us. You could not see the sky it was so close. When she looked up, she yanked me back with the most chilling grasp, close to her waistline. I can still hear the desparate breath she took. Once I shouted look and was yanked back, I noticed everyone in the street stopped and was staring up at the sky. Once I looked back up again, it was gone, and everyone started walking again as if nothing had happened. The next day, when I went outside I heard nothing of the incident from adults.

I told her I did not beleive her, she was just trying to appease me, and asked her to recount her story. Here is what she said: ""I looked up and saw the UFO and lights, I was scared so I pulled you closer."" I told her that when she pulled me closer, I looked around at everyone else looking up. I asked her what happened in that moment because when i looked back up the ufo was gone. ""The UFO ascended into the air, and sped off, like a bright white light, it just disappeared.

They were a good distance apart so I immediately thought they were a couple of planes either heading for Shreveport Regional Airport or Barksdale Air Force Base.  I took my attention back to the road since it was at dusk dark and proceeded to drive on south towards my home and in the direction of the lights. I could no longer see them due to the trees along the road.  When I got about a quarter mile from my house I came to a clearing in the trees that allowed a good view to the east and when I looked up at the darkening sky I saw the lights again. This time I saw they were not just lights. They were two objects, eliptical in shape, almost oval, and had three lights emitting from them. One of them was rotating on a center axis but neither was moving horizontal or vertical.  I stopped to get a better look and I saw various planes flying around the objects with the familiar red and green lights but the lights on the objects were white, yellow, and red.

It was too low and in the wrong place to ever have been a conventional aircraft and it was travelling very fast.  By the time I alerted my family to look as it was such a strange thing to see, it was gone.   The next day there was a report in the local newspaper that a person in a nearby town - Cobden- had reported seeing a similar light, however between Cobden (to the south) and my town is a range of hills; and what I saw could not have been seen by that person unless it had travelled around or over these hills.

The objects were traveling from the south-by-south west to the north-by-north east. I brought this observation to my partner’s attention.  Our first thought was someone had fired a few rockets, but the altitude and flight path was not consistent with such an event, although the speed of movement was. We watched as the object covered a distance of approximately 50k with consistency of speed, direction of travel and altitude.  We were discussing amongst ourselves what they might be when in an instant they came to a complete halt. A fraction of a second after stopping, all three objects blinked and then accelerated out of site (The first appeared to be in a very steep if not completely vertical climb). The second object moved in what appeared to be a level trajectory due east. The last moved in what appeared to be a gradually increasing altitude north.  It took approximately one second for the objects to be completely out of site. We switched to IR and still had no visual contact. Obviously, we discussed the issue amongst ourselves but did not report it to higher for obvious reasons.

But these craft are training over our skies every night of the week (Exept Sundays) in Sacramento CA. Up in the foothills and the Sierra Nevada range we can see them in formations of two, four, and six over the Central valley. I think it's because we are at a higher elevation. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO MAKE THIS A WHITE WORLD PROJECT. They are operating without regard to who is watching them. I believe they are manned craft as opposed to UAV's. They look a bit like bright stars and Planets at first and tend to wobble a bit when you look at them. But watch for the red tail of light followed by a range of colors that sparkle off the craft. Usually they work in groups of 2 and can sit still for hours, only to move as quickly as 50 thousand miles per hour in a second. One night I watched as more than 8 gathered in a circle in the sky. A lone craft then dotted in and out of visibility across the sky. Each time it reappeared it did so it came back with a flash of light. Almost like a ""Top Gun"" Training flight. I don't believe that these are UFO's. These craft are US Military in their training style and seem to be guarding our coastline as well. I have never seen a beam or ray fired from any of them though. They make no noise, usually move in a circular pattern, they blink out at times and reappear in a different area within a mili second. Although they appear small, at times they can get close and appear the size of a house. It is the most interesting right at sun up. One of the lead ships stands like a beacon over the North Valley (Beale AFB?) and waits for them all to gather like children after recess. If you watch very closely, you can see the craft streak across the sky just beyond the Hue of the morning sky to this lead ship. 50 60 thousand miles an hour. What our Government has in it's secret arsenal now may be the biggest jump in tech. ever. Anti Gravity machines than can disappear and seem to time travel. It's up there,, every night.

My job has me working until 1:45am and I don't get home till shortly after 2. I wasn't tired, so I stayed up late to work on a computer project. I went outside to the front of my home at approximately 5:15 to have a cigarette. I was standing in the driveway of my home, facing the house (so I was facing east / northeast) and looking up at the stars. I was amazed with how clear it was. Usually I can only see a certain number of stars due to light pollution in my area. This night was incredibly clear though, and I could see constellations I only see once every so often. I noticed an airplane fly by. It was high enough so that you couldn't hear the engine, but you could still clearly make out the red and blue lights on the wings. It went off into the distance and there it was obvious there were no more aircraft in sight. As I stood there a few minutes longer admiring the stars, enjoying my cigarette, I noticed a pinpoint of light almost directly overhead. This was much different than an airplane. With an airplane (especially at night), you can always see the wing and tail lights which are often red and blue. This was a single white point of light that appeared. It flashed overhead for about 2 seconds, then disppeared. About 10 to 15 seconds later, it appeared again, heading in a southerly direction. It flashed again for 2 seconds and disappeared. Then, after another 10 or 15 seconds had passed, it flashed again. That was the last time. If I had to measure the distance between the flashes, I would say it was equal to the amount of sky that two adult hand widths would cover side by side, extended at arm's length. I followed the path of the light to see if it flashed again, but it did not. This is what made me even more suspicious because there were still stars in the sky above where the flash would have appeared that were clearly visible. There were no clouds over the house at the time and, again, I was amazed that the sky was at clear as it was. I wondered if I could have been seeing a satellite, but it didn't make sense that it would be flashing or that it would only flash three times and disappear. The brightness of the flash was about equal to the brightness of Mars or Venus on any clear night. Less than a minute after I spotted the light, I went inside to look at the clock on my cable box. I used this clock specifically because the time is set by my local cable company and it would make sense that it would be the most accurate clock in my home. The time was 5:22.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,28.673367261904765,-81.17914702380952

It was oval shaped...almost like the shape that a ball assumes if you put pressure on it.  It was not as flat as the stereotypical 'flying saucer' shape...more round.

I distinctly saw the shape of it and it wasn't round, nor was it oblong, it was not the shape of a balloon. It looked like a ""flying saucer"" with a lid on it. It was flat and shiny on the bottom, and the top looked like an oval cut in half and attached to it. It was definately bigger than at least eight big black cows put together. I saw its dimensions after it flew over the hill and turned around abruptly. It moved to the left, then back to the right, slowly moving toward the Bay and shifting direction, until it disappeared. It was silver and shiny and distinctive in the clear blue sky. There was nothing else up in the sky at that time. Nothing flies that low over the hill in the direction toward my house. I can't think of anything that would move so erraticly. It sure wasn't a bird or a plane.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,37.54118127183787,-121.976828371768

Recap:  This event was taken under investigation as a joint inquiry between NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia.  Thumbnail:  (Please see original post in NUFORC data base).  This NUFORC witness reports that after a short local trip in Conyers Georgia, that a number of aircraft were observed ""hovering above the city"".  Said aircraft had the look of ""fighter jets"", with red, white and blue lights, were flying in pairs back and forth at staggered heights.  Upon arriving at home, witness continued to watch and counted appx. ten aircraft.  About 8:30PM, an ""object"" (not described by the witness) appeared traveling at a high speed downward as if to crash, but disappeared before it ""left the skyline"".  Thereafter the aircraft began to clear away.  Earlier separate MUFON investigation in nearby Newton County/Covington/Starrsville area:  On 10Oct07 at a few minutes after 8:00PM, a motorist in the Newton County Starrsville community (appx. 14.5 miles SE of Conyers, I-20 connecting the two vicinities) observed a fiery-like glowing orangish sphere shaped object just to the north side of Starrsville Rd., over the treetops at an unknown altitude and distance, but described as low and fairly close.  Object appeared about the size of a baseball held at arms length, including it's surrounding aura-like glow, and was moving VERY slow in a westerly direction.  The object seemed to have segments within, much like a science book illustration of a human brain.  Witness also noticed appx. 10 aircraft circling the area.  She reported it to a friend via phone, and upon arrival home contacted MUFON.  This investigator met with the MUFON witness in Covington Georgia on 15Oct07, conducted an interview and visited the event site.  Witness was found to be well educated, intelligent, and a long time productive resident of Newton County.  Continued investigation consisted of the search for additional witnesses, contacting the local authorities, the Georgia Air National Guard, the FAA and so forth.  No real progress was made toward a positive identification of what was observed.  Subsequently, this writer discovered the above NUFORC Conyers witness report which seemed to describe the same event as that of the MUFON witness from the Covington/Starrsville occurrence.  This writer contacted NUFORC Director Peter Davenport and a joint investigation was undertaken.  This FI sent an email of explanation to the NUFORC witness, and also placed a phone call to the Conyers residence.  The phone call reached an answering machine, and additional calls thereafter found a recorded message that the line had been disconnected.  There was also no response to this writer's email.  We feel that an interview with NUFORC's Conyers witness is important to further the Covington/Starrsville investigation, as well as what was described in Conyers.  We think that the Conyers witness may have observed the Starrsville event from afar, perhaps from a high vantage point in Conyers that might give a good view toward Convington/Starrsville to the SE.  However, until such time the Conyers witness might come forward we cannot be sure.  Could there have been a second, separate, event in Conyers?  We do not know.  Anyone with information regarding this matter can contact Georgia MUFON, State Director Tom Sheets, at mufonofga1@yahoo.com  If the Conyers witness reads this..........please contact us. There is nothing to fear. We would like to conduct an interview at your convenience, and your identity will be held strictly confidential.  NUFORC and MUFON urges each Georgia citizen to help in the solution to one of mankind's most enduring mysteries......we can't do it without grass roots assistance. Thanks!

It was a dull matte grey color and looked like two inverted contact lenses with a little turret on top, with a large round blue/white light on one side.  Whatever way the object was moving was the way the light faced. A vehicle was stopped on the other side of the road with 3 occupants in it, watching the object.  1 female and 1 male were standing up in the bed of the truck and 1 male was standing on the dash of the driver’s side.

She is 56 years old and works as an artist and designer.  She is very good at creating animation using her Mac computer.  I asked her to write down the experience she had so that I could report the incident as a possible UFO. She did that for me and she also supplied me with the picture and the animation that I have attached.  The picture (lightshape2.jpg) is a representation of the object on a photograph of the tops of the two trees where the object appeared to hover.  The animation (lightshapelayers2.mp4) is her attempt to represent the shifting nature of the object—at times amorphous and without apparent boundaries of edges, at times with edges more distinct.  She says it is a pretty good representation of what she saw. We both use Macs so I hope it translates well to PC computers.  Here is what she wrote about the experience:  We were being lashed by the remnants of Hurricane Noel (Nov 2 or 3, 2007-I can’t remember the exact date but I think it was the 2nd). There was gale force wind, thunder, lightning, heavy rain.  I was sitting in my computer room near the window in my second-floor studio when I noticed that there was something strange about the lightning. There was too much of it, it was like watching a strobe light, and the thunder didn’t seem to correspond. It was like the lightning was spelling out something in Morse Code. Dit dit dit dit, etc. And it was too near, too bright and very unusual. I started to feel a little uneasy.  But it was just a storm so I waited. I decided that I should turn off the computer because it was the type of weather that causes power outages. Just after doing so I sat quietly in the darkness of the room for a while. Then there was a bright flash and a brilliant light illuminated the entire yard, driveway and all the nearby area about 30 feet in every direction (an estimate). But it still didn’t seem like lightning, and I did not want to look out for fear of what I might see. It felt strange and scary because the illumination lasted for several minutes without flickering or changing although it was clearly undulating. It was brighter than broad daylight-maybe10 times brighter than a cloudless summer day at noon. I wanted to believe that this was ordinary lightning but something scared me and something in me really did not want to know what it was out there, even though I was compelled to look. I had a sense of fear that made me want to crawl under the table. But I sat still and looked out of the north window at the yard and rooftop of the cottage next door. I could see everything clearly bathed in this brilliant white light. It was like there was a giant magnifying lamp, and it stayed unmoving and illuminated, undulating for a long stretch of time, possibly 5-10 minutes. All this time I was sitting rooted to my chair with a window in front (north-facing) and another window to my right (east facing window), both with wide-open views of the weather phenomena outdoors.  At this point in time, I was just witnessing what I thought to be a very unusual lightning storm.  Suddenly the light just went out, or rather seemed to have rolled away. It was dark, save for the intermittent “dits” of light that I described as being regular and code-like. I felt a sense of relief-I noticed after the fact that I was very tense. During the episode I was transfixed, I could have moved but I was trying to focus with all of my senses because of the unusual nature of the lightning so I stayed seated in my chair. When the lights suddenly went out, I moved closer to the window on my right (east)- which has a parallel view of the cottage and property behind my house. I was glad whatever it was, was gone. I knew whatever it was, was strange.  Then the light suddenly appeared again, brilliant as ever, illuminating everything, making everything seem like bright and flat white light, filling the sky and everything reflecting it in a bright white glow. I got a really creepy feeling and then I looked out and up over the back of the cottage, in a space like a little valley between two treetops, there seemed to be a consolidated light-ball of some sort: large, like the size of a bus maybe, round and with a concentrated brilliance that was outlined by a thin gradated line - which made the shape seem to blend with the surrounding brilliance. Immediately I thought I was seeing a UFO, then I ducked under the table, the surface of which is about a foot above the window’s lower ledge. It’s an old drawing board and I had it backed up to the window. Under the table I could look out at it.  I looked at it, stared at it, frozen with fear but compelled by curiosity. I was watching it and almost couldn’t breathe. I saw it seem to change shape, as if the thin gradated line modulated, it reminded me of pixilation overlap used in film special effects to depict morphing, it changed from a round circle to a diamond shape, with what seemed like symmetrical filigree-like “steps” making the edges seem dimensional and not flat. It was like a ragged-edged diamond and the edges again were softly outlined by a thin gradated line. It reminded me of the Russian painter Kasimir Malevich’s painting “White on White”, a painting consisting of a tilted white square on a white backgound. Only a slight variation of brushstroke allows the viewer to see the shape emerge. As difficult as it was to stare for long at the object because of its brightness, the edges of the object were very unusual and detailed, with various tiers along the edges coming forward and receding.  After watching it for a minute or two I got really scared and ducked down under the table. I felt like it was a UFO type of thing, even though I kept trying to frame it within my usual knowledge and expectations, all the while “knowing” that it didn’t fit into any frame of reference in my experience, and that there had to be an intelligence involved so I started to “talk” to it, saying “Please go away, you’re scaring me” and “I don’t want to get abducted” and stuff like that. I remember saying, “whatever you do, don’t hurt my cats”.  But I felt a sense of fear and panic that was undeniable. There was no thunder.  I crawled out of the studio on my hands and knees because I didn’t want to be “seen” even though I already felt like I had been seen and there was no escaping it. I entered the living room where there is a large picture window facing the same direction (east) as the window in the studio with the table. I stayed on the floor. The illumination in the general area remained for some time but fright kept me from looking anymore so I don’t know what might have happened. However, after a few more minutes the illumination dissipated, there was darkness and a few “dits” of light again, but then it was as if the storm had just quieted down a little, everything seemed again like a normal storm - there was regular lightning, but it was farther away and had the accompanying distant thunder, it continued to rain and the winds continued through the night. I had a feeling like I didn’t know if I had seen what I had seen.  So I constructed a still image showing the relative positioning above the trees, just to serve my memory and help me to realize that whatever it was that I saw, it was something unusual. I followed that with making a short animation as well to show what it looked like, which I think I have captured reasonably well although it is very difficult to “say” in film with so much whiteness. I have been experimenting with animation techniques for the last 8 years so I knew what I had to do to make the movie look like what I saw. I am self-taught and there is a certain roughness to it because of gaps in my technical knowledge. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I could see it through the bare limbs.  It looked like a giant cleary marble, but it glowed like a swimming pool does at night when the lights are on inside the pool.  It was fluid-looking, like lighted water.  It was perfectly round and appeared to be much bigger than my car.  On the bottom of the craft, were 3 red lights all in a row that appeared to be spinning left-to-right, but not really flashing. I could tell they were spinning though.  I had slowed my car down when I was coming out of a curve and first saw the very bright white ligh ahead and to the right of the road.  It wasn't supposed to be there.  The area was an old homesite, but the house had burned down years earlier.  At first I thought it might be that someone had decided to build another house there and had had a security (yard) light put up, but I could tell that the light was way too big to be a security light, even before I saw the object up close.  When I got parallel to the light, I stopped my car and just stared at it.  It was maybe 30 yards from the country road, Old Sandy Hook Road, I was travelling on.  It was stationary, but the red lights were spinning on the bottom.  The white moon-shaped light looked exactly like swimming pool water when someone walks in the shallow part at night and the lights of the pool are reflected in the gentle waves.  It was beautiful, but I was overwhelmed.  I was afraid to get out of my car, but I just sat in my car in the road and stared at the object until I noticed a truck coming toward me.  The road is not very wide, so I put my car in gear and went forward slowly as the truck came my way.  What made this even more strange was that when I rounded another curve a few yards ahead and was headed to the left, I saw the same exact object on the right side of the road ahead of me. There is only woods and one house between where I first saw the object and the second place I saw it.  There is no road someone could have used to perhaps pull a baloon or something from where I first saw it to the second place I saw it.   I kept trying to think of something logical for the light to be, but it was like nothing I had ever seen before.  It hovered over trees at the back side of a small field people use to keep a few cows in - not a  big field.  It just hovered there, just like it did earlier.  Now I was really scared, but I couldn't help myself.  I stopped my car and rolled my windows down, so I could see better. I heard nothing.   I was still afraid to get out, and I kept thinking how  people who might come down the road would think I was crazy, if they saw me stopped in the middle of the road.  I turned my head to face ahead of me to see if another vehicle was coming, and  I don't know if I really saw this or not, but I could swear that a light was over my car and shining on the road all around me.  Now I was very frightened, but I looked back to the right where the object had been, and it was gone.  Another vehicle was meeting me at that moment, so I put my car in gear and left.  I kept looking at the sky to see if I could see the object leaving, but I didn't see anything else.  But I know what I saw.   I will never forget it.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

However, after seeing several videos online as well as interview clips on the History Channel, it is now my belief that I was one of many that witnessed this object or type of object.  I had been outside in front of my house about five minutes when I had an urge to walk to the rear of my house. I felt like ""someone"" was back there. When I came to the backside of my house I didn't see anyone standing around, but I immediately noticed what at first appeared to be ""cop lights"" just above the horizon approximately 3-5 miles away.  At first the ""cop lights"" flashed randomly from red to blue but then I noticed green and then yellow flashing as well. I went back inside to get a ""monocular"" to get a better look and also asked my girlfriend to come outside and take a look.  As I viewed the object through the monocular, I noticed it randomly switched colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and also shapes.  It first appeared like a diamond or two triangles with bottoms touching. Then the object ""went all white"" and became much larger momentarily. After about 15 seconds, the object appeared to get very small or possibly move away from me. When the object was all white, it appeared more like an oval or sphere.  The object randomly shifted between colors, size and shapes the entire time I watched through the monocular or without the monocular.  When I did use the monocular, I held it against the side of my house to ensure a steady view.  The object appeared to go from complete stillness to ""bouncy"" and back. Again, everything seemed to be random.  My girlfriend seen exactly what I was seeing... whatever ""that"" was.  I myself was in the US Air Force and am certain it was not conventional aircraft of any sort that I have seen before, or since.  One odd note I should add is the fact that my girlfriend has had several experiences all of her life in terms of seeing strange objects and ""beings"".  She has had ""geometric patterns"" appear on her tongue that change in shape and appeared to be cut in to her tongue, only to vanish within a few days.  Not witnessed by myself, but several of her family members.  She also has a strange ""bump"" just under the skin on her left calve. It's been checked by a doctor (now years ago) but was considered a ""calcium anomaly"".  With reports of ""alien implants"", I thought perhaps with everything she has experienced, perhaps there's more to it.  More specific details of this experience are available upon request.

I glimpsed it after I turned to check before entering another road and then looked back. A very large brown object with no lights hovered in the field to my right.  I didn't enter the other road, but stayed at the intersection, since there was no traffic and just stared at this object, but for only a second.  It hovered above large scraggly trees and to me it looked a lot like a cross between an old 1930's or 40's buick and an airplane. This doesn't sound like it's real, but it was.  This is something I've only told my husband, and after I told him I wished I hadn't.  It doesn't seem possible. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

In my dream, I awoke in the middle of the night to the sounds of my parents talking very excitedly about something outside the window on the side of our house.  (Their bedroom was next to my bedroom - both had windows on the side of the house; my parents' bedroom was in the rear; I shared a bedroom with my brothers in the front of the house; both bedrooms were on the second floor.)  I sat up in the bed to listen to what they were saying. My brothers then awoke and asked what was going on.  I said I didn't know, but that I heard my parents talking about something on the side of the house, so, since my bed was directly under the side window, I pulled back the blinds and looked out.  The night was very bright, like under a full moon on a clear night, and there were no leaves on the trees, so I could see very clearly (as best as one could at night) down to the neighbor's lawn next door and saw there 3-4 ""little men"" in silver jump suits with head covering pointing what looked like an old-fashioned stand-up tripod camera up towards my parents' window.  These did not look like the classic ""gray aliens"", but were probably only about 4 feet tall, very thin, and had slits for eyes and mouth and two little holes for a nose.  They almost looked child-like, or robotic.  It seemed they noticed me peering out and swung the ""camera"" over toward me in the window.  I then felt absolutely paralyzed and my vision started to ""blue"" out, as if I had stared at an old-fashioned camera's flash bulb and now saw nothing but the flash.  I then came out of this blindness and paralysis a few minutes later due to my father shaking me.  He told me the same thing had just happened to him before I looked out the window and my moth! er had t o snap him out of it.  He then yelled at all of us to stay away from the window, and especially don't look into any blue light outside, which we dutifully did.  All this time, my mother was trying to call the police but said the phone wasn't working.  She seemed to be starting to panic.  She then started turning on all the lights and ran downstairs to let our dog out into the backyard.  I guess she thought the dog would scare these things away.  We all then starting yelling at her to close and lock the door, while one of my brothers was insisting on going out and getting the dog back in the house.  Things started getting very panicky - and that's when I woke up with my heart racing.  After I relayed this to my friends and my brother, I saw him turn white and start talking to his girlfriend privately.  I thought he was concerned that I went off the deep end, but the next day they approached me and told me he had had the same dream - down to every detail.  We both got the chills and decided not to talk about it any more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

For some reason we both looked up and observed an egg shaped object that was approx 1,000 - 3,000 feet above moving at an incredible speed toward the south/south west. It went right over our car and reached the horizon in seconds. I only remember this as being a white glowing egg. My father thought he saw red lights in the shape. This craft made no noise and to this date has intrigued me. The only other information I remember is several weeks later there was an article in the local paper about UFO sightings in Michigan. The article detailed accounts of several Michigan Police officers that observed a glowing UFO that hovered over Lake Michigan. I believe the area was the Muskegon, MI area. The article indicated that the last event was on the same night we saw our UFO and that it shot off toward the south west. The time was 10pm EST and I saw my UFO at 9:03pm CST.

This sighting has stuck clearly in my memory for 20+ years although I only occasionally thought about it over the years as you hear about UFOs.  It was a sight where you instantly know this is something extraordinary and not what our brains are used to processing and seeing.  I never really investigated anything more about it over the years because the craft I saw was triangular and I never heard of anyone seeing such a thing.  Until yesterday.  I watched a cable special about the UFO incident in 2000 near St. Louis with the various officer sightings of a black triangular object.  I then checked the internet to see about sightings in Colorado at roughly the same time of mine.  I have goose bumps again to see so many similar sightings from seemingly credible accounts.  My story is brief but it left a permanent record on my mind.  I can't remember the exact date but it was in the early 1980s and I was a passenger in a car with my brother driving.  We were on a small street road near our house and it was daylight and very clear.  As we were driving, I casually glanced at Pikes Peak which occupies a large part of the mountainous view in Colorado Springs.  Near the top (above treeline) and slightly to the right of Pikes Peak was a triangular black object that appeared to be rotating.  It was close to Pikes Peak and probably 5 miles from me - line of sight.  I could tell it was very large given its relative dimension to Pikes Peak just behind it.  Had this been at night I could have dismissed it as any possible craft but being a clear day I was instantly startled as to what this was.  I had a good familiarity with military aircraft with my father in the Air Force and growing up in Colorado Springs near the Air Force Academy.  As I stated, the fact that it was triangular and didn't seem to have any other discernable shape or markings, I was amazed at what this might be.  I immediately told my brother to look and even told him ""stop the car"" and look.  By the time he finished asking ""what is it"" and stopped the car, I watched it disappear at an incredible speed over and behind Pikes Peak.  I never saw it or anything like it again but after reading these accounts I felt I had to add my story to the many accounts listed.  I am shocked to see many accounts even older than mine of similar sightings which indicates it could not have been any kind of experimental military craft.  I hope one day I can find out what it was and solve the mystery. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A friend and I were walking home on a new street built through a dark field between two new subdivisions.  The stars were very visible, so we were looking at them when we noticed a brighter one, very visible, that seemed to be moving in a linear fashion.  It could have been something very normal, but as we watched, a smaller light seemed to emerge from the brighter light, flying straight down from it, then turning at a right angle to continue flying. We thought this was pretty strange, but what happened next still frightens me! My friend yelled at me to turn and look behind us.  We couldn’t believe it, but there was some sort of flat-bottomed craft hovering maybe 30 feet or so above a telephone pole that was about 50 feet away from us!  I remember that it was hovering at just about double the height of the pole.  It was so close that we felt that it must be observing us, since we were the only people out in the deserted field at this hour.  We ducked into the low underbrush beside the street for cover and continued to watch. It surprised me that it was not brightly lit, although it seemed that some sort of soft light might have been coming from the top of the craft, because I could make out the outline of the craft in the dark sky.  It seemed to be a little more that 25 to 30 feet in diameter, which was easy to estimate, given its proximity to both of us and also to the telephone pole.  It had a somewhat oval shape, not quite round.  The lights from our subdivision illuminated the bottom of the craft well enough for me to just make out some sort of protruding cube-like structures on the bottom of the craft, and possibly something that looked like ductwork. Later, I realized that the texture of the bottom resembled the flat top of an apartment building, turned upside down. It hovered for quite some time, and it did have a sort of windy, whistling hum to it, but no engine sounds. We really felt threatened, or at least observed, and continued to hide and decide what we should do, feeling quite panicky. We were frantically taking notes together, blurting out the things that we noticed, confirming that it was really happening.  Finally, the craft started slowly moving at the same low altitude to the east, toward the subdivision where we both lived.  We then felt brave enough to stand up, out of the brush, and follow it on foot, since it seemed to be departing.  We followed for a few seconds, then suddenly it zoomed off at incredible speed, disappearing to the east.  All of this with no increased noise. My friend told me to look to our right just as it left, and we both saw a glowing greenish ball of light, electrical looking, float gently to the ground and disappear just a few feet away from us. I understand why people would be skeptical about many of the sightings reported, but obviously, they have never seen this type of craft at such close range.  It did not behave in any fashion according to the technology that we had in 1981, or even still.  And the other craft, further out in the night sky, were also unexplainable. And then there’s that glowing ball of light. We were both very intelligent honor roll students in the 10th grade at the time, and very credible people who just happened to be in the right (or wrong) place at the right time.

It appeared that these 17 lights were playing, flying toward each other and away at unbelievable speeds.  Other people coming out of the shopping center looked up to see what we were looking at. Everyone freaked out. Since I was an 11 year old, I remember telling my mother that I thought they were angels playing tag.  It was unbelievable. The lights appeared the same as stars but were much large.  I would say they measured about 90-100 feet across flying at 7000 feet.

You may not be interested in something so long ago. My uncle emailed me this site and asked me to send this to you. I had an experience as a young teenager that was quite amazing. My brother and I was at my grandparents small farm playing in the driveway when we seen a large light to the east in the sky approx the distance that you would spot a small aircraft. It was a large and distinct light that stopped us in our tracks to stare. As we stared at the light it slowly made its way to the north not changing distance or altitude. We watched as it made its way from due east to due north. As we continued to stare it started to appear as though it was coming towards us. The light continued to come closer and yet did not change mass but became remarkably close. When the light stopped approaching it was approx 50 yards from where we were standing. It was directly behind a mature pecan tree and the light was as large as the entire tree. It stayed in that position for at least five minutes and then slowly started to back away. As it was backing away it was gaining altitude. When it got back to the distance it was before approaching us it started to go upwards and we watched it disappear into the distance in aprrox 30 seconds. The light did not make any noise nor did it create any shadows or brighten the area around it or where we were. I would guess the experience lasted at least 20 to 30 minutes. We of course told our grandparents and odd enough it took little to convince them of what we had seen. My grandfather told us that his neighbor that lived about 1/4 of a mile to the south had described the exact experience that happened to him only at an earlier date. I have not heard of anyone else having a similar experience in that area or any area for that matter ever since. I of couse have no ideal what it was but maybe you have heard of an experience like this before. I have heard of people sighting things that they could not explain but for something that came that close and was that distinct for! such a long period of time was nothing short of amazing.  I give you my assurance that this was no hoax or made up event. It has been an event that has been discussed amongst my family for over 20 years which is why my uncle asked me to send this to you.

It was an autumn evening with a clear sky. The sun had set about an hour ago when the incident occurred.  My family (my parents and my brother) were having an after-dinner tea time at the balcony of our apartment; and I was in my room.  Our apartment was located at the top of a hill in the city, where the most of the north side of the city was visible from. Then my brother came into my room shouting that there was something strange in the sky. I rushed out to the balcony.  The object was about 5- 8 kilometers away, at an altitude of 1500 - 2000 meters above the city. It was huge.  Comparing with the buildings at that distance, I can say that it was 150-200 meters in diameter.  The object had a very bright silvery metal color. It was self luminous, and a “haze” of bright white light was surrounding it. It’s difficult to describe its shape because of the brightness and the “light” surrounding it. The “haze” was not homogeneous; it had a somewhat patchy appearance, and for short durations of time (5 to 10 seconds), it was possible to see parts of the thing inside. The inside object was roughly egg-shaped, but its shape was constantly changing. The “shell of the egg” was fluctuating like the appearance of the surface of wavy melted metal.  It looked as if something inside, trying to come out, were forcing and deforming the wall. The object had not moved around and stayed still at that location for about 2-3 minutes. Then suddenly something even more strange had happened:  The object had gradually expanded 2-3 times in diameter while its brightness had increased making it difficult to look at it directly, and then it “exploded” without making any noise (in fact, no sound at all could be heard during the whole incident). This event took about 10 seconds.  In a few seconds after the explosion, all the “white – silvery – bright” haze and other things had disappeared, and numerous (about 50 or so of them) spherical objects came out of it.  The spheres were also luminous but not that bright. They had pale neon colors on their surface with a thin layer of “haze”.  The spheres were all identical to each other. They were perfect spheres in shape.  Although it is difficult to make a correct estimate, based on their distance and their altitude, I can say that their diameters were about 20 meters or so. No details (windows, signs, etc.) were seen on their surfaces, except that their ever changing pale neon colors.  Immediately after their appearance, the spheres started to move towards south (towards our location).  They moved horizontally at a constant speed, and did not change direction. Their speed was about twice or three times faster than an airliner. They moved all together at the same speed, side- by-side; but they were not lined up in perfect rows. They did not make any sound at all. They did not leave any trails behind them while they move. They passed over the roof and disappeared from our sight.  Besides us, thousands of people of the city had observed the incident. The incident took place in local newspapers next day. The government agencies explained the incident as “a meteorite passing over the city”.  That spectacular show was the most extraordinary event of my life. Despite after the 30 years passed, and still remembering most of the details, I do not have any explanation of it. It was certainly not a “meteorite”, not even close to it.

After just seeing a show about a UFO sighting in 2000 in Illinois by some guy and 4 police, I have to share this with people who are actually interested in this sort of thing as I’ve always felt I should have documented it some how.   I grew up in south Florida but have lived in another state for over 20 years.  I am a 47 year old professional and I am an outdoor enthusiast. I am in to nature and have always had a keen awareness of my environment and surroundings.  Twenty nine to thirty years ago I saw a huge wedge shaped object fly directly over me in Coral Springs FL.  At a very late hour, 1 AM, 2 AM or somewhere there about, after dropping a friend off, I was east bound on Sample Rd and was stopped at a red light at Coral Hills Dr. Back then, populations were less and there were no other cars on the road.  While sitting at the light, it was like it came out of nowhere but suddenly appeared over the tree tops heading due south at about a block west of University Dr which was one block east. It was so low that a shot from a shotgun would have easily hit it.  It was so long I leaned onto the passenger seat and could see the bottom as it came over, but then sat back up and could still see it on the driver’s side and it moved slow at maybe 30 mph. It probably took at least 30 seconds to pass completely over me. It got about a mile ahead of me by the time the light changed and I could run up and turn south on University. It never seemed to speed up but gradually got further as I kept catching red lights and after several miles, I stopped following and turned around but noticed it appeared to be starting to turn toward Ft Laud airport. That fact has always made me question what I absolutely know I saw.  I have always described it as being as long a football field and wedge shaped. Like on the TV show it was an elongated triangle shape. It had the 3 white lights, one in each corner, and the red flashing light rear of center. It was not black like in the 2000 sighting. It was more gray color and I remember it having what looked like steel plating. It made NO noise what so ever and I don’t remember the lights being overly bright. It was fairly pointed at the front and about as wide as a four lane road with a median. I remember the rear once it passed over was thick or tall (it had huge mass) but I don’t remember it being lit across the rear. It had no wings and the fact that I could hear nothing as it passed over still makes no sense to me.  Another thing that’s always made me question my own eyes was the tree tops didn’t sway or bend what so ever, but as close as it was I’ve always thought there should have been at least a breeze if not wind.  I’ve never stopped having a hard time believing what I saw that night until seeing that show on the 2000 sighting in Illinois.  The descriptions and 3D images were so similar, I got goose bumps while watching and it felt like I was seeing my experience all over again. All these years I’ve wished I would see one again to prove to myself I wasn’t nuts and that TV show was like I was seeing it again. That show ended by noting secret military craft stay secret usually around 10 years. Well, like I said in the beginning, I saw mine 29 to 30 years ago so maybe I did see what I saw.

A fellow parked along side the field in the parking lot asked ""look at the object over there-what is it""?  I looked and said,it's a plane while I served a customer.The next car pulled up for p/u for groceries.The stranger said look,it's not moving-I looked and said -it's a helicopter.I finished the second car and again this fellow bothered me. Again saying look at the lights on it while staying inside his car ? At that moment I had no more customers to serve-so now I had FULL attention of what this fellow was asking about,in what to identify.Clearly,about a little over a mile-directly east bordering Westhill and Scarborough,Ont. -east of Morningside Rd..I could see a wheel of colours rotating clockwise at a very low altitude-just above tree tops.The fellow stayed inside his car,and I put my head down and ran across the field about 200 yds.I then stopped,to look a mile away to the east, with my workplace behind me.I looked and noticed it was gone from where I first saw it.I checked across the sky and looked behind me.I was in shock as I turned to the west.Just above me-off 10 degrees-- about 50 ft.away and 200 ft above in the sky-was a silver craft.I could not believe what I was witnessing at age 18.The description was a silver light bulb/capsule shaped craft.The larger back end facing me,had four distinct colours of light-in sequence blue-green-yellow-red.These lights rotated clockwise -one at a time.Inside the center of the perimeter of these four lights -a slightly larger orangey-yellow light that stayed on.There were no marks on this grayish silver craft-like one mould.This thing had no sound,and appeared 40-50 ft in length.Small end about 10 ft in diameter to the back about 30 ft in diameter.I watched this craft and light for about 15-20 mins.I felt at the time they were time travellers and shouted for them to come down, pointing t! o the gr ound.I felt the word Neanderthal and bone density pop into my mind.I could not await any longer to stand alone-I wanted to get some other witnesses to this marvel.I ran very fast back towards the store.As soon as I reached the edge of the parking lot,I heard a four pitch ""beeping"" sound.I dead stopped and turned around.The craft was moving very slow[5 mph] toward the northwest,and making the beeping sounds.The fellow who brought this to my attention was gone-nowhere.I ran into the store to have a co-worker friend witness this thing.He was unloading a 45 foot trailer of groceries-he could not.I run fast back through the store to go outside again.I screamed for a co-worker who collects grocery carts,to run over here.The craft was about less than a mile northwest of us-still flying very low and beeping.After a minute it was out of sight.This co-worker asked me,""what is it"" ? I replied time travellers! We stayed together and look all around in the skies.After 10 minutes we went back to work.The store would be closing at 10:00pm,as it must have been 9:15pm at that point.Then I heard a whooshing sound directly above moving across to the east.My co-worker friend screamed across the parking lot and say-did you hear that ! I noticed a very low[1000-2000 ft] white trail-east to west -like a jet trail Again we both stood together at the edge of the field and witnessed a bright red and white light.Directly east about 10 miles,high in the sky.We watched the intensity of a red,then bright white shining on and off for a couple of minutes.Then suddenly,it went out and reappered south -near Lake Ontario.The location would be Pickering Ontario-where we watched at out vantage point in location.This light shined brightly on and off a white to red colour for another couple of minutes.Then it was over-but never forgotten of what it was I had witnessed.It is important for me to report this to you David.From 1967-2002 I have seen 9 ufo's in the month of August.But in 2003,all that changed.I had witnessed 16 more sightings start! ing Marc h 3,2003.IN TOTAL OVER 80 SIGHTINGS TO PRESENT**** JULY 2007.I have started to photograph them.

I want to report something that happened to my neighbor and I years ago at our home.  This was in 1977 or 1978 in Kingsport, TN.  We lived near the area airport and we were used to seeing planes day and night (helicopters were rare, however.)   Our houses shared a driveway and we were out at night playing basketball under a street light my parents had put in.  Our houses were situated along the Interstate 81, which ran across the street from our homes, and there was a steep hill behind us which had no homes back in there, just woods and fields. 	While playing, I noticed a regularly flashing red light was travelling from west to east basically parallel to the Interstate very slowly.  I just gave it a casual notice and didn’t even mention it to my neighbor, and went back to playing.  The light disappeared behind trees and hills in the east.  After a few moments, I noticed it coming back in the opposite direction, and it was travelling a little faster.  Again I just took notice, it was a little odd, but nothing to mention.  It went out of sight to our left (west) and I kept playing.  Well, after a short time (maybe 1 minute) it appeared again, moving faster.  This time I showed my neighbor, and we wondered if it might be some kind of helicopter.  This time after it disappeared to our right, we waited for it to return.  It did so, and was moving rather rapidly.  It was still a steadily flashing red light at this point.  We were excited, and ran up into our back yard to see better, because it let us get uphill above the level of our houses.  As the light travelled from right to left along the Interstate this time, you could tell it was getting closer. This last time, it came pretty close, and the flashing light started to look like maybe it was more of a spinning thing.  There was still no noise from it.  It appeared to curve around a large hill at the left edge of our vies, and then it came out from behind that hill.  It seemed to have changed direction and was coming right toward us.  As it got closer, it was definitely a spinning craft (it was late at night, so the shape of it wasn’t visible) but the lights were either a red-lighted strip with black circles spinning fast, or something round with red-lighted portholes or something similar.  It was moving fast, and dipped below the tree line, but still above the hills.  It suddenly dipped down right behind our house.  No sound at all.  The distance it was at would have made noise very noticeable if it were a helicopter, or a plane.  It was probably only 5 or 6 houses down from ours and up in the air barely above the trees. 	My neighbor and I looked at each other, mouths hanging open.  I think we both said “Did you see that?” at the same time.  We ran into the house to tell people.  The family said the TV had been out, just static (we didn’t have cable), for a minute, but was now back on.  They thought I was crazy, of course.  I knew when I ran in the door that no one would ever believe me.  I had seen another UFO behind that hill before, but that would be another entry, I assume.

Remembering my first sighting of a UFO as I boy (which I have just reported that to you), I decided that it was something that I wanted to investigate. The light was still sitting there motionless so I took a chance and went in to get the wife so she could go with me to try and drive to where it was.  We headed out from our north location in town where I had a clear view of the object the whole time. As we approached a 90 degree turn on the road I looked over to the object on my left and watched it move again (slowly)towards the east about 500 yards. By this time I was afraid that driving and keeping my eyes on the object was getting dangerous so i pulled over on this quiet road and shut the engine off to see if I could detect any sound. By this time I was very close to the object,maybe 1/2 to 3/4 mile.  My wife got out with me and we watched and listened. There was no noise whatsoever. I could not make out any form or particular shape. Just very bright.  It moved again slowly and still in an easterly direction. After about another 10 min. It shot very suddenly across some flat land and over to a high ridge which I estimated to be about 7 miles away. While it was near us I estimate that it was less than 1000 ft. When it moved toward the ridge I would estimate its speed at between 5 and 600 m.p.h. As soon as it got to the ridge it slowed and was running along the ridge at an estimated 10 m.p.h. What that made me think was that it had such pre-planned purpose. Knew exactly where it was and where it was going. The only thing that came to mind of what it could possibly be doing there was exploring for minerals. there are a few cattle farms and dairy but little else.  It flew the entie length of the ridge and then zipped at incredible speed at about a 60 degree angle toward the north and was out of sight in a second or less. there again as an ex airforce man and a studend of physics for many years, the only way to make something move that fast and changing direction that fast would be by using what I call differential variation between bodies (stellar)and by controling the variable lines of force of these bodies would allow them to control both the altitude and position.  I also believe that these objects that we see are exploratory vehicles which would be preprogrammed for a mission from a distant object. I think this because I don't believe any living vehicle could withstand the ""G""'s that a body would be subjected to.

I was in the passenger seat of a car headed west on Boughton Road. My mother was driving. I was gazing north, looking at the constellations but not paying special attention. Then I noticed something odd about one of the “airplanes.”  At first glance, it looked like any small aircraft at night: a pair of red & white lights flying low, headed west, roughly parallel with the road. What struck me as odd was its slow speed. In fact, we seemed to be outpacing it. (I believe the speed limit on that road was somewhere around 40-45mph).  It would have been out of view soon, if not for the fact that my mother made a wrong turn, north onto Weber Road. We were headed straight across its path as it continued west. I didn’t say anything, but after a few seconds my mother noticed it too. I remember her asking, “what is that?” over and over, in an increasingly anxious tone. It was only about 20 feet above the ground, and moving so slowly that it just looked completely wrong, as if it shouldn’t be in the air.  We rolled down the windows and killed the radio. I’m not sure why we thought to do this, but we were duly shocked to find that it made no sound. By now we could see the shape of the object, and in a few more seconds it passed directly in front of / above us. We had a clear view through the front windshield of the car.  From the side, it had looked like a very thin wafer with lights front and back. From the bottom it was an equilateral triangle and each of the three sides curved inward. Each of the triangle’s three apexes terminated in a small rectangular “nub” with a light. (It was actually a very elegant-looking shape). The lights were red and white, but I don’t recall if they flashed or alternated in any way. The object itself was pure, unreflective black. My mother and I later disagreed somewhat on the size of the object. She felt that it was about the size of our car (a large sedan), but my impression was that it was slightly smaller – maybe about the size of a dining room table.  I won’t vouch for my memory of what happened next. (Not at a distance of 20 years, to be sure.) But what I remember is this: After it crossed Weber Road in front of us, it stopped in midair, hovered a second, then rapidly dropped several feet. Then it took off at a shallow upward angle, traveling east at a surprisingly fast rate. It was out of sight in a few more seconds.  A few final comments. If you look at a map of the area, you’ll see that the intersection of W. Boughton and N. Weber streets is just northeast of a small airstrip (Clow Airport). I’ve thought about the possibility that we saw a light plane – especially considering the red/white lights. I just can’t completely accept that conclusion based on the evidence of my senses that night.  I should also mention that the terrain in the area was mainly uncultivated fields. I didn't know it at the time, but a stream runs parallel to Boughton Road right along where I estimate the object's flight path was.

I was moving from Houston TX to Metro Detroit MI. I was traveling alone in a huge 26' Ryder Rental Truck while towing my 1985 Cavelier on a tow dolly behind.  I was heading North out of Elizabethtown, KY but was still well South of Lousville, KY on I-65. I saw a State Park sign coming up so I decided to pull over at that exit and just sleep on the shoulder on the side of the road near the highway so I could get an early start with out getting lost in the morning, plus I was not very acclimated with the procedures needed to back this monster mobile up.  Anyway I merged into the exit lane and turned right onto this road (name forgotten).  I proceeded probably a mile or more down this road so I was far enough away to not hear the noise of the occaisonal semi going up the hills on the Interstate.  I pulled off on the right shoulder, went over a hill and stopped near the bottom of the grade.  I engaged the emergency brake and cut the truck motor.  I was smoking a cig and just getting ready lay down on the bench seat and try to get a couple hours sleep before continuing.  Suddenly, I noticed that the interior of the cab was gradually getting lighter.  Mind you, I am out in the middle of nowhere parked by the exterior boundaries of a state park.  Of course I figured it was a car or vehicle of some kind.  Damn if wasn't a vehicle of some kind!  The interior of the truck cab continued to get brighter seeming from behind, but I could not see a vehicle on the road behind me.  The lights go so bright it was kind of freaking me out a little.  I looked out the passenger window and could see some kind of multi-colored lights on what appeared to be some type of flying saucer. I could not see the whole thing, but it was slowing moving over a hill south of me with an approach that seemed to be coming towards me.  I could not take this suspense.  This was a moment when I realized that whatever this was, it was a lot more powerful than I was.  I got out of the truck and stood between the truck and trailer watching this thing approach me.  I made such an effort to hear something as it came closer but I heard not a sound.  Not a single sound.  No wildlife, no bugs, no flying saucer.  But I could see it!  It was not shing a light on me as it was just illuminating the darkness.  It continued to move slowly never varying its speed.  The object appeared to be huge.  My perception was that it was roughly 200 feet across.  I walked to the back of the trailer giving up my false refuge because I really couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The object continued north and went over the next hill seemingly to flew just over the tree tops.  When the lights faded I got back in the truck ane locked the doors. I played the radio for about 5 minutes to help myself calm down.  I decided I really was exhausted even though I had just witnessed an amazing thing.  I turned off the radio, double checked the door locks, and fell asleep.  The next morning about 4:30 I woke up and thought about what I saw.  I actually tried to rationalize that I did not see what I thought I did. I went to start the truck, and the battery was dead.  Last night I only ran the radio for about 5 minutes before I turned it off.  As luck would have it.  I had parked on a slight incline so I release the emergecy brake, put it in neutral and we started rolling downhill.  I pushed in the clutch, put it in 1st and popped the Clutch.  She started right up.  Just coincidence I thought.  I found the entrance to the park further down the road on the right and made a wide U-turn to go back towards I-65 North.  Hours Later I picked up a station from LIMA Ohio that said there had been multiple UFO sightings the night before.  They even gave out a phone number to call if you had seen it. It was probably just their number they were giving out and not an official number, but I was just excited that somebody had seen something last evening and they were describing similar sightings.  I know these areas are 250 miles apart, but it seemed to give my version credability again.  I know it was a UFO because I could not IDENTIFY if. Nor have I seen anything like it since.  I told this story a lot at first, but based on the looks people give you, I very rarely tell it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

We were roasting marshmallows with the grandkids on the beach one night, and the subject of UFO's came up.  My daughter re-capped an incident that I had long since forgotten about, mostly because at that time I was skeptical and didn’t have time to think of such things as UFO's.  This happened about 19 years ago, but I think is worth passing on.  It involved my daughter (16 at the time) and her mother, the location was near Monroe Washington.   Quote:  ""Mom picked me up at the Dairy Queen, where I was working part time during the summer months before school started. It was dusk at the time, we drove up the woods creek road towards home.  As we drove along we saw a bright light ahead and as we neared it and saw what a strange thing we were looking at, Mom pulled our car to a stop, lowered the windows and shut the motor off. We gazed in amazement at what we saw, it was a football shaped craft with several lights from front to back. It was hovering over a dairy farm field, perhaps a hundred feet off the ground, I would guess it was about 30 feet in length. It made no sound at all, we had our windows down and our motor was shut off. After just a few minutes it started moving slowly up the valley (north). Mom started the car and we stayed along with it for about a mile, it then turned to the left (west), increased in speed and shot out of sight like a bullet."" End of quote..  My daughter is and has always been a responsible person, you can take what she says to the bank.

This lightning came in pulses lasting about 5 seconds each, and maybe 10 seconds in-between each. We watched this for 15 to 20 minutes before we were both so freaked out that we went into town to get a hotel room for the night. It is important to realize that both of us seen this thing. Neither of us was drinking, or on any drugs, and even 14 yrs later our individual accounts of what we seen that night are the same. I have searched for similar accounts online, but have so far not been able to find anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

About late July or early August, 1994, my 16 year old daughter had gone to the movies with her boyfriend.  I was in the living room when they returned to the house.  Both children came into the living room with a look of total “terror”.  My daughter ran down the hall to her bedroom and the boyfriend left immediately.  I ran to my daughter who was sobbing and saying, “it was so awful”.  After calming her for a few minutes, I asked what had scared her.  She related she and her boyfriend were waiting for their ride after the movie and went for a walk near the lake.  There was another couple with them who had gone ahead and were sitting on a dock nearby.  Next, she said, she “felt” something next to her and looked to see a very small object which was “flying” next to them.  She said it startled them and the object immediately flew from their sides and became very large, hovering, silently barely above the tree tops. She said it had blue lights which were above it.  She said the total silence and speed of the object’s departure had terrified her.  I had her make a drawing to the best of her recollection about the object she saw.  She made several drawings, and she finally settled on a drawing that looked similar to a butterfly, basically two triangles with a central area much like a cigar.  I phoned a UFO center that evening and was told there had been many sightings that particular night from the Moses Lake area.  A few weeks later, there was a tv program about UFO sightings and one of the pictures looked almost identical to my daughter’s drawing.

The object was noticed approaching sundown as it flashed reflected sunlight brilliantly like a mirror.  It didn't flash again but appeared to be a reflective, metallic, egg shaped object hovering to the south over Washington D.C. or Chevy Chase, MD.  It first appeared similar to a blimp, but had no markings, tail surfaces, flaps, openings, windows, lights, rivets or other surface details.  It moved silently and left no contrail.   Kensington is at a higher elevation than Washington but it was difficult to judge the size, distance and height of the object.  It appeared to be at about 20 degrees elevation from the horizon and disappeared at perhaps 60 degrees from horizon. The object moved very slowly to the west parallel to the ground for several minutes, and after angling upwards 45 or 50 degrees it began to ascend rapidly and in 15 or 20 seconds it became a tiny point of light in the dark blue sky before disappearing.  Its upward movement was of continuous and rapid acceleration at several times the speed of a conventional aircraft.  As it moved the object's apparent shape changed from egg-like to a flattish ellipsoid,  more specifically a symmetrical convex lenticular cross section top-to-bottom, a slightly elongated ellipse along it length, the narrower part of which was its rear. The object was also seen by my wife and neighbors. Note:  This is an amended version of a report submitted to NICAP by my now deceased father.  I recall hearing there were many other witnesses and hope to prompt a response from one. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

We pulled into the drive of the house in which we lived at the time, in the same way we always did. Soon we were on our way to the porch, headed for the front door, when I heard my mother exclaim ""Look, what's that in the sky over the neighbor's house?"".  My father, who was very fatigued, first scoffed at the notion, but then, as he was about to say something, he was cut short by awe, and fell silent for a moment.  A second later, I heard him murmur ""I don't know what that is...""  I knew my father was not one to be surprised, so I took a look as well.  When I turned, I saw something that bewilders me to this day.  The object was shaped like the planet Saturn, however both the 'ring' and the sphere were one piece.  The peculiar craft spun in a jerky fashion, and the color was a soft luminous green, similar to that seen on glow-in-the-dark toys and LED clock screens.  The object came from the north, and was moving in a southward direction.  The craft made no discernible noise. We watched the craft for 3-4 minutes until it changed course, seemingly veering west, until it seemed to ascend and disappear from view.   After the incident, we went inside and we all discussed the bizarre occurrence for a few minutes, until my mother said ""it's bedtime"", which prompted me to go upstairs, where I drifted slowly to sleep.  Thus ends the odd affair, something I will not soon forget, and something that I hope can help prove what I know is true, the fact that there is life in this universe aside from our own.

The time was 5:40 a.m. I looked out my bedroom window, that looks out to the East, and saw a huge bright yellow light, that was hanging in the sky.  The light wasen't moving,so I grabbed my digital camera, that also takes videos. My bedroom, is on the second floor, so I could see this bright yellow light very well.  The distance was very hard to determine,I put it just in front of the mountains.  I don't have a tripod,so as you know, it's very hard to capture something in the night sky.  The craft started moving, and I said to myself ""come this way.""  I was surprised, it did come my way, straight towards me,  that's when I started to video this bright light.  The digital camera I have, doesn't give me the greatest quality, but, as  you can see, there is something there in this video. As I videoed this craft flying towards me, I took the camera away from my eye, to see just how far away this craft was,I was shocked to see it was almost to my house.  This story sounds hard to believe, but, it's definitely is the truth. I'm sorry I had the screen on the bathroom window, because, when I took the pictures of this craft, flying over my head, the flash on the camera was set on automatic, so it went off, and it left me with a picture of the screen,and the reflection of the flash.  But, I did manage to get a good picture of it, from my bedroom window, which also shows smaller white objects attached to it.  The video is also empressing.  This craft was silent, except for a very low rumbling, or roaring sound., and the size had to be at least 100 feet in lenght,and at least 150 to 200 feet wide across the back.  It was pitch black,so it does make the size hard to determine.  If anything, it might have been larger.  When this ""FANTASTIC"" craft, flew over my house and yard, I saw that the tip of this craft, came to a sharp point, and, was not rounded. There were large circular lights on the bottom, that started from just behind the nose, then ran horizontally, across the bottom.  There were 3 or 4 rows of these circular lights. The colour of the lights were of a dim off white, with a tinge of yellow.  There was also, a tiny green light,thatI noticed just off to the right side of the craft,but it didn't look like it was attached to it. There appeared to be a black void between the craft, and this small green light.  The lights didn't reflect off the bottom,they looked like they might have been recessed,and I could see what appeared to be something, that looked like grill work, or something, that looked like that over the lights. This huge craft crossed the street, and headed West,and as slow as it was traveling, which I failed to mention,was about 25 to 30 miles per hr. ""IMAGINE THAT?"" What was also incredible, was how it banked to the left to go South, without slowing down, or speeding up.  It was as if it pivoted on the left tip, and came round,so that the front of the craft moved to the South. It continued to fly South, over the top of the high hill, across the street from me. I lost sight of it, as it past behind a tall tree that is in my yard, but I could still see the lights that showen through that tree, as it continued traveling South, until it was completley out of my sight.

I had eaten pizza at one of my favorite places about an hour prior, so I wasn't having low blood sugar or anything like that.  I have no know medical conditions (i.e. macular degeneration, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.) that could possible account for my observation.  I hadn't had any alcohol, nor any other drug (prescription/recreational) substance, nor do I have a history of using any such substance.  I don't wear corrective lenses and I have really good night vision. I am alert & orientated as to person, place, and time.  I believe this statement is given to the best of my knowledge and of my own free will, without seeking any personal gains.  I feel strongly enough about my experience as to overcome any and all concerns / reprocussions that might arise out of my making this statement.  And, I had washed my car earlier that day so the windshild was unobstructed! I was proceeding East bound on Route 52E just prior to the Regents road off ramp.    I could see military planes in the pattern at Miramar Air Station. I noticed a white light at approximately 2 O'clock middle (not high or low).  The light appeared to be between me and Miramar.  Initially the light appeared to be stationary and looked like a star and then it took off and I saw it start to accelerate at an incredibly fast rate of speed until it was out of sight.  All this happened in less than a second.  I was flabbergasted and I had to pull over to the right shoulder and come to a stop just prior to the exit sign.  I have taken three semmesters of Calculus based college Physics and I am familiar with Newtonian mechanics as well as optics, and I have taken the Nikon school of photography.  I am a primary health care provider.  Prior to this sightening I was a disbeliever in UFO's.  I've seen numerous shooting stars, I am familiar with the F-18 Hornet, F-14's, F-15's and numerous other Fighter & civilian plane/jet flight characteristics.  I've seen missle test flights, and NASA rocket launches.  I solomonly sware that I can't account for this visual sightening based on any of my life's experiences.  It wasn't an optical illusion or reflection or something that can be explained on my perspective in relation to its course of motion.  And, it was traveling at such a high rate of speed that I can't even conceive of anything going that fast!!!  I don't know if it is a space ship or whatever it is but I can tell you that it had enough of an impact on me to motivate me to make this report which I wouldn't ordinarily do unless I think it was pretty significant!  Because it went from a stand still to an acceleration it is difficult for me to explain its flight characteristics as a natural phenomen.  I would say that it is a UFO.  The was no visible trail nor any sound coming from it that I could hear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was between December 07 and January 08 around 6pm. After “Murr Tower” we were crossing the Ring highway that gets us to Ashrafieh from Hamra. I was sitting in the front next to the driver and another passenger a young woman (around 26 yrs old) was sitting behind me at the back-seat. As we were crossing that highway I saw a motionless light-ball in front of us about 200-250 high and about 200 meters ahead. Let me point something here: Since a similar sighting of a couple of years earlier, I keep gazing in the sky when I’m in a car with someone. It was about the same timing but for a longer time, me and my brother were stuck in heavy traffic between Carantina and Dora when we noticed two still orangey Light-balls ahead of us in traffic about 250-300 meters above the horizon but looked much farther, about a km or a little less. We pointed and some people in close-by cars noticed them too. We kept guessing if it could possibly be artificial lighting over a high building or a road light but it sure wasn’t. The pair were too high above the horizon and after a while one moved towards the other and they started moving up and down and left and right in short sharp swift manner which exclude the possibility of a normal helicopter, they were too fast and froze too quickly when they stopped. Let me get back now this late sighting of last year, here it was motionless and grabbed my attention and excitement clearly so I showed it to the driver and then the girl at the back, they were both amazed by the strange nature of a frozen motionless glittering fire ball in the sky, it looked small but appeared like a ball not a point and felt too close. By the time the taxi driver had the chance to pull over on the right side of the highway we became exactly underneath it. The three of us got our heads out of the windows and looked at it from beneath. I remember the girl sayi! ng “we’r e exactly under it now, please move forward before something falls down on us!”. My best guess is that it was 200-300 meters above us now, looked 2x larger than before, fiery orange to yellow light sphere. The second the driver stepped on the gas and moved forward it gradually but rapidly darted straight towards the opposite way we were heading and that is towards Ras-Beirut (Hamra) gaining ultra speed. I kept my head out and my eyes pointed at the thing, as it first accelerated when the car was about to move, it started glittering and then as it gained speed it started blinking more, as it sped very fast reaching probably the shoreline over “Manara” it blinked faintly and disappeared. The time it took from acceleration to disappearance is no more than 4 seconds. The three of us were startled with what we saw and guessed that it might be some advanced Israeli unmanned reconnaissance droid which I doubt it because why does it shine so bright if it’s supposed to be sneaking discretely for sound or image?

Unfortunately, I had on earphones listening to my mp3 player so I did not hear any sound coming from the object, however, even at my usual volume I can hear autos and small planes. I heard nothing during my viewing. The object was heading due East (flying west to east). What immediately caught my eye was that it appeared transparent, it was a starry evening, relatively clear, and it looked like the stars were reflecting from the bottom of the object. I saw no lights whatsoever so I knew this was no a civilian or possibly even military aircraft. Size wise, I would say it was about as big as a small private plane. Oddly, the most striking resemblance I can compare it to is the wingshaped B2 bomber. It had a dome cockpit type area and wings that had cut outs similiar to the B2. This object was much smaller. I did not see any lights until it was almost out of sight and it appeared that above the edges of the wing tips there were circular housing that emitted a bright, glowing red light. Again, above, not below like a normal aircraft. I would estimate it's speed at approx. 150-200mph.(I do that having been to many air shows and observing other aricraft over the years.

I was heading west, and the object seemed to be moving in a south-easterly direction. At first I thought it was a radio tower or something similar, but I soon realized that the lights were moving very slowly. As I came closer to the object I could see that it was cross-shaped and very thin and flat. It seemed to have triangular pieces connecting the wings to the tail. There were several red and blue lights along these connecting pieces, and they flashed on and off in a chasing pattern. The craft also had white lights on the nose, tail, and wings. It seemed to be about the size of a small one or two person plane. The craft moved very slowly and seemed to drift from side to side as it flew. At one point it began moving in small circles. 	After a few minutes the object stopped in midair, and it seemed that one of the wings detached itself from the rest of the craft and drifted away from it as if it were a smaller pod or shuttle craft. It had only one single white light on it. This smaller craft hovered near the main object for a moment, and then both crafts began moving away in the same direction. I do not know if they parted ways later, as they were now flying away from my car and I did not feel safe stopping to watch them as I was alone and in a bad part of town.

We were passing through Sugarcreek on our way to Bellbrook (my home town) when we saw the strangest aircraft in the sky.   It was large, black and triangular with one white light on each point.  It seemed to be hovering nearby.  It made an odd humming noise and was able to move very slowly.   We pulled over to watch it and two others appeared in the distance, moving incredibly fast and moving in ways that you would not expect of an aircraft.  In fact, their movements struck me as being completely unnatural.   Even now I cannot conceive of how anything man-made could move in such a way. I looked at the clock. It said 1:40 am. There was no mechanical interference and we didn’t lose time.

The time was about 10-15 minutes before our scheduled landing time of 7:52 PM, which would make it around 7:30-7:45 PM. We were flying over land that was spotted with some bodies of water. I was sitting on a window seat on the left side of the plane so I assume I was looking south. Here is a picture I found on the net that is similar to the view I had:  http://www.factionfive.com/blight/uploaded_images/DSC02804-771617.JPG. I would guess we were about 10,000 feet high, but perhaps someone more knowledgeable can estimate the height given the information above.  I was admiring the view when I noticed a light that was noticeably brighter than the other city lights coming from an object above a small body of water (like a small lake).  The shape appeared to be a sphere but I can't be sure as it was far away.  It was unusual enough to keep my attention. The light was a bright yellowish white but seemed to change to a bluish white and did not blink. It was moving very slowly so at first I thought it could be a helicopter. After observing it for about 30 seconds I felt it was not a helicopter and was definitely not a plane. What happened next is why I think it is worth reporting as a UFO; the object started to accelerate at a geometric rate. It quickly sped up and flew up towards the plane and passed below and in front of us in about 2-3 seconds. If I had to guess, I would say the object was 15,000 feet away when I first saw it over the lake and it came within 2000 feet of the plane when it passed under and front of my view. I may have the absolute distances wrong but the relative distance (2000:15000) is about correct.  The point is the object appeared to accelerate from almost nothing to beyond 1000 mph in about 2 seconds.  It happened so quickly and I was in disbelief by what I saw. I looked around at the other passengers hoping that someone else saw it but no one appeared to have. I recall a red glow on the lower half of the object but I am not confident about this particular detail (this happened over 3 months ago) but the rest I am confident of what I saw. I have never reported a UFO before. I would like to know if anyone else saw this.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

The first time I saw the large orange sphere I was with my son doing the Sunday morning paper route, which was very large.  The reason I remember the approximate date so well was when we got home I sat down to read the Sunday paper and there was a report of a John David Gosch that had disappeared while doing his paper route.  All that was left was his red wagon on the corner where he was last seen.  My son held two paper routes, both weekly and Sunday and since the weekly route was a small paper, he usually ran his weekly paper route with just the dog along.  When I read about the Gosch boy, my son never went on any paper route alone again.  My son stopped and bent down to tie a shoe lace and as I turned to my right, this huge orange ball came from behind us, straight through the sky and gracefully went down somewhere behind one of the houses that Frank Lloyd Wright built.  I say gracefully because there was no sound, no tree tops blowing in the wind - it just floated straight and fast.  Naturally, by the time I grabbed my son by the back of his shirt and said ""did you see that"".  He had missed the whole thing.  The second time I didn't see the orange ball, but I know it was there. I was sitting out on my deck, actually I sleep outside all summer when it's not raining and is warm enough.  It was probably about 11:30 pm and I was still sitting up watching the stars, etc., when a light came over my deck.  Like a strobe light actually.  The back end of my deck, looking north is about four foot off of the ground and there is a railing around the deck.  This light hit the top of the back railing and moved down across my deck, up to and over me.  I was facing the light and was sitting back almost to the wall if my house so I could see the big dipper.  All of a sudden it was like I was in broad daylight.  I leaned forward and looked to both sides trying to see where the light was coming from.  I thought someone had put up some kind of new yard light or something.  As I looked around I saw that no else’s back yard was lit up and the light was just around me.  It didn’t even cover my whole deck.  After about 4-5 minutes the light crawled back across my deck and disappeared so I just forgot about it.  The next night, Saturday at about the same time the light came back.  This time I got up out of my chair and went over to the back railing so I could look up over the house.  There was the big orange globe.  I was standing in daylight, literally, the light was so bright, but you couldn’t see a stream of light coming from the globe.  There were no blinking lights or anything.  It was absolutely motionless.  I stood their staring at it for about 4 minutes, at least it seemed that long.  I did notice Mars behind and to the left of the globe.  It was much farther up and not nearly as large so I do know it wasn’t Mars.  It didn’t seem to be perfectly smooth because I could see brownish (like indents) marks all over it.  There were no windows or anything and you couldn’t see where the light was coming from.  I really had the feeling that I was being watched.  I live in a regular ranch style house and that thing was bigger than my house.  It’s hard to judge distances but it looked like it was right on the other side of my house.  I remember getting a little aggravated because it didn’t do any thing and I said “for heaven’s sake say something or come down here and say something”.  Don’t just sit there!  I went over to my chair to grab a cigarette and when I returned to watch it again, it was gone.  There was no sign of it.  Not shooting off through the sky – nothing.  Once again, no sound, no trees blowing in the breeze – just gone.  When talking to my sister who still lives in Iowa, she said she had seen the orange globe almost two years earlier.  Now, I do have a huge imagination but my sister does not.  She said she was sitting outside on her back porch after dark and this bright globe looked like it came up out of the ground and rose just above the tree tops, then just sat there.  She went to get her husband to see and by the time she turned around it was gone.  Note Characteristics:  I checked emitted beams because I was bathed in a circle of light, and The object landed because I know the first time I saw it - it went down but it's more like it went into the earth.

We were having our annual family reunion that weekend. It was the girls turn to camp out in the backyard.  I'd never slept on the ground before.  So, I couldn't sleep, but my cousins sure could.   Anyway, after awhile lying awake in the tent, I heard a low droning sound.  Sort of like a low droning hum.  Had I been asleep I probably would not have heard it.  I got up and went outside of the tent and looking up through the young pine tree (I wasn't coming out from under it) and above dad's storage barn, I saw an object just above the larger trees.  It was disk shaped and had colored lights on the bottom.  It wasn't moving very fast.   Going back into the tent I tried to wake my cousins, without sucess.  I went back outside the tent and watched the object move slow and steady in a ENE direction.  I went back into the tent obviously scared and was finally able to waken my cousins. They had no idea what I was trying to tell them.  I know I must have scared them too because I remember us all running toward my grandmother's mobile home (she lived behind our house then).  But, my mother met us at the back door of our house.   The electricity went out and we ran as fast as we could to get inside. The lights were out only a few minutes.   Needless to say we all slept on the floor inside after that.  It has bothered me that I was the only one to see it.   Since that night when I've asked my mother what woke her up, she always say the she just got up and the lights went out and she knew she needed to open the door for us.   I've never reported this to any organization or any person outside my family.  But, I'll always be curious about what I saw that night and wonder if there will ever be an explanation.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,30.2311,-94.2066

Early 80""s It happen so long ago in the early eighties i'm not too sure about the year or day... but I'll never forget what I saw.  One of my friends had some girl cousins that came over for the summer.  We really didnt have many girls on my block so we decided to make the best of it and play a game called ""catch & kisses"".  On my block was a school CS 77 and we were all in the school yard chasing each other... well as I was being chased or chasing one of the girls from the small yard where your closed in (the school is a U shape and the small yard is in the U"") into the big yard were it's out in the open... I  saw what appeared to be a huge fire ball.  I remember a few of us kids stopped dead in our tracks.   I was coming out the small yard which was on the Manor Ave side of the school and I was Running into the big yard  which allowed you to look from Manor ave to Ward Ave.  I was facing Ward Ave which was west and saw the fire ball coming from that direction.  It appeared to fly right above us.  It seemed to be flying really low.  You could hear this fire ball.  It sounded.... well like what you would expect a fireball to sound like... i guess..... I've never heard anything like that before.   And you could almost feel this thing as it passed over us.  It flew right over us east bound,  but once it pass over it disappeared from our sights because of a 6 story building on the corner of 172nd St. and Manor ave. We all started running around tripping out and asking each other if we saw the same thing.  Oddly enough we really didnt make a big deal about it.... we all thought it was a meteor or comet.... and every couple of years it would be talked about as a weird unexplainable occurance. It wasnt until I got older that i started thinking UFO. This fire ball was or appeared to be flying really low... so low that a building only 6 stories block our view immediatly after it passed over us.  Also, this thing should have crashed.... exploded or somthing. there is no way somthing that was close enough to hear and feel.... like you feel when a plane is flying low..... didnt impact. and if it was a comet or somthing.... wouldnt the news report such a thing?

SOMETHING AIRBORNE HIT & DAMAGED OUR U-HAUL,Bowling Green,KY,1984-06-01T13:00:00,unknown,20 - Minutes,"Occurred : 6/1/1984 13:00  (Entered as : 1984 13:00) Reported: 12/19/2006 7:51:37 PM 19:51 Posted: 2/1/2007 Location: Bowling Green, KY Shape: Unknown Duration:20 - Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54080.html,"SOMETHING AIRBORNE HIT & DAMAGED OUR U-HAUL My story is a very strange one, and I have not told many people about this.  We decided to keep quiet about this incident back then because of being fired, or people thinking that we were responsible in some way - as will be explained.  They may have thought that we were seeing things or drinking, but we were doing neither.   As far as seeing a UFO or such, we didn't.  Yet, my co-worker and I did encounter something very strange and unexplainable indeed.  This is a TRUE story, and my previous co-worker can verify my story if he ever decided to come forward.  I still to this day cannot understand what happened to us that day back in 1984 etc.   The day began as I was working for Wal-Mart in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The day was clear, warm, and beautiful.  It was a busy time of the year, and we were using U-Haul rental trucks to transport merchandise from our warehouse to our main store.   One day my co-worker and I were again sent out to get some more merchandise from our warehouse sometime after noon.  The warehouse was located across town from where our main store was located - about seven miles.  I was driving a large U-Haul truck, and was driving carefully.   Everything was going well until we came to the four-way intersection on the Nashville Road from Campbell Lane.  I stopped at the intersection red light, and then proceeded to turn right onto the Nashville Road.  We pulled up a bit and proceeded to drive the short distance left to our destination when something really powerful and large hit our U-Haul.  Whatever it was hit us so hard it literally made us jerk sideways, and it made a loud metal crashing noise.   After gathering our senses I put on the flashing emergency red lights and we got out to see what had happened.  We both thought that somebody had hit us in the back end of our truck.  Yet, when we looked around there was not any vehicle anywhere that had hit us - nothing.   We would have seen a vehicle pass us while we were inside the truck, but this was not the case either.  Nobody else (traffic) seemed to have seen anyone hit us, or anything unusual, either.   Now confused and puzzled, we decided to look for damage to the U-Haul, and this is where the real strangeness comes to play.  When we went to the right passenger side of the truck there was some severe damage to the truck, but it was near the very ""TOP"" side of the vehicle.  My co-worker and I were completely stunned and speechless.   A severe dent about eight feet long and two feet deep was plainly visable on the truck near the top.  This was the passenger side that no traffic at all could have been near to because there was no road there - just a school yard.  Whatever had hit the upper part of the U-Haul had to have been airborne!   The damage to the truck was extensive, highly visable, and not there when we had began our trip that afternoon.  The truck was checked before we had left the store.  Whatever hit the truck had to have been airborne, and very big and slanted to make a deep dent like that.  The damaged looked like what a disk would make if it hit metal.   We didn't know what to do, and feared that we would be held liable for the damage.  We feared for our jobs too.  After all, who would possibly believe such a story as this?  How could we logically explain this?   After a while of talking we both decided to keep quiet about this because we felt we had to.  Nothing was ever mentioned to us about the damaged U-Haul either when we got back to our store, and we felt that was odd, too.   I can tell you absolutely that somthing very large, airborne, and powerful struck our U-Haul truck that day.   Whatever it was had to have been flying at tree-top level and grazed our truck.  Yet, we never saw the craft or whatever it was.   This story is absolutely true and accurate.  I have no idea of how to give you any kind of sensible explaination for this.  We were attacked or hit by something strange though.  Strange stuff!   Thank you for your website and interest.

I was making a Snow hole when a friend of mine shouted towards me to look over the Tree Line as we were digging in inside the woods.  When I looked up I say this disc shape craft that gave off a brilliant white light from its under carrige- evryone stopped what they were doing and we just sat their in ore of this amazing craft, minutes later a second craft same as the first came in to view from the same direction as the 1st -over the tops of the trees. Their was 12 of us just standing quite in ore of these craft that gave off no noise and no fumes of any discription, I walked forward from my snow hole for about 80ft and the 1st craft gave off this brilliant white light that shot straight down from its under carrige to the ground were we all stood looking up.  The next thing I remember is being back in my snow Hole with my friend and it was 3 hrs later than when we had been looking outside-which only felt like 5 minutes a go.  I am now out of the Marines,  myself and a few of the guys who witnessed this evenyt still talk about are visit from God only knows and are time loss///? now comes the Good bit...we were picked up 1hr later from Helicopters and taking back to camp -everyone  of us still in disbelieve at what had just taking place ? I mean here we are 12 normal guys just digging snow holes on a Exercise for the Military and the next thing we no we are all carted off in to a office with Generals and What I can only think of as Goverment agents-they stood at the back not saying much but every now and then nodding their heads in agreement.  It didnt feel write from the moment I stepped inside the office-? OK my head was in bits because one minute I am digging a snow hole and the next I am picked up by helicopter and whisked away to an office full of generals and God only knows who else was in the room, but I was feeling a little at ease. They asked all sorts of questions and at the end of it all made all of us sign a form saying it was a Satellite falling to earth -I mean why go to all that bother to prove something that even today I dont even no myself what the hell happened.

Soccer-ball-sized craft that I could see thru much like a dandelion flower seeds just before you blow them.  It was made like a lot of spikes in two heights, though, and if I had not been looking in that exact spot at that exact time, I would never have seen it.  It was outside the window that overlooks the space between our building and the next, a width of about 5 feet betweein the two buildings.  The day was overcast but it was light outside.  No country, or group of countries could have made this object.  I heard it make no sound but, then, it was outside the window, and it appears to use the air as a stepping stone and it glided toward the window as I happened to look that direction.  It stopped, pivoted once, paused, pivoted again, and left quickly in the direction from which it came.  The best way I can describe seeing it is like seeing Predator, wherein one can look directly at it and not see it unless it moves.  And if you are looking a few feet to the side of it, one would not see it probably.  It was too small to have occupants since it was about 10 to 12 inches in diameter and a portion of that diameter seemed to be made of spikes, but you can see thru it.  It moved ""with purpose"", though, and could not have been some eye phenomenon because I saw it pivot twice.  I only saw it once, and have never heard of anyone quite describe what I saw, or at least I do not know of anyone whose description matches mine.  I did see a fairly similar depiction of my craft, but is was all black in the book, and there was no additional informaton.  I think a good description of the basic shape is that of certain pollen when viewed with an electron microscope, but that would be shape only.  The color is like a crystal that reflects the colors of the overcast sky at daytime.  It did not emit lights or beams, left no trail, and did not land or make any sound.  There were no lights on the object, no aura or haze around it.  It did not change colors any more than a series of crystals would.  There was no aircraft in its vicinity, and it had no noticeable affect on any equipment in my livingroom where I was when I saw it.  I do not have pictures of it.  My sense is that it was a probe of some sort, gathering information of some sort, and it may have taken a picture perhaps on the first pivot.  Who knows?  It is just a guess...

I was a front seat passenger and noticed a very bright light about 30 degrees off the treeline to the S/E. It appeared to be several miles off, but I commented something about a helicopter. The driver looked in the direction I mentioned and we both saw it move with lightening speed maintaining the same latitude, across the windsheild and stop about the same distance in the N/E direction. This occured West of Pouquague approximately. We were both pretty amazed, but chalked it off as to just one of those things.  We were traveling a short cut across what we referred to as East Mountain Road to reach our destination of Wingdale, New York. At the top of this mountain, there is a farm on a plateau. On the N side of the road, the main house sits about 100 ft. from the road. Directly across is a barn and some out buildings ( a barn mainly) that sits directly off a 15 foot shoulder.  As we reached the top of the hill, we noticed a large illuminated object hovering beside the house. initially, it appeared to be amorphorus. Undefined, but brilliant. The base of the object appeared to be off the ground but level with the second story of the house. The top of the object faded into the haze so we had no idea where the top of the object ended. It was very close to the house which gave us a little perspective. It was at least 5 times the size of this 2 story farm house. While it was not touching the ground, it seemed ""at rest"" hovering beside the house and remained there.  I told the driver to turn off the headlights as we grew closer, and instructed him to pull onto the shoulder by the barn so we could take it all in. He turned off the motor and  we just stared. We were both terrified at the scale of this object. The top of the mountain was very dark. There were no lights coming from either the house or the out buildings. There was no moonlight and it was slightly hazy.  We sat there for about 15 minutes. There was no noise except for a very low frequency the I can only describe as ""feeling"" the sound rather than hearing it.  At this point, my friend decided he was going to get out of the car and investigate it closer. He opened the door and started to get out when the noise because more audible. I panicked, and literally tore the sleeve from his shirt to restrain him from getting out of the vehicle. I turned the key and started the car motor and told him to drive. I also told him to leave the lights off until we began our descent down the other side of the plateau, which we did. We were both so frightened we wanted leave quickly, but it was like groping for a light switch in the dark.  The East Montain Road is very steep and there are several hairpin turns. The mountain pass runs parallel to a deep ravine. From some places on the road, you cannot see the bottom of the ravine (in daylight) and as we were heading down, shortly after we turned on the headlights again, I noticed something glinting in the ravine below. The reflective(?) object was not stationary and seemed to be traveling slightly ahead of us but with us. It was shiny, and traveling like a bullet, only sideways. We were going to try to find a place to pull over again, to let it move on when it seemed to shoot down the ravine on an S shaped course and disappeared. In a S/E direction very similar to the object we saw initially on Rt. 55. This however was NOT the object we saw by the house. These were, in my opinion, two different objects.  We vowed never to discuss this with anyone because of the stigma attached. We were both New York State officials at the time. I honestly don't know why I'm reporting this now, so many years later, but I am still stunned by it to this day when I think about it, and at least I have it off my chest.

I don’t even know the date, but it must have been from say early October, or until the end of march.  The reason I say this, is because my best friend and I had gone to watch NC State play basketball.  So it was definitely during basketball season.  The year was 1985, or 1986.   The only reason I’m reporting it, is because I see others who have seen similar objects.  I’ve (We’ve) kept it to ourselves all these years.  Oh, we have mentioned it to a few people, but you can imagine what kind of ribbing we took. Anyway, it was after the ball game, and that would have been between 9 and 12 pm depending on what time the game was.  I really don’t remember if it was a 7:00 game or an 9:00 game.   We were on our way back home on 50 highway from Raleigh towards Benson.   We were driving in a small pickup when we noticed a huge black object to our left.  It was really low, if I had to guess, I would say maybe 600 feet or less.  I would guess the object to be at least as long as a football field.     We pulled over and both of us opened our doors, got out, and looked up as this huge triangular object passed over us.  It was solid black, with no discernable lights except for the very tip of the triangle.  The other thing worth mentioning, is that it was slowly rotating as it moved.   Well we stood there and watched this object move from the left to directly overhead moving to the right of us.  Since we were on 50 south, that would have been East to West.   As we looked up, we were both in awe.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  Completely silent.  I think that was the eeriest part of the whole thing.  How could something that huge fly the way it was flying, and make not a bit of sound.   We tried to follow it somewhat, but because it was so low to the ground, it was out of sight in less than 2 minutes. Gone behind the treeline. We’ve often discussed it between ourselves, but not made too many waves.  We never heard anything else, and we figured something that big would have had to be seen and reported by other people.  I know what I saw, and I’ve watched a lot of shows about our military, and never never have seen an aircraft like what I just described.  I’m pretty sure the stealth was not out at that time, but even if it was, it did not fly in the manner with which I witnessed that night.   My main reason for posting this, was to see maybe, just maybe someone else saw the same thing my friend and I did, and about that same time frame.  It would validate my experience somewhat and verify that I was not crazy!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Reading some of the recent events reminded me of it.   I was walking down the street and off to the west, toward the mountains I saw the large glowing blue spherical objects arc across the sky and then vanish.  They flew in-line with one another, like a traffic light, just straight up and down.  They just appeared, and followed, almost like a rainbow pattern and then vanished.   The lights remained solid the entire time, they did not flicker and they did not make any sound.  I would approximate the distance to have been at a minimum of 3 miles away, and still they were very large.  A few moments later, another individual came out of her house and said she saw them as well.

Driving S/B on CA 1, sunset at 100degrees over my right shoulder, just at the N.Laguna beach across from the Irvine ranch open range, above the far hills to the S.E. I noticed a spot of black growing larger until it was directly above the trees of the hilltops I could see from the S/B right lane.  I thought it might be a helicoper ranching, but it was not.  It was metallic silver and panshaped on the bottom rounded top disc. No lights that i noticed in the sunshine reflecting off of it; it was very clearly a disc.  When above the treeline it seemed to force the trees to bend away from the craft as it approched and the tree tops just brushed underneith lower at center and finally swayed when the tops left the area around the ship.  As if the ship had a strong and large area of space that displaced the matter of our world.  This effect was at least as wide as the entire ship and maybe as much as 2 X the width of the ships appearance.  It seemed to be heading directly toward me after it's traversing the hilltop in a N.W. travel that was aproxamately 3 miles distance and from where i was 2 miles away toward the N.E.  When it was directly East it traveled toward the Sun right over my moving vehicle.  Before it got to the road it filled my windshild by about 15 percent so it was very close and slowed hovering there.  I thought to myself and to anyone capable of perceiving my thoughts these words/thoughts.  ""I will never belive what I am seeing if You do not do something out of the ordinary with your craft.  Please, show me a manuver other than this to be sure I understand You wish me to see this.""  At that momment the ship moved to flatten the bottom of the craft so that I could witness the entire bottom of the pie pan shape exposed flatly and now encompassing 1/4 of the windshield.  It was round perfectly circular with the lower flat portion appearing as a smaller circle inside it.  It proceeded to float like a leaf falling from a tree, with a regular back and forth flutter of side to side fl! ipping m otion without changing it's slow steady pace or speed Westward over the car which suddenly affected the radio transmission as a white noise garble, and causing a bit of a studder to the sound of the engine of the car.  The car did not stop, but i was slowed to about 40mph from a 70mph pace by this time.     I noticed the disc in my window as a speck in the rear right side window traveling under the sun toward the horizon exactly to the West out to the Pacific Ocean and disappeared from sight in about 2 seconds from the passing above the roof of my automobile out of my sight to the resighting of it toward its' vanishing point in the Western distance.

Rainier National Park, WA Shape: Unknown Duration:6 Hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57715.html,"FIRST TIME REPORTED Late November, 1978 Mt Rainier National Park & Ashford.  Double Sighting, 6 Hours   Over the last three decades, I have debated within myself, as to whether or not I should report the following incident: I experienced the following beginning late November 1978, Mt. Rainier National Park,  Longmire Wilderness Center, Snow Camping with two other individuals.  We arrived at Longmire within Mt. Rainier National Park, in the late afternoon.  Their was substantial snow fall which blocked our access to continueing up the Mountain via Hwy 706..  We set up our tent rather quickly due to the snow becoming a snow and rain mix.  We decided that due to the change in weather we would hit the hay early.  Approximately at 2:00 am I awoke with a Migraine which was unbearable.  I awoke the two other individuals and we decided that we would head back home.  Upon packing our backpacks and gear we saw a extremely bright object which we perceived to be a falling star or maybe a meteorite entering the atmosphere and speeding across the horizon.  The object dissappeared and we all thought how lucky we were to see such a lovely event, not realizing what was to come.  We proceeded out of the park via Hwy 706, it was raining lightly and their was snow and ice on the roadway which subsided upon reaching the Nisqually Entrance.  We proceeded at moderate speed toward Ashford, Washington.  As we arrived within the small town we immediately saw a bluish white light of great brilliance directly above a telephone pole which lite up the entire roadway. I yelled at the driver to stop which we did immediately.  The light was in the shape of two diamonds stuck together at one point about the size of a two seater sports car. Within the vehicle we all were talking fast and loudly, what is it, what should we do, where is the camera, why should we take a picture, UFO pictures are never good enough to confirm an actual sighting, should we get out of the car etc.  We were nervous to the point of laughing and screaming.  I remember getting the old fashion,  immediately developing camera out of the glove compartment and then turning to the driver and saying I am getting out of the car.  Upon exiting the vehicle I was transfixed on the objects brilliant blue light and the noticable lack of sound and or wind which I was expecting.  My last memory was hearing the other two individuals yell and scream for me to come back as I walked  toward the brilliant object above the telephone pole..I also remember  another vehicle, a station wagon coming from behind the telephone pole on what I think was a side road and stopping also.  The next thing I remember is being back in the car with the two other individuals screaming drive, drive and being extremely frightened and visably shaking. The station wagon I remember seeing was no long there, and the driver proceeded to drive as fast as the roads would allow, with our top speed being over 80 MPH, the object was directly overhead being brilliantly illuminated.  It never waivered from keeping up with our vehicle, turn for turn, stop for stop.  Upon reaching the Eatonville Valley the sky became huge and open, we continued down into the valley and watched the object fly directly out into the middle of the sky, stop and then proceed directly upward at a high velocity and dissappear.  Myself and the other two individuals proceeded home to Tacoma, Washington and spent the next decade argueing about the amount of time that went by versus what it normally takes to reach Tacoma. To make a long story short there were three hours not accounted for and a picture in the glove compartment not of the mysterious object but of our vehicle empty with all the doors, hood and rear opened, with our  gear stacked around the vehicle.  None of us took the picture.  The irony, it was me who said why take a picture of a UFO they never come out to prove an actual sighting let alone an actual meeting.  The other two individuals involved always agree that something happened but currently one refuses to discuss it and the other prefers not to discuss it. They both become nervous and upset whenever I bring it up.   Myself, I want to dicuss it,  The reason, because of what has happened since the incident.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,,

After Basic Training in the Army I was sent to Fort Lee, Virginia for my job training school. I remember this all because I was turning 21 and was keeping a daily notebook at the time. One morning while standing at attention in formation, something made me look up and to my right.  I noticed what looked to me like a large disc with a multi-colored glow about it. This was not a normal disc, it was somewhat elongated in the middle. It had a glow that appeared to be steady, only the glow around it seemed to be changing in color.  The outer glow was not one color at any time, however, it seemed to be many colors at once. I observed it as it crossed the crystal clear winter sky going from my right to my left. I can't remember the direction, however, it took only about eight seconds to cross the sky.  At that time I looked at the guys on both sides of me and whispered to them asking if they had seen it. Since we were at attention, they seemed annoyed at my asking. No one else seemed to see the object and I never asked again. Our Platoon Sargent then began talking and I stood still at attention without looking for the object again.  When I returned to the building, I drew a sketch in my notebook, however, the sketch was stolen along with other personal item after I left the Army.  The sky was so black, and the object so bright that I never forgot this sighting. It flew in a straight line and at a high rate of speed. My guess would be that it was at about 20,000 feet. The object was silent and the base was very quiet at 5 AM. This was not from a jet and flew to straight to be a shooting star. I could clearly see the object within the colorful glow around it. My view of it was as if looking at the side of a disc, not the bottom. The object may have been a long cylinder with rounded ends that came to a slight point, like a side view of a disc with an elongated center.  No further action by me and did not hear anything about it as girl chasing was most on my mind at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The night was very clear and the stars could be seen for miles. I got out of the car and for some unknown reason decided to look up in the sky. As I was looking into the eastern sky, I noticed a lighted object moving very slowly. I asked my fiancé to come and look at this object. She asked what it was in a very excited voice. I said, “I think it is a UFO! All of the sudden the object stopped in front of us about 10 yards away at tree top level! We were both getting a little concerned. The object or occupants in the object were looking at us maybe, but it was too far away to tell. The lighted object hovered in the same position for about 30 seconds. I was getting goose bumps and starting to perspire as was my fiancé. Then all of a sudden the object moved to the west again slowly for a few seconds and then moved out of sight in about 3 seconds! It was just like in documentaries I have seen in recent years  Now the sighting was about a mile and a half away from an airport and air guard base. However, the object made no noise at all! I know enough about planes to know that they make some kind of noise and that they do not hover like this object did and then all of a sudden move out of sight in about three seconds. I have been around aircraft since I was young and my dad was a flight engineer on a B-24 bomber in WW2. I wanted to call the air guard base, but I was afraid the airmen at the base would just laugh. However, many years ago, an F-94 from the base chased an unknown object, but gave up the chase after being outrun.  I spoke to a UFO expert about my sighting and he told me he believed that the occupants knew we were watching them and that is why the object hovered for about 30 seconds. I have gone over this sighting in my head for the past 25 years and wondered what the object was. I have come to the conclusion that it was either Air Force test vehicle or reverse-engineered object flown by our pilots OR, an alien aircraft. It was state of the art regardless of what the object was. The object in my opinion was saucer shape and very well lighted. My fiancé and I were married for about 9 years and then divorced and we had one son, now 19. He told me his mother showed him where we saw the object.  I will say that I feel fortunate to have seen a UFO. I feel like a veteran and feel that it has changed my view on life differently. I believe there was a Jesus and he did walk on water, but I wonder if there was a scientific reason he was able to walk on water. Maybe we were seeded here on earth!  I would also like to convey to you about an incident that happened to my uncle at about the same time as my experience. My uncle was a farmer in Illinois. He told me at my wedding that he was riding on his tractor one day in his field. He told me he was driving slowly and this gold metal object came up to him and his tractor engine stopped on his tractor! He said he was very frightened. The object moved around him. He tried to start his tractor to get away from the object but it still would not start. The gold metal object finally moved away and moved out of sight in a few seconds. His tractor started up again, just like other people have experience with there cars when they saw UFOs. I believe my uncle was being studied by a probe. He told me he prayed the entire time the object was studying him and that he was very frightened. I just think that it is very coincidental that my uncle and I saw these objects about the same time. It may not be. I decided to write you because I saw SEEING IS BELIEVING, UFOS with Peter Jennings last night and saw the interview with the gentleman with National UFO Reporting Center and also this is the 60th anniversary of Roswell. I hope this helps by reporting what I saw 25 years ago and I have wanted to report this for many years. Thanks You ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Reported to Beale Air Force Base. I was watching a late show one evening in 81/82 when I became aware of a very low basso tone. At first I wasn't thinking anything about it except how odd it was. But I continued to watch tv. As a little time progressed on the tone became deeper, stronger, and more insistant, much louder until it was rattling my glass table top and windows. At this I jumped up and ran for the sliding glass door to see if a Jumbo jet was going to land on my house. It sounded so low in the evening air. I knew we were on a flight path for Beale air force base and we were used to hearing planes now and again in the daytime but never this late at night. I was scared the sound was so invasive. As I launched myself out the back door I landed on a small concrete slab patio with a start as I tried to gauge where the sound was coming from. I looked up at a pine tree in our back yard tall or so and then swiveled toward the sound of the bass tone. As I turned looking up the whole time I could not believe what I was witnessing...there hanging no more than about 200 feet about the ground and moving at a smails pace was a cigar shaped gun metal toned UFO. I was dumfounded as I watched it inch thru the night sky. There were no other sounds but that deep bassso drone as it approached until it was right over my home, and partly obliterated by the roof of my house. Suddenly it stopped dead in the air and as it did so the drone stopped also. It was utterly quiet with not a bird, nor frog, no cricket. It was incredibly eerie! As I watched it just hang there in the void above me I searched its superstructure for some sign of familiarity with airplanes I was familiar with, but there were no wings, no propellars, no windows or portholes, no designs of any kind, just a long dark polished cigar shaped something right over my house dead still in the air. I had a long piece of property, longer than wide and it clearly could have spanned the length of a football field. I continued to watch it, I don't know how long, curious, and in w! ondermen t when suddenly one light ticked on and then off and a little ways away another came on and then off...this continued around the entire bottom of the middle half of the structure that had settled in above my house in a half circle arc and then it disappeared beyond the roof of my home until I finally saw the same light that had started it all tick on and off again and then with that a bright all encompassing light surrounded where I was standing and illuminated the top of my home. I remember thinking to myself ""they've seen me"" and this is where I have an odd double memory of what happened next, I remember wanting to jump out of the light, but I do not remember doing it. I remember staying there and looking into the light. I remember when just before the light came on there was an odd metallic sound like something industrial going on, but I did not see any opening. It was not a blinding light but it was without a doubt the brightest light I had ever seen and yet it did not hurt my eyes and I do not have a remembrance of even wanting to blink my eyes it was all so intrigueing to me. It was almost as tho the light itself was alive, it was filled with rianbows and small moving things, I can only liken it to looking at semen, or bacteria under a microscope, it moved fluidly. It was truly one of the most unique and beautiful things that I have ever seen.I felt an intense euphoria as I watched the motions within the light swirling about in slow motion. Just incredible sight. Very hypnotic, and calming. I do not know how long I stood there, it didn't seem like long but I was utterly entranced so who knows. After awhile the light went out with the same metalic sound, just blinked off. And immediately the ship began to move again, but in no more a hurry than it had been in coming and that basso profundo sound was back. I don't remember moving from the spot, I remember thinking I should run and get my husband so he could see this but I didn't do that and I cannot explain why, at least not until the ship had just p! ast the trees on the other side of our house. Then I ran into my house and tried to wake my husband up, which was a bit of a feat, and then he refused to go outside to see as this thing had not gotten far away by then, but he refused to go even tho he could hear the sound it mad. His sister who was visiting also did not wake up. After this my life turneds upside down as I began a feverish research into all kinds of things I had never been interested in before. My life has never been the same. After the incident I called up and reported the sighting to Beale Air Force base and inquired about the possibility of them having such a craft which they assured me that had not. Years later I was recounting the incident to a friend when my son of 17 walked thru the door and said ""Oh, I remember that mom, I was watching from my window in the bedroom"". Well he was barely 2 when this happend and I had never told him about it. But before I could get into the rest of the description he filled in the blanks with having seen the white light all around me and how it ""danced"" with rainbows and seeing me just stand there for the longest time staring at it, and then it going out and watching me watch it go. He saw all of that. It was a real shock to me...I mean I couldn'nt understand how a child of that age would remember such a thing, but he did. I have had other encounters, and many sightings, and strange phenomenon happen in my life, but this was one of the most life changing.

Slender in build and perhaps 52 inches tall. Mature in appearence yet without any secondary sex characterists of any kind. Dressed in a pale colored short sleaved shirt and green shorts. Light weight boots were noticed on its feet. The ears and nose appeared normal for a humanoid. The head was slighly larger in proportion to the thorax than would be normal yet was attractive in its shape. Dark brown hair covered the top and back giving it a receeding hairline appearence. We encounterd this personas we were leaving the rocky summit of this Mountain. There are only two trails that leave the summit and our backs were between the subject and the trail head. We had no prior warning of his approach to us and seemed to appear out of nowheare. He greeted us by asking the question, ""What can you tell me about the flora and fauna here."" I asked him to clairify what he wanted to know. "" I want to know if there are Bears here and are they dangerous."" I informed him that here are small Black Bears here but they are not aggressive towards humans in general. He responded, ""Very good"". His voice was normal sounding with no accent. He stuck us both to be a college professor or scientists in his questioning but had such a gross lack of basic knowledge about the woods that we both turned in surprise to talk about this person, made eye contact  and then turned quickly back to talk more with him and he was gone.  There was no possible way that he could have gotten out of sight of us so quickly as there is a very limited amount of room on the rock we were standing and it led directly to the trail behind him. In any event we ran around the top of the summit looking for him and then ran down the trail perhaps a quarter mile looking for him. We saw no sign of him. We existed the summit via the other trail and walked rapidly in hopes of findi! ng him t here but did not.  What seemed so strange about this encounter was that it took place on a very cool fall day, perhaps 40 degrees F.  He was dressed for summer and seemed perfectly comfortable.   I not sure this officially qualifies for a close encounter of the third kind but I find it curious that this encounter has stayed so fresh in both of our minds 25 years later.  He and I talk little as we live 2300 miles apart but when we do speak the first thing we say is ""did you see what I saw.""  The answer continues to be ""yes.""",2007-08-07T00:00:00,38.659,-78.4515

I pulled to the side of the road to take a look and thought I observed the fire move. I thought I must have been moving so I stopped dead still and I observed movement of the fireball.  That scared me because this type thing is not suppose to happen.  I did a U-turn on Route 123 and as I headed back south on Route 10, looking back once and observed unusaul movement again.  I stepped on the gas peddle and got away as fast as I could.  I considered reporting this to the police but figured it would just get a big laugh.  In about 1992, when I was back in the area with my Mom, Dad, and fiance' I drove back to the area, retracing my drive. I found there was no hill that could have supported a structure on fire in that area.

My wife and I were travelling from Edmonton to Camrose.  The route we took was Highway 14, to Highway 21, to Highway 13 to Camrose.  The totasl trip would be only 1 hr at 60 mph.  It was night, and the evening was cold.  We left Edmonton at approx 10:oo PM, and at about 10:20 pm we exited #14 to travel S on #21.  We were driving our 1975 red chec 1/2 ton, no camper, open box.  We had our 1 year old daughter in a baby seat betwen the wife and I, I was driver.  We traveled at 60 mph (100 kmh).  As we approached the RR crossing at Looma, AB, I noted a aircraft, I assumed to be a plane mid sky at my 11 o-clock.  I usually look at the night sky while driving.  about 5 minutes later, I noticed that the plane did not make any progress and pointed it out to my wife.  Her I watched as we travelled along #21, and we noticed that the aircraft was still at out 11 o-clock (left of our vehicle)  As we approached a small twon of Hay Lakes, I noticed that we were getting closer to the aircraft.  Now, there is a two story farmhouse, that is situated just n/w of Hay Lakes.  It sits only 40 g=feet N of the highway.  We always drive by this house.  The highway curves to the right about 300 ft past the house.  As we we getting close to the house, we saw that the aircradt was very large, and hovering only 50 feet directly above this house.  Brights lights were on the side, but the lights were not round.  The whole side of the craft was lit up.  As we got closer, we actually drove under the craft, so I estimate the size to be about 100 feet in diametrer.  As we passed near and uder, the craft blocked out the stars, and I noticed that the bottom was not lit up, but I could see the shape to be a circle because it was black and blotted out a circle in the sky.  The sky was claer so the stars could be seen around the object. I slowed down and rolled down my driver side window, and all I heard was the sound of my vehicle tires on the pavement.  No sound came from the craft.  I should also advise that at this point we were only 90 feet below the craft.  I kept driving because all I could think about was my baby.  My wife yelled, ""stop the truck""  but I didn't.  I kept my eyes on it by shifting my view to the side view mirror.  My wife looked back through the rear window of the truck cab.  I then noted an RCMP  (Royal Canadain Mounted Police) approach me from the S/B lane, I watched as his car passed under the craft,, and as funny as it sounds.  He did not stop.  He kept driving and were silent all the way home.  Hay lakes is nly 30 minutes from out home in Camrose.  I did not report this because of two reasons:  1.  At the time I was a City Police Officer and reporting this would kill my credibility as a crown witness.  2.  The RCMP officer driving the car I would have known, and no-one in the local detachment said anything, so I kept quit as well.  I did tell a few close friends and my father.  But only after a few years.  My wife and I still bring this up from time to time.  I should have stopped. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

From 1984 through 1987, while living in the Monterey Bay Area, I observed several times what appeared to be flights of balloon clusters at very high altitudes passing eastward over the Central California Coast.  Most were too far away and too high to see much, even with 7x binoculars. Only one time did they pass directly overhead and seemed close enough to see them better.  The clusters appeared to be several silver-gray, featureless balloons in tight formations and appeared to be straight eastward moving very rapidly, like a jet. They also seemed to be moving around, rotating around each other in rather unballoon-like ways but I am uncertain of this because of they were so far away.  I did not think much of these sightings, assuming that they were some sort of new fancy style of balloon, travelling in the jet stream, until I found out that others had seen very similar objects from relatively close by.

It was about 9 or 10 pm and we were returning to my house. I pulled into the driveway in front of my parents home. I got out of the driver's side, and looked up toward the night sky. I noticed a small dim white light that was no larger or brighter than the light from the dim stars that were visible that night. The light tracked very slowly, in a straight line, due south.  My first thought was how it reminded me of the satellites we used to watch move slowly across the sky as we layed in our sleeping bags on the camping trips of my youth. They were dim, and moved slowly in a straight lines across the night sky. But this was in the city, on the street, surrounded by streetlights, at sea level. I'd never noticed a satellite in those conditions before.  I said to Tristan, ""Hey, do see that light? What is it a satellite or something?"" I pointed in the right direction, and told there it was in the sky next to the tv antenna on the neighbor's house. I saw her look in the right direction, but she said nothing.  I wondered if she could even see it. She didn't like wearing her glasses all the time, and she was not wearing them now. Her eyesight was not that great.  We wathched for a moment longer in silence and suddenly, to my surprise, the light appeared to oscillate wildly back and forth perpendicular to the direction of its travel, kind of like the needle of a sismograph, and then it was just gone.  I was stunned. Nothing I was aware of could move like that. I quickly looked toward Tristan, and in perfect unison we both said, ""Did you see...""  She had been able to see it after all, and we had both witnessed its odd departure. We went inside and explained what we'd seen to my parents.  As UFO stories go it's pretty boring. No huge craft. No big headed aliens. But, we saw what we saw, and I can't explain what it was. I'm a skeptic myself, but this story is the God's Honest Truth and I'd take a lie detector test in a minute to prove it.  Unfortunately, Tristan and I broke up in 1988.

They were flying in formation roughly 200 ft above sea level.  This struck me as odd because military aircraft rarely flew anywhere near the area, so I stopped to see what was going on.  Roughly 20 seconds later, a white, diamond-shaped craft flew overhead, roughly 100 feet above sea level -- much lower than the helicopters.  It made no sound and no colors other than white were seen.  It was fairly bright, but not so bright as to light the ground beneath.  There were also no navigational lights.  It was very large, with the sides spanning about 30 degrees of sky from my perspective.  Total viewing time was 6-8 seconds.  After it passed out of sight behind me, another 3 seconds or so passed when two F-4s (recognized by the sound) came screaming along the same path.  These passed by about the same altitude of the helicopters, roughly 200 ft.  They were moving very fast, as if they were moving to intercept.  Ten to fifteen more seconds passed before three duel rotor helicopters (Chinook?) Slowly followed behind.  I went home and told my mother.

My boyfriend and I had been driving around the back dirt roads in Kitsap and Mason Counties. The area can be found on a map in what would be north west of Belfair on the north shore penninsula and about an equal distance south west of the Bangor/Silverdale area of Kitsap County in an area known as Tahuya.  My boyfriend pulled over and parked the car next to the road.  I don't remember what day or month it was as it happened so long ago but I do know that it was summer because it was in the middle of the night and it was warm enough to have the windows down without wearing a jacket.  In Washington I would say it was late July or August.   I don't know how long we sat there but I do remember asking my boyfriend what time it was. He told me and then I began to light a cigarette.  The next thing I remember was what appeared to be car headlights coming from an odd angle behind us, but I didn't hear any engine noise.  I remember we both noticed the lights as my boyfriend was looking at his driver's side mirror at them. I wondered who else would be out here in the middle of nowhere at this hour. The lights came up behind us so smoothly almost as if they were floating.  Then the next thing I remember (which seemed to be only seconds passing)is no lights and I was looking at my boyfriend and I asked him again what time it was as if I were reliving the minute before.  He told me and it was 3 hours later.   We just looked at each other wondering how that could be.  I think I said something to the effect of ""I have been trying to light this cigarette for 3 hours?  Didn't I just ask you what time it was?""   All I can tell you is that this moment in my life has never gone away.   The bottom line is that lights came up behind our car on a dirt road making no noise at all and with their dissapearence I lost 3 hours of time.   We were in our early twenties at the time and I never told anyone because I didn't think anyone would believe me.  Now even after all these years I believe something happened to us that night that was not normal or of this earth.  When I did sleep next I had a vivid dream of being examined by aliens.  I don't know if this dream was my minds way of trying to account for the missing time or if this is what happened to me during the three missing hours.  I guess I'll never know.  I still remember the dream though as if it I had it yesterday.  In case it could be related to my missing time I will explain it as best as I can, but like I said I don't know if it is related to the 3 missing hours and the strange lights behind the car.  I was laying on a metal table but I wasn't cold or hard. There were several, 3 for sure, (beings? not human) around the table. One to the left of my head one behind me and one to my right side. I had the feeling they were males although I couldn't tell what sex they were.  They had greyish colored skin and bigger heads then we have with no hair. I remember the heads as being larger especially in the back area more so then ours.  They were talking to me without a mouth I heard them in my head.  They were telling me that I was fine and they seemed happy or I was getting a happy feeling from more then one of them.  It was like being in a room with a group a happy chatty people.  I felt that my boyfriend was close but not in the same room as me.  I also received the feeling that he was fine just as I was. The one to the left of my head asked me if I would have a baby for them. I said I would but that I couldn't have babies and I asked them if they could fix me so that I could and could have one for me too.  I felt a sense of confusion from them and that's all I remember of my dream.  The one I really looked at was the one to my left.  I don't remember them wearing clothes and they were what I would call scrawny except for their heads.  I also don't remember them having ears. The mouth area was like a slash and they didn't have lips like we do and I don't remember seeing inside the slash of the mouth so I don't know how deep it was. The mouth was smaller then our opening for a mouth, about half as small. I couldn't tell where the light in the room was coming from but the room had a bluish cast to it.   My comment about not being able to have babies was most likely due to my earlier misscarriage that left scaring and I was told that I would probably not be able to get pregnant again.  However 5 years later I did.  So, was this dream related to my missing 3 hours?  I don't know but unlike most dreams I still remember this one as if it happened yesterday and I still relate it to my missing time.  I am not a crazy person. I would be very embarrassed if anyone I know found out that I thought I may have been abducted by aliens.  I have always thought of myself as a sceptic, but I can't or never have been able to explain the lights behind our car and the missing 3 hours, nor why this dream doesn't fade from my memory.   I would like to know if anyone else in my area saw anything similiar or unusual during the summer of 1987 in the late evening or early morning (before sunrise) during a very warm night in the Tahuya/Dawatto area of the Kitsap penninsula.  Please don't use my name publicly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

I am resubmitting this revised item. I originally submitted it two or three years ago and it was apparently not received as it did not appear in the database.  I was riding my motorcycle on my way home from work one night on SR1 in August 1987 and as I left Castroville I kept seeing flashes of orange and green lights out of the corner of my eye. I assumed that they were just reflections from street and other lights nearby in my face shield.  The flashes kept occurring and were random. Then it occurred to me that they were all coming from the same point in the sky. I looked up and saw what appeared to be occasional small flames of orange and brilliant green coming from a small, dark spot in the sky.  I exited the freeway and stopped to get a better look.  I saw a small, dark object in the sky, darker than the sky, to the south and at approximately a 40degree azimuth. The object did not seem to move but I could see what appeared to be sheets of orange and green flame occasionally going from the near end back toward the farthest end.  I took out my binoculars and looked for the object, finding it once another sheet of flame crossed it and saw what appeared to be a dark, rounded rock  with a large depression on the side and small pockmarks or craters on it.  The rock was oriented with it's small part toward me and pointing a bit more West and downward, and the much larger part pointing away from me. It reminded me of some of kind of potato.  The rock was much darker than the night sky, even though there were few stars in that area of the sky at the time. Even so, there seemed to be some light illuminating the side I could see as well as the near end, that I assumed was light reflecting off the Earth or from some lights on the ground.  As I watched through the binoculars, sheets of orange and green flame would be emitted or produced from the near end and would spread along the length of the object briefly.  I stood and watched the object until I was falling asleep. It was perhaps just an half hour.  I did not see the object move from where it was. I thought the object had moved but it was the stars that had moved.  I mentioned the sighting in sci.astro about two years later. Someone posted a followup (which I never saw until 2006) saying that I saw a rocket from Vandenberg but there is no rocket that looks like a rock. I also mentioned in the post that it appeared to move a few degrees but I was wrong: it did not appear to move relative to horizon or any landmark that I could see but it did move relative to the stars, or rather, the stars moved behind the object.  I followed up the sighting with inquiries to local news and to the FAA and got no response at all.  I believe what I saw was an asteroid near-miss. The object was probably at the edge of the atmosphere, which would account for the occasional sheet of flame, and was moving at the same speed and roughly in the same direction as the Earth, which made it appear to be relatively motionless and which kept it from hitting the ground or water.

As we drove toward that location, we slowed and witnessed a ""craft"" hovering above the treetops. It was silent, yet clearly rotating behind a veil of ""orange brightness"".  Turning directly toward it, the headlights swooped through the treeline, and exposed a mist of sparkle. Shining through this mist, the headlights raked the glowing object.  There was a sudden compression or jolt of air,(a soundless ""poof"" best describes it), and the craft slowly began to glide away across the treetops.  Glowing cinders, much like tossing a log into a burning barrel would emit, rained down as it moved.  Gliding approx. 30 yds, it took off at a 45 degree angle upward with such incredible speed that a second or two it mixed with stars.  It suddenly burst a bright blue and disappeared from the sky.   Within minutes a Highway Patrol appeared behind us.  I believe he was also witness to the event. Taking our names, he informed us that we did not see anything, and let us drive off.  Arriving home, a minimum of 15 patrol cars were seen entering and sealing access to the roads.  As we exited the car, stepping into the driveway felt much like squirming out of molasses. It was a wierdness that lasted until morning when disbelief set in.  Revisiting the scene in daylight revealed nothing other than the strangeness of an empty horse pasture.

I remember it being in the local newspapers the next day and that numerous people had reported it. If I remember rightly it had also been reported to the coastguard.  I was on my way to football practice at the time. We practised on a small field under some street lighting close to Aberavon beach. On our way there I noticed some lights in the sky behaving oddly. At first I thought it  might be aircraft dogfight training as the lights seemed to be dancing around each other. I then noticed what seemed to be a cylinder shape at the centre which could only be defined by the lights on it. I could not see any physical solid shape. These lights continued revolving and cartwheeling and slowly moving away towards a slightly misty horizon until they dissapeared.  This sighting alone amazed me as it lasted what seemed a good 10 minutes which gave me enough time to discern that these lights were not aircraft of any sort that I had ever seen.  About 20 minutes later as we were playing football I noticed more lights in the distance heading towards us. I stopped playing football to clearly observe them. They were moving slowly and at first I saw four lights that as they got closer changed into three lights and a triangular shape was clearly discernable.  To my amazement the lights passed directly overhead. I couldn't make out any sound or see any shape in between the lights. I can only guess at the size. It seemed to be about the size of a British Vulcan bomber or bigger. It passed over slowly and as I mentioned earlier there was absolutely no sound.  Then, not long after it passed overhead it  pointed upwards and ascended vertically at exactly the same slow speed until it disappeared. This amazed me as I know of no aircraft that can do this for that duration and speed.  Shortly after two aircraft appeared which led me to the conclusion that they were looking for these lights.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

I was working the midnight shift in an outside perimeter post at an area correctional facility during the month of January, 1995, exact date un-recalled. This facility is located on a mountain top covering an expansive area and the perimeter shack was located in an area where the facility lighting was somewhat blocked for better night vision of the perspective area to be observed. I retired in the spring of 1995, so this event took place in the winter prior to my retirement, though the exact date in January I don't remember. I do remember that it was crispy cold out and there was snow on the ground and the sky was extremely clear, black and filled with stars. I'm guessing that it was between two and three o'clock when I left the warmth of the perimeter shack to go outside to relieve myself of all my coffee intake and just happened to scope the very clear and starry sky when I noticed a bright light which at first I thought was a shooting star or satellite, speed and stop suddenly almost directly overhead and remained still, maintaining its' yellowish reflection as did all five objects, which I'm assuming was the reflection from the sun, when suddenly another appeared of the same size and speed, and then another shot in, and then a fourth one sped in, and then a fifth, each from different directions at an unbelievable rate of speed and seemed to hover there for maybe forty to fifty five seconds or so, not touching each other, but very close to one another as if they were having a meeting. Each of these lights where about the size of the hole at the end of a common ball point pen and left a slight tail that diminished when they stopped and there was no noise, possibly because they were so far away. The yellowish reflection color was the only color that was noticable, if there were any other colors at all, I believe these objects were to far away to distinguish any running lights or maybe the suns' reflective beam devoured any other colors. You could have placed all five object lights into the diameter size of a dime or even smaller area. I watched for what I am guessing for about a minute or so and then they all suddenly sped off at the same time, at the same devastating speeds that they showed up at, in the same general directions that they all originally came from. I was totally amazed at what I had just witnessed and sort of wondered if I actually saw what I saw. I spent a g! ood hour or more out in the cold night peering for more of this action, but saw none and eventually the sun began to rise and I lost the night sky vision. I said absolutely nothing to anyone at my work place at the time because of the ridicule and possible accusations that I was halucinating or something and with the exception of a few friendly conversations over the years, very little has been to said to anyone until now. I can still see it so clearly in my mind. If I had had a camera at that time and was able to photograph this account, it would be even more believable than what it already is. I was reading some of these reports in this space and thought I would share this account and experience. Just possibly, someone else out there may have observed this same phenomenon that took place in January of 1995 and maybe state what they had seen also. I am a firm believer in extraterrestial life and feel that we are not alone or the only intelligent being in existance in this universe....Thank You.....

It silently floated northbound in a straight line (not descending) as I gazed east toward the Gila Mountains. It was a few degrees above the mountain ridge and about the size and brightness of the moon (when the moon is high - not it's just risen appearance) Unfortunately, buildings & trees blocked my full field of vision so I didn't get to see where it went. I watched it for about 30 seconds.  Also, another UFO incident I know was when I was a child. My father worked at Cape Kennedy (in Data processing and died in 1969) came home all excited (a very stoic man) and said something came up to one of our unmanned rockets right after it launched and like a mosquito to a man (UFO to the rocket) and checked it out at many angels and then flew off in a blink of the eye.

During the conversation I kept seeing a bright light in the distant sky outside.  I assumed it was the metal from an airplane reflecting the sunlight.  I kept looking out the window because the light drew closer.  I soon noticed the light was flashing, and I thought that it could be sunlight glinting off of a helicopter instead.  My curiousity remained, so I continued to watch it as the flashing light came closer and closer.  Soon enough it actually flew over the restaurant, and I was dumbfounded and in disbelief at what I saw.  It was a rather large, silvery metal saucer, and the flashing [white] lights were on the outer rim of the saucer.  They seemed to be flashing because the lights would turn on and off in a line, going round and round the rim.  Looking back, I suppose the lights could have seemed to be going round and round if the saucer were spinning, but at the time that did not seem to be the case.  Either way, I could not believe what I had seen.  I asked my friend sitting next to me if she had seen it, and she said she had not seen it.

This sighting happened quite a while ago when I was about 8 or 9, and at the time I just took it as an incredible and unmistakable UFO sighting, and didn't think to see if there was a website I could report it to until just now (I'm 19). Even though it wasn't very long or eventful, it is one of the most stark and obvious UFOs I've ever seen (even against those in the media).  It was a summer night, and my sister, our next door neighbor and I were all outside in our field. We lived in an apartment house on top of a long driveway in an area that separates street blocks from more wooded and fielded terrain. We were in our field, looking at stars and just talking, when we saw a UFO rise straight up from behind the distant woods that were off to the right of our distant neighbors house, approximately 7-800 ft. from where we were standing. Notice how I checked the ""The object landed"" box, because this object almost definitely had to have been on the ground, because it was rising in a perfect vertical line from behind the trees. It appeared quite small (about the size of your fingernail if you were to hold it up to the sky), and no detail could be seen, except that it was extremely clearly a perfect saucer UFO straight out of a comic book. There were no individual lights, but it was completely glowing a very pure bright, gold light (this may have been due in part to the possibility that it was reflecting light as a faraway object, but it wasn't an ordinary reflective glow; it seemed engulfed in light, like the object itself was either VERY reflective, or emitting some kind of glow itself). There was absolutely no sound anywhere in the quiet of the night. It rose straight up at a mid-pace until it was very high in the sky, then without any shift in appearance whatsoever it made a perfect 90º left turn and continued at the same exact rate of speed, and just kept gliding in that direction until it was out of sight.  Despite my young age, I am certain there's no way it could have been any known aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was getting ready for school and I looked out the window to the East, toward the sky to see the weather. This was probably around 8 A.M. and I am not sure of the time of year.  However, I do know on this particular day, it was already light outside and the sky was clear. I remember noticing what I thought was a bright star way up in the sky to the S. East and wondering why there was a star out when the sun was already up. The object I was seeing was approximately the same size, shape and color of a bright nighttime star, only it was not dark out at the time. I took a longer look to see exactly what this was, still thinking it had to be a star of some kind. Suddenly, and with unimaginable speed, the object shot straight across the sky, from its point in the S. East sky, to a new point in the N. East sky, stopping just as suddenly as it had taken off. After sitting perfectly still in the new location for a short while, the object once more shot at incredible speeds, straight toward a new location, this time in the S. East sky again, yet at a lower part of the sky than before. And like before, it stopped just as fast as it had shot across the sky. By this time I could not believe what I was seeing and called for my Mother to come look. From what I remember, we probably watched this object for around 20 minutes. During this time, the object would either be sitting perfectly still in the sky or it would be zooming in a straight line, at mind-boggling speeds, to stop instantly at a new location again. I remember how amazed my Mother and I both were at what we were seeing. It was truly unbelievable how fast the object could stop and go. My mother finally had to leave for work and I started out for school. I could still see the object, but it appeared to be smaller now, like it had gone further up in the sky, even though it was still moving in the same general East, S. East locations. I was hoping to show it to my Science teacher when I got to school, but it vanished before I got there.

The date was approximately summer 1998. The time was approximately 2pm. As I was walking to my building I glanced up at the sky for no particular reason other then to view the sky. That is when I saw the UFO.  What I saw was what looked like A torroidial  (Donut) shaped glowing plasma. The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly. The object was not a continuous torroidial  shape but was instead waning and waxing in the following manner. The object would start out as a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object and slowly morph into a complete torroidial shaped brightly glowing object. It would then revert from its torroidial shaped glowing golden like brilliance to a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object, again. It continued doing this continuously during the entire time I witnessed this object. I would estimate this object to be approximately 100 yards in diameter and 1 mile directly away from me. The direction of the object from me was approximately dead east. The object was traveling at a relatively slow but steady southern direction, AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF THE CLOUDS.  I would guess I witnessed the object for a total of 20 minutes. After looking at it for 5 minutes I decided to run up to my apartment to get my binoculars to see it closer. By the time I got the binoculars and made it back downstairs, approximately 10 minutes had passed. The object had traveled so far south by that time that by looking in my binoculars the object looked the same size as when I had first saw it. I witnessed the object through binoculars for an additional 5 minutes and then I simply left off looking at it. I would like to express my feelings as to what I feel I was seeing. Although I can not say for a certainty what this anomalous object was, what I can say, and I feel very strongly about this, is the following. This object gave me a very strong i! mpressio n that there was an engine of sorts powering it and that it was either malfunctioning or was experimental in nature and not functioning within expected parameters. Try and try as ""They"" might they could not get this ""Thing"" to stabilize at full power. Not unlike a cars engine that simply will not an maintain idle speed.

A couple of moments later, it started to move to the right about 30 feet also, stopped a few moments, and then go back to the center line over the house and down to the original position; waited only a few seconds this time and went straight up about 30 feet again and then to the left and slowly, slowly moved above all the 2 story houses on the block where it moved behind the trees and into the sunlight coming fromthe east.   I then lost sight of it.   I must stress that it was perfectly symmetrical and its movements were perfectly aligned with no wobbling, no lights and no sound.  It was absolutely suspended in mid-air.  At first we thought it was some kind of kite, but, boy-oh-boy, it sure wasn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

One night around 1am i couldn't sleep because i was too hot, being from Scotland im not used to the heat! I got up to open a window but the problem was there was a mesh on the inside to stop mosquitos. I coludn't work out how to open it so was at the window for quite some time. It was then that i noticed a light in the corner of my eye. Looking out the window across the suburbs i could see a disk shaped craft hovering above a small clump of trees in the middle of the suburbs. It was about 500 yards away. It was clear to see because the house i was in was on a hill and the suburbs sloped away from it so there was nothing obstructing my view. I was almost looking slightly down on the craft. The craft was dark in colour, about 100 feet wide and thin from top to bottom, maybe only 10 or 15 feet. There were also small lights in the middle of the craft around its circumfrance. There was a green beam of light shinning from the middle of the underside of the craft down into the trees below. It was about 15-20 feet wide and panned out fractionaly futher from the craft. I watched it for about 10seconds or so then the light shut off. Without any noise the craft disappeared in a streak of orange light leading up to the right into the night sky. It was as if it had almost instantly accelerated to a speed hundreds of times faster than any plane, simply too fast to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

She called out to us kids to look up in the north sky at the strange gray cigar shaped object which was hovering. It was very high, I would now estimate that it was 75 to 90 degrees high, and had no contrail, no sign of movement.   It's hard to estimate how long it was, as it was very high. It was not a blimp or a weather balloon either!!   We lived very close to H&H Guest Ranch, which had gliders and skyjumping on weekends, but this was a weekday and that was NO glider!

I asked others for some time after that, but could find no other witnesses.  I finally gave up hope of discovering the truth of the matter, and no collision, fire, nor other disturbance was made publicly known, even weeks later. 	It looked like a huge, burning basketball, with bright orange flames trailing lazily behind for about two, or three times its diameter.  I thought I could hear the flames, similar to the sound a flag makes when stirred by a gentle breeze, but I didn't hear an impact of any sort. 	From the ball field north of Wilson Memorial High School, (the old army hospital) it described a gentle arc earthward beginning east northeast, seemingly it would have crashed roughly northeast of my position, I thought at the time, Harrisonburg, Va.

My bedroom was in the back of the house, facing the back yard, which, in our Ventura, California town, was wilderness area owned by the Getty Oil Co. There were, back then in 1967,  no houses, roads, or buildings--nothing at all.  We lived, literally, on the very edge of town. I had just gotten into bed at about 11:00 PM and had definitely not fallen asleep. (I have examined this fact a number of times to counter the argument that I was dreaming. I am sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I was wide awake.)   A faint, intermittent noise began, similar to the sound of a rain bird spraying water, and I can remember thinking, ""Why is the neighbor watering his lawn at this hour?""  The noise slowly began to get louder, as if it was approaching, and, in fact, it was, and began assuming a more electronic character as it did so.  By this time, I began feeling afraid. The noise became quite loud, and suddenly, in front of my window, wreathed in green light, appeared a figure in silhouette, moving back and forth in my window as if trying to look in at me. While the window had a sheer curtain covering part of the view, it did not obscure the bright green aura, or the box-like protuberance around the ears of the being.   It wavered back and forth in front of my window for a minute or so, and then moved away down the path behind my house.  As it did so, the electronic sound diminished as well, eventually fading completely.  By this point, I had the covers over my head, and was shaking in fear. I did not jump up to tell my parents who were sitting in the living room in the front of the house, as one would normally do, and have never understood why. I can honestly say I have never been so frightened in my life. What happened was, of course, completely unexpected, and there fore carried an element of shock as well.  It was not a prank by friends (to stand as high in the window on the path behind my room, one would have to be 7 ft. tall) nor was it a dream.  I have replayed the incident many times over in my mind since that time--and each time must conclude, after looking at all other rational explanations, that I saw the outline, silhouetted in green light, of a being not from this world. There are other elements to this story from other members of my family, and neighbors as well.  But this is enough for now.  Though I have told this story to people several times over the years, I still get a cold chill down my spine from the remembrance, and even feel it now as I write this.

We commented on how strange this was and watched the object as it moved slowly over our heads to the east and over a hill (in the direction of the Elmira/Corning Airport)  To our amazement, when it reached the top of the hill, it just stopped, abruptly, in mid-air.  As we were trying to figure out what kind of aircraft could possibly be capable of such a thing (and realizing that it was definitely not a jet plane) it took off at a speed that was both incredible and shocking.  We were stunned.  We vowed never to tell anyone about it for fear of ridicule.

Alamosa UFO disappears after flash of blinding light.,Alamosa,CO,,light,20 minutes,"Occurred : 8/8/1967 16:00  (Entered as : 08/08/67 16:00) Reported: 10/23/2007 8:27:37 AM 08:27 Posted: 11/28/2007 Location: Alamosa, CO Shape: Light Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59395.html,"Alamosa UFO disappears after flash of blinding light. Two of us were driving west on Colorado Hwy 160 toward Alamosa.  The road is called the 'gun barrel' because there is a stretch of about 15 miles that is completely straight.   My friend, who has a private pilot's license, saw an orange light directly ahead of us and pointed it out to me.  We watched it 'fly' north for about 5 minutes before we stopped the car to get out and have a clearer view.  After a few minutes we continued to drive west and watch the light.  It would occasionally change from orange to green, and then back to orange in a random sequence.  We stopped the car one or two more times to try to figure out what it was. Our approximate location when we first spotted the UFO was 37°28’09.17-N  105°35’52.42-W. After about 20 minutes the light was approaching mountains that are west of Alamosa, still travelling north.  With the mountains as a reference we could estimate size, height and speed.  We guessed that it was 200’ long (it had taken on a cigar shape as we got closer), about 1000’ above ground level (Alamosa is at 7500’ above sea level) and traveling at about 200 miles per hour. When it was very near the mountains we suddenly saw a blinding white light and then it was gone. After we checked into our hotel rooms we went into the hotel restaurant.  As we talked about our experience we wondered how many of these kinds of things are seen and never reported.  It was 6:00 PM or so when we decided to call the local newspaper.   The editor happened to answer the phone.  When we gave him an overview of our experience he asked if he could come to the restaurant and interview us. Before he arrived I went to the hotel desk for a Colorado map.  We marked the map with a line showing where we thought the UFO traveled as we watched it. We told him what we had seen and he took copious notes without asking many questions.  When we were through he said, ""Now let me tell you what other stories I have heard.""   He then told us about reports from many local citizens including ‘close encounters’.  I recall one of the events he told us about was an elderly lady who reported a huge UFO that hovered just above her house for several minutes.  He made it a point to make sure we understood that the other reports were from very credible people. The story about our sighting was reported in the Alamosa newspaper the next day.  My crew was in the area examining two national banks for two days.  We regretted telling our story because we took a lot of grief and ribbing from bankers and other citizens.  As we were checking out of the hotel the owner/manager asked us if we were the bank examiners who had seen the UFO.  We were very defensive by this time, but admitted that we were the people mentioned in the newspaper article. She then told us this story.  Her 8 year old daughter had been visiting a friend’s house the day of our sighting.  Her daughter called the police to report a military jet that she saw shot down.  She said that it was chasing a light and the light shot out a light that knocked the airplane down.  Then she came home and told her mother what she had done.  The mother told her that it was not right to make false reports to the police and that she was in big trouble. When the police showed up at their home to make sure everything was o.k.  The police and her mother told the girl that if an airplane had crashed, there would be search parties out looking for it.  Now, here is the part that makes me believe that this was a true report of what the girl saw.  She said, ""If they find it -- can I have it, because I saw it first?""  I met the girl briefly and asked her to point in the sky where she saw the light and the airplane.  Her line was shorter than ours, but ended in the location where we saw the blinding white flash. I have decided to report this again just because I am old enough now that I don’t care what people think.  I have searched for the article and have not been able to find it.  I was not even sure which year it was until I remembered that the well-known case of Snippy the horse (mutilation) occurred about 2 to 4 weeks after our event.  The Snippy event was September 7, 1967 so our event would have been sometime in August, 1967. If you have a way to access the Alamosa newspaper you will find our story there.  I would love to have a copy of the article if that is possible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  However, he is correct about the date of the mutilation of the horse in Alamosa.  Reports of other mutilations south of Florence, CO, were circulating as early as June 1967, a fact which I know from personal experience there.  PD))",,37.46284615384615,-105.783

The object may have been silver.  The motion of the craft would appear to be using magnetic field generated by the electricity of power lines similar to the theory based on the history channels show tonight about aliens and the earth.

I thought at first it was a planet in the sky so I stared at it to figure out which one, but I noticed a slight wobble to it. It appeared to be moving slowly towards me. It was in the eastern sky at the time I first noticed it. As I watched I tried to squint to make out anything thinking it was maybe a helicopter, but when I squinted it seemed to have an odd shape to it, and it was not blinking like a normal helicopter was. About 2 minutes later my mother came out and asked what I was looking at, I pointed the object out and said it seemd odd. At this time it was getting closer. At about 9:30 PM at this point the object was getting closer and you could see visible horizontal movement as the object got closer to us. It took about 2 minutes from that point to reach a point where we could see it visible moving at a fast pace. It was completely silent, and almost looked like a cruise ship moving in the sky how it was floating by. As it got closer the front had a bright orange light on it, which is what I assume I could see from the distance originally. I coult also make out two lighter lights behing it tailing it. These lights formed a triangular shape. The shape was an elongated traingle the front was about 3 times the disance from the back two lights were apart. At this point the object passed directly over the house and you could visibly make out a very dark black shape of a trangle with two lights on the back, one on the front and what looked like smaller lights around the side of it as it passed.  It continued to move to the west passing over the hill behind our house. It took about 1 minute to pass from where we could make it out to where it was no longer visible. There was no noise at all coming from the object.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.62226046511628,-79.1465007751938

Neither my wife nor I noticed anything strange at the time--not until we looked at the video footage later that day.  I was using a Sony Handicam on a tripod, taking a shot of a large metal sculpture, zooming out.  A blob of light is seen coming from the top-center of the frame, gets slightly brighter, then fades out quickly.  This first ufo is visible for perhaps a few seconds.  Then, a few seconds later, in the same shot, another blip of white light seems to appear from somewhere behind the sculpture, and streaks toward the left and up slightly, very quickly, lasting maybe less than a second.  A jet plane (can't tell if it's commercial or military) is also in the shot, its vapor trail clearly visible.  It seems to be climbing at a rather steep angle of ascent, but I'm not sure.  I have the original digital tape and an uncompressed .AVI file of the relevant footage that's about 40 megs.  Let me know where to send it.

White light seen moving at quick pace This is the second day in a row that a UFO was spotted over Indiana, PA around 9PM EST. Friday night Aug 11th 2006 we went to leave my house to go for a walk as we normally do on weekend nights. Upon leaving the house I spotted a very bright light over the east horizion. from my location appeared to be 2 inches from the horizion at about a 30 degree angle from my location and it probably was over a mile in the distance (numbers are a pure estimate, unsure of real distance, height, and angle it wsa at from my location) at first I thought it was an airplane going in for a landing at Jimmy Stewart Airport, which was very near where the object was spotted. However, the object stayed in a fixed location for 10 minutes. Upon noticing this we decided to go find out what it was. We got into my car and proceeded to drive up Highway 119 but did not take the Clymer exit which would take you to the airport. I continued to drive down 119 and saw the object again after about traveling 1 mile down 119. It appeared to be in the same location still, but not sure exactly how far it was from me. We did notice at this point the object was moving, it appeared to be traveling parallel to my car as it traveled down 119. I was headed in the direction of punxsutawney, PA. At this point we slowed down and came to a stop off the sholder of the highway and the object was moving at a quick pace then came to an abrupt stop. I figured I would get back to the airport and see if I could get closer. I turned down the first exit I could find and continued back to downtown Indiana. At this point we lost track of the object because of our location. Upon getting back on to Philadelphia St and proceeding east back towards 119 I took the clymer exit this time and headed towards the airport. When we got there we did not see anything in the sky and decided to return home to see if we could see anything there. At home there was nothing to bee seen, however I noticed an interesting vapor trail in the sky that looked like no plane one I have ever seen. It moved in a very defined line and make very quick turns in a very large S shape from what appeared to be from where we originally saw the object directly over our location and through where town is. I compared them to other vapor trails created by planes that night and compareing the rate of disipation of a known plane one to this, this trail had to of been made very quickly to maintain its definition over that large of a distance. Although a little freaked out we proceeded to go to town to do our walk. At around 9:55 PM while walking down church st facing west we noticed a very similar bright object in the sky. I stopped and watched it closely lineing it up with a power line to detect movement, and it was either riseing in the air or coming towards us relatively quickly. I pulled out my camera phone to try to take a picture and it just flicker out and was now not visible again. We continued to walk towards the Sheetz convienance store near Indiana University of Pennsylvania at this point and the object was lit up again. Once again it was moving towards us at a relatively quick pace. My girlfriend at this point was getting very scared and we decided to get into Sheetz as fast as possible. We ran towards other people who were walking in that direction to at least be near others, at this point the light just flashed out again. We spent about 8 minutes in sheetz before deciding to get back to my car and drive back home, the car was about 3/4ths a mile from where we were now. We started to walk up 6th st towards downtown Indiana and while doing this in the same location in the sky looking towards Indiana Mall the light just flashed back on again and was moving once again. We moved quickly into town which a festival was going on at the time, so there were lots of people around. At this point we lost track of the object so moved quickly to my car, which was in my work's parking lot about 1/4th a mile away Quickly got home, where the light appeared again over the hill behing my house. At this time I pointed it out to my mother, sister, her boyfriend and her friend. We watched the object for about another 10 minutes as it randomly got bright, dim and eventually disappeared. This is the second night in a row an object was in the skys. The night before (Thursday night) we had a tringular large UFO fly directly over our house at a quick pace, but slow enough to watch it for 30 seconds in detail. The objects seem to always appear in the summer around 9PM in august. It is the only similarity to all the objects I've seen in the past few years here, but they are definatly appearing more often now the ever before.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.62226046511628,-79.1465007751938

I was getting ready for bed at approximately 10:00 pm. I went to the bathroom and did not turn on any lights and looked out the bathroom window and saw a huge orange glow on the ground.  I first thought it was a bonfire or someone in our pasture.  The object was on the ground and I could see definition in the lights going around the object.  I studied the object for several minutes going back into my bedroom to see if maybe it was a glare from the TV or some other light in my house.  I turned off the TV and there were no other lights on in my house and went back to look and it was still there.  I then went into my dining room area an looked out that window and watched the object again.  I then called my 17 year old son to come look at this as well.  He watched the object with me in disbelief trying to figure out what the bright orange glow was.  We than went outside on the carport and it was very quiet and my dog was not barking at the object.  My son went in the front yard to look to see if it was the moon somehow glaring in the pasture but it was not.  I called for him to come in the house because I was actually beginning to get frightened at this point.  I do live near West Georgia Regional Airport and thought maybe it was some sort of aircraft.  We went into the house and within 10 seconds when we left the back yard and went back to the dining room area the object had disappeared.   I also could see a strange glow where the object had been.  My son and I both could see the definition of the lights on the center of the object and it was very bright.  I know what we saw was something out of this world and know that we cannot be the only life in the universe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was sitting on a starboard balcony of a cruise ship, scanning the northern sky. The ship's position was in the northern gulf, west-southwest of Key West Fla. The sky was mainly clear with scattered clouds low on the horizon. Several stars were visible but one stood out as it appeared to be a sphere rather that a twinkling object. I presumed it was a planet and that was more clearly visible due to being in open waters with the absence of light. I then became more intruiged with it as I realized it was positioned between my line of sight and the scattered cloud cover. No sooner had I realized that, then the object began spinning in a pinwheel fashion, the circumference of the area growing with each revolution. It spun very fast and I can only speculate that it spun 8-12 times. It then sped off in a north-westerly direction at an amazing rate of speed. I find it difficult to characterize the sighting and the motion other than to compare it's actions with the child's game of ""crack the whip"". The pinwheel motion almost looked like the object was gaining momentum and when it had enough, it ""flung"" itself into the northwestern sky. I followed it for approx 1-2 seconds before it disappeared. I cannot articulate properly the impact of witnessing this phenomenon. It was much more spectacular than my description provides.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,43.23776070381232,-79.86514418377321

It was approximately March 10, 2008, but I don't remember the exact day, just that it was early March. At 7:54 pm there were three of us driving in a car northbound on Pueblo Blvd. heading out toward Highway 50. I remember the time exactly because before we saw the ufo I looked at the clock in the car because we were supposed to call a friend some time after 8:15 and pick him up. We were heading out to another friend's house for a quick visit. The house we were heading to at the time was an apartment complex with a locking gate that requires a keycode for entry, at least at that time of night, though I'm not sure because I've only been there once. I think to get there you take one of the last right turns as you head from the city park on Pueblo Blvd. over a bridge that goes over the Arkansas River, which we've also seen different looking ufos over. As we pulled in to the apartment complex, we could see Highway 50 across a small field, maybe a few hundred feet away to a car dealership with al of it's parking lot lights on. But, after we had crossed the river heading out to these apartments, we saw a few small radio antennas of some sort with a single red blinking light on the top of each, and further in the distance larger, much taller antennas with red blinking lights. They're landmarks out there, and when you see one of these at night, the same one you've driven past over and over at night, you know what's a radio tower and what's not. Between the smaller towers closer to us, and the taller towers much further ahead of us, was an oval shaped light (like a cirlce, but with a flat top and bottom). Judging by the mile markers, it was a little more than a quarter mile away when we first saw it, but it was off to our right, about 7-8 stories above the ground. It emitted a red light similar to the lights on the radio towers, but this light was bigger, the whole ""craft"", and was a brighter, slightly pink-tinted red light. We could not see a definite outline of a craft, just a light. The light! coming  from it seemed somewhat constant, but the way the glare shifted and points of intensity in the light shifted rapidly with much energy, it seemed like a plasma of some sort. And I don't mean like some hippy lighting effect show, I mean like looking at a plasma light bulb in which the light seems constant in it's intensity, but slightly grainy, and without the glass to hold the plasma and dull it's intensity. The light seemed to have been travelling the same direction and speed that we were. Just before we came to our turn off, the light began to descend to between 5-6 stories, leaving a semi-vertical steam or smoke trail. When it finished descending to between 5-6 stories off the ground, the  emission of the steam trail ceased and the light dissappeared. The craft descended and disappeared within just a few hundred feet of the apartment we were headed to, as we were driving just beneath this steam trail as it floated south along with the wind and descended to the ground with the wind so that the bottom of th steam trail was about 2-3 stories off the ground, and not even 60 ft. from our vehicle as we were driving out to the apartment. We heard no sound from the craft, but we were driving so if there were a faint noise we wouldn't have heard it. It was not an airplane or helicopter, military or civilian, as we have both that fly over Pueblo and especially in that area. We would've heard the rotors had it been helicopter, as it was travelling about 60mph northbound, following Pueblo Blvd. but off the the right as you approach Highway 50. It was not an airplane, as we would've heard the engines and no airplane I know of in use can travel 60 mph and even slow down as it descends to 5-6 stories without crashing. Besides that, this was one solid pink light that gave off a steam trail lower than 100ft. The steam trail, and I say that because it was light and not dark like smoke, was almost vertical, but you could tell that the craft descended rapidly, almost vertically, but while still travelling north. I don't ! know if  it dropped off it's horizontal speed while it descended because we weren't close enough to it to tell, we only drove up right under it's steam trail. I almost wish we'd had some sort of air sensor on a long pole, because we could've sampled the steam trail we were so close to it. If I had to put an approximate size on this ufo, I'd say about 1 and 1/3 as tall as an SUV and as wide as 2 SUV's are long. It appeared to be round all around, with a flatter top and bottom, but we only saw it from one angle as it was travelling the same direction we were at about the same speed. As to the weather on this night, it was nice out, but getting pretty chilly because I wished I'd had my sweater with me. There were no clouds in the sky and it was probably about 40 degrees F.

As i drove closer to the hill, it turns beside it with a tree line to the right(in the direction that i was moving). The lights i saw ontop of the hill had moved down the hill towards me. I looked up out of my driver side window, and i saw an odly shaped craft that was moving slower that me, it seemed, in the opposite direction. My window was down and the radio was not turned on. This said, i heard no noise personally. Again, this object with lights was not shaped like anything that i have wittnessed. It was only 50 feet (at most) above my head. The best way that i can describe this is a craft with rounded backward wings. it had a spade like tail. I wish i could draw something on this description to help. It was not like my normal idea of what a space ship would look like. The most important aspect to make me believe that it was something Unidentified is the fact that it was only above the tree line, Moving extemely slow (i think slower than 40 mph), and most of all, it made no noise. (even a helicopter would have been loud at that altitude). To be honest, it freaked me out a bit. So, i didn't stick around to see which way it went.

Let me tell you that I live one mile from Ft. Drum military base. The skies are always lit up with something going over and I am very familiar with all the planes and flares, and many exercises they perform during the year. At first I though it was a helicopter but after a few minutes I noticed it was not moving and there was no noise at all. The light was very bright like a strobe light, flashing very quickly.It was just above the tree line, if i had to guess i would say about a mile away not very high up.the size was about the same as the street lights that are around our complex if that makes any sense to you.Yet it was about a mile away so i can`t guess the size. anyways i kept looking atit and it just stayed in the one position pulsing very quickly, my binoculars were downstairs and i wanted to get the but i was afraid when i got back it would be gone, went down anyways and got back and it was still there. When i focused in on the light i was amazed at what i saw!!  it was swirling colors, light pinks, blues, yellows oranges, all i can liken it to is pictures of thee Northern lights i have seen,  the shades if you can picture them condensed into a small sphere, it was the most beautiful thing i have ever seen in my life!  Yet when i looked at the light with a naked eye you could see no colors at all! After about 7-8 minutes it started to move off to the east I followed with my binoculars until i could see it no more. Total duration was 10 minutes. I have for weeks gone through all your reports and a lot of other reporting stations and could not find anything similar to what I saw.  I have checked all militery flare sites which dont relly have many good pictures and I have talked to military personal here in the complex and they had never heard of any flares like this. I have checked into entertainment strobe lighting, ball lightning, swamp gas, holograms, lazers, i have gone the gambit, just nothing i can compare it to.

At 9:30pm I began to hear unusual sounds of thunder which where consistent in pitch, tone, and duration.  As the thunder continued to rumble at consistent interavels I decided to look out on the back porch to check for a possible thunderstorm approaching.  Instead, I saw in the distance a bright off-white dome of light rise beyond the trees, which seemingly shed no light on surrounding objects in spite of it's brightness.  After a few seconds the bubble-like dome of light slowly descended back into the horizon of trees.  This light did not seem to be an object, but it appeared to be some type of energy concentration.  I stared mezmerized in the direction of the light for minutes when it then ascended back into view more quickly.  This time when it dropped out of view again a rapidly spinning object with blue and off-white lights quickly came up into the sky just above the trees.  It appeared to wobble a bit, but it was spinning very fast.  It only was in view for a few moments before it flew off into the sky and out of sight faster than anything I could comprehend.  The object seemed to come up from an area known as Dean's Hollow, which was located about a mile from where I was, but I can't say for sure if it did or not.  However, I saw what I saw.

At that time, my Grandmother and I noticed a grayish round object floating in the sky. It was almost like a perfectly rounded cloud. But, it was certainly not a cloud. I also noticed a place near by (possibly a jet) and suddenly, the round object started flying (very very fast) toward the plane and then disappeared. The plane continued to fly.  Now, a 7 year old kid and a Grandma may not seem like a credible source, but my Grandma, at the time, was only 52 years old and she still clearly remembers what happened to this day.

I was a student at Arizona State University and was driving home to Omaha after the Spring semester.  It was dusk (almost dark) as I went Eastbound on I-40.  I do not think I had crossed into New Mexico yet; I was not near any town at the time of the sighting.  I was driving a 1987 Pontiac Fiero (with the fuel-injected 6 cyl.) on cruise control at about 70 mph.  There were no other cars nearby.  Out of the corner of my right eye I caught sight of an airborne craft slowly overtaking me just off to the right side of the interstate.  The area where I was driving was quite flat.  I could not immediately identify the craft, but it had a rotating beacon underneath and a few other lights on it.  It was no more than 500 feet off the ground.  My first thought was ""this must be a cropduster following the highway to go home.""  I kept switching my gaze between the craft and the road, trying to identify the craft.  I am quite good at identifying aircraft in the sky.  With each look, however, I became more intrigued because nothing looked right.  I could not make out position lights at the wing tips, and the rotating beacon (which cast light on the underside of the craft) was multile colors, including blue and white.  I could not make out the edges of the bottom side of the craft, though I got the impression it was bascially circular.  The lit portion of the underbelly appeared grey.  The craft was about the size of a modern-day jet fighter perhaps.  Now very intrigued I sped up and caught closed the distance between me and the craft some.  My plan was to stop quickly, shut off my engine, hop out of the car, and listen for engine noise.  A radial engine, for example, sounds much different than a horizontally-opposed engine.  By the time I got out of my car the craft had proceeded away to a distance of less than 1/4 mile.  If it were a conventionally-powered aircraft of that size I could certainly have heard it.  The winds were calm on the ground.  I heard nothing.  Now I was very, very intrigued.  I jumped back in the car and gave chase along I-40.  I got up to about 100 mph and the craft appeared to be pacing me, not allowing me to approach it.  At that point I decided it was stupid to be going so fast and not paying attention to the road, so I began to slow down.  At that point the craft accelerated away and climbed.  The rate of acceleration was incredibly high.  The craft disappeared among the stars.  The exact day is a best-guess.  Also, the year is not certain -- it could have been spring of 1988, 1989, or 1990.  However, I think it was 1989. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was approximately 18 years old at the time.  (I am now 33 years old) My male companion and I were driving down an old country road, where we stopped off for a little car talk session, as we were having fun that night.  I turned of the car lights, but left the radio on.  Then the radio station started messing up and completely stopped.  I looked over at my friend, who at the time was approxiamately 17. I looked in front of the car and there was, what appeared to be a very bright street light about 100 feet in front of us.  I asked my friend if they had a new street light installed because it was bright.  He said no.  Then, I looked again, and the light had moved positions.  It was now hoving over a rural farm house that we had stopped by.  I asked him if the light had moved positions, and he laughed at me.  We both looked again, and it moved a third time.  This time it was hovering over a tree.  The house and tree looked bright as day.  The light was so bright that it was like putting a spot light right on them.  Only in a big way.  We both continued to watch the object as there was absolutely no sound, yet it moved.  I'm not sure that whoever was flying the craft realized that we were in the car watching, but we didn't move.  We watched the object come closer and we started getting very scared.  It came very close and we got a very detailed description.  The object was a grey-metallic color, it was saucer shaped.  It had what appeared to be tiny windows in the middle of the saucer, going all the way around it.  The object just hovered there and then it happened.  They turned on the lights.  Oh what amazing lights.  They were almost irridescent in color.  Red, Yellow, green, blue.  I could almost see like a fuschia pink/purple color in there.  Like a christmas tree with flashing lights.  Only they flashed the lights so fast that I couldn't keep up with the color changes.  My friend was punching me in my leg and screaming to drive, but all I could do was put my face in the windsheild and! say, ""L ook at all the pretty colors.""  Then I saw what seemed to be an almost transparent dome on the bottom of the saucer.  It was like a golden amber color.  I thought that maybe the bright lights were coming from that.  I mean the bright white light over the house and tree.  The dome wasn't very big at all.  Matter of fact, I would have never noticed it unless the thing was so close.  It was approximately 1 acre away, just hovering.  It was as close to me as my neighbors house is today.  I was completely mesmerized. Then, approximately 5 minutes after the last move and light show, it just stopped all lights and moved to the south as fast as it could.  It was gone in a flash, and I was shaken.   Of course, it was a very big ordeal and I told my parents about it immediately.  I stayed home from school for a while that week, as I was a senior in high school, and was very confused about the situation.  My friend had gone to school and when I went back, he had told people at school what we had seen.  I was embarrassed about it because I didn't want people knowing what we had seen.  I didn't want people to make fun of us about it or ask any questions.  Now that I'm older, I've learned to deal with this situation much better.  If anyone at the center has seen anything remotely close to what I've encountered, please let me know.  Curious.

In 1984, when I was 15, I was driving home with my Mom from the store. It was dusk, so there was still some light left. We were heading down Caton Farm Road, which, at the time, was just a two lane ""countryish"" road.  When we were roughly a half mile from our street, we noticed a very bright white light up ahead just over the trees. It was completely out of place and we wondered out loud what it was. As we got closer and were able to see what was responsible for the light, and I think we about crapped our pants. There was a huge grey, metal disk just hovering above the trees over our neighbors house at the corner of our street. It was completely still. I wish I could say how big it was, but I honestly couldn't say.  My Mom pulled over on the side of Caton Farm, a couple hundred yards away from it, at which point I flew out of the car and ran towards it. My Mom, of course, got out of the car and started screaming bloody murder for me to come back.  I stood on the corner of my street and Caton Farm and just stared at the thing. It was above the trees (maybe a hundred feet) and shining a white light down that lit up my neighbors back yard. I can't remember how long it sat there in the sky, but it wasn't more than a minute or so. When it left, it was really surreal, because it looked like it wasn't moving that fast, but it disappeared from my sight so quickly. It just went up and then followed Caton Farm until it was gone.  I had never been so excited as when I saw that thing. The first thing I did when I got home was to call both the police station and the local airport to see if anyone else had reported it. No one had, unfortunately.  My Mom wouldn't talk about it with me and would get mad if I tried to bring it up. I think it really scared her.  The next day, I couldn't wait to tell everyone in my Earth Science class. I picked that class because the teacher was really cool, and we always had great discussions about weird stuff. Needless to say, I was just about laughed out of the classroom.  I told a few other people over the next couple of years, but after hearing ""are you sure it wasn't a helicopter"" one too many times, I never talk about it anymore.  Until I found this site, I thought I was one in a million to see such a thing. I'm glad to know I'm not. I just wish the government would come clean with what they know. I hate the fact that I saw this amazing thing and have no idea what it means. At any rate, I'm so glad I got to see it.

Early August, 1984  My daughter and her classmate and I were headed home by car, southwest out of Caribou, Maine (Aroostook County), at about 9 p.m. The early evening summer sky was already quite dark, and I observed to my right a large, bright object in the sky very close to the horizon and moving slowly east. I kept a keen eye on the light, and at one point it stopped, and then it moved very quickly east at a more rapid speed than it had been traveling, almost like it had been shot out of a cannon. Then it reversed direction and traveled back to where it had been before. This erratic movement made me curious as to what I was watching.  As I moved along the road through woods and farmland, up and down and around curves, I tried to keep up with the object, and as I rounded a turn and made for the straightaway ahead, the object approached us on the right in a slow and deliberate manner. I crossed through an intersection and came to a complete stop to watch the object in the sky cross over us from right to left about thirty to fifty feet above my car. Our car windows were rolled down, and there was no sound at all.  The aircraft appeared to be egg-shaped or round with an unorganized array of lights, mostly amber-orange, red, and white covering the outside. It appeared to be from fifty to 100 feet high.  A large beam of light was directed down from the bottom of the craft like a search light, and it was whipping back and forth as if it was searching the stand of trees as it flew over.  The craft disappeared into the woods east of us, and we did not see it again. Needless to say, we were all VERY shook up and were not really sure what we had actually seen. I did not report this sighting to anyone, but I have witnesses in my daughter and her classmate to corroborate this amazing event.

(This is a follow-up to a report I had submitted previously) A friend and I observed what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft as we traveled south on Highway 52 near Mt. Airy, NC. At first, I thought that we were approaching some kind of lit up construction site near the treeline on the opposite side of the highway. I was reaching across from the passenger seat adjusting the radio when I noticed this anomaly. The lights looked three dimensional, for lack of a better description. When I realized that the lights were attached to an object and actually gaining altitude, I directed my friend's (the driver) attention to that direction. We both kept asking each other what this thing was that we were watching. The underside of the object had a white light on each corner and a bigger, very bright light in the center shining on the ground below. As the object slowly and deliberately rose above the treeline, the light in the center went out. The remaining three lights, which had been rotating clockwise while the object ascended, came to a stop. Then the lights slowly rotated about a half of a revolution counter-clockwise and cocked up at an angle simultaneously, which put the lights facing almost directly at our passing car. After a brief pause, the object silently 'blinked' out of the atmosphere in a split second, zig-zagging in what seemed like thousands of small straight lines.  We soon noticed that no traffic was visible in either direction during/after the sighting, which was eerily improbable on this busy four lane highway at that time. The FM radio, which had suddenly failed just prior to the sighting, then started working again (this gave us a scare because I had inadvertantly turned the volume all the way up in my troubleshooting effort). Much to our relief, the normal amount of oncoming traffic soon resumed in the northbound lanes, although we did not see any headlights behind us in the southbound lanes the rest of the 20+ miles to our exit - we also looked northward from the bridge while crossing back over the highway after exiting and could not see any headlights approaching.  We were very intrigued by what we had experienced as one might expect. Upon reaching our destination, we came to a very disturbing realization, however. The thirty minute trip, which we had made many times before, had taken us almost FOUR HOURS. There was absolutely no explanation for the missing time and we were totally dumbfounded. The only thing that we could figure was that since we were almost directly under the UFO,  we must have been affected by its energy field. That would also explain the lack of continuity in the flow of traffic, we surmised.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,36.4617,-80.6191

My Boyfriend and I were heading back to my house in the country late one night on a dirt road in 1988. I cannot remember the date exactly, only that it must have been springtime, because of where I lived during that time. As we drove we noticed some strange lights in the sky. I was intrigued and told him to turn around to get a better look. We turned around and headed back the way we came. We drove slowly, and there were 2 other cars on the road. One car was heading in our original direction. It slowed down and then took off quickly. The other car was coming up slowly behind us. We began driving very slowly, looking at the object. It was cigar shaped and had blinking lights. There were colors but not a big difference in color, more like changes in shade. Anyway, the lights were on the ends of the object forming circular rings around each end., appearing like rotating ends. We put the windows down to see if we could hear any sounds, but heard none. Then suddenly, the ends of the object came off and suspended for a second, then shot in an upward direction so fast that it left a light trail. We weren’t quite believing what we were seeing but the ends that had come off then began a zigzag like pattern in the sky, traveling very fast. We couldn’t believe how fast. We were thinking out loud trying to figure out what type of craft could move that way, but never could think of one. The main object remained stationary, but still had lights blinking. The 2 objects that had split off also had lights blinking. They returned to the main craft after a few minutes. The object remained where it was and we were trying to decide what we would do. Then it appeared to get lower in the sky. I was very excited, but my boyfriend was scared. I was acting like I was high on something and wanted to get closer to it. I was really afraid, but more excited. I don’t know , I must have had an adrenaline rush. We had totally forgotten about the car behind us and then noticed they were right behind us and watching too. We motioned for them to come up next to us. They drove up parallel to our car and we started talking about what we were seeing. They were obviously scared and didn’t want to wait around for whatever “it” was to come closer. We did agree that we could not explain what we were seeing. They decided to leave and sped away. It was 2 women, but didn’t get any names. We stopped in the road and looked at it, then realized it was moving slowly along the tree line. The road we were traveling on was next to a young  pine grove, with older trees behind it.  It was hard to judge how close we were to the object, but I’d estimate within a half mile. The object was moving above the older trees and there didn’t seem to be too much distance between it and the tree tops. We didn’t say anything to each other for a little while, then I said I wanted to get closer. We sped up along the road to catch up and then realized it seemed to be drifting towards us, purposefully. Well, this definitely sounded alarms and we both decided to get the hell out of there. It was almost like, they had “spotted” us. We get home and we tell my parents and siblings all about it. We go over everything with them to try and come up with a rational explanation. We never did. Time has passed. I wish I had gotten the names of the other people who saw it. I wish I had pursued more information. I have never been able to come up with anything of this earth that could have done what “it” did. That feeling has never left me. I married that boyfriend and he has been plagued with “night terrors”, or so they say. He will wake up all hours of the night screaming, or talking out of his mind about “things” coming to get him. He has a scar that no one in his family can remember an injury that caused it. We joke about it being where “they” took him and did experiments. I know it is not funny. I truly believe that we experienced something from beyond our understanding. An interesting thing about that is we moved away from Mississippi in 2004 to the northwest US and he has not had one “night terror” since we moved. I had 2 other interesting events occur like this in my childhood that I had put away as a trick of the mind, and didn‘t let myself see it any differently. I took in a lot more of this event than the others. I am a Christian by faith. I believe the Bible, I believe in my salvation. I am not afraid that there is something else out there. Many people believe it is blasphemy to believe that there are “others”. I don’t. Who are we to believe that we are the only ones in the universe? That there isn’t room for more. I don’t know what we saw that day.  I may never know. I do know that, because of my belief in an all powerful God, that ANYTHING is possible.

I put my arms up for some strange reason.   All I can remember after that is standing there with my arms down to my sides as I watched the object leave.  It went to the right, then up to the left, and then went straight up. This probably took a matter of maybe 3 seconds before I could no longer see it.  I got back into the car and it was 2:00am.

I was in my neghbor's backyard shoveling snow off of the basketball half court when I noticed the UFO.  It was to in the front of the house just over the oak tree tops in an opening in the tree branches that made it visible.   I was convinced that this thing was watching me.  It was about the size if a mini van.  It was the shape of a plump M&M candy.  It was inky black in appearance and would have probably gone unnoticed by me save for the lights in it. There were three white lights on its underside. They were about the size of those saucer sleds that kids use. They were not airplane lights but big and round lights. The lights curiously did not illuminate the rest of the object.  It remained absolutely silent and stationary for maybe ten minutes or so.  I was terrified the moment that I saw it.  I also stood motionless the entire time of ten minutes.  All I could do was hope that this was not going to turn out to be an abduction.  I was fearfully dreading seeing those little monsters with big black almond shaped eyes.   Nothing at all happened to me.  I decided to start shoveling again and pretend it wasn't there. The moment that I looked away the UFO left.  I just remember looking down for a second and then looking back up there and there was no sighn of it. Then I ran somewhat toward where the thing was in order to get to the gate and then run into my house.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. That was all that happened. My personal interpretation of this was loooong thought over and pounded through in a lot of objective consideration.  In the end and after many changes in my life and a radical transformation which began in late 1996 I came to a sound and peace filled conclusion.  If I indeed saw something that night (meaning that this was not in my mind) it was unquestionably supernatural. The thoughts that I progressivly began to consider brought more and more confusion, meaninglessness and ultimately despair into my heart.  What would the existence of alien Intelligent life mean to me?  Why would they come here?  Why me?  What does this say about humanity's origen and its inextricably linked purpose for existence and its destiny?  Is the abduction phenomenon real?   I read quite a number of books about all these things.  Many different explanations were offered. The acceptance of any one of them would impact my world view tremendously and therefor my life would be conducted based on my conclusions which I was desparate for.   Years later after putting faith in the God of the Bible and His Son, Jesus, I saw things in a new and clear light.  Mankind is actually created by an entirely supernatural God.  We were created to be his children.  This means that we are in many ways like Him.  One thing is for sure:  He is the absolutely most superior person there is.  We are created as the most phenominal and superior life form, reflecting our creator (in the image of God).  Thus, there can not be any life that is more capable or ""intelligent"" in any way comparable to Mankind.  There are however both good and evil entities called angels (messengers of God. The ""evil"" ones wish to hide and distort the truth about God and thus bring death and destruction to humanity through sin.  God conversly works through His unique and eternal God-man Son, Jesus, to intervine and save people.  Hence, the reality that there is to the UFO/abduction phenomenon can be attribed to these categories:  1. Natural or explainable phenomenon. 2. People who are crazy to one level or another, or on drugs, etc. 3. Secret military aircraft. 4. Evil spirits expressing themselves through UFOs and abductors as an effective means to mislead people into believing in lies about God and mankind.  Lies like ""you are your own god"" or Atheistic evolution theories, various magical, new age, and eastern mysticism worldviews.  The list never ends because there is no reliable measuring tool for interpreting the phenomenon. As a believer in Jesus however, I have made it a priority to either validate or repudiate the Bible as a true book from the one creator God.  A careful search into this will reveal to anyone that the book is fully relable. Jesus can save us and also bring the universe and life into its proper context. This is liberating. ""If you obey my words than you are really my disciples (followers); and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."" Jesus, John 8:31-32.  Have you experience truth and freedom?

Half way through my journey, I came to a T junction, no cars where on the road at the time, when I all of a sudden felt rather strange, like when you think someone is watching you. I looked up to see a large disk shaped object hovering over me, around 60 to 70 foot in the air, it was around 50 foot in diameter, it was silent except for a very low sounding hum, a little like a power station hum. The craft was circular with a ball in the centre, that seemed to be glowing orange like the cherry of a cigarette, the circular space outside of the glowing ball was like a black metal, kind of a dark purple silver. There was also a smell that reminded me of electronics class at school, it was of a sulphur type of smell, like when you are using a soldering iron.  I am not sure exactly the amount of time I stood there for until I turned to see a man had come out of his home, maybe about 20 seconds since first seeing it, he was standing on his doorstep looking much the same as I was, staring up at the craft in amazement, although the craft was directly over my head, I did not feel scared at the time, I was to confused as to what I was looking at to feel anything. After what must have been about 30 more seconds to a minute, it slowly and silently ascended upwards around another 100 or so foot, then moved forwards towards the north of me for about 50 yards, hovered for a few seconds, and then shot of to my right, which was the direction of RAF Odiham around 8 miles away, the craft moved so fast that it looked like it just vanished in thin air, but you could just make out that it moved off in a certain direction, the only sound it made was a slight whooshing sound, as if it had disturbed the air as it sped through the atmosphere.  I looked back at the man on his doorstep, and he was looking at me in a confused manner, I then started to feel a little worried in case it came back, and continued on my journey home, I got home in a very excited state at what I had seen, my parents I think thought I had gone loopy, I calmed down somewhat and went to bed as I had school the following day, that night I started to feel very unnerved, as I was starting to think could it ever come back?.  The following day I got up tired, because of lack of sleep, and went to catch my school bus, which was only a few yards from where I saw the craft, while waiting I went and knocked on the mans door who had also seen it, because I was desperate to find out what he had thought it was, his wife (I think) answered the door, I asked if her husband was in and she asked why, and I said because I wanted to know what he thought about that strange thing last night, and she became agitated and told me not to speak such silly nonsense, then as she was closing the door I saw the man with shaving foam all over his face, but the women closed the door, so I never got to find out what he thought about the experience.  I often wonder if anyone else had seen it from there window, maybe not though, as it was very silent (If anyone did please Email me, I would love to hear from you, it happened by the Hook bypass greenhaze@hamptonroads.com).  I am not sure what it was, maybe a secret military craft, or maybe an alien craft, but I really don’t believe that with our modern technology, that we could build something so perfect as what I saw that night. I did not imagine it either, as the man definitely saw it too, and the day after the women at the house acted as if her husband (or boy friend) had told her about it based on her reaction.

In the late spring of 1990, I received a call from my neighbor - the wife of a workmate and my wife's friend - who lived across our parking lot in military housing on top of Stoney Lonesome, a small mountain at West Point, NY.  She said, go outside and look up . ..  I did so and over my head came a set of lights in a boomerang configuation.  (Immediately after this event, I made a drawing of the lights, but have since lost it).  The lights were arranged in five or six sets of three.  The three lights in each set were identical: pastel yellow, green and blue.  There were some smaller red lights, but not in a configuration common on commercial or military aircraft.  The sets of lights were absolutely symetrical in their arrangement and fixed in their relationship.  My wife joined me and alerted our neighbors to our right who also came outside to look. The lights were relatively low, and I could hear the throb of an engine.  The sound is best described as the sound made when a set of twin boat engines is operating a little out of synch.  Its speed was very slow and it made a turn around our small area during which I saw a small red light behind the ""craft"" move suddenly to the craft and disappear, like it was on a tether.  Its speed remained slow, so slow that I wondered if it was ligher than air . . .  faster than drifting (there was no perceptible wind) but definitely powered in a direction at a speed that should not have supported aerodynamic flight.  As the craft completed its maneuver, it moved east toward the Hudson River.  It was soon behind the two story duplex across from me.  I estimated its altitude above me at about 400 feet (based upon clarity with which I could see the lights and hear the sound).  It was two fists wide, perhaps.  Using the roof line of the opposing duplex (which eventually obscured the craft from view) as a reference, I make the following estimate of its size.  The duplex was approximately 30 feet tall (top of roof line) and 40 feet wide.  When it was obsured by the roof line, the craft was about half the width of the duplex.  If the craft was at 400 feet and did not change altitude as it moved east, and my eyes were at about 5 feet above the ground, then the craft's width was approximately equal to 8000/25 or 320 feet, a very large craft.  I also estimate that the distance from my viewing point to the duplex roofline was 80 feet, making the distance the craft traveled before it was obscured to be approximately 32000/25 or 1240 feet, almost 1/4 mile. It probably took about 30 seconds for the craft to travel that distance once it headed that way, making its speed to that point approximately 30 miles per hour, very slow for an aircraft! (I did these calculations as I am now making this report).  I called Stewart AFB and reported the sighting . . . or more appropriately inquired as to what might have been over this Federal installation.  A coupld days later they returned my call and told me it was several ultra-lights operating in formation.  After seeing this craft do a 270 degree turn without changing geometry and after hearing a sound that did not equate to more than two engines, I knew this was not a plausible explanation.  Strangely enough, I shortly thereafter was given the book Communion by Whitley Striber.  I didn't even realize, as I read it, that he lives across the Hudson and a bit south from West Point.  It was amazing to read his descriptions and the explanations given to him by Steward AFB!  The following week I talked to a couple of the cadets we sponsored and learned that they heard cadets talking about something strange they saw circling over the Academy!  Lastly, my partner's father saw the same object in Connecticuit approximately the same time!  I didn't learn of that until 13 years later.  For your notes, I was at the time a Major in the Army teaching electrical engineering at the US Military Academy, from which I graduated in 1976; I recieved a MSEE (control systems) from the University of Washington in Seattle prior to teaching at the Academy. I do consider myself a trained observer of scientfic data and annomalies. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,41.39214,-73.96292

The lights were so near, and the pattern so large that I had to lean forward to look up through the windshield glass to see all three at the same time. After watching them for a while, we saw that the stars behind the ""triangle"" disappeared as the lights moved. The three bright lights seemed very close to us, and we kept remarking at how strange they looked. They moved as a unit with each of the three lights equally distant from the other two.  At first they seemed to be moving with traffic, but after some time had gone by, they began to pull ahead of us. Gradually, they moved far enough ahead of us that the pattern was smaller than the rearview mirror, and they appeared to be at less than five degrees above the horizon. Before they (it) pulled completely away from us, I recall seeing a military jet being refueled in the sky and the lights seemed to be nearer to the ground than the two planes engaged in the refueling. We had no scale to measure it, but it seemed to be twenty times the size of the larger plane. Finally, it disappeared in the sky over the East bound highway. We had been so interested in the lights that we missed seeing the Mississippi River (and our exit to the Quad Cities) and ended up about 30 miles into Illinois. We had to find and exit and backtrack 40 miles to Rock Island. Neither of us had seen anything like this before.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,41.555164116094986,-90.5987598944591

Not something a plane can accomplish, especially back in the mid seventies.  There were to white lights, kind of moving back and forth, slowly.  It would move to the right, stop, move back to it's origanl position, then to the left, and then back to it's position again.  It would do this all the time for nights at a time, when it was a clear starry night.  Finally one night when I watching it, it just shot up at an angle at unbelieveable speed and it was gone.  I never experianced it again.  I've seen lights that illuminated, in a strobe like matter, starting with a large bright white light, to a green, red, blue, back to a brillant white again.  Seen that all the time.  Mainly in the fall months when the sky was clear.  My most favorite happened in the late 90's when I used to go out almost every night just to see what I could see.  I was getting ready to head in for the evening when suddenly a black, triangler object, about the size of a small plane hovered like a kite over my head. It was triangler shaped, black, thin, it had 3 round orange lights at each corner.  It was completely silent.  When it finished going over, and I couldn't see the underneth any more, it turned on its side, so I could until it was out of sight..

Very sharp edges.  The center of the donut was dark like the rest of the sky. No noises, no electrical disturbances. The 2 objects were identical, approx.2 times the size of the moon  It is not easy to estimate the altitude, but it must be at the cloud level, because their size was constant.

"In the summer of 1972 my family and I witnessed many UFO sightings above and around Folsom Lake, California.",Loomis & Folsom Lake,CA,1972-06-30T00:00:00,unknown,Summer of 1972,"Occurred : 6/30/1972  Reported: 11/10/2007 8:42:13 PM 20:42 Posted: 11/28/2007 Location: Loomis & Folsom Lake, CA Shape: Unknown Duration:Summer of 1972",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59743.html,"In the summer of 1972 my family and I witnessed many UFO sightings above and around Folsom Lake, California. I am 59 years of age now and my two brothers and three sisters still talk about the spring and summer of 1972.  I was 23 years old then and my older sister lived on three acres, less than two miles from Folsom Lake.  The area she lived in at that time was very wooded and remote.   Many evenings and well into the early morning hours she would phone either me or one of my brothers, excited or even frightened over what she was seeing in her pasture or in the nearby fields.  Her horses became restless, dogs barking, and upon looking out from her large living-room window she would see one or more orange objects often glowing bright and then dimming.   Upon her phone calls, my two brothers and I would drive out to her house, often during the middle of the night.  Many times we would see the objects before arriving at her house.  There is simply too much to relate in this posting, but I will say that what we witnessed during those spring and summer nights of 1972 were without question neither airplanes nor helicopters.   We drove our parents out there on a few occasions and they too were completely baffled as to what these objects were.  There were never any sounds coming from the objects.  Among a host of reports I could now relate, I will focus upon my two most memorable sightings:  1) Standing outside of our car at the edge of Folsom Lake and observing one or more bright orange objects moving erratically then pausing and hovering motionlessly without a sound.  One such object actually shot a high beam or light directly onto the water.  It was a very dark moonless night and I remember that we spoke of how easily we could see the ripples of the lake water once the beam of light penetrated the lake.  It was so strange since there was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  These objects maneuvered, as I say, erratically, often pausing, disappearing, and reappearing almost instantly in another location.  At times they would seem to fall and rock from side to side reminding me of a lightweight falling feather.  2) On another memorable occasion we (my brothers and I) drove back out to the Folsom area after receiving a phone call from my sister.  This time we were parked atop a bluff on Sierra College Blvd.  We witnessed several bright orange objects in the distance.  I cannot make any estimates as to how far they were or how high they were; all I can say is that they appeared to be about the size of goftballs from where we were.  I recall how truly amazed we were as we witnessed six or seven smaller objects slowly moving toward a large orange object.  It appeared to us that as each smaller object neared the larger one they actually disappeared, as if they entered the large object.  Not saying that they actually entered the large object, but this is the appearance they gave.  As the last smaller object entered or disappeared, suddenly all six or seven smaller objects would reappear and begin the entire process over again.  We watched this phenomena repeat itself for nearly an hour as I recall.  I could write several pages on all of the UFO activity that we witnessed in and around Loomis and Folsom Lake during that particular summer long ago.  To my knowledge nothing of that magnitude has ever occurred there since that time.  No members of my family have ever reported it until now, 35 years later.  During that summer we read absolutely nothing in the newspapers of these mysterious orange glowing lights over Folsom Lake.  What we saw was certainly not ball lightning, aircraft, swamp gas, meteors, or anything that is easily explained. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was somewhere between 10 and 11 at night and I was watching television in my livingroom ..and this room had a picture window in it so that if I looked out of my window I would be able to see the lawn behind my building and also see a back shed for storage…This shed had lights on it so that the yard was lit up. Well this particular evening I was watching television and sitting on my couch...my son was in his bedroom, when all of a sudden the television turned off.  Just went black.and at the same time, the lights in my apartment went out…I saw flashing lights  .alot of flashing goin on and I heard like a buzzing loud noise…didn’t understand what was going on so I arose from the couch to take a look.  What I saw…all I can say is…I was stupefied……I  called to my son to come quickly to take a look…and as we stood in the window…we actually saw a spacecraft….or whatever it was…flying saucer? Land in our backyard.  It was perhaps 15 ft wide  and round and had some sort of dome on the top whereas it opened and  six or seven people….when I say people  I don’t know what they were but they looked like human bodies….there were 6 or seven of them that climbed out of this spacecraft and they all appeared to be wearing spacesuits with helmets on.  They were all working..by that I mean they were doing some kind of job…sort of like unloading something and lifting things and handing them to each other. I couldn’t tell what they were doing with this stuff or what it was that had them all working together..seemed a little frantic…like they were in a hurry…from what I can remember…  While my son and I were watching this..I remember thinking…I wonder if I could walk down the back stairway and open the back door so I could get a better look but was so afraid at that point that maybe I would be putting myself or my son in harms way that….I don’t know  cant remember anything about the rest of that night…and never spoke with anyone about what I saw for fear of being ostracized….It has been after all of these years…I am now 64 years old…and starting to remember more…of which is very disturbing to me…in no uncertain terms  I awoke this morning…and oddly remembered something about that night…that is most disturbing to me.  I do remember that at some point while I must have gone back to the couch…not sure about sequence…so much is all mixed up in my mind…but I now remember that my television came back on but it was not your regular television. I was the aliens that were on my television screen….and now that I remember what they showed me. I am mortified about the whole thing…. They showed me the destruction of the world…huge storms….devestation…showed me wars going on all over the world…showed me explosions…people being devastated by storms and fires and water and it was so horrific seeing all that on my television that night that I think somehow it was too much information  for my brain…I either got shut down somehow by them or they did something to my memory…..What I find odd is that I am only now starting to remember..and naturally…it is extremely unsettling and I wish with all my heart that I could talk with someone who knows and believes about these things happening..because when I try to talk about it…people thing you are crazy…they don’t believe me and I find that most disturbing.  I am a normal woman….I know I am not crazy…this has been such a burden to me in my life…never understanding what and why I saw this……I realize this is old information…very old…but I guess I need to talk with someone and found this site because of the internet…..

I actually have 3 sightings: The first was when I was stationed at Ft. Huachuca, AZ, in July, 1973. My friend, Ed Knees and I were going northbound toward Huachuca City (where we both lived off base), at approximately 22:30 hours, when I noticed a golden light pacing us. I mentioned this to Ed, who said it was probably the moon reflecting on electrical or telephone wires. After I pointed out that the wires were on his side, he stopped the van. We both observed the light, which was stationary at this time, until Ed used the spotlight mounted to the top of his van (used for hunting at night). Right after Ed flashed the light at the “ufo”, it completely vanished. The really unusual thing was, it made absolutely NO sound whatsoever. This base also had rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and I am very familiar with the current US governmental inventory. This occurrence took approximately 10 minutes.  Second sighting: July, 1985 - I was sitting in a hot tub with 2 other friends, at approximately 21:00 hours, when we all noticed a oval craft, going over our heads. This craft had green, blue and white lights going in a counter-clockwise circle, around the craft. We were just 2 miles from the Concord Naval Weapons Station (carried nukes) in a town called Antioch, California, and the craft made absolutely NO noise -–not even a whisper. Again, I am familiar with most fixed wing and rotor aircraft, and this did not fit that inventory! This incident took approximately 5 minutes.  Third sighting: August, 1985, same location (Antioch, California).  At approximately 02:00 hours, I got up from watching the TV, to get a drink at the kitchen sink. I happened to look up to see a very large, dark gray triangular object apparently floating in the air, approximately 5000 feet altitude. It had red glowing lights on each point, and a softly glowing white light in the center. This craft also made no noise at all. After 2 or 3 minutes, it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.

My self and two of my cousins were walking along the street heading west. We were going to have pizza. Ahead of us the houses thin out and there was a section of about two city blocks where there were no houses, just grass lots. Beyond that was a small unused strip mall,some fast food and other types of stores. Beyond that was Interstate 57. As we talked we noticed a string of red lights appear above the dark strip mall. We could make out a form that was darker than the night sky.  To me seemed round with the lights ringing the middle. I would say it was about 30-40 feet across.The object started to move very slowly to the north west. I remember we talked about what it could be, One of my cousins said it must be a helicopter to move so slowly and hover like that. About that time the lights went out. a few moments later a small private airplane crossed the sky to the south east. We could plainly hear its motor. That ruled out a helicopter. The object could still be made out as a dark spot in the sky. It moved west until it reached the interstate highway at which it moved lower and went north along the highway. We could plainly see the traffic moving under it. It went north along roadway until just about the exit/overpass at which time it tilted skyward and in a blur was gone. We were shocked and at this point we knew it was nothing we could point a finger at and say ""that was it"" We talked excitedly and ran to the pizza place. We had been there maybe three minutes. Standing in line to place our order when a man in his early 20's came running in. He was hysterical. He asked where the phone was, he had just chased a UFO on the interstate. People in line snickered and we stopped talking about it until we were seated. Obviously he had seen the same thing we had.

Nightime visitation in Connecticut-1973; this was a probable abduction.,Manchester,CT,1975-07-10T01:00:00,unknown,30-60 min,"Occurred : 7/10/1975 01:00  (Entered as : 07/10/1975 01:00) Reported: 11/25/2007 6:11:11 PM 18:11 Posted: 11/28/2007 Location: Manchester, CT Shape: Unknown Duration:30-60 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60035.html,"Nightime visitation in Connecticut-1973; this was a probable abduction. When I was seven years old I had a terrifying experience that I kept to myself for weeks and was unable to sleep at night and refused to go my bedroom at night.  My parents had to let me fall asleep in the den with them and they would then carry me up to my room.  Upon finally talking to them about what was worrying me their reaction was almost as scary as the original event.  When I spoke of this with them they turned ghostly pale and seemed very stressed- although my mother did manage to muster out that it must have been ""just a dream.""  	One night in the summer of'73, I woke to find two small grey beings standing in my bedroom looking at me. (This was before any mention of, or description of, alien abductions had been put on T.V. or in the movies-to my knowledge at that time, anyway.)  The beings could not have been much taller than 4 feet, they had very large almond shaped black eyes, they were slender and their mouths were just slits.  One of the beings walked towards me and spoke to me telepathically. I could not move and I was clearly very fearful. I asked him if he was a Martian and he said, no, but you are right that we are from another planet.  I don’t remember much that happened after that, but I do remember looking towards the hallway (my door was open and the hall light was on), and I saw my father being carried out by several of the small beings out of the hall and down into the stairwell.  The only other memory of this event- which is slightly detached-is that I remember a different being, slightly larger but with the same large eyes, hovering over me, telling me that they wont hurt me and then forcing me to drink some white liquid that had the appearance of milk but had a horrible chemical taste. 	During my subsequent years I think I chose to forget this traumatic experience. But one day when I was in my late teens I was walking past a bookstore and saw a display of Whitley Streiber’s book ""Communion.""  When I saw that  face on the cover of the book I went into a cold sweat and had a panic attack.  It took several months to get up the courage to purchase that book and read it. These memories then came back to me.  I have not pursued hypnotherapy to reveal any further truths, simply because I really don’t think I want to know-not yet anyway.  I swear to you that this really did happen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2007-11-28T00:00:00,41.77653827160494,-72.52271851851853

I lived up at the top of Briggs on Freeman, way up by Angelese National Forest.  Very few lights, very little people.  I went out of my house to walk down the street to babysit the neighbor's kid.  I was in an astronomy class in high school, so every time I went out at night I checked the skies to identify constellations.  I looked up, as usual, and saw over in the north-northeast three ""stars"" in a triangle shape.  It stumped me, because I could figure out what constellation it was.  I remember thinking something about the Summer Triangle; most likely that it couldn't be the Summer Triangle because of the time of year or location.  I assumed it was a constellation that wasn't easily seen in town, and I was just lucky to catch it on a clear night, up in the foothills where there were no lights to interfere.  I went on down the street to babysit. A few hours later I returned home.  It was close to 11:00 p.m. or so, and I again looked up into the sky.  The same ""constellation"" was in the same location.  I knew at that point that it was impossible, after several hours, those stars should have moved.  I stopped to watch them.  I noticed they were brigher than the other stars.  As I watched, the three points of the triangle came together in the center, scrambled around each other, then shot off in three different directions at an incredible speed.  Needless to say, I was a little freaked and ran into my house. The next morning I heard my parents talking in the kitchen before I got up.  They said something about not mentioning anything to me, because with my imagination it would scare me.  Years later I asked them both about the incident.  They both remembered that my father had gone outside after I had left to babysit.  He went to close the garage door.  He also saw the lights.  Something happened, he never did tell me what, but whatever it was was more than just three ""stars"" up in the sky, otherwise there would have been no need to protect me from what was seen. So, apparently I saw them in formation, went indoors, and in the interval between my two sightings of them, my father also saw something.  Maybe they broke formation and scrambled off, like they did with me, but for what ever reason they came back in time to put a show on for me when I went back outside.

Second craft was observed for a good period of time and was definitely present and was not a reflection or trick of the light.Importantly, My position was in very close proximity to the Mt. Whipple observatory atop Mt. Hoplins,directly to the South. Running lights were no longer able to be observed from my perspective when the craft had reached these higher altitudes. Craft apparently were travelling up and away toward the Northeast from my position, since Light apeared to grow smaller, grow larger, get smaller again and then wink out. Observed phenomenon for a good 10 to fifteen minutes from around 5:05 to 5:20 am from  when I came in and imediately noted my impressions. Have previously witnessed Belgium triangular style craft over Marcola Hills (Springfield) in southern Oregon in fall of 1997, and had quick glimpse of boomerang wing craft over this location last year.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,31.847831999999997,-111.04981199999999

The triangle is exactly 1"" wide on bottom side and 3/8"" from the center of this side to the top with both ends narrowing into a perfectly very thin point, particularly visible on the left (wrist) side.

We had ascended to a nearby cliff division and took a five minute break.  There was a wind from the SW 15-20 mph and the skies were mostly clear.  I noticed a few large aircraft pass through overhead which is normal in this area.  I looked away viewing the area around us when I look back up - directly above our resting location when I noticed a large round white object.  It was about one-half the size of the moon at this point and was not moving.  I pointed it out to my brother and we looked at it for about 2-3 minutes while it remained motionless above us.  It was obvious to us that it was not a balloon and did not resemble any of the other aircraft in the vicinity.  I had sunglasses on that have polarized lenses so I could see with fair clarity when I realized the object had nearly doubled in size and had turned mostly bright red.  My brother seconded this observation and the object began rotating and changing its physical appearance.  This began happening about 5 minutes after our initial sighting.  It was rotating in a clockwise motion and appeared almost translucent or had some kind of field around it that gave it a translucent appearance.  The red color of the object slowly became larger and smaller as it rotated.  It would become oblong, oval, round, square, and sometimes appear to have protrusions that seemed to come out of the body of the object itself.  We then noticed large aircraft begin coming in from all directions and seemed to have changed their original trajectory in order to come into contact with the object.  Presumably they are of military origin and had detected them on radar or from some type of space platform.  3 of these aircraft came close to the object but I am unable to approximate the altitude.  You could see contrails that slowly disappeared behind the jet aircraft.  Then the object disappeared. I waited for about two minutes when suddenly an identical type of object as the first appeared in the same location and was bright white and was also rotating.  Then a small bright turquoise light appeared to come out of it and was shining much brighter than a star.  It moved away from the other craft and appeared to dance around to the side of the other object for about 3-4 minutes.  I could see more aircraft begin to aim towards the objects when suddenly the phenomenon disappeared.  We waited for about a half hour and no other objects were sighted on that day. The next day Sunday, my family and I witnessed a larger sighting that I will report for the appropriate date. I had also submitted an earlier report which can be seen at  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16585.html",2008-06-12T00:00:00,35.503425,-108.8373625

She was driving while I rode in the front passenger side.  The road to the highway from our home slopes downhill and gives you a view of NW Gallup on the outskirts and a railroad system that goes W to E.  I was describing to my wife an encounter that had happened to my brother and I, just the day before almost exactly 24 hours ago.  I then looked ahead above the railroad tracks as we went down the hill and saw a bright white round object and I stated that what I had seen earlier looked exactly like it!  While we proceeded closer I could see that it was not moving in any conventional manner.  It did not appear to be moving at all.  Suddenly two more identical objects appeared to the N and to the SW of the initial object.  We turned down Highway 66 and I had become quite excited by this point.  We took another turn which goes north and across the railroad tracks and then took another right which takes you down Warehouse Lane, which is home to Burlington Northern, and a few other municipal installations.  I had my window rolled down and I had not taken my eyes off of the formation when we had come to a stop off the side of the road.  I got out and looked above and could still see three objects when suddenly I could see one more, then another, then 6.  They seemed to just appear from nothing and then I detected some that looked like they were coming down from space at very high speed.  They zipped down so fast that a few looked almost like a meteor coming down.  They were all moving independent of each other and it had gotten to a point were I could count up to 12 of them.  They were at different altitudes from each other but all were going in a mostly W – SW direction.  It was partly cloudy and windy at about 20-25 mph from the SW.  I noticed one object that was different from the rest in that it was quite a bit larger than the rest (about the size of a quarter held at arms length) and was rapidly rotating and changing forms.  It looked somewhat translucent but it seemed like it had some kind of field that enveloped around the shape of the object.  Around the edge of the field was slightly brownish and seemed much closer than the other objects.  I could see approaching aircraft coming in from all directions and are what I would deduce to be military jumbo type aircraft.  When a few of these planes came close a few of the objects actually appeared to be playing with the jets.  They flew in very close proximity to the planes and flew even alongside them for a moment or two.  The formation almost seemed like a flock of geese or a school of fish in the ocean the way in which they moved with each other. There was no noticeable noise that came from these objects.  They all slowly disappeared through a cloud front that was approaching from the W or by just disappearing as the fleet headed W.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,35.503425,-108.8373625

While travelling west out of Belfast on the 16th of March 2008 along the Ligoneill road over Wolf-hill, I, the driver of the car noticed an object in the sky. The hill was a steep uphill climb so I could afford to take a good look while driving uphill. I estimate it was perhaps 50,000 ft because of the type of clouds that it was travelling above. I quickly realised that it was no ordinary aeroplane because the speed it was reavelling and the length and width of the object, which at first appeared to me to be a trail but I soon realised that it was very opaque silver/white, very long, cigar shape.  Fortunately I knew the road ahead lay almost exactly in line with the direction the object was travelling and that I would have a clear view of the flatland ahead once I reached the top of the hill, so I asked my passangers to get the camera phones ready.  Upon reaching and traversing the crest of the hill I pulled the car over to the side of the road so that my passangers could take a steady shot. By this time the object had travelled very far ahead, I'd estimate around 10 miles in a matter of a few minutes.  Aware that the object would soon be passing over a Royal Air Force base and Civil Airport, I observed the object intensly and wondered if the Air Force and Airport controllers were tracking it on Radar.  One of my passangers was able to capture two photographs showing the object with reasonable clarity with a wide view of the countryside. Considering that the object had travelled from directly overhead to the horizon by the time we could get cameras ready and the car stopped in a good spot, I think these photos show an accurate indication as to the size, altitude and speed of the object. It was travelling West. There is a three minute interval between the two photographs, simply because my passanger had to delete some old pictures from her phone to make room in the phones memory in order to take the second shot, but this actually helps see the path of the object if you consider the first point of sighting to be almost directly overhead and slightly to the left of both pictures.  A couple of minutes after the second picture was taken the object had traversed the entire sky and was gone.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

The object appeared to be under 1,000 feet in altitude but over 500 feet in altitude and was moving at a steady pace and appeared to be gliding along rapidly with a wing span I estimate from between 230 to 250 feet. crescent shaped front end and had a protrusion in the middle of the back portion. It looked exactly like a giant manta ray with a short tail.  The Object was almost the color of the sky like it was supposed to be camouflaged but lighting from the ground made it possible to be seen, it completely blocked out the stars that would have been visible had it not been there and it's shape was determined by the outermost edges of the craft.  There was no noise as it came towards us, no noise as it was directly overhead and no noise after it passed by. It had no lights, No writing, and no visible fire from a jet or any sort of engine.  after it had passed I thought that it's color was so odd that it was like if you were to take a large mirror into high grass of all the same color and then witness the mirror reflecting the grass back at you from a distance - it would be hard to tell where the mirror was unless it was moving the Color was so odd that i believe the object may have been super shinny and was only allowing us to see its camouflaged surface, the flaw being fairly bright ground lights shinning straight up onto the bottom, and also the fact that a star you could see would not be visible as it passed between us and the star.  The object appeared to be gliding rapidly - it was only visible for about 15 seconds before it was too far away to see any longer.

I tried to go back to sleep and then decided to get up to use the bathroom.  Upon return back to my bedroom I was startled to see that the room was filled with bright orange light.  The light was intense as it streamed through the northeasterly facing window. Shadows were cast in the folds of the curtains.  I went to the window and saw a rather large (dime at arms length) orange sphere of bright light directly ahead approximately 200 feet away viewable just over the space between the roofs of two houses on the hill in front of me.  I turned to get my glasses and all of the orange light suddenly disappeared so I immediately turned back to the window.  The light blinked on and off two or three times and then completely ceased to be visible.   I continued to watch for it out of the window but it did not return.  Later in the week of 3-24-08, my sister who lives 2 streets away in the same northeasterly direction stopped by for a visit.  One of the first things she said to me was, ""What was up with that orange light Monday?""  However she saw a more diffused generalized orange glow over a school ball field immediately in front of her house that spread over a couple of blocks and she saw it in the evening of that day.  The orange light of 3-24-08 was the sixth sighting in my lifetime thus far. I reported another to NUFORC that occurred on 1-12-08 and was witnessed by more people than just myself.  I am a contactee and I converse regularly with other experiencers on an almost daily basis.  I am mentioning this because during the period of time just prior to 3-24-08, many of my abbductee acquaintances reported paranormal experiences and there was a general consensus that ""something is going on.""   For example, one friend saw an entity at his bedside; another had a sighting, and another suffered nosebleeds after a ""dream"" visit with a ""man"" that she has not seen for many years but has come to think of as sort of a guardian angel.

The craft made no noise and there was no traffic in the area or any other noise...very odd because of the proximity to MCAS Miramar.  The shape seemed to be similar to the stealth plane, a triangular shape, black, with large lights on the underside toward the front.  One light was under the pointed nose with two or three lights on both sides, angled with the shape of the plane.  I believe the aircraft had lights on the upper side as well because of the soft light above it.  The lights were not spotlights; they did not cast a beam.  I emailed a local news station with a half hour of the sighting, but never received a reply.  Nothing was ever reported in the news, so I am unable to confirm if others saw it as well.  Something else was very unusual:  the news did report that San Diego's commercial airport, Lindburg Field, was closed for a time due to fog.  Odd, because there was no fog that night.

It is blackned and charred on its under surface and the blackness does not rub off. The object appears also to be distorted. Appears that extreme heat and pressure resulted in object beginning to melt and then to re-solidify into a distorted shape and losing some of its symmetry. 12.There appears to be symbols inscribed on the periphery of the object. A coup couple - two or three- seem somewhat discernible, while others appear either        obliterated or severely marred by the heat and stress. 13.I tried to photograph a drawing that I had made of the symbols and transfer them onto my computer.

To me the object does not seem to be of this world. It does not appear to be of Native American origin.

The hole is too perfectly round and too perfectly positioned to be an accident. Perhaps it is the female part of a attachment that would lock something into the concavity.

At any rate, I saw ((name deleted)) eyes get real wide as he looked at the sky. I looked up and what I saw was amazing. I saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft of some kind. I can clearly recall that the bottom was bordered with a green glowing light, and there was a large circular orange light right in the middle of the bottom of the craft. So basically, I was looking a a big green-rimmed triangle with a circular orange light in the center.  When I first looked at it it seemed like it was quite far away. Like it was  just passing overhead. But to my mixed horrer/awe/excitement as soon as I looked at the damned thing it slowly but surely started coming right at me. It felt as though I were attached to it by some kind of string, and that by looking at it I was pulling it towards me. Like we were magnetically attracted and we had reached the point of no return, and a collision was inevitable. I also had this odd feeling that everything but me and the object had ceased to exist. I mean, everything was still around me, but it was like everything but me and the ship was on pause or something.  As it descended towards me I watched in awe as it just kept coming closer, and closer, and closer. And the closer it came, the bigger I realized it was. Eventually the thing got so low that I thought it would squash me along with 3/4 of my city block. It was truly amazing. It was gigantic, and it came down right over me in the middle of North Minneapolis! I would have expected chaos around me if I had been thinking clearly. I mean, cars should have been pulled over honking, people should have been yelling, etc... But no. Complete calm. And the calm seemed perfectly natural to me.  So, when the ship had come so low that i could hit it with a baseball it was like I snapped out of a trance and panic overwhelmed me. I immediately burst towards my front door across the street. Upon my first step was the first time my brother and my friend had entered my awareness since I first spotted the object.  I don't actually remember physically running across the street, but that may have been due to pure panic. Anyway, I got to the door with my brother and friend scrambling right behind me. I took one last look up as I darted into the house, and there was nothing there.  An odd side note. My brother only remembers seeing the thing from a very far distance.

The UFO in question appeared over the night sky just like any other aircraft we’d seen; Niagara Falls AFB was just up the road and we were used to unusually loud and streaking aircraft, we’d actually spent many a night interrupting our teenage nighttime endeavors to look up and identify a particular jet noise. 	I grew up in a house that was situated last on the left, on a street that began at the Lakeshore, and wound up to the Conrail tracks. Subsequently, my parent’s backyard looked sprawling, but the backyard landscape was primarily the property of first, Niagara-Mohawk, and then obviously, Conrail. (The first three, the last track, I believe was the property of Norfolk &Western). We, as kids, quite often used the Electric Company’s dirt-utility path, which obviously followed the tracks, as a sort of rendezvous point. We basically spent more time on that path, than on our own street. We’d generally walk the path to the corresponding neighborhood, to meet with friends. The particular night that this sighting occurred was indifferent to any other given evening. The three of us walked to our point to meet with a few buddies. 	We’d arrived at our usual location, which stopped just short of a viaduct bridge that over passed the next main road. We were there a total of 8-14 minutes when we heard the rumbling of an aerial vehicle. It initially sounded like a heavier aircraft, and I looked up to search for something like a 737 or a CRJ. Instead I witnessed what appeared to be, in my mind as a 15 year-old kid, a military craft of some sort. 	It approached our vantage point from the southern-tier and appeared at first to be a typical vehicle. We only looked up because we were bored of waiting for our friends to arrive, and the noise was a bit unusual. The craft sailed along the sky just like any other large aircraft, but we watched it because we, at the time, had nothing better to do. 	To elaborate in a manner as precise as possible, the vehicle appeared to follow a typical FAA-dictated glide path. We only became startled when the noise appeared to magnify about 2-3 times its initial offering. This acceleration was enough to make us suspect that something was wrong with the aircraft, so we continued to watch, and I guess, kind of searched for cover, just in case. To our surprise, the craft rapidly accelerated across the horizon, and the associated noise dimmed significantly. Actually, the craft in question bolted across the horizon, and we ran away from the scene with all the leg we had. This sounds a bit pathetic, but we actually hid in my buddy’s garage for a few hours. To describe the particular craft as accurately as possible, it appeared to be triangular, at least in light-scheme. The vehicle possessed no observable wings or tail. It approached our vantage point from an apparent SW vector and was around 15,000 ft. altitude. The noise that it produced and the associated light-burst sent us running away so that’s the best I can offer. The craft simply made a mockery of the sky, and the hideous sound it produced beforehand was enough to set off our fight or flight response.

When I entered the establishment, a male patron there, whom I knew well by that time, hailed me over to his table, stating that he wanted to tell me something unusual.  He was surprisingly animated, and seemed quite excited by what it was that had just happened to him and his girlfriend. The two of them proceeded to describe how they had been walking north on the east side of University Avenue, and just south of NE 50th, when they witnessed an intensely bright fireball streaking across the night sky, at approximately 7:15 (??) p.m. (Pacific).  They witnessed the object, which was as bright as a welder's torch, streak across the clear night sky, make several abrupt, almost instantaneous, turns, and then streak to the east, or southeast, disappearing from their view behind a building. A moment later, they witnessed a second, identical, object performe a similar maneuver across the sky, and apparently follow approximately the flight path of the first object. I am certain of the date of the event, but I am uncertain as to the exact time of the sighting. The male witness to this event was interviewed by an ABC news camera team in January 2005, and he appears in the ABC special, entitled ""UFO's:  Seeing is Believing.""  I consider the witness to be highly credible, and the incident was reported to me perhaps within minutes of its occurrence.

The lights were difficult to see, like very dim stars. If I hadn’t been looking for dim stars in the exact spot I was looking, I wouldn’t have noticed them. They appeared to be the same brightness, color, and distance of the stars. (I know stars are at all different distances from Earth, but this is the best way to describe their appearance.)  It was a clear night in early summer. There were many visible stars, no moon. Myself and my friend (about 20 years old), were watching the sky from a field in the countryside. I noticed the lights and was able to direct my friend to see them. We both watched them and discussed how they were moving. We agreed there were no aircrafts that could move like that. We saw them for at least 15 minutes, but it could have been longer.  They did not move in regular patterns. Each light would move independently. They were not traveling across the sky, they were staying in a proximate area, never moving very far from each other. This was easy to see because of the abundance of visible stars around and behind them.  Each light would move in a straight path, at a steady speed, and then change direction immediately. The light would not slow down or change speeds mid-flight. The direction-change was immediate. They did not curve.  A light would sometimes become more faint and then brighter again. (I assumed this to be it moving further and closer from us.) Their speeds could vary at each direction change. (I assumed this to be a result of the angle they were moving relative to Earth). I don’t remember if they ever stood still. Their speed was not too fast to watch, (Not like a cat chasing a rapidly-moved laser pointer.) though I’m sure they were moving at high speeds. Our distance from them made them easy to track.  The lights eventually became too faint to see, but not all at once. I assumed this to be a result of the group moving further away from us.  We agreed that the movements were intentional (controlled by some intelligence - presumably the pilots of the crafts). But could this have been some naturally occurring phenomenon? If so, I’d assume someone would know about it, or it would be common knowledge. After all, there are astronomers who study space for a living.  As I said, I believe these moving lights were controlled by an intelligence. Not because they were doing anything logical, but just that they were deliberate and unmistakably calculated. If these were actually government crafts being tested or whatever, I don’t see what their tests could have been proving. Furthermore, why would they have 5 of them up there? If they were testing, wouldn’t they just have one craft? Or two? I don’t kow. If they were alien craft, I still don’t see how those ‘acrobatics’ could have had a useful purpose. Unless they were just joyriding in their crafts, like some of us do after a fresh snow. We saw this 8-12 years ago - don’t remember. Haven’t seen anything like it since.

Im from Dayton, OH, but I was in Fairborn, OH, this particular day It was around 12:00 noon, full daylight, little clouds in the sky..  I walked out outside of a apartment complex, mind you id been up since about 9:00 am, as soon as I get outside, I noticed a round, rather large object sitting in the high air, hovering.  A friend was with me but I was so attached to the object in the sky, I wasn’t able to say anything to him till it was all over.  I continued walking and starring, after about 8-10 seconds the object ascended, or rather departed farther into the sky.  Estimating another 5-7 seconds to depart.  Now this is the reason why I believed what I saw.  Not only a full beautiful day of sunlight, hardly a cloud in the sky, but... As the object departed, whatever part of the sky this is actually visible, (I’m not sure if our own space shuttle does this, I could be wrong, but I don’t think so) I noticed I could see a distortion around the object.  Simply I could see black around the departing object, rather the distortion allowed me to see, without the blue sky, right into space, or rather the point of leaving the atmosphere allowed the, or didn’t allow light as normal.  I cant really explain, but my brain, or rather I would have never have thought of that occurring. The process that took place I’ve never considered.  I believe what I saw only because of the sunny day, perfect vision, not really, the distortion around the object as it departed, like I say, I could not have conceived the Idea of what I saw.  I, in general do not think of this memory, vary rarely, but an idea popped into my head to write and send to , somewhere.

I got off work at approximately 11:15 and headed home.  The town that I live in is very remote and absolutely zero activity at this time of night during the week.   As I was driving I noticed a bright light which was white and occasionally had red random flashes of light with a very rare green flash at times.  The object was moving in a way that made me feel as though it was following me.  When I came to a 4-way stop I thought that it would move on away but it didn't.  It came to a sudden, complete halt.   I sat there in my car, scared to death, and just watched it for approximately 5 minutes, afraid to take my eyes off of it or make any move myself.   I decided that I wanted to get home as quickly as possible so I made a right turn and started out in the direction of my house very slowly.  The object started moving again along with me and every turn I made it followed.  When I reached my house, which is about 1 1/2 miles down a dirt road in a very desolate, isolated area, I pulled into the driveway and stopped and, once again, the object made a very sudden, abrupt stop.  It did not move at all for a few minutes and then it began to sort of hover slightly to the left and then the right. It stopped again and I just sat and watched because I was too afraid to get out of the car and then it took off at an unbelievable speed.   I went in and woke up my husband and told him.  He is one of the biggest skeptics in the world and of course told me it was my imagination.  Well, the next night I guess his curiosity got the best of him because he went outside and just watched the sky for quite some time and said that he finally saw the same thing that I had seen, exactly as I had described it to him.  He even called my mother to have her go outside to see if she could see it from her house which was approx. 8 miles from us. She did not see it.   Just a few years ago I had a niece at my house out on the back deck when we noticed the same type of object that just sat there and then moved slightly from side to side and up and down, completely stopped several times and then just took off.   I've discovered that people think you are crazy when you tell these things so we keep it to ourselves now.  I even called the weather station with the second incident and they just pretty much laugh at you.   My husband and I are both very intelligent people and we know what we saw.

I remember that date and time exactly because that is my birthday and we were headed to our home for a “surprise” party. We noticed a very low flying bright “diamond shaped” light, flying just above tree level alongside the freeway. It was headed east bound as we were west bound. It was only approximately 100 feet up. At first we thought it was a helicopter because of the slow flight. We rolled down our windows to see and hear it better and we heard absolutely nothing. We then pulled off onto the side of the freeway, got out of our car and watched it. Usually even against a very dark sky, you can make out the outline of a helicopter or whatever, but we could make out NOTHING of any shape other than the diamond-shaped light.  Suddenly, it “dropped” four different lighted objects…I first thought they were flares, but after dropping approx. 10-15 feet, each of the smaller “lights” took off in level flight in 4 different directions. We were stunned. We jumped in our car and followed the closest one, which was headed west, which was towards the Long Beach Naval Station. We drove to a high point, at a Mall, where we got out of our car and watched. From this vantage point we were able to track and see all four of the “lights” in the distance. In the meantime, after dropping the 4 “lights”, the main diamond-shaped light turned and headed slowly north/northeast,  in the direction of Anaheim.  After about 15-20 minutes, the 4 lights started heading N/NE back towards the main light. We again jumped in our car and followed as quickly as we could towards Anaheim. We then actually saw each of the individual 4 lights arrive at the main “diamond-shaped” light and slowly rise up into the “light” After all 4 were retrieved, the main diamond-shaped light took off at considerable speed to the north where we lost sight of it.  I do NOT believe in “little green men”. We checked the papers the next day and saw no other reports of this sighting, which is mind-boggling because of its location, and the duration of the incident.

I was woke up about 430 Am to come along with my mother so she could drop my father off at work. In the car was my sister my cousin whom was spending the night with us that night and I. We took I-75 back home as usual because my father worked 15 min away from where we lived. While on the highway after you pass I-70 But befor you get to benchwood rd exit (note Benchwood rd exit was not there 10 yrs ago)I notiched an circular oval shaped object hovering around the highway ligts. The ufo was very close to us and I could not beleive my eyes. It continued to circul the lights in rapid movements. The ufo flashed with lights that circled around the whole center of the craft. They were multi colored I remeber it was blue and red colored lights. As we passed the craft I looked back and continued to watch it untill I could no longer see it. I asked my cousin if we really just seen a ufo and she replied yes in a creeped out way. What i belive the ufo was doing was getting energy from the lights on the highway to help power its craft. That is what I beleive. I live 10 min from the wright pat airforce base and I came up with a theroy that maybe its a top secert craft they created that can spy. I have allways told everyone about this encounter but never thought about reporting it till watching shows on ufos. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A glowing, reddish orange orb was floating through the trees in my backyard.  It was about 30 feet from where I stood and just about at my eye level. The orb looked about the size of a giant beach ball. Our yard fell away steeply just feet from the foundation.  I watched this for several seconds as my brain tried to compute what I was seeing.  I watched as it maneuvered through the dense trees, yet never came into contact with one.  It then emerged from the other side of the woods and slowly climbed in altitude until it cleared the hill on the other side of the woods. It then disappeared in the distance.  I listened to the local news reports and scanned the paper for days to see if anyone else had seen it.  This happened in a heavily populated suburb.  One week later, about 10 o'clock PM, I was driving to Blockbuster with my husband and we spotted the same orb near the edge of town.  We followed it until it disappeared into the woods. This happened in the summer of 1992 in Cincinnati, Oh. It has haunted me ever since then. I was 45 at the time and a homemaker. We have witnessed several other strange anomalies in the years since this sighting took place. I know this sounds kooky, but as a child of 6, living in an orphanage in Iowa, I awoke one night to see 3 small alien figures standing next to my bed observing me.

Everyone was talking about it and I don't know anyone that believes in UFO's. The lights were triangle in position and hovered for hours.  I never could really see them very well until about the third day into this when just like the other gentlemen I was watching television and noticed this strange object with lights flashing out the window. Some of my friends were in another part of the house when I went to get them to come outside. We all stood in silence and looked at this retangle shape object with what I remember to be different colored lights and they were flashing. It looked like something you would see at an amusement park but huge. Like the other post this was also near a water tower but on another side of town from the other post. From what I have read this object must have traveled from AUM to over the VA hospital to where I am near baptist hospital (East to West) This object was approx. a quarter mile away and went below the tree line as if landing. We all piled in the car to see if we could find it but there was no sign of it and we never heard anyone else talk about it.  I've always wondered what it could have been and don't think it was aliens or anything like that but after that we never heard or saw anything about it in the news and the story quickly faded away.,2007-08-07T00:00:00,32.372222543950365,-86.2398247156153

As I was getting ready for work, I saw way off in the distance a light in a trailer park. It changed colors, so I thought it was an ambulance or police car. I'm guessing that the trailer park was about a mile away. The street light at night is pretty much all you can see of it otherwise.  I was concerned because I knew some of the people there, one in particular I commuted to work with each day.  But the light lifted off the ground, and so I thought it was a helicopter. But it then moved erratically, and I mean something crazy. I've seen helicopters lift off several times, but this was wild. And the range of colors wasn't typical from what I've seen.  (At this point, I woke up my parents and we all watched it approach.)  It moved slowly, eventually coming our way, passing close to our house. That's when we got a good look at it. It was no helicopter. By this time, it's movement was straight and smooth. It seemed like it was flying much lower than the majority of planes I'd see in the sky.  Just before it got to our house, it's lights changed to a constant, steady white. No blinking or any other colors. I could see the outline exactly. It didn't look at all like a stealth bomber. It was a perfect triangle with three lights on the underside, one near each angle. No sound, and it was moving really slow. I've seen helicopters move faster. If it was as high as the regular planes in the sky I would see (about those speeds), then it had to be pretty big. I later saw a news report of people describing the same kind of craft, and the pictures they showed were exactly like what we saw.

There was no sound and no other light. It did not variate in brightness at any angle. It seemed to stop overhead, maybe 3000 feet or less. Just far enough that a spotlight could not hit it. It drifted like a hot air balloon in speed.  While watching, I called the ATC tower at the local airport.  They confirmed they could see it visually but did not know what it was.  After a few minutes it just turned off. 2 minutes later it reappeared in the exact same spot on the South horizon again.  When I called ATC again, they advised they now knew what it was but couldn't tell me. I told them they might ought to before someone shoots at it or something stupid.

THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TO MY STORY IS THAT THE DATE THAT I HAVE SEEN THEM IS ABOUT 4 YEARS PRIOR TO YOUR SIGHTING.  I HAVE SEARCHED FOR DATES ONLINE BUT HAVE SEEN NOTHING DURING THIS TIME.  NOW AS A RESULT OF MY FINDINGS, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO TELL SOMEBODY.  I JUST CANT BELIEVE NOBODY ELSE HAS REPORTED THESE LIGHTS DURING THAT TIME PERIOD BECAUSE WHAT I SAW WAS ENORMOUS! HOW COULD ANYBODY MISS IT?  CURRENTLY, I RESIDE IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA, BUT FOR A BRIEF TIME, FROM 1990-1991, I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE, AZ.  AND FROM 1992 TO 2004 I LIVED IN THE FAR NORTH SUBURBS OF CHICAGO.  I WAS AT THE CORNER OF SCOTTSDALE ROAD AND E. SHEA BLVD. AT THE NE CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION IS/WAS A ""MOBILE""  ((sic.  Mobil)) GAS STATION.  WHILE I WAS FILLING UP MY CAR WITH GAS, I SAW THESE RED LIGHTS IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING IN A ""V"" SHAPE IN WHAT LOOKED VERY CLOSE AND MOVING VERY SLOWLY!!! BECAUSE THE AREA SITS AT SORT OF A HIGHER ELEVATION OVERLOOKING THE PHOENIX, TEMPE & MESA AREAS, THE LIGHTS SEEMED ALMOST EYE LEVEL.  YOU DID LOOK UP SLIGHTLY BUT THESE LIGHTS SEEMED NO MORE THAN ABOUT 1 MILE AWAY IN DISTANCE AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT A HALF A MILE LONG OR LONGER IN SIZE.  THE OBJECT MOVED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION AND MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND WHAT-SO-EVER. THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO SOUND IS WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.  I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF AMBER LIGHTS, WHICH I DON’T BELIEVE IS WHAT I SAW.  I BELIEVE I SAW RED LIGHTS.  ALSO, I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF FLARES. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I SAW.  THIS MAINTAINED A CONSTANT ELEVATION IN A VERY SLOW EASTERLY DIRECTION.  I WAS IN SO MUCH DISBELIEF THAT I DIDN’T HEAR ANYBODY ELSE AROUND ME MAKING COMMENTS THAT I HAD TO ASK AN OLDER GENTLEMAN, WHOME WAS WALKING OUT OF THE GAS STATION AFTER PAYING I ASSUME, IF HE KNEW WHAT THOSE LIGHTS WERE.  HE DID SORT OF A DOUBLE TAKE, ANSWERED, ""I DON’T KNOW,"" PROCEEDED TO GET IN HIS CAR STARING AT THE LIGHTS AND DROVE OFF. I WAS ABOUT 23 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, AND I REMEMBER THINKING, ""WELL IF HE DIDN’T THINK IT WAS ANY BIG DEAL, THEN IT MUST NOT BE,"" SO I PROCEEDED TO GET IN MY CAR AND LEAVE TO GO TO MY GIRLFRIENDS HOUSE AT THE TIME IN MCCORMICK RANCH.  I THINK I KEPT AN EYE ON THE LIGHTS FOR A WHILE AS I WAS DRIVING BUT AFTER THAT I CAN’T REMEMBER WHEN I STOPPED LOOKING.  I REMEMBER TELLING MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT WHEN I WALKED IN HER HOUSE AND SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING ON THE NEWS THAT EVENING ABOUT IT, SO IT WAS FORGOTTEN UNTIL ABOUT 1997 WHEN I SAW THE FIRST REPORTS OF THE LIGHTS ON TELEVISION.  I REMEMBER SEEING THE REPORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND FEELING THE HAIR STAND UP ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. I WONDERED, ""NOW HOW DO I TELL SOMEBODY MY STORY WITHOUT THEM THINKING THAT I AM NUTS?""  WELL, I NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT MUCH BUT, I TOLD MY FUTURE WIFE AND I RECEIVED THE TYPICAL RESPONSE I GUESS ANY CRACK POT MIGHT GET, ""OH, COOL OR THAT’S NICE.""  SO AGAIN, I PUSHED IT ASIDE.  BUT IT IS REALLY EATING AT ME NOW TO TELL SOMEBODY.  SO HERE I AM.  I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY FINANCIAL GAIN OR RECOGNITION.  I JUST WANTED AN EAR TO HEAR MY SIDE.

In 92 my wife and I had recently bought a new house in a rural area of our home town. It was a very hot sumer and our newly planted outdoor plants were suffering badly with the days heat. We were both working by day and watering plants at night on our return home which on this occassion was very late. The area we lived in was a no fly zone as it was military controlled airspace and our local airforce base was responsable for that zone. I should also mention that I have and have held a pilots licence for 27 years. I have flown in both fixed and rotory winged aircraft many times, both in the civil and military situations. Roughly between 12 and 12:30 I was watering the plants and my wife was taking a shower. I was enjoying the cool night air and marvelling at the clear night sky when suddenly a strange craft lifted above the nearby tree line. It appeared to glow a kind of yellowish colour over all but along the sides there were what I can only describe as roundish areas that glowed orange, 3 or 4 of them. This craft was teardrop shape but in a horizontal aspect, slightly higher though at the wider end. It lift off in a corkscrew effect and made no sound. I have no doubt that it was not a helo. I know their flight paterns and the way they operate very well, this was not a helo. At this point a started kicking the way and yelling to my wife to come look at this thing, not wanting to take my eyes off it for a moment. I then realised that I was not the only one who had seen this as a very dark coloured car raced past our house in the direction of the craft. I was releaved to know that I was not the only one who was seeing this. My wife came out and asked what the problem was. I told her the stroy and then after what seemed like an eternity of searching the sky I resigned myself to the fact that I was the only person who saw it and was frustrated by that thought. It was my trun for the shower and her turn with the garden hose. I was no sooner in the shower when in she came and said with a trembling voice....you better get out here, that thing is right over the house and there is some sort of stuff coming out of it. Grabing a towel I bolted for the verander. Again I searched the sky to no avail. I asked her what she meant by stuff coming out of it. She said ""It fit the discription you gave me but from underneath I could see sparkly stuff that trailed back from the sides. It was then I became aware of the dark colourd car moving very slowly along the street and come to a spot out front. I thought this was a good sign that we were not alone in this so I started toward the car. At roughly 30 yards on a moonlit night and raped in a white towel I don't think I looked inposing but the car suddenly dashed off again. I went back inside and straight to the phone. I called RAAF base Townsville and the following conversation took place....  Yes hello, can you tell me what aircraft you have flying in the area of *********** currently please?  Response ""What, at this hour, nothing, you would have to be kidding"".  Well I'm not kidding, there is something flying around here right now.  Response ""Can't be, thats military zoning, we would know about it if there was.  Yes I know it's military, thats why I'm calling you. Listen there is something out here and I've gotta tell yuh, I am a pilot with both fixed and rotory wing experience and this is nothing like that. What have you got on radar?   Response ""Nothing, look, are you sure about this?   Deadly, I'm not alone, I have my wife as a witness!   Response ""Ok, well look there is nothing I can tell you except that the sky is very clear, NO TRAFFIC ON RADAR. Thanks for calling it in though!   My wife and I told our friends who were envious mostly. The funny thing about it is that some months or so later there was a UFO filmed by an amateur at a soccer game in broard daylight in another state.   My wife and I looked at each other and I don't mind telling you, when my wife said pointing at the TV ""thats it, thats it and the damb thing is corkscrewing,....the hair stood up on the back of my neck!!!",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

I noticed from just above tree level a craft surrounded by lights emerging from just above tree top level.  At first it appeared to be a small triangular object decorated with lights such as a hang glider.  Then as more of the object drifted into view it appeared to be one huge object that was made up of three smaller triangular objects.  Almost as if three hang gliders were attached together making up a larger triangular object.  As more of it became visible and it drifted into full view I realized that it was not hang gliders due to the enormous size of it.  It was almost silent.  Perhaps a small engine sound was barely audible such as a putter or hum, but not sure about that.  Then just as if it realized that it had drifted into a populated area it stopped, hovered, then the lights blinked once.. twice... three times... then absolutely dark it went.  But it was bright night and you could still see the object hovering above.  It then made a slow lumbering change of direction back to the cover of the tree top canopy and away from the interstate.  If you've ever seen the floating laboratory that scientists use to study the rain forest canopy in South America.  It is a floating helium filled raft like craft used by scientsts to drift over the rain forest and gather data and experiments.    This UFO was similar to that with lights.  I'm convinced that it is definitely man made due to it's crudeness and slow mobility.  It probably is hydrogen cel or helium and is manned by military special ops types doing training ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This sighting took place in 1990 over in the middle east.  At that time I was in the military the US AirForce  we were dispatched to Egypt pryor to the start up of desert strom to build a fuling base in the desert along with a large MASH unit.  While at the site we would start working at dawn and many times would not finish up to well after dark.   The first 30 days we were in country we were house at a large hotel complex in Cairo Egypt.   Not sure of the date but one evening after we had finished work we all were waiting on the tarmac for our buses to takes us back to Cairo it was about 72 Degs and a very clear night.  Their was aprox 70 of use including our commander. Shortly after we all gathered to wait for the buses one of the guys pointed to the south east and said what is that well we turned around and looked up.  I have never seen anything this until at that moment.  There were aprox 100 objects pale orange in color that were at a very high altitude in two V formations one next to the other looked like a W in the sky. These objects moved very slowly from the south east to the northwest.   As they approached our location you could drop a pin and hear it hit the sand not a single person was making a sound.  Once they got over head at a high altitude they changed course in unison to the north.   We watched them for about 30 to 35 minuets.  I looked over and saw our commander looking up at the objects and asked him what he thought they were.  He said I have no idea.   To this day I have not been able to determine what the objects were.  I did go to base ops the next day to see if their may have been a large military flyover.  NO traffic was in the air that night  The Egyptican military do not fly at night and no commercial traffic was in the area. I submitted this report some years ago to MUFON but have never heard anything back from them or if they received It.   I am now retired from the Air Force and this incident still bugs me I would like to know what they were.  By the way being in the middle of the desert their were no external lights other than a bldg light that was on about 500 yards away .

I had a dream in which I remember my skull being ""cracked"" open.  I didn't actually see anything, but I remember the sensation much like people remember sensations during surgery.   I awoke in my bed, I was unharmed, but for some unknown reason, I was terrified.  I heard a strange noise outside that sounded like a loud ""hum"" and a steady vibration that rattled every fibre of my body.  The noise circled around my house several times at an incredibly fast rate, at least one revolution every few seconds.  I could not see an object and I was too afraid to look out a window, but I did see some strange lights glowing through the window.  I had never heard this sound before, but for some reason, it terrified me.   The sound had to have come from a machine of great power and the ""hum"" was similar to that your hear at a power relay staion only amplified thousands of times.  I recognized the sound, but had no memory of it.  I only knew that I didn't like it...   I attempted to wake my family up, but to my astonishment, the would not wake up as if they were sedated somehow.  Eventually, the object left the area.  I was almost convinced it was a dream, but I forced myself to stay awake till morning and I turned on the television to establish my sanity.   Incidentally, as soon as the object left, I was able to wake my family, but they had no memory of the indcident and dismissed my experience as a vivid dream.   The experience was the most terrifying thing I have witnessed in my life and I have suffered from post-tramatic stress syndrome since then.   I am not the first person in my family that has had a close encounter with a UFO.  My grandmother woke in the middle of the night to observe a diamond shaped object that had a blinding glow.  The next day, her eyes swelled shut and the doctor that examined her indicated that her retinas were burned.  The ammount of damage to her eyes was consistent to light several times that of the sun; they had no explanation, but she recovered.  The object also burned a trail the the yard just outside the window.   My father also experienced a close encounter with a UFO when he was young.  Since he grew up with no electricity and no automobiles in the middle of ND, the closest he could describe the objects he saw were, ""fire-wagons"".  He has little memory of the incident.   There is a history of Schizophrenia in the Family, but my Grandmother, my Father, and I have not been diagnosed with the condition.  I have never experienced any other vivid hallucinations in my life...   I am convinced that what happened was completely real… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-05-15T00:00:00,41.3068,-93.5826

It was summer, 1993.  I was driving south on Hwy-69 from Ankeny to Des Moines [Iowa].  I'd arrived at [approximately] the crossroad of NE 66th Ave.  Myself and my passenger were listening to an 'oldies' radio station on the AM dial, when suddenly in front of us the entire sky lit up white/pink/orange.  The radio went dead - static only.  Upon searching, nothing could be found on either the AM nor the FM dial.  The weird lights on the horizon dissipated.   Considering the times back then, I think it's understandable we immediately thought Des Moines had been nuclear bombed.  My passenger and me began sobbing, she hugging me across the console.  Still I continued to drive, but at a marked slower mph.  We approached the area of NE 51st Ave, where on the west side of the road was situated a K-Mart and an Earl May garden center.  Directly behind Earl May was I-80.  This is hard to describe, because it was so amazing ... it's difficult to get my brain around it, let alone find words to do the visual any justice.  I drove slowly as we saw *something* behind Earl May.  It was approximately fourty feet high [a guess, judged by the height of the one-story garden center].  It had ... what I can only describe as 'sparks' emitting from it's 'roof.' It was, as I remember, rectangular, and silver in color.  But the silver was ... shifty.  Pearlescent kinda.  The 'sparks' were of varying colors ... white, pink, orange, yellow ... but said colors were *vivid* and, no joke, hurt my eyes.  At the time my mind thought the 'sparks' were emissions from this ... thing.  In that immediate area, just north of the I-80 interchange, and just south, there are stoplights.  Also entrances and exits to and from I-80 [in a clover leaf shape].  At both stoplights cars were stopped.  On the entrance to I-80 westbound too was a car, sitting there, the driver's door was open.  Surreal.  Again, what we saw behind the Earl May was enough of a mind-jumbler.  Then realizing cars were stopped ... at green lights and on major entrances to Interstate roads ... I was driving *very* slow at this point, as I passed cars ... seemingly empty of drivers and passengers.  But I did make note of semi-trucks passing over the I-80 bridge, as they were apparently the only other vehicles in motion, beyond my own.  I drove to my passenger/friend's house, and we woke her father, as we were quite alarmed.  We phoned the radio station to which we'd been listening.  They reported no 'outage' that they knew.  Nor did they have any breaking news concerning any sort of ... well, anything that could or would relate to what myself and my friend witnessed.  Jump to 1992.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sic.  How can the story ""jump"" backwards in time?  PD))  I'd bought a new Macintosh.  Once I got it set up and connected to the internet, I posted my story to a message group.  Two persons responded, asking what type auto was I driving.  Perplexed (and thinking maybe they were messing with me) I responded I was driving a Chevrolet Celebrity.  One responded immediately asking ""... was it diesel?!""  Yes was my response.  Same person responded, again within moments, that the reason semi-trucks were traveling over I-80 was because they were, too, diesel engines ... and went on to say that might have been the reason my vehicle was still operating.   I don't understand *why* that might be ... but I know it created quite a stir within the group to which I posted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was driving East on Arkansas Lane in Arlington Texas in early afternoon.  As I topped the hill and approached the intersection of Park Springs and Arkansas Lane I saw an enormous oval shaped disk that appeared to be made of highly polished silver, hovering over the City of Grand Prairie, Texas, which is the City to East of Arlington and about 10 miles from the intersection I was approaching.  It seemed to me to be about the width of a football field or two and was much larger on the horizon than the Dalworthington Gardens Water tower that came into view as I approached the next traffic light at the corner of Spanish Trail and Arkansas Lane.  The strange thing about this sighting is that the UFO appeared to be appearing and disappearing as it sort of wobbled while sitting there in the sky.  Although I did not see any airliners at that time, The UFO seemed to be sitting well above the trees that were visible to me and just under a landing flight path to DFW Airport that I generally always see a plane or two making a final approach when I travel East on Arkansas Lane.  Sometime before this sighting, I remember hearing about some one or some group trying to project a picture of Christ in the skyline above New York City and at first I thought that because the UFO was appearing and disappearing that perhaps that was happening here also.  However, this was in broad daylight.  I looked to my left, intending to honk at the white pick up truck to my left and call the driver's attention to what ever this was.  However when I looked at the driver, I could see that the gentleman driving the truck had his mouth open and was looking at the same sight I was seeing.  I continued down Arkinsas Lane and the UFO continued to hover and appear and disappear until I reached the intersection of Bowen Rd. and Arkansas Lane.  Then the UFO disappeared and never appeared again.  The next day, I was again in my car listening to either the local Classical or Oldies but Goodies Radio station, when the announcer made the following addition to a short news break, ""All you people in Arlington, who called in to report what you thought was a UFO yesterday were actually seeing a weather baloon.""  I was not one of those people who called in, but I do know that what I saw was no weather baloon.  At the time of my sighting, I did not have a computer.  Two years later when I did purchase one, I began a search that continues today for someone, anyone who saw this same UFO  I am unsure of the date and even the exact year, but I know that others must have seen it and either called the authorities or a radio a station to report it.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,32.70709736842105,-97.1238705263158

I do not remember the exact dates but it remained in the sky for about 3 to 4 days. The reason I am filling this in right now is because when this happened over 4 years ago when I was around 19, it did not seem as serious to me as it does right now. I was just watching a show on YouTube about alien sightings a couple of minutes ago. At one point they spoke of a probe that hovers silently in the sky and that virtually every country has reported such sightings. This is where it struck me that I have seen this myself and did not realise it well enough that I did. At first I thought it to be a kite. But it just stood there at one point in the sky for days and no stings appeared to connect it. This was very unusual for everyone I showed it to, but no one really gave it much importance. I observed it for all the days it remained in the sky and did not notice much change in the position of the object. I have filmed this object on my camcorder and am therefore reporting this. I would like to submit this video to the appropriate authority. However, I haven't seen this video since the incident took place. Just reviewed it a couple of times immediately after shooting it. The video is back home somewhere in the video collection of our family videos. I am currently studying away from home and dont have immediate access to the video, but i'm sure if the situation is serious enough, I can sit through all the tapes and find the one that has the footage. The video camera is a sony camcorder and had some 350x zoom or something and I tried zooming in as much as possible till it started getting very blurry and my hands were too shaky to remain steady at such strong zoom levels. It was during the day and the total video length must have been atleast a couple of minutes at all levels of zooming. It is a clear video as per whatever a normal camcorder at the time could handle. The day was clear as well so no cloudy distortions. Anyway, I don't know what to do beyond this reporting, so if important please let me know.

I had my head down because I was watching my dog but something caught my attention. I glanced up and I noticed lights directly above three of the townhomes in front of me (the homes are approximately 50 ft. away.)   I noticed there was a structure or formation to the lights.  The formation looked like the right wing of an airplane except the ""wing"" was very large.

My brother and I were walking along the beach near our parents house at around 20:00 hours. It is not uncommon to be alone on this beach as few people live in the area, this was one of those occasions. We walked only a short distance down from our access to the beach and decided to sit for a while. The low wind and few waves made it very quiet. That was when things took an abnormal turn.  As we sat there talking we notice a light at the end of the point which was about 2kms away. The beach is the shape of a crescent moon, the light was at the left point and we where in the middle. We didn’t take much notice of it at first because 4x4s use that end of the beach frequently, suddenly the light disappeared then reappeared. Of course we where not scared by this, it was only when the light stared to move around the crest of the beach at tremendous speed that it gain our attention.  Attention turned to alarm as the light drew closer and we could hear no sound of a motor. The light covered the distance from the point to our position in around 20seconds. By this time my brother who is an emotional lad was in hysterics running flat out for the exit. I thought it prudent to follow but curiosity got the better of me and I stopped just before the access, as I turned I saw the light had stopped just before the shore line about 20metres from me. As I stood there I saw that this light did not just face forward but evenly illuminated 5metres around it in every direction. I could also see that there was no physical object holding this light up, it was hovering about 1metre off the ground. I got the distinct feeling that it was aware of my presence and it was using caution.  By this stage my brother had left the beach and was screaming at me from down the access to run. My one regret now is that I did not investigate further but I gave in to my brother’s pleas and moved off the beach. The beach rises quite quickly from the water line to the top of a small dune which stretches the length of the beach with a few trees scattered along the ridge. It then descends into a gully, then up again onto another dune. As I caught up with my terrified brother in the gully we turned around to see if the light was following. The light ascended off the beach to a height that it could be seen in the gully, easily 30 feet off the ground.  Almost simultaneously we started moving further down the access and the light descended back on the beach. It then started moving at high speed back the way it came, we know this because we could see the glow along the top of the dune. After a brief period back on the road that leads to the beach access we collected our wits and thought about it sensibly, we realized that it was low tide so any land vehicle would have to have left some sort of track on the beach. So we then proceeded back onto the beach to search physical signs of what we just saw, however nothing could be seen on over a kilometer of beach covered.  I have no man made explanation for what we saw that night. All I know is that it was aware of our presence and exercised some degree of caution indicating intelligence. Thank you for reading.

A large Light appeared off the golf coast looking north from Vanderbilt Beach towards Sanibel Island. It was redish white and it brightened enough to make a reflective streak across the water within seconds. It seemed to have been sitting there for a couple of minutes before it brightened and grabbed our attention. It slowly started moving away from the coast and then out of nowhere streaked out of view at the horizon. Needless to say it was a jaw-dropping sight that grabbed our attention. Less than a minute later there was a bright ""ping"" of light that came from the horizon in the same redish white hue. It seemed to signal the original light to come back. It's difficult to say how far this was happening away from us on the beach but if i had to guess i would say at least a mile away. My friend disagreed and claimed to have seen a rounded triangle solid object but i could not make out enough detail to verify. As it moved across the sky slowly the object/light split in 3 objects and moved apart to form a triangle formation that moved in a way that kept the exact proportions of the triangle. Abruptly all three lights shot across the sky and disappeared. The acceleration and speed i could not guess but it was like nothing i've seen; hundred of miles per hour. This whole process repeated a few times of reappearing and shooting off until it just stopped leaving me and my friend baffled and mystified by what was just witnessed. My name is Daniel and my friend Brett was also there. It was the last night of a vacation and it was a very silent night with the exception of the event. Never before had i given much thought to people describing their ""UFO"" events until this had happened. I don't claim to know what i saw but i do know as much as i can that it wasn't man made.

My mother must have been around 43 years old, my older sister 14, I was 11 years old and my younger brother was 6 year old.  We were sitting on the roof of the first floor facing the hill gazing the stars. It was a clear summer night with very few clouds and it was full moon. We could see the houses on the hills across our house and the clear moonlit sky.  Looking at the horizon we noticed an aircraft aproachig. I was excited as I always been fascinated by airplanes and I though it was going to be a nice fly by. As it got near we noticed it was flying very low for an airplane so we thought it could be a helicopter. It was flying between the hills and as it flew it lit up the sides of the hills with a white light to the point you could clearly see the foliage beneath it.  As it got closer we saw it was not helicopter. It was a long cigar shape craft around 40 feet long and also by the way and speed if was flying. As the object was cruising in between the hills it passed right in front our house about 500 feet away. We could clearly see a white glow or aura around it, and a thin lime or ligth green colored light coming from the back of it like some kind of exhaust or propulsion. It was amazing.  We all looked at each other in disbelief as this thing flew by right in front of us making absolutely not sound, no noice, whistle or wind noise. It was as if it was floating not flying. It kept on cruising in between the hills lighting everything in its path until it went out sight in the horizon. My brothers and mother still talk about this to this date.  I have decised to report this now after 30 years because I think it is very important people know we are not alone and I believe very much goverments of the world a very aware of UFO's and do not come forward to avoid world wide system disruptions and cultural upheavals.

This very delayed report is the result of just finding your site as received a link from a friend.,Niagara Falls,NY,1979-07-18T21:00:00,light,2 hours,"Occurred : 7/18/1979 21:00  (Entered as : 07-18-1979 21:00) Reported: 10/11/2007 10:40:12 AM 10:40 Posted: 11/28/2007 Location: Niagara Falls, NY Shape: Light Duration:2 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59199.html,"This very delayed report is the result of just finding your site as received a link from a friend. Let me preface this with an observation. There was a major documentary in the 80's on one of the tree big network hosted by one of the Primetime anchorman. One of the subjects was the Air Force Report called Project Bluebook. I recall an Air Force spokesman saying in an interview that the entire U.S. is covered in Radar put in place for ABM and bomber defense, and if there really were UFOs they would have shown up on radar. By some coincidence the Air Force code name for the Top Secret  project to develop Stealth Bombers and fighters was named ""Have Blue"". Due to the length of time I am not sure of the exact date, the only thing I recall for sure is that it was the week prior to the weekend Air Show at the Niagara Falls Air Force Base where either the Thunderbirds or the Blue Angels were appearing.  As it turns out the Real show was to begin much earlier. I was traveling on Ridge Road which is on the escarpment in Lewiston, New York.  This ridge was formed by glaciers and is where Niagara Falls started.  The Ridge Road is very near the U.S. and Canadian Power Plants which has seen a host of sightings and also Lake Ontario where at least one Air Force jet was lost chasing UFOs (or trying to. While driving down the road I saw numerous people out in their yards looking up into the Sky.  I stopped at one house and asked directions.  After getting the directions I asked why they were outside.  The father answered that they were just enjoying the nice weather, apparently not wanting to appear to be nuts. I proceeded down to my friends, friend’s house to find them out in the yard as well. I asked what was going on and they said that you have to see this.  They pointed to some light in the sky that appeared to me to be just stars.  I said So? They told me to keep my eye on them.  All of a sudden one of the lights started from a dead stop to well beyond the speed of sound, but with no noise, and then proceeded to make 90 degree turns.  Sometimes there would be two or three moving in formation or by themselves. Most of the time these lights just looked like bright stars but occasionally they would pulse and while they were predominately white they would they would sometimes have a blue or green tint.  Another strange effect is that while watching one it would suddenly withdraw slowly up until it was out of sight. Since I belonged to the Civil Air Patrol I had the phone number for the Tower at the Niagara Falls  Air Base.  We called the tower and asked if anyone had reported an strange lights?  He said ""Where are they now""?  He said that he could report them but they are pretty common and they are harmless.  But he agreed that tonight’s ""show"" was more impressive and much bolder than most.  He said that he doubted that they would scramble any planes as they had lost some before, not from being attacked so much as blacking out or pushing the planes or themselves past what they were capable of in the trhill of the pursuit. About 20 minutes later though  some jets appeared and chased the light around making a lot of noise.  It was pretty amusing as the light seem to be playing with them able to travel 10-20 times as fast, hover and turning at impossible oblique angles.  It was a very weird feeling that something was out there just a few miles away and it sure wasn't meteors, weather balloons, reflections, or Northern lights all of which we had seen plenty of times before.

My wife is a strong german farm girl and not at all prone to making up tales.  So she tells me that on Saturday evening she was coming home after visiting my folks. She was traveling east and she when topped the hill on 80th  near the police station in Cottage Grove. She notices a saucer shaped object hovering  over the houses off to the right or south. I questioned her about that part because there is a water tower about a ¼ mile east and south  of the police station, but she said she could clearly see the water tower and the ufo was closer to her and further south a little. She said she watched it til she came abreast of it and continued on towards home feeling spooked and not wanting to stop with our three kids sleeping in the back seat. When she got to keats ave about a mile or so further east she did stop the car and got out to look at it, as it was still in approximately the same position. So she had watched it for about 5 minutes and was as close to it as a half a city block.  So our kids are grown up and married and my oldest girl and her husband were over for supper one night many years later. He started  telling us a story about his 13th birthday party and how a tiny object no bigger than a foot in diameter flew right between him and a friend while they were playing in the yard  My son-in-law lived right about where my wife saw the ufo and it was the same weekend in Sept. 1979  We have thought about filing a report or calling the police but not wanting to get the notoriety.  My wife describes it as about 30-40 ft in diameter and about 8-10 ft tall at the center, she says this because she thought that it was as wide as the houses under it. She says it was about 50 ft in the air. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2007-11-28T00:00:00,44.8205,-92.9256

Well i was ten years old at the time and myself and all the other neighborhood kids were playing a game of kick the can. It was just starting to get a little darker out side and the street light in front of our house had just come on, so i know it was around 7 o'clock. When one of the other kids kicked the can we all came running to the goal, which was the street lamp post in front of my house, located at the intersection of chestnut hill ave and the crescent street extension.  One of the other kids looked up and said hay whats that,and we all looked to where he was pointing.What i seen was a large dark colored v shaped craft,with 5 sets of lights on it's under side.The five sets of lights where in groups of three in a triangle pattern,with one group of three lights at the front of the craft and the other groups going down the two sides of the v shape. I am the kind of person that remembers every thing, so my estimate of the size of the craft would be 300 ft wing span and around 200 ft in length. We heard no sound at all and it appeared to be only a few hundred feet above the tree tops directly over the crescent street extension, we were very close to it, i could see the bottom of the craft and it looked a lot like what our modern stealth bombers look like, with a flat black paint look, and different lines that seem to outline access panels.  The craft just hovered there for about 2 minutes as we all watched in awe, then it slowly started moving south directly over my house then the millers river, all the time it seemed to keep the exact same altitude following the land as if it was locked into some kind of gps that kept it exactly the same height off the ground. We watched it go down over the river and then back up the other side, then it went up over stans auto body shop and then the jr high school then out of our range of site.the whole time we were walking around for the best position to see it from,so we all got an eye full.   At one point i was directly under it so i seen it well and will never forget it.It displayed flight characteristics i have never seen from any stealth craft. in the way that it just hovered there, and remained completely silent even though i was that close to it ,also when it did move it moved so slow that it could not have been held in the air by normal aerodynamics,it just didn't move fast enough to generate any lift.  Once it was on the other side of the river we could see the side profile a bit better, and there was nothing significant there, just more dark flat black like the bottom,and i would say it was about 10 feet thick,that is,if it were on the ground it would be 10 feet tall. The back of the craft did seem to be an exhaust of some kind, and it looked glowing hot ,but i heard no sound,and the glow was blue not red like i would expect from a jets after burners. I have seen this story on the television show unsolved mystery's,and those witnesses described it as five planes flying in formation,i can see why they would think that because the lights on the bottom did make it look like 5 plans in formation.But i got real close so i can tell you it was one solid object for sure.but i do believe we seen the same thing, myself and those people in new york that were on unsolved mystery's ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There are railroad tracks that run perpendicular to the hi-way, and I usually did not like heading to Maxwell on that road as the trains always ran with their front light on (they only had one at that time) and I hated that cause they were always on high.  But it was early and still light out so I thought it would be fine if there was a train, as it would not blind me then. The weather was cloudy and grey, and it had been misting all day and was cold out.  I can not remember why we were making it an early day, but I think we had a test the next day for school. As I started out of town we were just talking and I noticed that there was a train coming towards us and I immediately thought ""Crap, a train with it's light on. I hate that.""  Then as we got a little closer to the ""train"" I noticed that it looked like a really tall train, as the light was twice as high as it should have been, but still did not think anything was strange about it. Then as we got even closer I realized somthing was not right about it and saw that the light was high above the tracks and my friend stopped talking and I said to him ""What the hell is that?""  Moving very slowly along the tracks was a football shaped craft the the ends coming to a flat point.   The light was on the front pointing straight ahead and there was another I could not see at first pointing directly down onto the tracks.  It also had several small coloured lights at different areas on it. I had pulled over nad actually got out of the car and walked towards it trying to figure out what I was looking at.  My friend was freaking out and wanted me to get back in and drive away.  The car never quit running and I did not notice any electrical problems either. Good thing there was no traffic as I probably would have gotten run over! The object did not make any noise at all.  It was dead silent.  I stood there and watched it glide down the tracks with the light shineing down on it.  The size of it was about a train engine and a half long, it was a fairly big craft.  It just faded into the grey mist out of sight. Finally the cold rain sort of snapped me out of the daze I was in as I watched it and I got back in the car and started off towards my friend's home.  We did not say anything for a while and it was sort of like being in a dream.  When we did start talking it was like we were trying to make some sense of what we had just witnessed. I should also mention that this was in sight of the airport which is just south of the hi-way and there are electrical lines that cross the tracks at several points so anyone flying an aircraft along them would have been very foolish and crashed doing so.  Also the Union Pacific does not check the lines that way either. The whole sighting took only about five or six minutes even though it seemed like hours, but when I dropped him off and got home it was actually four hours later.  Maxwell is only fifteen minutes up and fifteen back.  We left town at around 18:30 hours and I did not get home till after midnight.  I still do not really know what to make of that. The next day when we saw each other, he said to expect the Ne State Patrol to contact me cause his Mom called them after he told her what happened.  I was freaked by that cause I just knew that everyone would think we were nuts or high on something. They called the airport to see if there were any planes coming in at that time, and there were none and they saw nothing on their radar either. We never discussed that event again for years till he asked me to recall the whole thing and I did.  Unknown to me he was recording me and he played the tape for a friend of his who said our story's were identical. I know this happened many years ago, but it is  still fresh in my memory just as the day it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Anyone who had seen the triangular craft, and I have discovered there were literally hundreds, and then saw the planes flying in the formation the next evening would have to be a fool to believe they were one and the same.

Then I saw a flying object silently and slowly flying across on the top of our house. I was immediately struck at how low it was flying and how quiet it was. Our house was located at the edge of a hill, so I immediately ran up to the rooftop, which was easily accessible through the upper room. I grabbed a small, juvenile telescope from the upper room and tried to examine it more closely from the rooftop. By the time my brother and I were on the rooftop, it was slowly hovering across the town towards south and then quickly sped higher into the cloud and disappeared little later. Here is the description of what I saw through my telescope. It was completely silver in color, and it was an upside down T-shaped flying object.  A drawing would be better to explain how it looked like, but it looked like two large cylinder pipes stuck together to form a shape of letter T. The ends were rounded off. Although it was somewhat hard to tell how far it was from where I was standing when I started examining it with my mini-telescope, I think it was at least 12 feet in diameter at the base. There were no windows, doors, or any blinking lights. However, some black letters were visible across the bottom of the flying object. I still remember how the characters looked like, and even to this day, I have yet to see any human scripts that resemble those characters. I have gone through http://www.omniglot.com to find any scripts that may look familiar, but I couldn’t find any. I have kept this information to myself over all these years, because whenever I would tell someone about it, I was made fun of, and even my younger brother, who was with me at the time, seems to recollect very little about it. That’s probably because I was the first one with the telescope and by the time I gave the telescope to my brother it was farther away and he had trouble locating it on the view. I decided to make a report on this website, because I have not seen any other UFO sightings where letters were involved, and in this type of shape. I’d be able to recognize those letters if I were to see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

It was a clear night. As I approached the Smokey Point Exit, I noticed a very bright white light (the size of a bright star) traveling from the east to west. It was several miles north of my location. At first, I thought it was a shooting star. But it wasn’t moving as quickly, and it was blinking at the rate of about once per second as it moved across the sky. I watched it for several seconds, and thought perhaps it was a satellite. As soon as that idea crossed my mind, the light suddenly shot back the way that it came, zipped up, zipped north, and then shot east again...and disappeared. It startled me quite badly, and I felt nervous as I continued off I-5 at the Smokey Point (#206) exit. I kept searching the sky, looking for the mysterious light, thinking it might reappear near the place that it had disappeared.  As I turned east and came to stop at the light at Smokey Point Boulevard, I glanced around and looked directly up. I was terrified to see an extremely large triangular object hovering directly above the intersection. It was so low that the streetlights shined on its underside, highlighting large rectangular shaped panels and what appeared to be rivets that were spaced very far apart.  I can’t describe the size of the craft, because it extended beyond my scope of vision lengthwise, and I could see clusters of small white lights that indicated the shape. Could it be that they saw my headlights, and traveled to the intersection where I was heading toward? It HAD to be more than a coincidence.  I couldn’t believe my eyes. I looked around for other people who might see what I was seeing, but there were no other cars around, and no people to be seen at the 7-11 store on the corner.  Even after all I’d witnessed, I really hoped that my imagination was playing tricks on me, so I looked up and expected that ""it"" would be gone. But, it was still there.  I then noticed that it made no noise and created no turbulence in the air. I got SO frightened that I ran the red light, turning north onto Smokey Pt. Boulevard and drove as fast as I could all the way home. I never heard any other reports of this.  It has bothered me ever since, and I am uncomfortable to this day about looking skyward.

It was about 5:30am and we were traveling north from Monroe to Matthews on Old Charlotte Highway. We had just passed the Bakers vacinity and were passing over the railroad tracks when I looked over at her (she was driving) to say something, and saw what I first thought was an enormous reddish-orange moon hovering on the horizon. I remarked that it was the biggest moon I had ever seen in my life, and she glanced over too and agreed. She was not a person to get excited about ANYTHING, so she just kept driving. I leaned down to get a better look, and instantly realized this was no moon! It was the size of a garbage can lid held at arms' length at that point (enormous!), and it was perfectly round and glowing red/orange like the the color of lava. Because we were still driving, I couldn't tell if it was moving or just stationary. All this happened very quickly. I knew this was something very strange, and tried to get Aunt B's opinion, but she refused to look at it or comment on it (she was just that way, ignore it and it will go away). She said, ""It's just the moon"". I thought it was awful strange that it appeared to be ""on fire"" and yet, it was not lighting up the entire sky like a glowing red fireball probably would. Instead, it appeared to be just glowing, as if it had an inner light source. Nothing else looked unusual about the landscape or weather. It was very clear and cold that morning. I looked around to my side of the road, thinking everything should be orange colored, and looked up at the sky and panicked when I saw the real moon way up in the sky, white as snow, and the shape of a tiny fingernail! I begged her to stop the car so I could get a better look, but she silently just kept on traveling. I again looked out her window, saw the giant sphere glowing in the sky beside us, and suddenly, we passed by a stand of trees that blacked it out for a moment, and when we emerged, it ! was gone ! I tried to find a explanation for it, but nothing worked. It wasn't the upcoming water tower (she and I both agreed on this) as it was yet to be in view, and it was on the wrong side of the road. To this day, she has never discussed it, and gets furious if I bring it up. I did report this to MUFON by email, and they responded that it was probably a ""ball of gases"" since there is a fault line in the vacinity. I don't believe that for one second! This was perfectly shaped, brilliantly colored, enormous and didn't appear to light up anything else around! I couldn't hear anything, but then again, we were still going up the road. I have no explanation for it, and am relieved to read on here that others have had a similar experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was staying at the Sea Gypsy hotel, which is right on the beach in Lincoln City, OR. I had spent most of my trip just sitting in our room in front of the open window watching waves for hours. My partner had settled into bed, lights off, and I was still sitting at the window drinking coffee. Around 12:30-1:00am I leaned out the window to have a smoke and was looking up at the stars. From the South over the Pacific Ocean I saw what I thought was a bright, large group of stars. As they moved North, I noticed that there were six of these stars, all perfectly 6 pointed in shape, with no tracers from stars look you usually see. There were almost blue they were so white, and WAY more intense that the brighest star. These 6 ""stars"" were spinning individually, and they all spun in a perfect circle together as if orbiting something. Then all of the sudden they started spinning faster and would rotate from large to small to large to small orbits around this invisible center. It did this while traveling North in a spiral direction. Very hard to describe. Zoomed off faster to the North Pacific and disappeared. I sat there for 2 or 3 more hours and saw nothing like it... although I did see planes and a couple shooting stars, but this was unlike I have ever seen.

Date: March 29, 2008, Saturday (the night of the Earth Hour) Time: 10:15 PM (+-5 minutes) Place: Argyle Mall parking lot (Clarke Rd. at Dundas St.), London, Ontario, Canada  Brief Description  Two dim orangish-white lights in close proximity, flying low (around 3,000 ft??) and fast, at first in formation, and then independently, in small arcs; all the while remaining in proximity to each other. Before the lights disappeared in the distance, they had ""chased"" each other rapidly in a small circle. The entire ""performance"" resembled a bravado-fuelled airshow, with rapid manoeuvres and (nearly?) silent engines. The event lasted 4 or 5 seconds during which the objects traversed one-third of the sky. Although there were brief and faint sounds (a vibrating rumble and a wooshing noise) associated with the phenomenon, they may have been coincidental.  Full Description  After shopping at Wal-mart, I was walking through the Argyle Mall parking lot when a movement in the clear night sky induced me to look up. West of where I stood, some 50 degrees up in the sky, I saw two steady (non-flashing) orangish-white lights (the size of an average star, but noticeably dimmer) in proximity to each other, moving fast in formation in the southwesterly direction. I assumed this was an airliner with lights on both ends of its wings. The ""aircraft"" appeared to be flying very low, because the lights were moving very fast and the distance between them was rather large. (If I extended my arm, the length of my index finger would approximate the apparent distance between the lights. For what it's worth, I'd speculate that the altitude couldn't have been higher than 3,000 ft.)  When the lights simultaneously veered away from each other in symmetrical arcs, it became obvious that they were two separate objects that had been moving in formation. The objects then performed some playful airshow-style acrobatics (lots of rapid turns in different directions) at high speeds, all the while continuing in the southwesterly direction. Before they disappeared in the distance, the lights had performed a spectacular manoeuvre: for at least one second they were ""chasing"" each other in a small circle (perhaps 5 degrees in diameter), as if they were attached to the blades of a rotating propeller. The revolution was so rapid (at least two rotations per second) that it drew a distinct circle of light against the night sky. (It's possible that what looked like circular motions from a distance were actually coordinated corkscrew motions along the axis of the southwesterly trajectory the lights were following.) The entire experience lasted only 4 to 5 seconds, during which the objects managed to traverse at least one-third of the sky (this indicates considerable speed). Although there were other people nearby at the time, I doubt anyone else noticed this brief and low-key phenomenon.  What struck me about the quality of the motion of the objects was the speed and peculiar fluidity and smoothness with which they changed directions. The thought that came to my mind was: they behave like living creatures, not aircrafts -- the motion somehow reminded me of bats in flight or fish swimming in water. The final circular manoeuvre brought to mind mosquitoes or flies swarming around. I've never seen airplanes performing such swift and tight acrobatics.  While I detected some strange faint sounds coinciding with the sighting, I can't be sure they were emitted by the objects, as opposed to, say, cars. When I first noticed the lights, I heard a brief (one second) and low, vibrating rumble, and then, a few seconds later, as the objects were moving further away, a brief (less than two seconds), soft wooshing sound. I'm positive I heard no ordinary aircraft noises from propeller or jet engines. (The event took place after 10 PM when traffic noise in the area was at low intensity -- it shouldn't have drowned down the sound of planes flying so low.) The absence of normal aircraft sounds seems inconsistent with the most likely mundane explanation of my experience -- that the lights marked low-flying (and improperly lit) fighter jets on a night mission. Had the objects been such aircrafts, they should have produced audible and unmistakeable jet-engine drones. (I'm not aware of an acoustic stealth technology that's this effective.)  It may be relevant to note, however, that the Argyle Mall parking lot, where I had the sighting, is located only 3 km southwest from the London (Ontario) International Airport, and that, assuming they'd been following a roughly straight path even before I noticed them, the objects were coming from the general direction of the airport.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,42.98372082362082,-81.25387288267288

For some reason I decided to pet my dogs, which were barking inside the gates of the backyard.  As I was petting them I noticed a light or large star in the Eastern Sky..  As I continued to observe the white light, it moved from side to side vertically and horizontally, very rapidly , and then it turned into two flying vehicles.  At first, all I could see was the ""V"" shape on the front where lights were outlining the front of the vehicles, which was flying downward at a 45 degree angle.  My first thought was that they were some kind of new air force jets, since we have Sheppard Air Force Base here in Wichita Falls. As soon as I entertained that thought, the second of the two vehicles stopped and turned to a horizontal position and then turned its lights on!  It was just like the ones I had seen on television with the narrow horizontal long wise lights around the outside, and a large light shining out of the vehicle on the bottom..There were maybe 35-40 lights around the outside of the ship. I could see that the shape was oval and could see the beam of the light, as it shone downward.  There were also windows at the top of the dome, and I could see white light shining out, from the inside. It seemed that althought the light was on the bottom of the ship there was something around the light, maybe the device or air system which was keeping the system airprone.  It also seemed like there were some kind of purple or blue lights on the side of the vehicle as it turned on the bottom light.  The side lights and windows appeared first and then the bottom light. Then, after about 5 or 6 seconds the second vehicle returned to a 45 degree angle behind the first vehicle.  They continued flying in a downward pattern and disappeared behind some trees, so I am assuming the vehicle has some invisibility mechanism.  I did not see anyone in the vehicle through the windows but for some reason I think the cabin par! t of it was in the front where I first saw the V shaped light pattern.  When it returned to an angled pattern it turned its lights off, except for the V shape strand around the front. It was flying, maybe 25 or 30 feet behind the first vehicle.  This all took place within a 20-30 second period and is the first time I have seen anything like this.

Regarding the report a UFO over at O'Hare International in Chicago on Nov. 7, 2006. I've known several people who work at the airport on the ramps, maintence, etc, and I find them to be people who would not make something up as controversial as a UFO sighting in restricted airspace, especially n this era of heightened airport security and the Patriot Act, it impresses even more.

While leaving a friends house in rural Monroe County, three of us stepped out onto the front porch.  I commented on a greenish glow in the horizon, but the other two friends thought I was being funny.   I didn't say anything more about it, but after about 1 minute, I noticed that the horizon had become substantially greener.  The neon green glow stretched from one end of the horizon, to the other.  This was a very large phenomenon.  I told the two I was with to look again, and they were very surprised by what we were now looking at.  Very soon after the horizon had taken on what was now a very green glow, objects began to materialize then dematerialize, and move in an ""S"" shape for about half an hour.  This is a description of the objects that materialized:  First, let me tell you that the night was perfectly clear.  The initial object appeared and had a cloud like texture, which literally materialized right before our eyes, but then began to expand outward in the a diamond shape, with the center being empty, yet it was aligned with the outer diamond shape.  After reaching a certain size of expansion, the object would dissipate, or dematerialize.  Then, more of the same object began to occur, and began occurring simultaneously in different areas of the horizon.  Very soon after, another object appeared, but this one was circular and would move in an ""S"" shape downward toward the earth, leaving an ""S"" trail, and then dissipating as well.  This also had a cloud like texture to it.  Several of both kinds of objects kept appearing and either expanding as a diamond shape until dissipating, or growing into a circular shape and moving in an ""S"" pattern, downward toward earth.  The sky remained a very strong glow of green, and then in what seemed to be the climax of the entire event, two objects, both about the shape and size of a full moon, seemed to materialize out of nothing, a single object in between them appeared and shot down toward earth, and then shot right back up again.  After this, the entire phenomenon began to slowly go away.  It took another 15 minutes for it all to stop, each of the objects I described, except for the final moon like objects, began to appear less and less, and the sky slowly turned back to normal, and then it was all gone.  Let me note, this phenomenon made no sounds.  Also, I ran in the house and called the Sheriff’s department to ask if anyone had reported any strange phenomenon in the Northern part of the sky.  They said no, so I did not want to talk any further as they would have thought I was crazy.   I also called my sister who lived about 25 miles north of where I was and she said she saw nothing in the sky either.  So, I just ran back outside to continue watching.   My friends and I were in shock at what we just witnessed.   Then, I decided to go home, but I did notice every here and there, people were pulled over onto the side of the road watching the sky.  I have to think that they saw the same thing I did.   The following day, my friend who was with me, and attended the University of Michigan, asked a science professor if the northern lights were visible from where we were and he said they were not.  Besides, the northern lights don't do all that! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-02-01T00:00:00,41.9828,-83.29789999999998

I would estimate they were about 10 miles away. I pulled over immediatly and got out of my truck. I called my mother (that was the first thing that I could think of) and told her what I was looking at. Then I called the sherrifs dept. and told them what I was seeing and asked if they had any other reports, the lady that I was talking to did not want to tell me if anyone else has called. I got the feeling that all she was doing was answering calls about these orbs.  Then they sped off so fast to the south, toward Iowa, that it was almost as if they disapeared.

I will listen to you and all that but don't push this stuff on me... I have to see to believe, at that moment I made a request to them (aliens I guess) I wish they would come down right now so you can see them and believe in them. Like I do.  Well at that moment in conversation I told her in Spanish..."" look in the sky. Here comes a car.""   There were two lights directly above the Harbor Bridge like back behind it a little . She laughed and we just kept talking thinking the whole time it was probably a plane or something.  Well for some reason I was watching it in the corner of my eye, and then realized like in no time it was directly above us. At this point my wife was starting to freak, and I was so full of excitement that this was happening.  I remember looking up and this object was huge, and made no sound... that was scary ...something that big floating above us and all you could here was a hovering noise..a very faint hovering noise... not loud at all...  The lights glowed from white to yellow to green and then the reverse.  The object then moved directly behind the Art Building, came to a perfect stop and made a 90 degree turn around the corner of the building going beyond our sight... I was trying to run to the other side of the building and my wife was pulling on my hand.She did not want me to go because she was scared... I finally broke loose and ran around the building only to see the object blink out.  It jumped from near the art building to about 1 or 2 miles out above the bay and then just blinked out again and disappeared.  My wife to this day does not like talking about this incident....

I know it is fact and I always keep this with me as my life experience:  When I was between the ages of 10 and 13 (1993 - 1996) I attended YMCA Summer camp in Silver falls State Park in Silverton, Oregon. I remember one amazing experience I had involving triangular craft. My friend ((name deleted)) and I left our cabin group and stayed behind in the cabin area of camp, while the other children went to dinner. Alex and I lied down on a mattress pad outside of the cabins and were watching the stars. This area of Oregon has very tall fir-trees and we were watching the sky through a gap in the trees. From our right side a round bright white light crested over a large evergreen tree. It seemed to be no more than 30 -50 feet above the treetop. It moved closer towards us and as it did, two more lights become unblocked by the tree and a clear triangle shape was formed by these bright lights. The craft seemed to be the size of a large sized airplane. It was silent and moved very slowly. I remember expecting to see men repel from it on ropes, but it suddenly moved to our north and disappeared VERY quickly. Then in the horizon something caught my eye to our right side, I looked to the horizon through the trees and saw three bright white objects come together from different areas of the sky. These three objects formed a triangle of the exact proportions of the craft that had been close to us. To my amazement this formation suddenly accelerated vertically and disappeared into outer space. I kept my eyes steady in the sky, my eyes following its trajectory. Then I witnessed what appeared to be three stars break away from the night sky and come together to form yet another triangle with the same proportions as the first craft. This triangular ""star formation"" then suddenly shot across the sky like a meteorite, leaving a white streak in the heavens. Afterwards I asked ((name deleted)) if he saw the second and third triangle formations and he said “no”. When I asked him about the first craft, he seemed uninterested in discussing it. We never spoke of it again together and our friendship ended soon after that night. I rarely speak of this event. This was such an amazing encounter and when I read other flying craft encounters, I have never found one as interesting as my own.

It was around 11:30 pm when my wife and I decided to leave. We were the first to leave the party I had to work the next day and I don’t like to go to bed late on work nights we thanked our host and walked outside immediately I saw a disk like object with many lights circling above the farm house. It was nothing like I’ve ever seen before I said to my wife hey look at that. She said yea that’s strange. We stepped inside the car and drove west towards a major road and my wife said that the object was following us flying on the passenger’s side of the car I looked and saw it, turned left and the object turned with us I speeded up and the object did as well, turned right and he proceeded to follow. It was kind of strange. We drove another ten kilometers and this object kept the same distance from the car above us on the passenger’s side. I guess I got brave our stupid and stopped the car, got out and got a good look at the object that was spinning slowly in front of the car moving over a house then stopped spinning and started spinning counter clock wise coming back towards us. To get an approximation on the size of it I would have to know how high that he was flying, what I do know for sure is that it was close and large maybe the size of a football field and it still made no sound. After a few minutes I got back inside the car trying not to alarm my wife I kept my thoughts to myself and drove on turning left on the middle peel road. We thought that we had lost it because of the trees but that was an illusion, one minute later it was back on the passengers side of the car. When we reached Boekel we were driving under a lot of trees so we couldn’t see anything following us any more my wife said drive fast and hide the car in our garage so I did we got out of the car and ran inside the house. I told the baby sitter and she said that it was a shame that she couldn’t have seen it. Me being of the nosey types had to look outside and to my horror it was hovering above the neighbors house but now it was very close and I could see from the lights that he was slanting down in my direction I could no longer see the under side just one row of lights, looking at me. I called for the baby sitter and my wife to come outside, but when they did the thing took off like a rocket. I mean a blink of your eye as fast as light. Then the two ladies went back inside, a minute later it came back and I called the ladies back. This time the object stayed and the baby sitter turned a little shade of white and said that she was going home because this was scary. Then she departed for her house. Just them my neighbor was returning home from a party. Walked over to me and the object took off again. Then I told him  of our “strange night” He laughed and I told him to stay put it will come back, just then it returned and he was surprised  He had never seen anything lik! e this a nd a couple of minutes later it took off and we went back inside. While undressing I asked my wife what she thought of all this she said that you should not think about it because it was too scary. And we talked about things and one thing that we are sure of is that we were followed by something that is not from this world. Being an SSgt in the US Air force I know what conventional aircraft looks like this was not anything I’d ever seen before.

Being miles from any major town, like Sherbrooke, the night stars were very bright and numerous. None one was under the influence of any drugs, and a few people in the group had shared one or two bottles of wine after dinner. I personally had not had any wine.  All of a sudden a woman in our group exclaimed, ""Look, there's a UFO !!!""  Everyone could see a small distant round white light gliding across the arc of the night sky, no faster than a plane, but not as bright as plane lights. It eventually just gradually faded out till we couldn't see it anymore. I told the lady that I'd seen objects like that a lot and it was probably a satellite or a weather balloon. No one else commented.  Then we all began looking at the Big Dipper and talked about what it is called in other languages. In french it is ""L'Ours"" (sp?), the Bear, and someone said what the Dipper was called in Spanish. Then the same woman piped up, ""Look there it is again, the UFO"". I restrained my self from remarking it was just another satellite, but seconds later this small dim light had glided up into the ""kite"" area of the Dipper then up to the very top star and stopped on it. It then flew over to the next star, and so on until it had connected all the dots as if to show us it knew we had been talking about the Big Dipper. I don't really remember which stars it flew to and in which configuration but it touched every star on the kite part, then it exited the kite and zipped down the ""tail"" seemingly increasing velocity, then it faded out as it had done the first time. All five of us were in awe. But no one really spoke about it.  There was a guitar there and I began playing guitar and singing, so unfortunately I missed the fleeting reappearance of the object, to which everyone exclaimed ""Wow!!!"". No one told me what they saw and I never asked which is another strange thing about this experience. I think it might have been a magnificent flare up, I'm not sure but seemed this object made it's final exit with a major exclamation.  I moved away from Quebec to Maryland weeks after this sighting and have never seen or spoke to any of these people since, but I will go back and find the man I knew at the campfire, who will still be living in Sawyerville. He will definitely remember all this event. He has seen many UFO's out there since the late sixties, and I believe that because of the telepathic nature this object exhibited, that this man probably had some psychic or spiritual connection to these Beings or Intelligences ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We both had not consumed any alcohol our drugs. Circa 1 kilometre before we reached our village we saw a red-orange lighting oval object  which flew over a hill right next to the site. It was less than 50 metres over the ground near a power pole (perhaps in 200 or 300 metres distance from the pole) and flew very slow and irregulary from one side to the other in an area of about 50 metres. We watched the ufo for three or four minutes (as we discovered it, we immediately stopped our moped) and could see that the object slowly changed its shape from elliptical into roundly and back again into elliptical for some times. Also it looked like it was completely enclosed by a kind of orange fire, but this fire didn't jitter. Than we decided to take a closer look on it and drove up on the hill. On our way we had to drive through the village for some minutes and could not see the ufo in this time. Reaching the top of the hill we saw that the object was no longer here but somewhere over the neighbour-village, in a distance of about 2 or 3 kilometres, perhaps up to 5 km, I don't know exactly. Because the object could be seen from the house of my parents, we quickly drove forward to me. At home, I searched for my mother's photo camera, and because of the noise she woke up. I told her what was going on outside, and so we went into the garden and watched the object staying at the same place near the next village, changing its shape and brightness. At ca. 4:00 I could see that its brightness went darker and darker, and at last it dissapeared in nothingness after over an hour. I took eight photos of the ufo, but I was very surprised as I saw them some days later:   1.) I choosed a long exposure time for the camera, but just on two of the eight photos you can see something more than black sky. 2.)  It was also surprising that there were TWO objects on the photos! Both stood not in the center of the image but could be connected by an imaginary line which leads through the center   3.)

It looked as if it was released from the original star like object. A few seconds after that started happening we hurried into the office. So I do not know what happened next.

The lights of the city were slightly illuminating the clouds. Suddenly I saw one ball of light pass above the clouds moving in a South-Westerly maybe more Southerly direction. It looked odd so I kept watching. Then another ball of light exactly the same size and distance moved the same direction following the first, completely silent. I kept watching and there was another and another. I ran in to get my video camera and started taping this. There were several more. They seemed to be spaced the same distance apart and travelling the same rate of speed, like in some kind of formation, though the patches of clouds made it difficult to be exact. My first thought was that they were satellites, but then do satellites travel in this manner? I've seen many satellites before, but these were closer, or a lot larger-if they were out in space! These balls of light were about the size of a small green pea if you held it in-between your forefinger and thumb in an out-stretched arm. I think I counted about seven to ten seconds between each ball of light. Also, they just seemed too perfect for shooting stars - and there were too many of them. I saved the tape it's on (I hope!) Though I only got the last few of the formation on tape. I have other family 8mm tapes I've been meaning to go through to put on disc. Hopefully, I'll find this footage. When I do, I'll send you a copy. I've seen other unexplained things in the Nevada sky, and yes I've seen F-117 and the B-2 bomber, both stealths, amoung other military jets.

Although it has been 10 years since I, along with 2 of my friends, witnessed a triangular shaped aircraft in the sky over an empty field, I recall the details of what we saw quite well. It was between 9 and 10 p.m., we were travelling on a remote road west bound out of Hemet, Ca to our friends house in Winchester, Ca. I was in sitting in the back seat, my best friend was sitting in front of me and her husband was driving.  We were driving about 65 mph, when we saw bright lights hovering in the sky up ahead to our right, My friends Husband slowed way down as we approached the object finally coming to a stop.  We stopped the car and we were adjacent to the ""UFO"", first I was stuck by the size of it, as this thing was about football field sized in width and length. Then I was struck by the absence of any sound, I mean this thing was absolutely silent, also, the object was hovering, and it was only about 100 -150 feet in the air. The air-craft was black or dark in color, with three very large, bright white lights located at each of the triangle points, and there were several smaller more dim lights on each side, also there was a large red light in the center wich was casting a red glow to the ground directly beneath the craft. We sat there observing this air-craft for a couple of minutes, when my friends husband said he was going to get out and go get a closer look, my friend and I immediately protested telling him that we had seen enough and begged him to please get us out of there.  Then the thing started moving further away from us slowly to the norththen in what seemed like an instant it was about 1/2 a mile away and had gaind alot of altitude. We drove on to our friends house wich was only a few more minutes away, as we drove I continued to watch the thing in the sky, and even though it was 1/2 mile away or more it was now west bound and adjacent to us. We arrived at our friends house only to find that no one was home so, we left. My girlfriend and I asked her husband to take the main street home, as the continued presence of the ""UFO"", was making us very nervous. We left heading north first then we turned onto the highway heading east bound, once we were heading east, we could see the ""UFO"" then futher north now but trailing behind us heading northeast. As we rounded the last bend right before you enter the city limits we lost sight of the triangle shaped ""UFO"". Over the years my friends and I have discussed the encounter we had with the ""UFO"", we are not really convinced that this was anything extraterrestrial. Since we are not far from March Air Force Base, the possibility of the air-craft being some kind of new technology the armed forces have is very real. On the other hand, an air-craft that size being able to hover at such a low altitude without any sound, nor causing any kind of, (for lack of a better term) ""wind"",  seems to be impossible.  Out of all the people I have spoken to about our sighting I have only found two other people who had seen the same thing in this area. In 2003 I watched a program on the Discovery channel and saw that people all over Arizona, had seen the same thing around the same time we had our sighting. Today I watched another Program on TV stating sightings of this same ""UFO"" all over the world, and so I thought I should also share my experience as well. I hope this information will help in some way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-08-07T00:00:00,33.68582744565217,-116.9679269021739

I was outside my college dormitory and we were having a school event.  I am Native American and we were having a drum and dance social event.  I was singing with the other singers when one of the drummers pointed to the northwest and said “Oh my god! Look at that!”  I turned and looked it was night time out when I turned and looked I thought we would be crushed in a few seconds by the enormous ship we saw.  It seemed to be landing.  It was so enormous I can only say that it looked like a large metropolis landing.   It made no sound but had a strange energy that you could “sense or feel”.  It had millions of little lights all over it and in many colors.  It was like a city because it was not a uniform shape.  It had many appendages and parts to it.  It was so big it seemed to nearly block out that part of the sky.  I was standing there and just complete shock hit me.  That is all I remember.  When we “came to” or became conscious again I felt dazed and like the memory of it was fading so quickly that I had to meditate quickly to hold it in my mind.  Everyone else seemed to just go back to what they were doing and when I tried to get them to talk about it or even come with me to go search for it, they seemed like zombies.  At the time I was pregnant, I don’t know if that was a factor in how I might have been treated if we were abducted or if our minds were manipulated at all.  I was a peer counselor at the time at the schools student drop in center “The Healing Circle”.  I ran A.A. meetings and held traditional “Talking Circles” for the Native students who needed support emotionally and we had our own licensed Psychologist on staff as well.  He was standing right next to me and witnessed this too. I believe we lost some time too. He was the only one who wanted to go running after this thing.  I eventually convinced some friends who were not there to witness it to take me to look for it.  We rode around in the car for a bout two hours.  We couldn’t find anything and it should have been right on top of us if! it was going to really land anyway.  While we were driving around we did see military jets circling the area for quite awhile.  I believe people called the radio stations and 911 too.  I can’t confirm that though.  The strangest thing was that I did forget the incident for about 5 years I could not remember it.  One day I was working with some youth, I am now a social worker, we were driving toward Minneapolis’s downtown and we could see the skyline.  We were talking about strange things like Bigfoot and UFO’s when suddenly the memory came flooding back instantly.  I was overwhelmed and that same shocked feeling came over me. I still don’t remember what happened though between the times I saw it landing and then the next second “poof!” it was just gone, completely vanished.  I have never reported this before.  I found this website and thought it was time to tell the story.  I have looked online for a picture of a UFO that would be similar to what I saw but I haven’t.  I am Native American and my tribe believes in Aliens completely.  I do too, especially now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This sighting occurred during the summer of 1997.  I wish I remembered a more accurate date, but I did not record any information after it occurred; family and friends basically made me feel embarrassed for telling this story… which is why I have not formally reported it until now.  I was age 17 at the time of this event.  In the summer of 1997, I lived in Kokomo, Indiana, and at about 11:30 PM on a weeknight, I was on my way (driving) to a local Kroger store to see my girlfriend off of work.  I was on S Dixon Rd., heading north as I passed over some train tracks and began approaching a bridge when I noticed a solid bright white light at my 1 or 2-o-clock in the sky.  At first I thought it was pretty far away, but as I continued to drive north I realized that the object was now at my 3-o-clock, and so was actually very close to me.  At this time, I became curious and turned right on to W King St., which appeared to lead directly to the hovering object.  As I drove towards the object, I pulled up to a house in the residential area that this object was apparently hovering over.  The house was on my right, and so I stuck my head out of the driver’s side window and looked over the hood of my car, up above this house… to see a large black triangular object with 3 bright white lights at each tip, and in the center of the triangle was one large deep red circle (facing downward at the house).  I was fortunate to have been able to observe this object from such a close distance; I remember it being about 150 yards away from me while it hovered over the house.  I was also amazed at how quietly the object hovered, as I remember hearing nothing over the sound of my own car engine.  I sat with my head out of the window observing the large triangle for about 1½ minutes before the object began to slowly rise and move in a NW direction, after which it then took off at very high velocity.  As far as I know, I was the only observer of this object, as almost all of the houses in the neighborhood appeared to have their lights off and I saw no other cars on the road.  I never heard of any news of a sighting reported by anyone else after that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I've experienced many different really weird things that I have seen, all in the same radius within 5 miles of each other.  One night my truck had broken down, it was late, more like early am, I was parked on a downgrade, being afraid of the dark, and knowing of all the wildlife I had seen in the rual area I was in, I was afraid to walk to get help, I just sat in my truck waiting for a vehicle to come by, I looked out my rear view mirror, I saw a bright, like glowing round circle, it was like bouncing in the air, like there was no gravity, I watched it for awhile in my mirror, I physically turned around to see it out of the mirror, it was there without the mirror, it just bounced around, it would suddenly move sideways real fast but would keep like moving up, and down like floating.  I saw the same glowing light once before that, I looked out the window in the early am, or late evening, and saw the same bright light, but much smaller bouncing around like near the ground , I think it was like a few months within the time frame, a few of us were standing on some stairs outside, like in the late afternoon, it was still light outside, we saw what we thought was a plane crash in mid air, I don't remember seeing anything before hand, but suddenly there was like an explosion of something in the sky it didn't seem too far, because it was sooo visible it looked like 2 planes had crashed in mid air, and suddenly parts of debris scattered, and were falling downward, I was like soo shocked to have witness this unusual thing, we thought for sure it had been a horrible plane crash, it looked to severe, we thought for sure we would read or hear about the incodent in the paper, or news, I looked for days, I never heard, or read of any such sighting ever.  I still to this day wonder what in the world these weird things I experienced were.

I don't have the exact date, it was some time ago.  I estimate it was the summer of 1995.  I was outside in my back yard in South Los Angeles CA.  Clear blue sky, no wind, early afternoon.  Something told me to look up.  I did and at an altitude of about 10,000 feet (estimated, it was just above the normal flight plan of landing LAX planes) headed east bound right over downtown was what appeared to be a weather balloon, silver in color.  This ballon was shaped like a 3 dimensional polygon, the sides were triangular so I gues it would be described as a dodecahedron.  I looked closer and saw several dark collered what looked like jet airplanes with curved back wingtips in hot pusuit of this weather balloon.  Just then a friend of mine walked up and wondered what I was looking at.  I showed him and he saw the same thing (a big releif!).  Just then the Balloon stopped in mid flight just east of downtown Los Angeles.  The ""jets"" that were in hot pursuit split off in formation and began circling the baloon (i.e. the first plane went let, second went right, third left and so on).  The Balloon stated to spin at about 10 rpm.  More and more ""jets"" began to appear and I counted maybe 20 of them at this point.  After holding in this position for about 2 minutes the baloon took off stright up at a rapid and controlled rate and the jets broke the circular formation and followed right behind the balloon in a straight line, straight up until I could no longer see them with the naked eye.  The speed was comprable to a space shuttle launch but there was no noise, no smoke or trails.  I heard no unusual sound and the only thing I noticed is this was taking place in the normal flight plan that planes land at LAX and during the entire time of the sighting no other air traffic was seen or heard.

I raised the sunglasses and the object was not visible. I put the glasses back on and it was visible. It was very faint and line pattern was white in color. so the object was a white line on a blue sky background with white clouds all around. Very hard to see. I had some binoculars just out of arms reach and I was worried about losing the object. I took a chance and reached for the binoculars. I never saw it again. The object was perfectly round and symmetrical. It did not move, with my outstretched arm, it was about half the size of my thumb. At the altitude that it was, that would make it huge.

In April 1996 my 12 year old son, his friend and I were were returning from a fishing trip south of Fremantle near Perth, Western Australia.  Driving North at approx 21:30 at night along the coast road we saw a bright orange light in the distance that resolved into 2 orange lights side by side.  Passing under the lights I looked out the car window to see a triangle shaped object hovering approx 100 metres above us and approx 20 degrees to one side of our vehicle. The orange lights that we could see from a distance were no longer visible.  We pulled over and crossed the road where we were close to being underneath an object that had several large red and green lights underneath, with a large central white light. There were small winking lights on the 2 outside (wings) of the delta shape. We could clearly see the outline of the craft and that it was silent and hovering in place. The craft was an isosceles triangle that appeared to be the size of a small civilian aircraft in width. Only one other vehicle passed us during this time and the passengers ignored our efforts to point out the object.  After approx 2 mins hovering the craft rotated on its axis and slowly moved East away from our position. It stayed the same altitude and we watched until the craft had moved off into the distance and out of sight.  Since the craft had moved off in the direction of our home suburb I told the boys to keep a lookout. We encountered the craft crossing the main highway approx 8 kilometres from where we first saw it. We turned down the nearest street to pace the craft that was slowly following large power lines behind suburban housing. At this point we noticed 3 smaller winking lights come in at speed from the surrounding night sky and join with the object. The boys kept the craft under observation while I drove parallel to its course. Approx 30 seconds after the smaller objects joined with the craft the boys said that it had suddenly gone straight up into the sky at great speed. As I was driving I did not see the craft leave though when I did look to the side a second later the craft was gone.  We made a report to a local UFO investigator who (with our permission) passed the sighting onto a local newspaper. Wishing to remain anonymous we did not give any personal details except to confirm what the investigator had told them. I have not referred this sighting to any other person since that time.  I understand that this is an old sighting, tho I hope it may add to your knowledge of these events.

I didn't really know where to start or what to look at so I just decided to check out the surface of the moon. It was really amazing to see all the surface features, craters etc.  About an hour had went by of gazing and trying the different powered lenses. I zoomed in on the moon using 25mm eyepiece which will focus on a 3-400 sq. mile area of the moon. I started noticing that about every minute and a half or so, sometimes one but mostly in pairs little black dots would go by as if it were some type of plane orbiting the moon (the moon was full). At first I thought that it was satellites that circle the earth passing in front of the moon, but then I realized that this would have to be something orbiting the moon itself due to the multiple times that these objects traveled the exact same path. The next night I decided to look at the moon again oddly enough I saw the same black dots mostly in pairs and slightly staggered but sometimes only one. I watched this for about 30 minutes, probably 12-13 times. These were very clear black dots and any satellite between here and the moon would not be this clear and so small. So I wrote some emails to astronomers and asked, thinking it would be something easily explainable. The response I got back stated that anything orbiting the moon would be too small to be seen in a telescope and also they knew of nothing currently orbiting the moon. I've looked at the moon a dozen or so times since and have not seen anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

But what happened was me and my gf at the time were outside talking and noticed these lights, one at first, then 3, they hovered in a way, coming very close together at times and then separating, moving in sparatic ways.  It was shaped in a triangle at times but not always, and sometimes it was a close knit triangle and other times a very distance but still resembled a triangle triangle.  Sometimes the lights were very bright red and other times dim, they did seem to turn white for a min or two, not very long though.  Then finally the lights all came together into one and it was a bright red like hovering and finally it seemed to moved away from the earths atmosphere because it slowly got dimmer until you couldnt see the red light anymore.   THere is NOO way this was an airplane as say by some agencies and governments.  It honestly couldnt have been explained, they moved in such different and odd ways.  Also anything with a motor (helicopers... whatever) would have been heard. you didnt hear anything and no distinct ""flying object"" was actually identified except for the lights.

It seemed to be keeping an exactly parallel distance from the landscape, because it moved up and down as if following every contour of the land.  It never touch the ground, but seemed to stay exact an approx. distance of 100 feet or more from the ground. It swiftly came over the ridge and down the hill, across the river and up the other side.  Once it went over the ridge we lost sight of it.  The bright red glowing ball was followed or being chased very closely by two black helicopters.

No I didn't contact the authorities here, I was quite a ways from the nearest town, and it was late at night.  I will contact my son to have him make a report.  We haven't talked about it for years, so it will be interesting to hear what he remembers.  I also tried to make a report about an incident years ago when I witnessed a bright light above the town of Culdesac, Idaho.  It was approximately around April or May of 1996, I would have to double check, because I am sure that I wrote it down.  The amazing thing was that a few days later I read in the Lewiston Morning Tribune (LMT)as ad asking for anyone who witnessed  something over the town of Culdesac to phone a certain phone number.  I again didn't call or report this.  Chicken I guess. At that time, I was working as a ((title deleted--public employee)).  When I witnessed the bright light, I at first thought that it was an airplane just reflecting the sunshine, but I realized that it was just way too bright to be an airplane.  I then noted that it wasn't moving, it seemed to be positioned in one place high above the town. I was driving home from work, and was actually looking at a double rainbow in the sky when I seen the bright light.  Another thought....I remember seeing a picture of that same rainbow in the LMT the next day.  The bright white light seemed to be totally still, then after 5 or 6 minutes, it appeared to be falling straight down for a distance, then zipped off at a 45% angle in a western direction. It was immediately out of sight.  There was a car in front of me, and I did see that they were also watching the rainbows. I wonder if they also seen the bright light, or could have reported it.

We stopped to see what it was, if we could. The fog was comming right twords us, and so was the light. Eventhough it was covered in a haze of fog you could tell this was no plane, it was getting closer and brighter. It was very big and almost right on top of us when we all got scared and ran.

The night was completely clear with no moon, the sky looking very very black, showing an unusual amount of stars for a city skyline. While turning back toward the west to catch sight of the next plane, 2 lights caught my attention.  They seemed to be quite low in the sky, much lower even than the aircraft on approach about 12 miles from the airport. They seemingly followed the same path as the aircraft that had just gone ahead of it. There was absolutely no sound, which was strange, but what was stranger… The 2 lights were not overly bright, no brighter than the brightest stars visible, but as they traveled east, they moved toward and away from each other. At the outermost part of the cycle, the lights were about 35 to 40 feet apart, from the ground they came apart a distance that seemed a bit wider than the houses they flew over. At the innermost part or cycle they would almost touch. A complete cycle I would guess at maybe 3 seconds. I saw this for a total of about 6 or 7 seconds.  The path the 2 lights took toward and away from each other was perfectly straight, almost as they were moving from wingtip to body center and back. But there was no wings or body, there were no stars blocked out as it traveled; there was no shape or outline of any kind.  I was surprised once more when it  disappeared right after it seemed to pass over the nearest house to me,, emphasizing how low it was.  The speed was fast enough that it would have been visible across the sky, from west to east, for no more than 10 or 12 seconds.

It was approximately -34 to -44 degrees below zero with a strong wind and dark.  It was colder inside our automobiles than outside so we waited outside our vehicles while they were warming up.  I looked up at approximately south, southeast (which was above the discount store building) to observe an object, in the shape of a trapezoid, that was large enough that it's bottom was 7 degrees above the horizon and it's top was 24 degrees above the horizon.  The object had a cluster of lights that were semi structured / semi randomly placed that apeared mother of pearl in color.  It was stationary regardless of the wind.     I waited to see if the other person observed it as well then he asked me if I was seing what he was seeing.  After observing it for about 15 minutes it moved 5 degrees to the right then went stationary again.  At this time our vehicles were warm so we both drove home.  It just so happens that I lived 1.4 miles in the direction of the object.  So I observed it getting larger as I drove toward it.  From the balcony of my appartment I observed it for another 15 minutes.  Then I went to sleep due to exhaustion.  I since then have taken GPS readings from both sighting locations.  With the help of University Scientists I have obtained Infrasound and Weather Radar Data.  The infrasound data may not be related based on university staff reccomendations.  Also, the infrasound readings are below audible levels.  I did not hear any noise. However two bars of infrasound do appear.  One bar at about 21:00 the other bar maybe 45 minutes later. (The one scientist that explained this to me became upset when I expressed my intention to report this data.) It is estimated that the object was 45 miles away and 4,000 feet above the earth. (?) With the help of three mathematicians I estimate the width of the object to be about 23.3 miles wide. ! It is t hought to be of a natural origin.  However, it did seem to exhibit some movement that suggests intelligent operation.  But I cringe at that speculation.  The creative part of me wants to elaborate and fill in the blanks.  But the logical side of me is struggling to explain it away as a natural phenomenon.   I have put together a 77 page book on it and sold one copy over ebay.

I'm not sure about the exact date of the occurance, as it happenned almost twenty (20) years ago, but when I saw the triangular image today, it confirmed my observation in Carlsbad CA, of a diamond shaped object hovering over the Pacific Ocean.  My dad and I were out on our balcony after dinner, around 9:00pm, when we noticed the diamond shaped object, hovering over the Pacific for about two (2) minutes.  Then without any sound or vibration, the diamond shaped object flew directly over our condo, at an extremely high rate of speed.  Then two (2) air force jets, which had to be scrambled out of Mirimar air force base, attempted to follow the diamond over our condo, but when compared to the speed of the diamond, the jets were no contest. The reason I am writing this today, is because your organization might care.  You might be able to reference Miramar's records to confirm a scramble. Again, my recolection is 19 years coming.  I might even be a year off, but if there are records available regarding the Air Force's action, it may give you some answers.

We slept in hammocks tied to small trees with few leaves present.  At around one in the morning, the little town close to where we were turned off the electric power.  So we were in the dark except for a bright moon up in the sky.   Five minutes after the town went dark this object flew overhead heading north.  It was the size of VW bug, round, shiny white as a the most perfect brightest mirror you have ever seen.   Around the white mirror there was a solid green light all around the object.  The object flew silently over the river heading towards the ocean. If I had a bow and arrow I could have hit it. The light was so bright that I could see everything around me almost like it was daylight, except that all was green.  I asked my father :""Did you see that?""  He said : ""Yes.""

Well my bro and I run outside and my dad is in the middle of the yard staring at the sky.  We look up and there is this round object flying extremely low and what seemed slow...so low its scary..but yet we dont say a word to each other nor do we run away...we can't help but just stand there in awe and stare as this object is about to fly over our heads...its the size of a house and it has small white round lights around the perimeter.   It is not making a sound and its about 10pm so no one is outside yelling or making a commotion..matter of fact, if you werent looking in the sky it would have flown right over your head without you ever knowing. It flew directly over our head and now that im older i can say that it was probably about 300ft. above us...it cleared some power lines but was so low i remember thinking to my self ""its gonna hit the power lines"".  It also flew what i would consider slow...about 30mph. I know SOMEONE else HAD to have seen it around the area as we live in a residential neighborhood in the city.  We didnt have a camcorder or camera back then and i know that now thats the first thing i would grab if i ever saw it again.  I remember telling everyone but back then no one seemed to care so i just kinda buried the memories and it was begining to feel like i dreamt that night because i dont talk to my dad anymore and my bro never brought it up but my wife asked me if i ever thought i'd seen a ufo so i asked my bro if he remembered that night and he confirms my story.   His account is exactly the same except he says he remembers shortly afterwards black helicopters were flying around the area because my dad pointed them out (he was a helicopter mechanic back then).  My bro is 3 years younger so i guess i would have been about 10 or 11 and he was! 7 or 8 when this happened.  Oh yeah...i know the object was round because when it flew over us, you could see this massive round black silouette in the dark sky and the perimeter lights were not beams but rather dull yellow white lights.

Today, 11/16/07 I visited your site again since 8/7/07 and was happy to see my first posting up, so now I would like to post the second one.  The summer of 1990 my extended family was visiting from overseas, and we decided to vacation in Ocean City, MD.  On or about July 20, 1990 after a long day shopping and enjoying the beach weather, my brother and I walked down to the beach for a smoke.  We sat on the shore and talked, when I noticed a set of triangular lights that seemed to dance around each other in the night sky. At first I just thought they were stars, but I also noticed they would blink every now and then, as if they disappeared and reappeared again.  At first I thought, the motion of the waves might have influence over balance, and perhaps on a clear night stars really do twinkle, so I quickly dismissed it as just a quirk. Then suddenly I saw one light dart away from the other two. At first I had hesitated in telling my brother what I had seen, but noticing that the other two lights had now followed the stray light from East to West, I asked him to look up in the sky and tell me what he saw.    My brother then affirmed what I had seen, and we began to speculate as to what it could be, he was the first to say it might be UFOs.  This went on for about 30 minutes, it was definitely not something that was just momentary, it seemed as if the three lights danced around each other, followed each other, and perhaps signaled each other. This is my second sighting, both of which I've witnessed with two different family members, who can verify my stories. I would like to further add that coincidentally on August 1977 I became psyschically intuned with departed loved ones through dreams.  I just find it fascinating that my first sighting which was a direct encounter with a saucer might have enhanced these abilities or are directly attributed to them.  Since my encounters I've read many books, including the powerful Edgar Cayce on Indigo children which represent a new evolutionary human society.  Emissaries from heaven is the term that is associated with children with psychic abilities.  I was 13 when I became psychically aware.  I want to thank your website for helping me realize that what I have witnessed is not something I dreamt up.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,38.338344927536234,-75.12374057971014

My father has been in the Air Force for quite some time.  My mother threw her back out, and she was in the bed one night.  My father and I always love looking at stars and stuff, and that night we were suppose to have a meteor shower.  My mom helps verify the story, so I know that it really did happen.  I was about 10 years old. My father and I went outside and walked over to a good place to see if we can see the meteor shower.  As soon as we walked over to the area immediately there was a saucer aircraft I would say about 85 yards from us hovering near the tree.   My hair raised up on my arms and I stood their in AWE. The craft was rotating it had numerous different color of lights.  It was saucer shaped and I want to lean that it looked like it had a double stack shape to it.  It was hard to see the craft because of these lights all over it.  My dad just stood their. I was like oh my god there is a flying saucer.  I couldn't believe it because my whole life my father said that stuff was non sense, but my mother believed in them because her mother had witness a UFO herself.  Within about 3 minutes, the craft immeditaley took off.  It made a vertical direction, and I am not kidding you, diffentely left us with a speed amazingly fast.  After that happened I know it was not man made, or at least anything that could have been man made with our current technology.  I immediately ran inside to tell my mom about it. My mom to this day stands behind me that I came in and told her all aboutit.  My father who works for Air Force Intelligence orginazatin even currently, denies it.

I stayed in bed most of the day watching TV.  My mother came home from work at the ordinary time and cooked dinner.  We all ate and then I went back to my room and continued to watch the TV, that had not been turned off all day.  As it began to get later and dark outside, my parents went to bed and I continued to watch TV.  Here is where my encounter began.  I don’t remember what show was on, but I do remember that I was beginning to doze off while watching TV around 11PM or so.  All of the sudden, my television turned off.  I immediately assumed that I had rolled over on the remote and accidentally turned it off.  I grabbed the remote and hit the power button, but nothing happened.  I then thought that either the tube was shot from being on all day or that after I rolled over on the remote and turned off the TV that the battery must have gone dead in the remote.  I then got up out of bed and walked over to the TV.  I reached down and pressed the power button on the TV and nothing happened.  I then figured that the tube was gone and reached over to my stereo, which was in the same entertainment center, and pressed the power button.  Again, nothing happened.  I thought, it could have been a power outage but the only problem with that is that both my TV and stereo had a “standby” light which was red and signified that the units were receiving power.  Both lights were lit.  At this time I started to get a feeling that someone or something was “fooling” with me and I had a feeling that I was being watched.  I had two windows in my room.  One was facing the front yard and street, and the other was facing our next door neighbor’s house which was probably 50 to 60 feet from our house.  Something inside me told me to look out of the window that was facing my next door neighbor.  Both of my windows had blinds and both blinds were closed.  I stepped over the window facing my neighbor and began to roll open the blinds.  As soon as the blinds opened just enough for me to get a glimpse of the yard, I saw a disc-shaped object hovering over the ground right outside my window!  Although I didn’t get to see this object long, I will never forget what I saw.  There were blinking lights of all colors around the rim of the disc and I couldn’t hear a sound that it was making.  As soon as I got a glimpse of this object, it took off flying straight up in the air.  It took off so quick that it startled me even further, but my interest was on high alert and I wanted to know what this was.  I then pulled the string down so that the blinds would open completely.  When the blinds were open, I looked up to the sky and I saw this object, now just a speck in the night sky, suddenly disappear!  I stood there for a few moments trying to make sense of what had just happened.  After I regained my senses, I reached over and pressed the power button on the TV and it came on!  I immediately thought to myself that I must be dreaming, so I went into the dining room which was adjacent to my bedroom and wrote a note to my mother that said, “wake me up if you get this note, I saw a UFO”.  I then went to bed and figured if I had dreamed this, she would never get the note.  She did get the note, and woke me up in the morning.  I was a football player, a very smart student.  Although I had drank alcohol maybe once or twice on an experimental basis with my friends, I had NEVER used any kind of drugs, nor had I EVER experienced any episode of hallucination.  This really happened and I would sware to it!  When I told my mother what had happened, she didn’t tell me that she did not believe me but I could tell that she probably didn’t want me to tell anyone else this story.  I really didn’t want to tell anyone anyway because the story sounded so “crazy” and I didn’t want people to think that I was delusional.  I did tell a couple of select people over the next year or so, and got the reaction that I thought that I would get, so I kind of forgot about it.  I joined the Army a few years later, and when I was in training in Colorado, I told a friend of mine this story and he proceeded to tell me a similar story from when he was a teenager in Utah.  It involved his truck stalling out in the middle of nowhere and he then witnessed a UFO hovering over his truck.  It took off just as quickly as the one I saw did and then his truck became operable again.  After he told me this, I became a little more comfortable telling this story and began telling more people.  I attempted to tell my story on one of these websites once before a few years ago, but it was not as user friendly as your site and I don’t think it went through.  Just about an hour ago, I saw a show on the history channel about USO’s, which led me to google “UFO sitings”, which led me to your site and I decided to go ahead and put my story on here.  I am a sales manager for a Toyota dealership.  I am a very intelligent person and my family and friends often look to me for advice on lots of things.  I come from a family that taught me to tell the truth, even when it hurts.  I come from a middle-class family which is a very conventional, church-going, don’t make any waves type of family.  I don’t want to overstate this, but this is the TRUTH. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2007-11-28T00:00:00,33.7522,-85.1444

There was a tree line on the other side of the field, and whatever we saw moved in between us and the trees about 35 - 50 ft above the ground. The two lights became very bright and began to spin clockwise around each other. It seemed as if we could possibly see a silhouette of something behind the lights, but we could not tell what shape it was. After about 30 seconds of spinning they leveled off, dimmed and began moving slowly away in just about the same direction, and a few seconds later the lights just turned off or disappeared.

She too was fascinated by what I was telling her and I gave her a ""play-by-play"" account while I was looking at the object. I watched it until I could no longer see it in the distance.  I felt frightened and fascinated at the same time.  Also, it had a fuzzy glow about it and no sound seemed to be coming from it.  We were very excited to see it and I wanted it to fly more around my area so I could enjoy the moment more.  Tonight, I am feeling very lucky to have seen such a thing.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

I am a sixty year old Marine corps veteran who has watched the skies since I was a teenage Civilian Observation Corps volunteer.  I do not drink nor take drugs which would interfere with my vision. I hesitated for several weeks to report this anamolous phenomenon because sky conditions have not been ideal -- thunderstorms and clouds, not to mention the urban light scatter that makes observations in Atlanta difficult.  However this sighting has repeated itself a dozen times in the last few weeks and I felt compelled to report it.  In each occurance several hovering lights have been observed out of my bedroom window which faces almost due east.  This view looks out on a main air traffic corridor in and out of ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson International) and PDK (Peachtree Dekalb).  On these evenings I would observe the normal comings and goings of the aircraft, with their landing lights, wing lights, strobes, etc. and what I observed was obviously not an aircraft.  I would see one perhaps two lights hovering in position from just above the horizon, perhaps ten degrees, up to almost directly above.  On one or two occasions the light would appear just after a flash like a strobe,  On others the strobe flash was diffused by a high overcast.  The lights, which varied from a reddish white to a bluish white, would remain stationary for thirty seconds to five minutes, then would fade and in their place a line of lights would appear, usually canted from the horizontal, like a wing making a turn, or sometimes three red lights would appear in the same spot in the shape of a triangle, equilateral or isocoles, then would morph back into a light and move quickly, probably too quickly for an aircraft, to the northwest or southwest, DIRECTLY ACROSS the flight patterns of two airports.  It is extremely difficult to estimate altitude but would not be surprised if they were manuvering over fifty thousand feet.  As I mentioned the cloud cover made it difficult to track them completely across the sky but the consistency of the pattern is remarkable.

The moon was just past it's full phase and lit up the night quite well, making stellar photography difficult.  The park is on the northwest outskirts of my town and the light from it is blocked by trees and low surrounding hills, making for a reasonable observing site.  The nearest airport is 12 miles away at Edinburgh and the flightpath for it crosses well to the south, with aircraft already low on their approach.  Flights practically cease after 11pm.  As I was waiting for my telescopes tracking systems to calibrate i was looking to the northeast to see if I could catch site of a meteor or two.  I noticed what I at first took to be a satellite since it moved in much the way satellites do, just fast enough to be noticed and on a silent, straight course across the sky.  However the reason I noticed it so quickly was that it was quite bright, too bright to be a satellite and yet far too fast to be a planet.  I grabbed a pair of 10 x 50 binoculars and followed the light across they sky for about a minute, and the reason for the brightness became clear.  The binoculars resolved the light into 3 lights in tight triangular formation, giving the impression that they were fixed to one craft moving on a southerly course.  The lights were unblinking white and never varied in position, size or intensity.  I was unable to discern what they might be part of, the distance being too great.  I had to return to my equipment for a few minutes and when I once again looked for the object I was unable to find it.  I would assume it was somewhere near the full moon by this time and I would have little chance of seeing it if it were not already over the horizon or hidden by the haze of the town lights.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

I overlook the Verrazno Bridge supporting towers and the object was somewhat above the height of the supporting towers. The object was square in shape and moved at about the speed of a dirigible. Not seeing an airplane in the area, I went back to the bedroom and got my glasses. I thought that the object might be a box kite but I discounted that because of the height. Back in the living room I saw that the object was now closer to the bridge. It was grey with a black design of some sort along the top and bottom. When it reached the area of the tower closer to Staten Island the object turned to its right, to the west, and continued in that direction until I could no longer see it. When it turned I could see that it was narrow. I thought that it might be an advertising banner being pulled by a plane but, as I indicate above, there was no plane in the area. I then thought that it might be a weather balloon despite its shape but a balloon could not turn as it did. I estimate that I am about 1 1/2 miles from the Brooklyn side of the bridge and the object was another 1/2 mile to 1 mile beyond that. Unfortunately, I own neither a camera nor binoculars.

We were looking into the sky at stars, small aircraft, etc.  I looked ESE and saw, just above a tree line, four small white lights in a triangular pattern (three on the left side, one completing the back right corner) travelling approximately south.  I said to my brother, ""What the heck is that?"" and pointed to the lights.  I had initially thought it was a formation of planes, but it couldn’t have been; besides the fact that there were no red, blue, or any blinking lights, it became apparent that we were looking at one solid object.  I only realized this as the triangular object began to move behind trees.  My brother was standing to my left and had a better vantage point, and he saw it dip down, come back up, and then fade out.  The whole incident lasted a few seconds.  A few minutes later, a helicopter started circling around that area; it’s difficult to determine distances, but I would say that the helicopter was probably closer to us than the object had been, and a little more south.  It had a bright search beam on and searched for about a half-hour.  We saw quite a few planes and a bird in flight while standing there, so we could distinguish between those and whatever it was we saw.

At times, it would stop completely, then move in tiny circular motions.  It was stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then moved forward and then backward.  My house faces due west and it was traveling from the west to the east.  As it came more overhead, at this time about a 90 degree angle, I began noticing a straight line extending from the white, round base that was also a solid white.  I called Nellis Air Force Base and they gave me your phone number.  I have left a message for you on the phone number that the Air Force Base gave me.  Before signing off, I just went out to check it again.  It is still in one place, but bouncing around in an almost jerky, circular pattern.

Well, frist of all I'd like o say that I'm very scared because ever since April the 1st of the year 2005, I saw what looked to me to be an alien craft, since that day i keep seeing it over and over every year on the same day exept for this day. Well, this time i was smart enough to call over my sisters to have some witnesses. This is how it happened i had come home from school and i went to go check on the dogs that we have, well the moment i went out there i felt has if something was wathching me and i loocked up and saw a small object preety high up in the air i was suprised and i started to think its gotta be an airplane or a ballon or something and then i started to remember about what happened one year ago and two years ago on the same day. It acted almost the same has the one from last time. It moved around pretty fast and it keept going back and forth, thn after probably 5 minutes i called my sisters and told them look i see it agian look come before it leaves. when they came they were like i dont see anything?? And then they looked closely and one by ione started seing the object. But then something more strange happened we saw one appear alomost alkl of a sudden they looked like they were close to each other aligned but then one would go ahead of the other, it was creepy and scary cause we started thinking that maybe more would appear and would see us. The object seemed silvernad round or oval shaped i couldn't figure it out cause ti was so high up in the air. Now one thing is for sure this were not an aircraft because aircraft or airplanes cannot go back and forth or make a turn in mid air, a ballon would leave out of sight, and another thing that day wasnt so windy at all, it was mostly clear. All i can say is i cant explain what i saw and i am always going to keep that question in my mind till i fnd answers.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,34.059722826086954,-117.757725

At first I thought it was just an early bright star, kind of like when you see the moon early in the afternoon. The sky was very clear. I figured it might be a ""star"" because the sun was now in the west, behind me.  It was very high in the sky. It had height similar to a star or even a satellite moving in low orbit, but was stationary. We live in an area that does not have high light pollution, so at night (especially in the summers) we are able to see satellites at night when they fly over. Our views are so good that one evening last year we were able to see a NOSS satellite group fly over.  I was able to gauge the height when an aircraft was flying at what appeared to be it's maximum altitude to the left of the ""star"" and the ""star"" was much higher than the aircraft. I knew the aircraft was high due to its jet stream. There were also two birds flying at a height that dismissed the chance of the ""star"" being a balloon.  Suddenly a second light appeared and was aligned in a way similar to Orion's belt.  The second ""star"" seemed to have started to move slowly below the first ""star"". In order to make sure the second ""star"" was moving I closed one eye and used my finger as marker and sure enough the lower ""star"" was moving in a southern direction.  Literally, in a blink of an eye the moving star was gone. It just disappeared. No flash or high acceleration, just gone.  I was looking back to the first star when it too disappeared.  I waited for a few more minutes for the ""stars"" to reappear but they did not.  This has been bothering me all day so I decided to post it here to see if anyone else has seen it.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,40.2944,-73.9932

He told me to pick him up at 11:00PM but didn't get off until close to 12:00AM. I was stuck waiting outside for him for over a hour. It was pretty humid so I didn't want to wait inside the car so I got out and waited. The parking lot was almost all empty except the cars of the people that were cleaning up the store. At about 11:45PM I laid out on the roof of my car and looked up at the night sky. I looked at a couple of planes passing by and then something caught my attention. There was this object moving really slow directly above me. I'm a skeptic so I tell myself it's probably some balloons, until the object stopped moving. Then I got a really good look at it. Here is what I can describe as only a black Triangle and it was pointing north, and where the angles were, there where white dots in their place. The object was almost directly over me. I got a good look at it but because of the lights in the parking lot I had to cover up the light coming off the street lights so the glare wouldn't get to my eyes. So I just stared at it for about a minute, then it started to move north very slowly. Nobody was around so I could show them so I didn't bother taking my eyes off of it. It continued north until I couldn't see it anymore. I googled ""Black triangle with white dots in the sky"" and this website came up, and I saw that there was a string of sightings of the same thing in February of 2007 that described the exact same thing.

We watched it for 5 or 6 minutes to see if it was making the path to the airport east of here. We were unnerved to see that it was tilting back and forth, in a seesaw sort of motion across the sky. The colors would slowly shift, some colors hard to see, but some colors were white and yellow. When it had no lights on, the body indicated a very soft-edged cone shape with irrationally placed red lights. Its path circled in a diameter around the general downtown area. It was disturbing because it looked so defiantly different than the typical police helicopters, care flights, and airplanes. That had a lot to do with its non-linear path, and slow, but very graceful speed. I've never seen something like this before and wanted some insight on similar sightings, I didn't know if maybe extremely distant helicopters can give this impression, but then I doubt that. I doubt it because the light was very profile, it never moved in a three dimensional fashion, just sort of gave the illusion of moving two dimensionally. The irrational red and white blinking lights moved about this dark cone like object irrationally. It's also important to note that it was very large and resembled a huge shining star. One more thing to note is that you could not hear it like an airplane or helicopter. Two witnesses: Male",2008-06-12T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

The object disappeared in the view of my mirrors and I returned home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

So fast that neither one of us said a thing, it had to be an illusion.  I fly airplanes and this was no airplane. It was flying at an altitude of about 300 feet, and appeared at least twice as big as a 747. The disturbing and creepy thing was that it was completely silent and traveled from horizon to horizon in about 3 seconds. The light turned green and we just sat there dumbfounded.  After a minute of silence, my wife said ""honey.....did you see what I just saw?""   We went home and decided to each draw our version of what we saw without discussing it.  Of course our drawings were virtually the same: a large, V shaped craft, with 2 or 3 lights running down each vane of the ""V"" and a light at the apex or nose of the ""V.""   It was black in color and the lights were a dull yellow or white.  Very freaky, almost disturbing to see something that big, so low, so fast.  The fact that is was so low (let alone silent) tells me that this was no black ops or Skunkworks test-bed. No military plane would ever fly this low over a very heavily populated area!  At any rate, we never reported it, as we figured no one would ever believe us.  Now, years later, I found a video on YouTube that got my interest going again, and I found this website.  Finally, we at least can document the evidence that filled our windshield on that day in 1996. FYI, the weather was completely clear.

As I observed what I thought was an airliner of a type that doesn't have a broad wing that is sometimes not visually prominent from that altitude, I became aware that its speed did not seem consistent with an airliner as it eventually slowed, ceased forward motion, an maneuvered to 90 degrees from its original flight path, and became stationary directly above the mountain peak at the base of which is the German town of Mittenwald, in the Bavarian Alps close to Italy, Austria, and Switzerland.  Soon I noticed another identical craft approach the first from the original course of the first, coming to a stop parallel to the first, and remaining so for the time I was observing from the window of the train as I was awaiting it to begin the trip back to Munich. My brother and his wife were with me, although only my brother confirmed the phenomenon as he only had a window seat opposite from me.  This is  a very busy tourist destination, and the mountain over which the craft hovered has a cable tram to the top (8,000'-10,000'), where there is an observatory, and ski runs, so there had to be many other witnesses.

A friend of my father is owner of a big, big farm far of the city, placed in a region called ""vergel de la sierra"", this farm still virgin, only a little house in the middle. This house used to be keeped by an old guy called ((name deleted)) he was very humble. The curious thing its that since my father was a child he used to go there with ""Tito"" the actual owner of the farm. Several sightings of strange things have happened in the farm.  When my father was a child, in the middlenight, a big ""cigarrete"" shape flying ship, with a powerful light stayed for at least 5 minutes over the little house. Tito and he where very scared, since my father was turning on the water boiler outside of the little house. It appeared from nothing and maked a big continuous noise. ""I maked a big jump to the closer window"" tells my father.   Another sighting aprox in 1995 was made by Chon (Chon already died, his son seen it and lives, he told us this was one of several other same sightings). Since we saw Chon, with half of body burned, when we were camping in farm, we asked wath happened. Chon said us it was common to see this ""bright light"" over a little lagoon but because of fear, he never get closer to it. But, one day he got closer by curiosity and the thing emitted a big flash of heat and light and went off. ""This thing came to steal water"" he said. I believed Chon, since he was a person who even dont know how to write or read, far of comunication and contaminating ideas.  I was esceptic to see weird things, until 1998 when my father, a cousin, a friend and me, where on camping on the farm. We where sitting over a very hig cliff, watching the eagles flying over us. We where keeping a camera with us, waiting for an eagle to get closer. Suddenly a black object apperaed with the eagles and in half a second descended tremendously fast ""vertically"" at our left (i remember it was like 30 meters far of us), its size was like four cars. Nor a small noise was made by the ship. It flyed very close to us, and passed from left to right like for about 6 seconds, until it was lost of sight because some threes. We tryed to follow it, but the fear was too big, so we decide to go as fast as we could to the camping and jeep. We couldnt photo the thing, but 4 people watched it. I remember it clearly, (at the bottom i guess) black triangle, flat, with some texture like lines. Four fire or light hemispheres attached to every end and one at the center.Ive sended a raw image in other mail.  Two cousins where chased at night in ""Vergel de la Sierra"" by a lightened flying ""hamburger"", on a night scout patrol, if you want more details they could mail you. Actually they dont like to talk about that, they still have a bad remember. They left even the tents and things there, they dont get back there anymore.  There are many things ive seen and read that tell me there is some real thing concerning to people, investors, government and many others. I hope my testimony to arrive to the correct hands, someone who is really interested in my sightings. Here in vergel strange things are happening.

We slept in a long dormitory which had 4 rows of cubicles, my cubicle faced a window which faced due South, more or less.  For a period of about a month in 1967, (possibly April/May) every night after “Lights Out” (22:00) I witnessed an unusual phenomenon in the night sky through the window.  An object, a point of light like a satellite was moving steadily through the stars, but not in a straight line as a normal orbiting satellite would describe.  The diagram below <e-mailed separately> describes the path of the object, which it repeated every night for the duration of the time I saw it.  The time it took to traverse my limited field of vision was mo more than 30 seconds so it struck me that the object would have been moving at great velocity but it came to a dead stop, just for a moment, each time before changing direction.  I now live in South Africa, I have seen many satellites in the night skies since 1967 but never have I seen one that behaved in this manner.  There may be a completely rational explanation, but I do not believe that the technology existed on earth to perform these types of manoeuvres at the time.  Certainly, the forces required to stop and change direction like that would not be tolerable for a human being.  I have often wondered what it was that I saw.  Perhaps someone else has seen something similar or knows what it was? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,,

I lived in a rural area, on a farm.  On a Saturday morning I left my house to do some chores.  Across the road and approximately 100 yards from me, I immediately saw a large ""sphere"" shaped object about 50 feet in diamater, smooth and dark gray in color.  It hovered about 4' to 6' above the ground and moved in a slight up and down movement but made no sound.  Being frightened by this unexpected sight, I quickly went back into my house.  After some time, I ventured back outside to see if the sphere was gone.  After looking around I saw that it had traveled across the road, and over our large farm pond and was now down behind a row of trees on the other side.  It's up and down movement seemed to be more pronounced but otherwise remained stable.  I once again retreated back into my house.  Not untill that evening did I venture back out to find that the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date in March 1962.

I was 14 or 15 years old at the time and I was with two high school classmates. We were sitting on a park bench in the Sawyer elementary school playground. This is on the south side near 51st and Kedzie.  It was summer vacation and we were out late (about 10 PM). It was already dark but as anyone who knows the city will tell you, the lights from the city will illuminate anything in the air. We noticed this object (which looked like a disk from our angle) move from our right to our left (this equates to south to north). It was fairly large and fairly close. I was about the size of a 474 jumbo jet and it was close enough to look like an airplane making a landing at nearby Midway Airport.  It moved very slowly and there was no sound at all. As I said it looked like a disk from the angle we were viewing it at and it did not have sharp edges – they were more rounded. The edges had what looked like portholes (round windows) around the periphery of the object. The inside of the object was very brightly lit and it looked like people moving around behind those portholes! I remember seeing at least one “person” who appeared to be looking at the bird’s eye view of the city! I think the object was rotating but very slowly. Other than the light from the windows there were no other lights.  We watched it slowly make its way very far north and we were able to follow its path until it just appeared as a spec of light which then moved east and disappeared. We were all very exited about this sighting and we decided to call the police to report it. It turned out that many, many people had called about this and the official police explanation was that it was an airplane towing an illuminated sign. I never believed that explanation because I know what I saw and it was NOT an airplane towing a sign.  If anyone else saw this on that night in Chicago please tell what you saw. I would appreciate hearing that someone else was witness to this strange object (notice I did NOT call it a craft although I believe that is what it was). There is one person here who describes the same thing but with square windows and he says it was in September 1964. I am fairly certain that my date is correct – summer of 1962.

I recall my husband and I were returning home from seeing the movie ""Rosemary's Baby"" with Mia Farrow. My husband (soon to be ex, at the time) was a navy pilot who after 6+ (?) years active duty, was still very active on weekends logging as many flight hours as he could manage (helicopters).  Our house was in an older, established very residential area and our street was a rather steep hill from top to bottom. We lived about halfway up.  My husband noticed something around the time we neared our house, that was in the sky seemingly at the top of the hill. Where our street ended, another street intersected where if you turned left, you continued on up the hill for some ways and very shortly you were in a quite rural area with farms, fields, etc. So he slowly proceeded past our house on up the hill out of curiosity, not really saying much. The object was huge and hanging apparently close to ground, not moving. Not making any sound. I was a little excited, my heart was speeding up, but I said nothing. I was young and trusted my husband in most matters, where if there were cause for alarm, he would not approach this thing and furthermore, as a pilot and a military officer, I figured he probably would be able to figure out what it was, etc. So I hung in there. We got to a sort of level part of the road, about a half a block long, and it seemed we were really close to the object by then and had a pretty clear view of it, and since it was not moving, we pulled over beside the road and either stopped or idled the car and just sat there and stared at it. There was a thickly wooded area across the intersecting street which we could see well from where we were. But I couldn't figure out exactly how close the thing was to us or to the trees. The wooded area was a small zoo actually; it did not seem that the object would have much opportunity to hover or land within the zoo area because it was rough terrain on foot, hilly and bumpy, etc. and the whole zoo area itself was small. The craft must have been just above the height of the trees, because the treetops did not obstruct any part of my view of it.  At any rate, probably if I were someone more mature than I was at the time, I could have estimated how far away it was, etc.  All I can say is that from where I viewed it, which was actually too close for my comfort, it was at least the size of 5-6+ school buses. It was a definite saucer shape and the overall color was a dull, non reflecting finish, maybe dull dark gray.  But there were lovely bright orange round lights spaced around the rim of the saucer. They were not the type of lights that were giving off light, or beams, they were just sort of lit from within.   And, on the dome part of the saucer, that is the hump part that sat on top of the saucer, there were seemingly windows spaced all the way around (I assumed, couldn't see anything but the side I was facing). They were rather small, rectangular shaped windows that were white, that is they emanated a white glow from within, not as bright lights but same as the orange lights in being lit from within.  I was extremely curious at this point, wishing I could get a glimpse of something inside, but these ""windows"" did not seem to be like regular windows on a house, that is, for the purpose of seeing in and out of. They could have been just white lights or some other part of the craft that looked like windows to me.  Because the white of the rectangles seemed more of a solid white, you could not see through it. At any rate, I do not recall any of the lights blinking, although it is possible that the orange lights could have been. I don't think so, though.  My husband and I just sat there looking at it for maybe 15 minutes, maybe more, sort of waiting for it to do something, but it did not do anything at all.  It just hung there silently.  It was a very clear night. I can remember how clearly I could see the thing. The outline of the dark parts of it were clearly visible because of the many street lights in the area.  I could not see the underside of the craft, though.  After awhile, my husband decided it was not going to do anything and so we drove home. I do not recall us ever talking about it and I forgot about it mostly, although I would recall it any time the expression UFO came up. I guess I just subconsciously decided that my husband probably had a good idea what it was, etc, but I had known him to be involved with military missions that were very secret and he could never discuss any part of them with me and of course I never pressed him on those matters.  If I was wrong (and looking back I think I probably was), and he really had no idea what it was and was maybe even frightened by it, he would not have let me know that either, for not wanting to scare me.  At that time he was away a lot (50% of the time or more) and we had 2 toddlers, and I am sure he would not want me getting all hysterical over this idea, especially since he no doubt saw no threat. I was not a news person at that time, did not read newspapers etc.  But my husband did, and I am pretty sure he would have mentioned it if he had seen any articles about it.  He would have looked for them.   And in spite of where the craft was, in the midst of such a residential area, it was an extremely quiet neighborhood, and it's very unlikely anyone who lived there but us, saw the thing.  It does seem likely, though, that people driving by might well have seen it, as we did. The road that ran alongside the zoo was a somewhat busy street, that is, at least busier than the street our house was on. I suppose you would not really call it busy, though.  People were almost never outside or even awake (with inside house lights on) past 10:30 pm or so, on our street and nearby streets. The majority of residents were older, many retired folks. This was probably around midnight, give or take. I did not see any signs that any of the people were up and about as we drove up the hill, nor would I have expected to at that hour.  At that time, we had not lived there very long, a year or so, and I was not very friendly with my neighbors yet, and I never discussed this with any of them or asked around to see if anyone had seen anything.  At that point in time, probably those particular folks would have gotten a bad opinion of me if I had!   In reading through the NUFORC website, I noted many older reports such as this, and so I decided it must still be relevant after all these years, so here it is.  At least it feels somewhat relieving to tell it to someone.  I will attempt a rough drawing of the craft and enclose a Binghamton area map marked with the location, to be sent via snail mail.  This will take a little time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,42.14263184079602,-75.90816368159204

I am writing of this encounter just to document it. I cant give exact dates or even the year as a fact. I do recall the event very clearly, but it is something that my family and I have never spoken of.  Well, a couple of years ago I did ask my mother some things about that night, but she has no memory of it. There is really not a lot to tell about the actual sighting but I will do my best to explain my encounter. I will also mention facts I do remember to help substantiate my gaps in memory. It was about 6:30 pm when my family and I were going into Quincy,Il. We were coming from Fowler, N.E. of Quincy. We drove west down U.S. 24 to Neikamps corner where we turned South. We traveled south to Ellington Road where we turned and headed west again. We traveled about 200 feet west when the encounter began. We were going into Quincy to go to church, we were going to a revival meeting. This being said, helps me to establish the time and approximate date.  The revival meetings  started at 7:00pm and the location of the encounter is about a 15 minute drive to the church. We were always early to the meetings as my dad was an usher and had duties before services would begin. This also helps me get a rough idea  of the year. I actively attended church with my family from about 1968 to 1972. I want to say the encounter was in 1970 but I can't jog my memory enough to state that as a fact.I do know we were riding in a  white 1964 Chevy station wagon. Since my father has died no one remembers when we owned that car. We were heading west, just in front of the WGEM radio towers.  I was setting behind the driver looking south out the window.  The sky began to become very bright.  It was very dark out at 6:30 in the evening so it must have been late fall.   As the sky brightened I became very afraid, I thought it was the end of the world.  I remember looking to the sky to see something but there was nothing to see.  I then turned and looked north towards the radio tower and saw the brightest blue white light I have ever seen in my life. The next thing I can remember we were headed south on Columbus road, just coming up to the KHQA radio tower. No one said a word about anything, we just kept going towards Quincy.  We arrived at 16th and Locust in Quincy, without ever talking about the light.  Everything looked normal at church when we arrived.  I could see the people shaking hands and greeting each other as they always do.  We got out of the car and went in and began to socialise as usual when we found out we were late. The services were over and everyone was going home. This would make the time be around 9:30 or 10:00, services always lasted that long, or even later. We talked for a bit and then returned home. We missed the whole church service, went back home and never said one word to one another about it. I have often wondered over the past 38 years or so what happened. Roughly 3 hours of time are gone and not one of us has said anything about it.  I have mentioned it to friends and family a few times, but I have never offered an explanation. I have no idea what happened in the 3 hours but I do know I takes less than 5 minutes to drive from the WGEM towers to the KHQA tower. These towers may be gone now I haven't lived in Illinois for about 20 years now.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,39.929225,-91.35987777777778

I started hearing a humming noise didn't know at first where it was coming from so I lowered the volume thinking maybe something's wrong with the T.V. The odd noise was still there. After about 5 mins the inside of my home started shaking, vibrating kinda like a small earthquake. I walked to our room where my wife was folding clothes and asked her if she hears anything strange, She told me she was fixing to come ask me the same question. That's when I asked her if she wanted to come with me outside. When we opened the back door to the north we looked up and saw a triangler shaped object. If I had to guess it was moving about 3 miles per hour from an east to west direction. The object was only about as high as the trees on the property. The size from tip to the two rear ends covered a good acre and maybe more. We could not begin to explain let alone compare it to any man made plane, craft, ect. It had four lights one in the very front, one in the middle, and two at each corner at the rear. It was so low we tried to see if maybe there might have been some kind of markings that would explain what the hell we were looking at. Maybe something from nearby Andrews air force base or something we could maybe make sense out of. No such luck. My wife ran over to my moms house and sisters house woke them up to tell them what was going on. My mom, sister, Brother in law, their two kids, My self and my wife witnessed this. It was so strange my sisters two kids were crying it scared them so much. Not to say the rest of us were not affected.

The area is the Gila Bend Reservation and there is not a lot of development - no lights.  It was a very clear night as was usual in Arizona.  As I was traveling south, I notice ahead that several cars on the interstate appeared to be putting their brake lights on, slowing and it also seemed that several had stopped completely.  I assumed I was approaching a wreck. As I got closer to an overpass, I saw that cars were also pulled off the road and at least one man was out of the car looking up.  Suddenly on the right side of the car, an object raced by me (at or near car level).  It was like a bright flash that ""zoomed"" past me like I was sitting still. The hair stood up on my arms and I realized that this was something out of the ordinary. At that point I told my son, who was asleep in the back seat to wake up.  The object had the brightest lights I had ever seen and at that time I couldn't tell anything about the shape.  Once I got on the other side of the overpass, the object was overhead.  It was triangle shaped with three super bright white lights on the three corners. At this point, I could see the object race back and forth overhead crossing the interstate from right to left and back. sort of in a ""swooping"" flight path.  At the same time, it was turning and rotating and the lights were shining down on the road, in the air, and all over.  (The motion would be as if you were holding an object in your hand and turning your hand round and round.)  There was absolutely no sound.  This whole incident took 5 minutes.  I didn't actually stop the car but continued driving at a very slow pace.  I know that others were pulled off and looking as I drove away.  Being alone with my son, I was worried stopping. I have seen a few ""odd"" things from time to time looking out at the sky.  However this incident was beyond that.  It was close and it was real.

I witnessed unexplained aerial activity in England around September 1998.  I was driving down to Maidstone in Kent (in the evening around 7.30 pm approximately) and somewhere on the road after the Dartford tunnel I noticed a bright light like a star in the sky. The reason I especially noticed it was that it did not stay far away as a star would. It seemed to be staying in the same place all the time, so as I drove down the motorway and approached it I literally drove underneath whatever it was.  This places the U.F.O.s to the west of the county and within just a few miles of the outskirts of London.  As I looked up through the car windscreen I saw that the craft was very dark grey/black, triangular shaped, with lights at each corner. I could see that the underside of the object was divided into sections. I wondered if it could have been a Harrier or the ""invisible"" Stealth bomber or something but I didn't see any wheels hanging down, just the white lights at each corner of the triangle. When I have mentioned this to other people over the years they always ask if there were other vehicles on the motorway but I just cannot remember now - I was far more interested in what was directly above me!  It seemed to be hovering and there was absolutely no noise whatsoever. When I told my husband later about this he asked about the noise level. Ovbviously a normal aircraft would have been extremely noisy, especially as it seemed so close to the ground to me, but I definitely did not hear anything.  I got the impression that it was hovering.  I see from your reports that other people have seen similar things far more recently which is why I decided to report my own sighting.

It was like nothing we've ever seen before.   I watched the object for several minutes before I saw it move very abruptly and FAST across the sky.

The object was very high in the sky so it's very hard to approximate the size.

The object seemed to be round although all that was visible were the numerous lights. I looked to see if the lights could be coming from anywhere land based but this was not possible. This is a small city and not the type of city to have light shows. Also the main residential areas are a long way from the airport. It could not have been a plane or helicopter because there was no sound. I was pretty frightened and rushed back inside with pets, I said to my partner : ""what was that?"" I do not remember his answer and he never mentions it which I find very annoying. I felt shock at the time and did not consider going out again with a camera or video.

Years ago, around July 20, 2001 I stepped outside, along with a family member, at about 22:00 to let our dog go to the bathroom.  It was not long before we heard a humming sound in the distance.  My family member and I simply ignored it and continued to wait for the dog to go to the bathroom.  Mysteriously, the dog began to bark at something behind us. 	The two of us turned to see the most unbelievable thing we ever set eyes upon coming towards us, over the tree tops.  It was a black, teardrop, shaped craft, about the size of house.  After a few moments the craft, still humming, was hovering above our heads. To our shock, it froze there and then lowered until it was only about twenty feet above our heads! It was then that we were able to see it quit clearly.  We observed several lights on the belly of the craft, one of them glowing mysteriously in the center. 	To our surprise, from this strange glowing light, a long, pointed needle, with a wire wrapping around it and meeting at the point, ejected.  This needle then sent down a focused beam of light, which suddenly expanded, then the light was gone and the needle was drawn back up into the light. 	The teardrop shaped craft slowly began to move forward again.  I, being curious, chased it, not wanting to allow it to escape.  The faster I ran, the faster it moved.  Suddenly, it sped forward in the direction the trees.  I thought for sure it would crash into them, but the moment that impact would have occurred, there was a dazzling flash of light and the craft vanished altogether, leaving behind only one trace: a patch of dead grass where the original beam of light had projected. 	Unsure off what had just happened we rushed back into the house, where another family member had watched the craft appear behind us from the window.  We assumed that this whole event had taken about two or three minutes, five at the most to occur, however she, and the clocks in the house, told another story: that we had been out for about a half-hour! She also said that the television signal was lost during this event. This mysterious occurrence puzzles us all to this day.

The truth behind the Grays  ((NUFORC Note:  Report of abductions is unconfirmed.

Nobody knows about it, or the other countless abductions I've had for as long back as I remember.  The first time I remember there being quiet bright lights in the sky above the back yard.  I felt this strong urge to go outside and check it out. and when I did, they took me.  And they've been taking me ever since.  Sometimes they'd come for me, other times they called me and I would have no choice but to them.  I did tell my parents about it once, as a little kid, around 6 years old, when the Greys left me in my living room insted of dropping me back in my bedroom.  They blamed it on sci-fi movies and videogames and I got yelled at for making up stories.  That was the only time I tried to tell anyone.  When I moved from home into my appartment, I slept with a 9mm. under my pillow for months, but I was always paralised when they would come for me, so that idea was a bust.  Setting up video cameras in my bedroom proved ineffective as well.  In the morning, the tapes would be blank, like I never set them to record at all.  And after a while, the fear dissapeared from the abductions and I started to accept that getting pulled out of my room on random nights was just something I'd have to deal with. One night in July of 2001, I was abducted.  It seemed business as usual.  I was called to the room of my apartment and then the flash filled my eyes, and when it cleared, I was laying on the table again.  The grays usually planted dozens of accupuncture type needles in my chest, stomach, neck.  Rarely they would insert a tube into my ear or throat which was quite painful.  This time was the tube in my throat.  As the machine was being prepared, several of the grays seemed to rushin from another room.  They spoke to the ones about to experiment on me, and they all ran from the room.  I felt a rumble in the table I was laying on and heard a loud explosion, followed by what seemed to be weapons fire.  Several minuets passed and then a tall, armored figure wearing a blank faced mask entered the room, carrying a type of weapon, resembeling an assault rifle.  The figure removed the mask to reveal a very canine like face, with bright orange eyes, covered by short, blue fur.  The usual abduction experience was frightening, but seeing this new creature made me feel like my heart would beat out of my chest.  The being leaned over the instrument table the grays kept their tools on and began touching the objects there.  Suddenly I could move again. The creature came over to me and gently helped me into a sitting position on the table. Then, in plane English, asked if I was alright.  I told her(I say 'her' because the voice of the being sounded most definitely female to me) yes and asked what was happening. I rose from the table, and she led me from the exam room.  Outside the room, in the large halls of the ship, there were dead bodies of grays around every corner.  Creatures like her, and several other new strange creatures were at control panles and moving about the ship.  The creature introduced herself at this point as Boudica(boo-dee-ca) and told me that this ship was going to be destroyed.  I asked her why and what was going on.  She then exlained to me something I never thought of in all the time I was being abducted:  The grays, in reality were a cybernetic lifeform created by Boudica's race and more than 3 dozen other races in contact with each other on the other side of the Milky Way.  Centuries ago, they formed a union with each other to establish trade, travel and the discovery of new lifeforms across the universe. However, space travle was a long, difficult affair.  So these large, strong alien races created the small, weak looning grays as sort of advanced scouts, used to seek out, examine and greet new intelegent lifeforms as they found it. They gray body design was chosen because the alien union thought that body shape the least threatening. They in general being tall and muscular, they couldn't see the gray body type being a threat to anyone. As I proceded through the ship, I noticed gray bodis being carried through the hall, some in peices.  And sure enough, in the open wounds of the grays there were servos, wires and components I could not identify in my limited experience.  Boudica took me to a room filled with several other large aliens.  One alien, an 8 foot tall being who appeared to have a reptilian face with a feathery red crest around its head, asked how long they grays had been taking me.  I told him(?) the last 15 years and he apoligised to me for all the pain and trouble I've been through. Then he promised me I'd never have to go through any of that again. Boudica told me I'd have to be put to sleep to be transported back to my appartment, because they didn't fully understand the methods the grays used to teleport people from place to place.  She took a long rod like instrument from the control panle and waved it once in front of my face.  That is the last I remembered from the gray ship. It has been more than 6 years since I've been abducted. I've tried to make sense of the events on the gray's ship tha night. As far as I can figure, they grays were supposed to be a scouting party to survey newly discovered intelegent races in secret. For whatever reason, they failed their mission, and would not stop abducting people and experimenting on them. So, the ALien union who created them is now in the process of finding and destroying them. It is my beliefe that whe the Ailen union finally destroys the threat to Earth posed by the grays, then they might finally make their existence known to humanity and induct us into their collection of races across the universe.

Next it headed laterally in the opposite direction for less distance than the first viewing, stopped again floated side to side downward then proceeded laterally back in the original direction. It exhibited this type of movement three or four times then appeared to move upwards growing fainter as it went, I do not know if was a elevation increase or a distance increase until it was so faint as it was difficult to tell from the background stars, so I want back to my un-packing.

Here is one more for you.  I think my sighting was somewhat unusual, because I saw the craft flying southward above Interstate 17 about 60 miles north of Phoenix.  I've heard reports from the Prescott area, and of course in Phoenix, but not many from in between.  Please refer to the following map:  http://maps.google.com/?ll=34.174885,-112.136593&spn=0.099698,0.100079  This shows I-17 north of Phoenix.  The map is centered on the Sunset Point rest area, which is about 1/2 mile up the road (north) after my sighting ended. I was driving home from Phoenix, and the time was approximately 8:15 pm. Don't take that time too seriously -- I didn't check the time while watching the UFO, and came up with an approximation later based on the time I got home. (I was used to making the trip and new how long it took to drive between Phoenix to the Sunset Point halfway point, and then home in Sedona.)  See where I-17 is split lower in the map area?  That is the stretch of the interstate that connects the Sonoran Desert with a mesa area at higher altitude. The road there is curvy and is on about a 7% grade, with little or no shoulder. It was getting dark, and while driving about halfway up that part of the road, I noticed an inverted V of bright lights far off in the distance.  They seemed low near the horizon, and at first I thought they were lights on a distant mountain. But that didn't make sense, because the mountain is off to the left (west), and the lights were just about 5 degrees left of straight ahead.  Also, they were white color and steady, not flashing red as with a radio tower or something like that.  While I was thinking those thoughts, I realized there was no way the lights were on the ground, since they were getting higher in the sky and nearer (bigger)!  Obviously, it was something or some things flying through the air. It was getting difficult to watch the lights, because I was in traffic, navigating curves uphill on a road with almost no shoulder and a cliff to my left in case I messed up!  (BTW, I was in the left lane of traffic.) As the lights got nearer, I had to push my head forward toward the windshield and look upwards.  It was a little tricky...  The lights stayed on the left of my car, apparently flying over the southbound part of the interstate.  I could clearly see there were five lights, one at the tip and two each on either side, in the V shape.  The lights were white, but not pure -- slightly yellowish, like an incandescent light bulb.  As the lights were just a short distance away, I thought, ""That is either 5 military jets flying in formation, or a UFO."" I watched to see if I could see a solid shape of a big ship, but it was too dark.  As the lights got the closest, I thought, ""That is either an alien UFO or some secret government project.""  It didn't seem to be jets in formation.  There were only the 5 whitish lights, and no green or red lights, or flashing lights of any kind. Another thing I remember thinking at the time was that I wondered how big the craft was.  If it was flying low, it might have been the size of a commercial airliner, but if it was higher up (tens of thousands of feet), it would have been huge and moving very fast.  When I first spotted the lights off in the distance, they were about the apparent size of my thumb held at arm's length.  When the lights flew by, they were about the size of my fist at arm's length.  By the time the lights had passed by my car, I had driven all the way up the hill to the mesa where the Sunset Point rest stop is located.  I thought of pulling over since there was some shoulder there, but realized that by the time I got out of the car, the lights would already have flown far away, and I wouldn't see much. So I didn't stop.  Two days later (Saturday) I was out socializing around town, and mentioned to some friends that I'd seen something while driving home from Phoenix.  One guy looked at me and said something like, ""Oh, you saw it!  You saw the UFO that was reported on the Phoenix TV news!""  If it weren't for that, I probably would have never connected my experience with the big UFO sighting, which I otherwise would have heard about months or years later, after I'd forgotten what day it was I saw them. I don't watch TV or read newspapers, and if other witnesses are anything like me, that would explain why you don't get many more reports.  It wasn't until months later I decided to do a search on the Internet and learned that people were calling the UFO the ""Phoenix Lights"". When I learned that the UFO was a mile wide, I realized that when I saw it, it must have been at a high altitude and really moving! I haven't tried to do any of the math -- the calculation would be rough at best -- but I guess it must have been going about 2000 miles per hour. (?)  If I can figure out how many apparent angular degrees my thumb is, and use a stopwatch the next time I drive home from Phoenix, maybe I can come up with a better number.  I'll be happy to do my best to answer any questions you have regarding my sighting.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,34.1371,-112.1336

I was in the country area just about 50 miles NW of Ft. Wayne and I happened to look up at the cresent moon which was to the left of my drivers window.  What caught my eye was that just off the tip of the cresent moon, there was an object which reminded me of a drop of water haning off the tip of the moon.  I starred for a while and determined that it was definitely not a star.  I could see that it had a circular shape and reflected the sun light as did the moon. I continued to see the object (which never moved from its ""hanging off the tip of the moon position"".  And eventually the road turned and I stopped paying attention.   But when I got home, I was so baffled by what I had seen, that I called the local weather station and asked about possible satelites in the area, but was told there werent any that i could see or anything that would be there like I described.  I have recently seen videos and pictures of what I can now saw if very much like what I thought i saw that night.  And due to the fact that these spheres have been documented as moving and being still, i do believe that is what i saw that night.   All I know for sure is that it was NOT A STAR!

If the red light was a square, the four white lights would be at the corners, one light at each corner. They were high enough that I could not tell whether they were physically touching or simply in close proximity.  The five lights hovered for about thirty seconds. Then, simultaneously, the four white lights shot off in separate directions, each one traveling toward one of the four cardinal compass points. They moved fast enough that after only a second I could no longer see them, but slow enough that I could track their progress until my view of them was blocked by surrounding trees and houses.  The red light remained stationary for another thirty seconds to a minute, and then vanished. When I say ""vanished,"" I don’t mean that it moved off, or that it faded away.

This was the second sighting of a similar craft from three days earlier.  I had just bought a new telescope on the 14th and was star gazing at about 10 pm.  There were two passerby's at about 10:20 who saw the high altitude craft.  I was outside setting up my new telescope since it was a very clear night and my new telescope's laser sight was sighted in and ready for use. I first sat down for a smoke then I saw the ufo. It appears to be similar to the last high altitude one I saw and it was the same approximate time, except that this one circled counterclockwise at least three times over the course of the viewing. The circlular flight path was probably at least 5 - 10 miles round, probably more like 20-30 miles. I saw the object when it was at the high altitude to the east through a telescope for a second, the shape looked almost like two D's piggybacking and was slight bit greenish tint to the light. I saw stars go by right next to the light on all sides so the craft appeared to be only as big as the light. I was surprised to see it appeared as though there were no other dimension to the craft other than the light itself.  When I view planes with a telescope or binoculars at night, they have a gray area where the lights arent and you can see stars get blocked by other parts of the craft not lit. This was not that way at all. Airplane lights also light up part of the fuselage which was not evident on this craft.  I heard nothing in the way of aircraft noises, no jet engines, propeller noises or helicopter noises.  F-16's from Selfridge always make a roar when flying around. Two people came walking by, a man and a woman, and they were pointing at what I was looking at. We met up in my side yard and watched together for a couple of minutes. It was dim then got kind of bright white, then dimmed when I turned my back to get my telescope (wanted to see it again while it was brighter) then the passerbys said that the object dimmed to red and then to off and disappeared to the East over Saint Clair Shores. The walkers both said there was no way that was a plane. The male walker said that he thought the craft looked to be almost in orbit, or much higher than commercial craft. The female walker was telling me that she saw the same kind of light show from craft recently and slugged her companion in the shoulder for telling her that her sighting, which he did not see, was a sattelite.  On this night, the man admitted that this couldnt be a sattelite or an aircraft. All three of us were mildly excited about the UFO, and the couple walked on after about 20 seconds of the craft not being visible.  As the walkers left a couple of minutes later I saw the craft come back again from the north heading southbound then turned to the east then north again, this circlular flight path was the smallest of the night and the craft was the lowest it had been to this point. When it got to direct north of my position it disappeared behind trees.  Then about 20 seconds after that I saw a white shape, very dimly lit that looked saucer shaped and it looked about the size of a private jet, maybe a little bigger. This was to the Northwest which I had not seen anything in this area before. This time it was much closer but much dimmer and the craft's surface was all the same dim lit greenish but mostly white color. The object was at only a few thousand feet altitude, looked kind of like the letter D resting on its back and it shot east at incredible speed with non-linear accelleration. The acceleration kind of bounced (hard to describe) then disappeared behind some trees.  The wind was from the West at gusts to 20mph, but this object went fast against the wind and the movement looked unreal. At very first glance it appeared almost to be a white balloon in the dark, but the movement was so unorthodox and against the wind and the speed at the end of the acceleration was too high for anything manmade I am aware of. I am guessing that the craft was the same craft in both instances, one higher than the other, but I do not know for sure. For one thing it appeared to go from a double D to a single D (no pun intended)shape, but in the last closest sighting, the color was similar, just far less intense. This portion of the sighting was quite wierd and so beyond my experience that I still have a hard time admitting what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

We were looking up at the stars as it was a clear and beautiful night. We were sitting in cloth camp foldout chairs and were both sipping Southern Comfort whiskey (I know, here come the laughs and jeers!) and reminiscing old hunting adventures we had shared. We were by no means intoxicated at this point, but I thought it best to include this detail, even if it seems damaging to the credibility of this sighting. 	Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I noticed a flash of movement in the eastern sky and looked up to see four bright shapes flying from east to west at incredible speed. The four shapes were roughly triangular with the apex of each toward the direction of flight. The shapes were flying in a V-shaped formation (like migrating geese), but lacked the point of the V, being only four in number. The first two shapes were closer together than the back two, but each shape was in exact parallel to the shape opposite it. A cold bluish-white light radiated from the four shapes and was so bright that no other details of each shape could be made out other than color and a rough outline. 	The four objects did not appear to be part of a larger group, nor did they appear to be lights or fixtures attached to a larger craft. No outline of a larger object around the periphery of the four glowing shapes was visible. In my opinion, each shape was a separate entity but flew with amazing precision and had the ability to keep exact pace and formation with its congeners.  Amazingly, no sound whatsoever was audible as the four shapes passed directly overhead at an estimated 1,000 feet above the ground. The objects were visible for roughly 2 to 3 seconds from the first sighting until they had passed out of sight. No Earth-made craft that I know of can move that fast; their speed was phenomenal. As the shapes disappeared from sight I looked to my brother-in-law and discovered that he too was standing up looking skyward. His eyes then met mine as he exclaimed,  “What the hell was that?!” I just shook my head and told him I had no idea. We stared incredulously at each other for a long moment before I had the brilliant idea to uncap the Southern Comfort, took a stout swallow, passed it to my brother-in-law, and then headed for home. 	I know for some that the mere presence of alcohol in such a story will produce doubt. For those who have had similar experiences, I think these details only add validity to my story. Doubt all you want, I know what I saw. The only problem is I have no idea what it was. My brother-in-law and I have not spoken about this since. This is the second time we have both seen “UFO’s”, if that is what you want to call them. This first sighting did not involve imbibing alcoholic beverages and occurred three years prior in a remote location while camping. If I have time I will try to enter that account as well. 	My brother-in-law has a B.A. in education and I have a B.S. and M.S. in biology. We are both solid, reliable, family men with no reason to lie about this sort of thing. I am as curious as the next person to find out just what these various aerial “things” might be. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

We thought it was some kind of tower but since we didn't remember a tower being there we got off two exits down and took HWY 31 back toward Alford Ave. The thing was gone in the 10 mins or less that it took to turn around.it was around 9:00 PM mabey a little before.

At the time of this sighting in 1993,  I held an extremely high profile job in law enforcement, and said nothing about it to anyone, however, it has stayed with me all these years.  Since it occurred on the Massachusetts Turnpike in full view of hundreds if not thousands of cars, I decided I would post it here, in case someone else might have seen more of it.  I was driving Eastbound toward New York, late in the afternoon, when I came over a hill and noticed directly in front of me, in a clear sky what seemed to be an immense and dense white cloud-like, that was perfectly formed into a rectangle reminiscent of a white piano key.  Its edges were perfectly formed and it seemed to be low in the sky and perhaps as much as a thousand feet in length. It remained perfectly motionless and radically unnatural in a cloudless, clear blue sky.  As I drove toward it in heavy traffic I debated pulling onto the shoulder of the road to take a photo.  The road dipped into a valley and the object was hidden by trees.  Determined to take a photo the moment I caught sight of it again, I raced the car forward. By the time I reached the next hilltop, the sky was perfectly clear.  I never saw it again, nor have I ever seen anything like it at any time in my life.  As I said, the memory stays with me, along with a great regret for not having stopped my car immediately and taken a photo.

The craft I witnessed was clearly visible in the glow cast by the street lights. I could make out every detail on the under body. Along with the strange size, color and placement of the lights, I could also make out what appeared to be two arched shaped tubes running along the bottom back side of the craft. In the glow of the street lights the craft looked to be of a dark non-metallic color. Its shape I would say, is not beyond the imagination of a human mind. However, this craft exhibited maneuverability characteristics far beyond that of any known current technology. The G-force's involved in the maneuver I witnessed would have been too great for a human. The craft seemed oblivious to any form of inertia. It approached at a constant rate I can only guess to be around 50 to 60 mph. It did not slow down. It simply just stopped, spun around and accelerated back to about the same speed it approached, all in an instant. It didn't even drift. There was never a sound or any sign of smoke or exhaust. Now here's the weird part. Not long after I filed my initial report, the street lights on the big bend part of the sawgrass highway (by Coral Springs) where removed!!! This I find very strange. Why would they take down the lights? Can anyone else confirm this? It may just be coincidence. I have done an incredible amount of research into the UFO phenomenon and to this day I can not find a sighting that resembles mine. I still recall that night clear as day. It will forever be burned in my mind. When a person see's something that defies all known logic, it tends to leave one feeling unsettled. I just want to know that I'm not crazy.

I notice something round and very shiny so much so that from a distance there looked like rivets (you know like in steel girders) I felt weirded out because my mind told me that wasn't possible, nothing we make is round that’s capable of flight! Also that there was a tractor supply just beyond or below what I was looking at so, I brushed it off. Then in August 2007 I was sitting with some friends (felt like kicking myself because I had no camera) there high in the sky I noticed something moving across the sky no flight trail and of the same description as before. What was really odd was imagine how much tome it takes for an Airplane to course across the sky this thing moved steadily and then disappeared behind the clouds. From ground level it appeared to be the size of a marble but when I saw the one in 1994 it was closer and seemed as big as a house.

On approximately 10/01/1994 at around 21:00 hours, myself along with 3 other people were traveling together on T Hwy in a southern direction in Benton County, Missouri approximately 8 miles north of Warsaw, Missouri.    As we topped a hill heading towards a bridge named Tebo Bridge we all witnessed  a light hovering above the water on the east side of the bridge.  One of the persons in the vehicle made the comment about what that light is.   We continued in a southern direction and came upon the bridge and stopped our vehicle.  All of us exited the vehicle and stood there and watched this light just hovering approximately 50 feet higher than the bridge and approximately 1/8 mile east of the bridge.  The best way for me to describe this light would be is that it is similar to lights you would see on an airplane but it was a constant light, not flashing or anything of the sort. This object was below the ridge line that ran in a east/northeastern direction with the water, so I am confident of the approximate distance from us to the object.  It was very dark out and very difficult to see an outline of the craft.   The weather was calm outside and the big thing we noticed was that there was complete silence.  This craft made no noise.   After watching this object for approximately 10 minutes just hovering above the water it turned and was now pointing in a north direction.  As it turned to the north we saw another light on the rear of the craft.  Being that it was so dark outside it was very difficult to get an outline of the object, but to my best guess it appeared to be an almost triangle shaped. After the craft turned, it slowly started to move in a northern direction.  As the craft moved away from us there still was no sound coming from it.  We watched this craft moving away from us at a very slow speed until it evidentially went out of sight. In 1994 I was a Police Officer and had never witnessed anything like that before or since.  Some of my fellow Officers are members of the Air Force Reserve and I described what I had saw and was told that the Air Force has nothing like what I described.  My thought was that Whiteman Air Force Base is approximately 40 miles from the area where this event took place and the direction the object took was in a somewhat direction towards Whiteman Air Force Base.

The Beam was brighter than the Lexor in Las Vegas. After driving for 45 mins  I could see that the beam was coming from the far west end of Simi, its source was a mile or two from the Regan Library. You could see the beam from 50 miles. The source was in a small valley in the hills at the end of the Wood Ranch Parkway. The beam looked like a blue white laser and shot up five miles with no flaring out or diffusion.  I drove to the nearest place I could and found several other cars driving past a guard blocking a fire road into the hills. I asked the guard what was going on, what was that light?  He said they were making a video for MTV and told me to leave.  He had no badge, no plates in the car, no logo on his jeep, he was not a cop. Three days later I walked up that fire road and found a warning sign, ""International Security Corp., AMSEC"". SEE PHOTO. AMSEC was owned by SAIC. What I found was interesting, and a large depression in the dirt, burned grass and an area 50ft x 50ft square of small quarts rocks with perfect 90 degree corners. 18 wheeler truck tire marks in the mud and small metal filings. Oh, and a security guard in a white Bronco way up on the hill watching me, and a few cows. I checked with Simi Valley city hall and there was no movie permits issued for any area at that time for any movie or video production. I want to know what this light beam was. It looked to be a 50 foot wide laser beam that went up 5 miles. This all took place 5 or 10 days after seeing a fireball fly over the valley.  Why was a spy satellite builder guarding a cow pasture?  Was this a possible UFO crash site and recovery?  Or a test of some kind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I'm an amateur astronomer, age 54...retired.  A friend and I like flying model planes. In the summer heat we typically go out late and fly until dusk. Naturally we are looking up at the sky as it darkens.  One day last week we are flying, and my friend Jim asks me ""what is that bright planet overhead."" I look up and see a ""star"" a couple fists width due west of Zenith that has to be as bright as Venus at sunset.  But, I know there is no star or planet that bright in that part of the sky.  So, I tell my friend that I have no idea; maybe an iridium satellite?  After a while, my friend says the ""satellite"" hasn't moved, and I take my eyes off my plane as long as I dare to confirm that no movement is detectable. We decide that we just don't know....maybe it is a slow moving satellite that we have no sky reference to detect motion.  As it darkens, the star/satellite disappears, and we don't say anymore about it.  On Tuesday, August 15, at 7:50pm CDT, my friend calls me on the phone and tells me ""that thing"" is back in the sky, and ""in the same place.""  I go out on the deck, and there it is again...same light, same brightness, same place...best as I can tell. I laid my back down on the house deck and aligned the object with a mark on the handrail to see if I could detect motion....I couldn't. I'm interested, so, I ran into the house to get the binoculars.  Outside with the binos 15 seconds later, I lay down on the deck to steady myself, focus, and....I can resolve a disk at 10x;...circular and bright, definitely not stellar in any case. Reminds me of Jupiter through a low power view, perhaps 50 arcseconds in diameter to show a disk at such low power.  Now I'm really interested, except that the binoculars fogged up in the humidity in just a half minute, and I can't see anymore.  So, I trot off to the shed thinking of what instrument I could grab for a quick view and mentally settle on 80mm f/5 ""shorty"" refractor that is mounted on a Bogen camera tripod and ready to snatch and view. It takes about 10 seconds to get to the shed door, and as I look up to fix the object from that location, it is completely gone.  The object dropped from what was probably about -3 to -4 visible magnitude to absoutely nothing.  Phone rings...it's my flying friend, and I know what he's going to say....he has a telescope and says that he had the object sighted in the viewfinder, but when he looked into the 40x eyepiece...it was gone.

Anyways, wether you publish this or not, I'm just gonna try and tell my story just to let the others who saw the same thing,know that what they saw was not a figment of their imagination!!! Neither was mine.  I went out of my house to fix my solar lights which I just bought from Home Depot that morning, andlike every other evening, I would glance at the stars and watch the constellation. I looked up towards the Big Dipper and I saw this huge V-shaped object, almost like a wing with black and green color. It wasnt brightly lighted but theres some glowing green light along the edge. I thought it was a glider but it was late at night and the object was so huge and was gliding so low that I can see it vividly.  I thought it was a Stealth bomber but military planes dont fly as low as 30-50 feet from the neighborhood's rooftop, it would be dangerous and illegal. The lowest Stealth bomber I saw was in Pasadena during the Rose Parade, and it created a sound 20 minutes after it passes you. This one was just very quiet.  I watched it for almost 8 minutes until my roof covered the view. It has no sound,  was gliding very slow towards the NorthEast. I dont want it to be a UFO, but what else can it be? Theres no airport in my area nor an airforce base.  I am a Registered Nurse. My brother is a pilot. I asked him if he had seen a plane like this that flies so low before and he has not.  So there.

Would Turn Into A Night I Will Never Be Able To Forget!!! I was looking in the sky yesterday night to say there weren't very many stars out.. The sky is very clear usually. When i looked up i happened to notice this very bright light.. It was a little bigger then the regular size of star. I asked my boyfriend what  it was, because i have never seen anything move that fast. For a second i thought it was a shooting star, it was NO SHOOTING STAR! He thought at first that it was a airplane but there was no blinking lights or anything to show it was a airplane.. Besides it was doing triple speed of a airplane. We were on the way to Store to pick up cigarettes for a friend.. After i noticed it it began moving faster and staying above us.. When we stopped to look up at time i stopped in one spot and looked like it was hovering over us. Then when we started to walk it moves again which ever direction we moved it would hover above us. We walked very fast back to our friends house. My Boyfriend told his two friends to look.. When we got back out side it finlly moved from above the house almost and was going the opposite direction from where i first noticed it. Not even two minutes we were all looking at it, it then disspeared into the sky. I sat inside my friends house, scared out of mind. I didn't know what to do!! I never believed in other life forms or anything.. I don't believe in ghosts and i am not supersicious. After about half a hour we went back outside to go get my friend her cigarettes for the second time. We weren't more then half way there and i had seen these three bright stars in the sky.. I told my boyfriend again about something in the sky. There were 3 perfectly spaced apart bright lights, that weren't there before when we were outside.. I couldn't have been mistaken either because.. Like i had said before there weren't very many stars out and i am very observant. I didn't really think anything of it then i realized if it was o'rein's belt or anything i wouldn't know because i was never into that kinda of stuff in school. i can honestl! y say i  have never seen that low to the ground stars before. But the fact it wasn't there before really didn't honestly scare me.. Considering what we just had seen not even a hour prior to that. We decided to go back again.. To scared to even walk our 5 minute walk to grab cigarettes... We got back inside and told my boyfriends two friends to come see this for themselves.. My boyfriends one friend is very smart when it come to stuff like this so we had asked him about it. The odd thing was the lights weren't the same color when we got out side they were an almost a green color as silly as that sounds.. After a few minutes they kept like moving a bit.. Almost like doing a VERY slow circular motion. Not even 5 minutes after that they faded away completely. My friends that were in the house came out and they thought we crazy because they didn't see anything.. They kept making jokes and thinking we were crazy.. But four of us had seen these objects.. And i can't even explain to people how scared and how weird that was. I used to hear stories about people seeing flying saucers and thinking they were crazy and it was like a myth.. But i can honestly say, i never thought i would have saw anything like that in a million years. I was also talking to my boyfriend on the phone today and he had told me he was talking to his friend.. And his friend also had said that last night he had seen these weird bright lights in the sky. I have nothing else really to say besides the fact i never want to experience something like that again for as long as i live.. I really hope this is helpful!",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

I have always loved the outdoors, and have been fascianted with the skies for as long as I can remember.  I was not intoxicated on this night, nor was I feeling particularly emotional or tired.  Facing west on ravenwood place, I see an object moving to the south which glowed with a hazy red light, moving quickly on what appeared to be a western bearing, and getting closer to the earth very slowly.  At this time the object appeared to be extremely far away.  My first instinct told me it was a comet or something similar, based mostly on the fact that it seemed to be too far away to be in the atmosphere.  It also appeared to have fiery red tail at this time, although what I saw as a tail may have just been my eyes blurring the image trying to maintain focus as it moved.  Within a minute or so of seeing the red object to the south, I see what first appears to be a very bright star, with a bluish white color, directly to the west of me.  When I noticed that the light from the bluish white object appeared to be flickering slightly, I moved to a place in the road where neither of the objects would be obscured by trees.  After getting a clear perspective, I saw that the bluish white object was still flickering slightly, and was moving slowly to the south, then began to slowly bobb back and forth (south to north) as well as up and down, and I turned my attention back to the red object, which was now to the southwest of me.  Now able to see both objects simultaneously from the aforementioned perspective, they both seem to be much closer than they had when I was looking at them separately.  When viewed seperately they appeared to be at least two hundred miles away, if not much farther.  When I had them in a single visual frame, they appeared to be be between 50 and 100 miles away.  After the red object reaches the point to the southwest of me, it appears to begin moving north, which makes me think it may have been making a wide clockwise circle, starting from the south, and ending in the west, almost directly above the bluish white object.  With both objects to the west of me, the bluish white object appears to be maybe 5 - 20 miles high, with the red object about 10 - 40 miles above it, and they still seem to be 50 - 100 miles away from me.  After coming almost directly above the bluish white object, the red object starts descending towards the bluish white object, without pausing or altering it's speed.  The bluish white object then appeared to ascend up towards the red object, although much slower than the red object descended  I would have dismissed the bluish white object as a plane or helicopter after seeing it move, but it seemed to be much too high for a helicopter, and seemed to be moving far too slowly to be a non-harrier airplane.  After coming to the realization that these two objects were not inanimate, and were moving towards one another, my vision began to shake slightly as I strained to comprehend what I was seeing. When the red object seemed to be no more than 5 - 10 miles above the bluish white object, both objects stopped moving suddenly and quite simultaneously.  At this time I became completly amazed at what I was seeing.  Both of the objects were staying far too still to just be moving directly towards or away from me.  As astonished as I was by then I really can't remember how long both objects stayed perfectly still, but it was at least 30 seconds, if not 4 or 5 minutes.  I was outside maybe 5 - 10 minutes total during the aforementioned sightings, and when I went back inside I believe the objects were still motionless in the same positions.  I came back outside about 30 - 50 minutes later, and the objects appeared to be in about the same place, and shortly thereafter the red object started ascending away from the bluish white object.  After reaching its original altitude if not a higher one, it started moving to the east, being almost direcltly over me at one point, but still about 10 miles to the north of me.  It was moving extremely fast, and I heard a ""sonic boom"" about 20 seconds behind it.  When it passed above me it seemed to be at an altitude of 5 - 10 miles.  With the red object much closer than it had previously been, I could tell that it had 2 red lights opposite one another, which did not flash or flicker.  There was a yellow light directly in between the two red lights that was flashing on and off, every second or so. There was a second yellow light directly in front of the first, which did not flash or flicker.  I couldn't see anything of the craft except for the lights, which appeared to be (based on a normal airplane frame) posiitoned on the wings (red lights), one on or near the underside of the nose (steady yellow light) and on the underside of the craft directly in between the wings.  I then turned my attention back to the bluish white object, which now appeared to be moving north again, to where I first saw it.  The bluish white object stayed in the same area flickering, and I went inside after watching the bluish white object stay in the same place for a few minutes, and noted that the red object still seemed to be moving very quickly in an easterly direction.  I went back inside at approximately 10:30 pm (cst) and didn't go back outside that night.  My overall feelings from the event are that the red object may very well have been a  military aircraft, as the pattern of lights was fairly normal, and the sound of the sonic boom seemed similar to other sonic booms I've heard that weren't associated with an unusual sighting.  I don't know much about aircraft, but if the red object was a man made craft, it had to be some type of harrier, as it definitely stayed perfectly still for no less than 30 seconds, at an altitude of no less than 30,000 feet.  Since I didn't get as close of a look at the bluish white object, I really can't speculate as to what it was, but it stayed in the same area, moving no more than 35 degrees from a given perspective.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,34.450566037735854,-93.03055566037736

I live in a very small town and the nights are always quiet.  The object had a basic triangular shape and at what I assume to be the front of the object was a white triangle, behind this triangle and out an equal distance to the left and right were white rectangles and behind them were two more  white rectangles.

The object was the same shape as previously described but instead of a solid white color there were bright white lights at each corner of the triangle and rectangles.

The aircraft made several rounds, rather than concentrating a search if it was for a search, and upon closer direct inspection it had no helicopter blades and thus was not a helicopter. However, it did have the ability to levitate. The craft was in sight for around 20 minutes, circling around a few times and eventually leaving.

The lights were vividly bright colors of blue and red, racing at a moderate speed around the full perimeter of craft. Standing there in amazement, I called for my mother and my younger brother, by the time they reached my room the craft was only approximately 100 yards away. Together we watched it barely graze the tree line. I then got my camera and went outside, the craft returned several times. I have two recordings of the sighting one 45 seconds and the other 1 minute and 30 seconds. It was very quite, and moved as if it was literally floating. The object appeared to be round in the sky, my conclusion is because the lights race around it giving it the illusion of a disc. After about 7 minutes the craft vanished.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,35.77337227722772,-80.90376930693068

I will relate the incident as told me in the first person, although I helped compose the report.  We have tried to be as accurate as possible.  I visited the location of this sighting with the witness and indeed she was very close to the object.  This sighting location is 6 to 7 miles SW from the runway at Robins Air Force Base.  A bit south of Hwy. 96 and west of Moody Road, the exact location not being specified for this report.   The year was 1997, and I’m not absolutely sure, but I think it was in the fall.  It was early evening and my boyfriend and I were sitting on the trunk of his car in the driveway to his house, by the side of the road.  It is a two-lane paved road through a residential area, and on the side opposite us there was a thin stand of trees, maybe 30 ft tall and behind them was an open field.  How the object arrived is still a bit fuzzy to me and I can’t be sure if it just appeared or came up quickly while we were looking the other way.  I just remember it was “there” hovering just above the tree tops on the other side of the road.  It was triangular in shape, but the sides were curved outward instead of being straight.  It was a deep black in color, and although it was dark, there was a full or nearly full moon, and we could easily see it.  About half of it was over the trees and the rest was in our view while it was hovering.  It actually protruded out over the road.  It was maybe 30 feet across at the widest point.  Surprisingly I was not scared at all, but rather very fascinated.  I surely didn’t know what to think as nothing of this sort had ever happened to me before.  I even waved my arms and tried to talk to “it”, but there was no indication from the object that it ever noticed us.  The top was dome shaped, there were no lights, it made absolutely no sound of any kind, no humming, no whirring, nothing!  We were within 50-75 feet of the object the entire time.  After hovering for several minutes, it moved slowly across the road and over us and then accelerated at an unbelievable rate to the WNW and was out of sight in less that two seconds, maybe even one.  The entire sighting lasted less than 5 minutes to the best of my recollection. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I don't recall the year, but it had to be 1997, 1998 or 1999, as I was living in the area during that time.  In the eastern sky, directly over Manhattan, I saw a HUGE (like the size of the moon in the night sky), ghostly, smokey white fireball, that looked much like a comet (tail and all), crashing down from above.  It looked as if it was going to crash in the ocean just east of New York City.  It took a few minutes for it to make its way down from the skies above NYC and fall behind it.  I thought I was seeing things, but I noticed drivers and riders in cars around me on the parkway were pointing at it and watching it with the same amazement (and concern) I had.  As it dipped behind NYC, I thought surely this was the end of the world and there would be  blinding flash followed soon by an explosion, concussion wave or tidal wave, etc., but nothing happened.  I scanned the radio, but there was no mention of it.  I checked the TV news shows the next day, and again - nada.  Still, it was a wonderful thing to see, and thankfully with no negative consequences.  Perhaps it was a large metor skimming the upper atmosphere.  Who knows.

It was New Years day, 1998. Approximately 10:55 pm in Wisconsin, USA.  Three people were driving from Milwaukee to West Allis on a routine 20 minute drive to drop off a companion on a cold New Year's night. While on the apex of a bridge adjacent to an industrial area, the back passenger spotted a golden light, flashing at a rate of about 4 flashes per second, moderately high in the dark southwestern sky [see FIGURE 1]. It was about the size and color of a small, golden street light, fixed in the sky behind and to the left of the vehicle. The back-seat passenger alerted the driver and the front passenger to the peculiarity of the light, and they all thought it might be some sort of ""helicopter"" or ""star"". As there was hardly any traffic, the driver slowed the vehicle down between 10 to 15 mph.  The object conspicuously glided down towards the ground and closer to the observers. It ceased flashing and became a solid ""gold-light orb"" [see FIGURE 2]. Now seeming to be only a few blocks away to their left (west), it began to parallel the movement of the vehicle—keeping up with its exact speed.. It was fairly low to the ground because it was somewhat being obscured by some thin tree branches (without leaves) along the roadside.  The vehicle, now having passed off the bridge, continued to move northbound towards a major intersection. As the driver slowed even more to get into the left-hand turn lane at a stop light, a red light rotated around the left side of the object, and then a blue light rotated around to the right side of the object. Both lights stopped at the visible edges and remained fixed at the object's respective sides for only a moment—disappearing within seconds [see FIGURE 3]. At this point the object was moving at its slowest. Because of the sudden appearance of the “police” lights and its speed, the witnesses concluded that it must be a police helicopter on a mission.  As the car sat at a complete stop in the left-hand turn lane, there were a few cars to the right of the vehicle. But people in those cars were not looking toward the object, which was traveling at a laborious pace very low to the ground (perhaps a 100 ft). It could barely be seen unless you were looking for it. As the object began to cross over the avenue they were going to turn onto (west), it now appeared to “branch out” into a string of five pale-white lights. It moved silently, almost at “walking speed”. The witnesses rationalized that it might be some sort of plane trying to make an emergency landing - but why land perpendicular to the street?  The lights suddenly stopped and became fixated directly above an estimated seven story factory building just two blocks away. The traffic light changed to green, and the driver finally turned left toward the object; it was just up ahead. No other cars or people were out on this usually busy street. Curiosity and perplexity filled the witnesses as they moved closer to the building.  Finally, the car pulled over to the side of the road. The back passenger rolled down his window and stuck his head out of the car to observe what could be resting in the sky above. The other two people strained to get a good view from the front passenger window. What seemed like a string of lights from a few blocks away on approach were actually the lights on the ""front"" and underneath of a large, black, equilateral triangle object. The five lights shown down like ""baseball stadium lights"", and were located at all three corners and in the middle of the two ""front"" sides [see FIGURE 4].  This large object was “fixed” in the air, producing absolutely no noise, movement, or flashing. Everything around them seemed so still, almost like they were in a vacuum and “weren’t supposed to be there.” The body of the triangle was colored charcoal-black, with a faint, grayish grove running along the front tip to the back center. There were visible sides: the edges showing a continuous grayish-black indentation with a slight overhang or lip. There also seemed to be very faint “circuit board” type etches on the body of the object. These apparent etchings were more apparent in the center grove on the “belly” of the triangle and within the groove or indentation along the sides. One witness later remarked that some of its features reminded him of a “Star Destroyer” space vehicle from the Star Wars movies.  After approximately 30 seconds of viewing the object, the driver became agitated and fearful, saying that they “have to get out of here.” He drove away and continued westbound on the avenue. When they left, the object left their point of view. But as they increased their distance at a block away, it came into view again in the back window, still fixated in the sky in the exact position last seen. Anyone else viewing the object might have passed and though nothing of it. It was so still and innocuous, that they probably would have thought it was part on the building complex. As the car passed over a hill a few blocks west of the object, it could not be seen any more. No other cars were observed on the road until about a half mile later.  The total experience was less than 5 minutes.  The three witnesses remained shaken for the rest of the night, with one of them insisting that it must be some sort of police helicopter performing a maneuver, and never wanting to talk about it again.  The most disturbing thing to the witness in the back seat was that even though he had been a big “UFO buff” from the time he was young, the word “UFO” or “alien” never entered his mind until after the triangle was completely out of view. He even had other UFO related experiences before this, but still cannot explain why he wasn’t “freaking out” at the time. The best explanation was that “he was denying it in his mind to keep his body from freaking out.”  The strangest element to the whole experience was the apparent personal awareness the object had to the witnesses. It got their attention by flashing, moved in and followed alongside the vehicle at a distance, changed forms, and seemed to wait for them and them only.

My husband had mentioned that, the night before, when he went outside to smoke a cigarette, he noticed an odd lighted craft hovering over what we knew to be Ft. Hunter Liggett Army base.  I had previously been a civilian worker on that base for three years, so I knew exactly where it was.  Anyway, he decided that we should go out the next evening and see if we could see something.  He went out first onto our property (two acres) with a pair of binoculars and scanned the sky to the north.  After about twenty minutes he called me outside and handed me the binoculars and showed me a bright light hovering above the horizon maybe 10/15 miles away.  Through the binoculars I could see that it was a silver-looking craft, what they call cigar-shaped (more like two saucers inverted onto one another), and had a row of lights around its center: red, green, yellow are the ones I distinctly remember.  The lights blinked on and off as the craft hovered.  Then it shot off to the west, looked as if it crossed 50 miles in less than a second, and stopped cold and hovered there for a while, then shot back with the same speed to its original position on the northern horizon.  It then proceeded to do strange things....turn on its side and hover, then back to upright.  Spin around and return to upright.  It then descended slowly back down below the horizon.  I got the distinct impression that it was landing back down on the base from where it came from.  I know from working on Hunter Liggett that it was an experimental testing base, it is exceptionally remote and in the coastal mountains, where there are few roads and fewer inhabitants, and so it seemed entirely likely to me that the origin of the craft very well might have been from this planet.  It did not come up again, and we never saw anything like that again.  I moved from that location in 2001.  But I do remember driving down the main highway that bisects the base on certain nights, and there appeared to be a sort of amphitheater in the hills hidden from view, but readily apparent at night because they had lots of lights, and sometimes when I drove by with the window down and those lights lit up, I could hear cheering of what sounded like hundreds of soldiers, but technically there wasn't supposed to be anything there.  I always wondered if the army was showing off its latest technical advance, something really awe-inspiring, which made the soldiers cheer like they do.  BTW, there was no confusion between the lights of this supposed amphitheater (if that's what it was), and what I saw in the sky that summer night around 1998.  I always thought the base was hiding things.  It's an excellent base for doing so; it's in the middle of nowhere almost like area 51 is.

(Mobile, AL) I was driving south down Rangeline Rd. about 20 minutes before sunrise, while the sky was still dark. As I was approaching the intersection at Hamilton Blvd., I had the window rolled down, enjoying the wind and casually gazing out at the landscape (due south, in the direction of Dauphin Island Parkway) as I was still about three blocks before the traffic light. It was as if they were purposely camouflaged as street lights, because I didn't even notice them at first. But then the last one at the end of the line, down closest to the intersection, appeared to be glowing about three times brighter than the others. As I focused directly on them at that point, I realized there weren't even any light poles along the road (it's a rural area), and these lights were actually a quarter to a half mile away. There was traffic both in front of and behind me, so I had to watch the road as I approached the intersection, and unfortunately, the traffic signal was green when I came to it, so I couldn't stop and stare. But I took one last lengthy gaze at that brightest one as I was rounding the street corner. There was a small clearing through the trees, and I got an excellent, last-second look at it as it had grown so intensely bright that it actually looked like a little sun in the distance. It had short rays of light shining from it it was so bright, with two prominent rays at each side, in the three o'clock and nine o'clock positions (edges of a disc?) Just as the trees were about to block my view, with amazingly synchronized timing, it suddenly faded to black, like a bright yard light going out.  Unlike most people who get excited when they only THINK they've seen a UFO, my initial reaction to this was denial, and I'm an open-minded person. Yet, it bothered me all day long at work that day, and then when I got off work at 2:30 PM, I looked out there in broad daylight, searching the skyline for any evidence of any kind of structure these lights would have been attached to, and there was nothing but trees. So I decided that, if they were anything that was supposed to be there, then they would be there again on the following morning. They were never there again. Except for that intensely glowing one at the end of the string, they all appeared about the size and color (yellowish) of streetlights, and they were the appropriate height and spaced apart like streetlights would be, so that nobody would have ever noticed unless they were paying as much attention as I was.  Another weird anomaly: when I got home that evening, I decided to do a web search and see if there were any UFO reports of craft similar to what I saw. Not even really expecting to find anything, I learned for the first time about Bob Lazar and his alleged back-engineering work at the secret base called S4, near Area 51. The site I found that evening is boblazar.com, and in the tape-transcripts section, I saw where Lazar says they ""glow"" at night, with the ""sodium yellow color"" of ""streetlights."" He explains that they can actually warp space and disappear, so as you can imagine, I was even more stunned as I read this than I was when I first saw it in the sky for real that morning.

Then one of it's bright lights, which were in each corner of the ship, rotated downward and was spotlighting the field as it passed over the trees and then above the field. It traveled very slow in a southward direction and finally slowly disappeared over the horizon. I started my truck back up and proceeded to head on towards Enterprise. On my way i met a few other truckers and asked them over the CB if they had seen any strange lights, but to my surprise not one person had seen anything.

It was about the year I graduated, 74,75 We moved west to get a better look and eventually came to park almost directly beneath one. The clouds where about 2 miles apart. The other quit a bit west yet. They moved very slowly to the south and stopped. They were amazing. The only thing I’ve ever seen like them is the northern lights. The center was one color then another band of color towards the edge or circumfrance and an occasional third band of color would come and go. The clouds “pulsed” just like the northern lights from the center with thin sharp protrusions somewhat like a spinyfish or sea urchin. They were more flat and plate like than high and fluffy I quess they were about an eight to a quarter mile in diameter. They resembled the spin art pictures people often do at county fairs. Yet very sharp and defined. We got out of the car and laid on the ground for over an hour. We finally became board and went on our way. I have seen some amazing northern light over my 50 years. Many colors, many shapes and sizes. One night the whole sky from horizon to horizon and moving rapidly in waves. Breathtaking.! The police talkied about it all night on the radio. That was in the early 1980’s. But these clouds were in the middle of the day. I think about 1pm or 2pm Very vivid and full like a single rain cloud but pulsing from the center and with very vivid colors. Deep clear color. I don’t recall any normal clouds in the sky at all. Its been years and I really don’t remember all the details. I have never seen them since, nor have I ever heard of anyone else seeing them besides the people with me.

On our travels away from my home to my friend's house, we cut through some wooded areas that concealed a barbed wire fence enclosing a compound called Remington Arms. We had done this hundreds of times before, just like all the kids did, but this time we had become frightened while passing through the first woods because of an orange glow which seemed to be illumunating behind some trees in the compound. It was a dry humid summer night, but it smelled strange, like rain or some wierd sweet odor. We started to sing the Beatle's song:""Octopus'Garden"" over & over again as we entered the second section of the dark wooded area. Brushing sounds of branches made us so nervous!  Soon we were at the clearing around the pond and could see the open sky.  We sang a bit louder and tried our best to ignore the orangey glow behind the trees.  I remember that the moon was hanging low and to keep our spirits light we slowly walked along the path toward it and kept on singing.   An object seemed to fly out from inside the Remington Arms compound and we noticed the strange odor in the air again. That wierd sweet odor, but even creepier was the way the tree tops were swaying, especially because there was no wind!   When we had first entered the pond area it felt as if something had been following us from behind the other side of the fence.  My friend was scared and I was too, but acted a bit braver and told her to keep singing and so our voices got louder with nervousness.  As we got closer to the shore of the pond we could see the sky better across the open water.  Suddenly we noticed that it was a triangular shaped ship which appeared without any sound, except for the movement of tree branches brushing together as it emerged from behind some tree tops. The dark triangle cruised directly towards us. It had some bright orange lights and made everything look like a negative film, with that orangey, brown tone. We kept singing, but softer as we couln't believe our eyes. Was this truly a UFO? Time seemed to stand still and must have slipped away because when we finally were able to move away and go down the path, skipping rocks in the strange glow which illuminated our way out of the woods and into the streets, the moon had risen and looked smaller. We hurried to her house as fast as we could and upon arrival everyone was worried. We were three hours late. It was after 11:00 pm and we started out from my house at around 8:00 pm. It was less than a thirty minute walk even with our dilly-dallying!  No-one believed our story and said we each shared an over active imagination. We cried and begged to be believed. ""Call the authorities! We're telling the truth."" and continued to insist that our experience was real! Then the next day my friend's Dad said, ""Maybe, girls, what you witnessed was only a new aircraft of sometype that the government was testing out. Make sure you both keep away from that area because you'll be caught and convicted of tresspassing!"" Of course, we didn't heed him and went back the next day afterschool. We sang until our lungs turned blue, but no UFO appeared. Later, after supper at my friends house, she decided to only walk me halfway home, the pond would be the ""good-bye"" point. So we sat on rocks in the clearing and began singing Octopus' Garden again. Sure enough, the orangey glow hoovered over the moving tree branches and the UFO softly floated above the water once again, not making any sound. This time we were both frozen with fear and disbelief. Again time slipped by, my friend wore a watch, but when we checked it later, it had stopped. She admitted that maybe she forgot to wind it or push the pin in tight enough after setting it. Whatever happened we'll never know? We ran down the path not even skipping the rocks properly. With soaking sneakers and drenched bell-botttoms, we reached the streetlights and fell to our knees in the middle of the road and began to pray! The older kids in the neighborhood started to make fun of us when we told our tale, so we stopped sharing it! One boy who had a tree house  and lived near the pond told everyone that it was true and that he saw the same UFO! We sorta felt better and became closer than ever before. Eventually,though, we kinda stopped talking about it altogether. Soon we became more interested in teenage things, like love, Rock N Roll, and our developing figures. I was always on the skinny side, butd suddenly started to loose a lot of weight. The boy and my best friend fell in love. Soon after my parents moved to the country, I was hospitalized. The Doctors diagnosed me with Hodgekin's Lymphoma. But the pathology report said some nodes had bizarre changes in them which couldn't be identified! Radiation & Chemotherapy took over my young life. I was just turning sixteen. I lost touch with ALL my childhood friends. The last time we got together was in 1984 after our dear friend, who said he also saw the UFO, committed suicide. My best friend was newly engaged to be married, but suspected that she was barren inside, maybe because of our experience. I haven't seen or spoke to her since. However,I was able to give birth to twin girls in 1986 and in March of 96 or 1997 during the visit of Hale-Bopp Comet, I had bizarre dreams of being abducted and woke up with tiny needle marks on the veins in my right hand. My daughters both had nightmares! One of them saw me on a table in a white room. I couldn't beleve it when she told me that these aliens took her arm off and she saw them doing painful things to her twin sister. I told them that I had a visit too and showed them my hand. I had two tiny unexplainable scabs directly on my veins. I chose not to tell them until later in adulthood that I saw them in the white lights too, and in my dream I also saw that same daughter laying on a table without her arm. God's honest truth! To this day the twins become uncomfortable talking about it. They don't like to remember the bad experience and say that I am making up my admissions just to scare them. I wonder...can generations become targets of study? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-03-04T00:00:00,41.19200961038961,-73.20145714285715

Three pilot crews from 3 different airlines observed and confirmed seeing an unidentified flying object as big as a battle ship after being alerted by Lisbon Air Traffic Control Center.  British Airways Captain Dennis Wood tells his story:  Rare BBC interview with Captain Wood!   On May 14, 1977, the Natal Daily News from South Africa, published an article about this UFO incident titled ""UFOs as big as battleships, pilots claim.""  Here’s that article: ""UFOs As Big As Battleships,"" Pilots Claim (May 14 1977)  For fear of being ridiculed, pilots of three airliners kept secret the sighting of three UFOs over Portugal, later described by one of them ""as big and solid as battleships."" British Airways Trident jet pilot, captain Dennis Wood, who has been flying with the airline for 20 years, said he and his crew first spotted the UFOs while flying from London to Faro. The sighting, described by experts as the most important in the past decade, was also made by the crew of a British Tristar below the Trident and the pilot of a Portuguese airliner.  All the stories tallied. Captain Wood, 42, said he and the Tri-star crew made sighting reports when they arrived at London’s Heathrow airport but kept it all a secret for fear of being ridiculed.  Captain Wood has come forward in the hope that Britain’s ufo experts will turn a serious eye to this particular sighting. ""Suggestions that the three objects were balloons, stars or satellites, strange clouds or reflections are quite unacceptable to us,"" he said.  ""As I looked to the west we saw this very bright headlamp in the sky.  All the cabin staff saw it too and I told the passengers.  Then it was joined by two cigar-shaped objects as big and solid as battleships."" On the return trip, captain Wood tilted his radar scanner.  ""There, in exactly the same spot, were these two cigar-shaped things.  We got to within seven miles of them when they disappeared from our screen.""",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

Being a curious person I set my clock to wake up so I could witness this celestial event.  I went outside that morning and within a few minutes I did see some heavenly body streak across the sky.  Just before I was about to go back inside to bed, I saw something else that I've never seen the likes of before or since.  In the not too distant night sky I saw a disc shaped object floating slowly towards me. It was very brightly colored (the lights alternated red, blue, green and orange in a circular pattern around the object).  I was transfixed by this sight as it inched towards our house. Over the next twenty minutes it floated closer and closer to the yard where I was standing. After about ten minutes of observation it was clear to me that this object was approaching and would soon be directly over head. I would estimate the disc at about 500ft in diameter and flying about 500ft in the air. There were times when it appeared to come to a dead stop and simply hover, then begin floating slowly closer. The flickering alternating colorful lights were the most striking thing about it and I remember wondering what government technology could produce such an object. At about the 20 minute mark in the sighting, the object was nearly directly over my head and I remember a strong fear coming over me. I was afraid of being spotted by this craft and went back inside the house. From various windows inside I continued to watch the object as it flew over the front of the house and I ended up in my bedroom watching it pass over the back yard. The object never made a sound. There were a bunch of trees behind the house a few hundred yards away; once the object glided over those trees it appeared to descend further. I watched it hover just above those trees for another 10 minutes or so before it ascended and quickly flew ou! t of sig ht. No airplane, weather balloon, or helicopter that I know of could account for that sighting. I will never forget what I saw that night and I have come to believe that others have seen the same thing as well.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,30.4224,-88.6527

This in itself was alarming because federal regulations state that all west and east converging aircraft were to fly at 1000 feet separation plus 500. This aircraft was obviously ignoring the rules because he was heading straight at us! As this object approached closer and we prepared for evasive maneuvering, we noticed that this object was void of any type of wing surfaces, propellers, engine nacelles, or landing gear. As we drew closer the object seemed to veer and passed off our left wing at approx. 100 feet. At this distance it simply appeared as a metallic sphere. It left no contrail, had no cockpit, and was most certainly moving under its own power on a flat trajectory. My estimation of its closing speed was that it was flying close to ours, based on my past experiences with other aircraft in close proximity. At the time we were flying in the 120mph range. The time available to see this machine was probably no more that 5-6 seconds at the most. Once it passed, I banked sharply to get on its tail. But by the time we were in position…it was simply..gone! Nothing had been said between my instructor and I during this entire event, until after we had finished looking for the object. I asked him “what was that?” His response was that he had no idea, and then told me “when we get back, don’t say a word about this ok?” And I never did. Not until almost 20 years later, when I found him again flying for a major airline, and had a chance to speak with him about it. All our recollections matched, and we both were still perplexed as to what that thing might have been. Since those days I have acquired a commercial pilot’s license and flown professionally. I have also acquired several degrees, one of which is in Aeronautics. And in addition, I became a federally licensed aviation maintenance technician. Now I am a public school teacher at the secondary level and teach technology education and aviation science classes. And NONE of my training, education, or professional experiences has helped me to explain what I saw that hot summer afternoon so long ago.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,34.53761649484536,-117.17310051546391

I believe it was early 1980. I was 12 years old at the time. My mother, grandmother, brother and myself were going to go shopping at Zody's in the Canoga Park area of CA. Zody's is no longer around but the location at that time was at the corner of Topanga Canyon Blvd and Roscoe Blvd. The sun was setting so it was still fairly light but getting dark quickly. After we parked and were heading to the entrance of Zody's, my brother and I were lagging behind my mother and grandmother. I then realized that my brother was not beside me and so I thought he stopped to tie his shoe so I stopped and turned around and that is when I saw the lights flashing. My brother was looking at it too. The craft was a disk shape, appeared to be made of metal and had white lights around the perimeter that flashed in sequence and gave it the illusion that it was spinning but it was close enough and still light enough outside to see the underside of the craft and I could tell that it was not spinning. It hovered completely still and made no noise at all. I watched it for about 10 seconds and then realized that mom and grandma may have already gone in the store and I didn't want them to miss out on seeing this. I turned and looked towards the entrance to the store and saw that mom and grandma were also watching the craft as were a bunch of people who were either on their way into the store or had just come out. I don't know the size of the craft because I don't know how close it was and I don't know the altitude because I don't know it's size. From my perspective it was the size of a dinner plate held at arms length. After watching the craft for about a minute it suddenly began to move to the right without changing altitude. Then it slowed to a stop and just as it came to a stop it suddenly shot straight up and was gone in only about 2-3 seconds. The entire experience lasted approximately one minute. By the time it took off it was dark enough to see the stars. We stayed there and watc! hed the sky for a little while thinking it might come back but it didn't, at least not while we were out there. My family acted different after that. They were more quiet than usual and I kept wanting to talk about it and I'd say, ""Wasn't that strange? What was it that we saw?"" but nobody said anything. It seemed like we should have had more time to shop but it didn’t feel like we were in the store very long when they were announcing they were closing and that we’d have to bring our purchases to the front. I don’t know if this was an indication of missing time or not. After we did our shopping, on the way home I still couldn't get anyone to say anything. It was as though my family were in a trans-like state, except me. It wasn't until we got home and we were getting our purchases out of the back of the car that my mother started saying, ""What was that thing we saw? Wasn't that strange?"" There were many witnesses but I don't know if any of them reported it at that time or since then. We didn't report it at that time..

I took it with me crossed two roads to the back meadow.  It was funny it was like the object could sence me getting closer because at first they where right over the meadow and seem to back off as I walk closer.  With the 3X9 scope I could see they looked like a clam shell shape and with several different color that seem to strobe and they seem to be hovering not flying.  That is what struck me as weird and there was no engine noise. They seem also to be in a slight V formation.  I was only 15 or 16 and heard some strange noise in the tree near me so turn and run back to the house.  When I got back to the house about 400-500 yard.  I turn and they were gone.   I never told to many people because I was by myself and most people do not believe in UFO's.

My friends and I, were hanging out in one of the friend's yard talking and trying to find satelites and such.

And as far as I knew only planets did that.  So I thought it was a planet, but something seemed to make me second guess it.  I leveled my hand with it vertically to a nearby star.  The object went in and out of view from behind my hand.  I started to ask them (my friends) if they saw it as well, and one of my friends said and I'm quoting ""Do you see that star?  It's F***ing moving man!"". 	We continued watching it go back and forth for several minutes.  I saw a ""satelite"" and pointed it out.  It was going in the direction of the object, off at 30 degree or so.  It continued until it passed the object on the left side.  It started to go around in a large circle until it was on level with the object, and TURNED  45 degrees heading directly at it. 	We were all watching it with anticipation of what was happening and freaked out.  What happened next is what got us.

I was traveling South on Redwood Road, coming up on the area of Camp Williams military base. I passed another car that was headed North, and I remember feeling really bad because I left my high-beams on, because the headlights in my car would only work in the high-beam position, and only if I held it in that position manually. The car passed, though, and went around a bend, and there were no other cars on the road. I remember it was very dark.  At that point, I began to see the flash of red and blue lights illuminating the area. I thought I was getting pulled over for leaving my high-beams on, so I started to look for a safe place to pull over. As I slowed down, I looked in my rearview mirror, and I could see actual flashing red and blue lights, and I looked over my shoulder and saw them in the rear window.  After a minute, I found a place where there was enough of a shoulder on the road to pull over. I pulled over and put the car in park, and then I noticed that there were no longer any flashing lights. I looked all around. There was no car behind me. I was completely alone on the road. I just sat there, wondering what that was all about.  As I sat there, I replayed the incident in my mind. I could visualize the red and blue flashing lights as they appeared through my rear window. All of a sudden it occurred to me that there were no headlights. There had been no headlights below the red and blue flashing lights! I started to panic. In fact, I was just plain terrified at that point. I knew that something very out of the ordinary had just happened to me.  I was so scared, I didn’t know what to do. I grabbed my cell phone and called my husband, at home. I explained what had just happened, and he told me to put the car in drive and drive home fast. He was scared too. As I spoke to him, I tried to gather my thoughts. I tried to tell him all the tiny details of what had just happened, so I would remember it all. I was scared and confused, and felt like I needed to go through it all and figure it out. In doing so, I recalled distinctly that there had been no headlights. There was no flash of white light, as it would have appeared if a car had turned around and their headlights swung around in the turn. There was no indication of a car pulled over further behind me, although it was very dark and I may not have seen it if there was. Everything I recalled then and everything I recall now is just completely puzzling.  Living near Camp Williams, in Eagle Mountain, had afforded us many opportunities to see military helicopters of all sorts. For a few minutes I thought that perhaps it might have been a helicopter, but I have been below low flying helicopters before, and I know what that sounds like. I was even buzzed by a low flying Blackhawk one night as my husband and I drove down the highway, so I know how it sounds when one is close. The thing that kept coming back to me as I recalled the bizarre occurrences of that evening is that there was no sound. As close as those lights were to my vehicle, I know I would have heard the sound, if it had been a helicopter. It was close enough that I saw the source of the flashing lights in both my rearview mirror and in my rear window. Whatever it was, it was very low to the ground and very close to my car.  I have always held a neutral position regarding the ideas of extra-terrestrials and UFOs. I have neither believed, nor disbelieved in them. I’ve enjoyed watching sci-fi shows, but it was always just silly fun to me. I’ve never really considered myself a “believer”. That night my skepticism really dropped to an all-time low. I’m still not really what you would call a “believer”, but I’m a great deal closer to it since then. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It looked to be about 100 feet above the tree tops, about 150 yds off the road.  It definately spooked me.  I have always been one to look at the night skies and have alot of interest in aircraft.  This seemed different than anything I had ever seen.  I continued down the road and after hitting Hwy 127 and turning north, I saw what appeared to be the same object, only it was several miles from the road and much higher.  It seemed to blink red, then green, which made me think of the white light going around blanking out the red and green on the object I had seen.  I did not believe that this object was following me, or had anything to do with me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Pugh. I was hiking alone in the Cascade Mountains of Western Washington.  After hiking a good part of the day I reached the summit of Mount Pugh where I set up camp for the night. Later in the evening I took advantage of the opportunity to observe the stars since I was away from the city lights. It was about 22:00 I saw three points of light. They were mostly red but also had some white in them. They were below the horizon.  I was looking down on them from a point several thousand feet above them while they were only 50 or 100 feet above the foothills below me.  I could see a faint illumination that they cast on the trees below them. They were bobbing and weaving in a strange kind of dance and they were all doing it in perfect synchronization with each other, almost as if they were physically linked. It didn't take me long to realize I was seeing something very strange and at that instant I had one of those ""Oh  Sh%*&"" moments.  I felt very uneasy as I was completely alone, at night, in the middle of nowhere. Two of them dropped below a ridge and were out of sight. They reappeared occasionally, sometimes from a completely different direction. This was mountainous terrain and there were literally scores of ridges and peaks surrounding me in all directions. I was looking southwest initially. Sometimes I saw them to the North or East and they would drop back down below a ridge in that direction. The other remained in sight continuously. They seemed to be playing hide and seek with me and I was constantly scanning in all directions, looking for them. After a few minutes I saw a fourth UFO.  It was just slightly below the horizon to the Northwest and was more distant, maybe several miles.  It's apparent size was about that of a pea held at arms length. It was more or less round. It was usually red, sometimes green or white. It's color and luminosity reminded me of a neon light. It would suddenly appear then the light would rapidly fade out in about 2 seconds. Then a little later it would reappear and fade out again the same way. It was always at the same location in the sky. What was really strange was that after I watched it fade I would keep my eyes fixed at that spot waiting for it to reappear but it never did while I was looking there. After maybe 30 seconds I would look away to locate the other 3 UFOs, then just at the exact moment when I looked back at that spot again it reappeared and faded. It was as if it knew the exact moment when I returned my gaze to that spot. This happened several times and it was creeping me out. A few times gold or yellow sparkling lights sprayed out of it. It looked exactly like a fireworks display. I know this sounds like too much but there was a fourth UFO that appeared briefly. It was a white point of light in the valley immediately below the peak I was on. It appeared to be no more than 100 feet off the ground. It slowly meandered northward up the heavily wooded valley. I could see a few points of light among the trees below that were the lanterns at some drive in camp sites. The UFO came pretty close to some of those. I estimate it was traveling about 30 mph.  I'm certain it wasn't a helicopter either. There was no sound and it traveled in a kind of tight weaving pattern similar to what the red lights were doing. With so much going on I felt like I was watching a circus.  It was really too much and I just wanted them to go away. After watching for about an hour and a half the 3 red lights were much further away and the fourth one was appearing infrequently. I was tired and it gets cold at night at 7200 feet, even in August. So I climbed into my tent and eventually went to sleep hoping I wasn't going to be a guest on an alien mother ship during the night. I always felt comfortable camping alone in the wilderness but now I will have a nagging fear in the back of my mind that I will have another experience like that. If some other people had been with me it would have been an exciting and interesting experience. As I was alone it was just plain scary. Two weeks later I went back to the same peak with a buddy (no way was I going back alone!).  One or two of the red lights described above appeared again but they were more distant and they didn't dance around like the last time.  They just slowly meandered around in the distance.  I pointed them out to my friend but he dismissed them at first.  After they continued to hang around I pressed the point with him and got him to admitt they weren't airplanes.  I could see it made him uneasy.  He went inside his tent and went to bed.  End of story.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,48.051100000000005,-121.7424

There were at least fifty fighter jets. These planes looked clumsy compared to the aircraft we had been observing. The UFOs had an incredible grace and range of motion that made the jets seem awkward.  This show continued for about forty-five minutes. Then the UFOs disappeared much as they had come.  They once again looked like bright stars and were instantly gone. My wife and son were with me.  All of us were astounded.

We were on the roof of the building in the Hot Tub when another couple joined us who we did not know. We chatted a little with them and they were visiting from Witchita Kansas where the Male was employeed at Boeing (As an Engineer if my memory is correct). My wife asked ""What is that!"" and she was looking up and over at a 45+ degree angle (cannot remember direction E or W). The four of us looked up and saw 7 lights darting around eachother like fire flies in the sky. I did not have my glasses on at this point and I said it was probably sparkler fire works from one of the theme parks near by. The make of the other couple said ""No, that is not fireworks!"" and he, his wife and mine got out of the hot tub and watched the lights dance in the sky. I rushed over to the table and retreived my glasses and was shocked when I put them on. The number of lights had grown to about a dozen lights very very high in the sky. The lights looked as though they were forward pointing lights on individual craft and as they changed direction and the light pointed away the light would disappear to us and another would appear as it banked its turn and came back down. We watched in quiet awe for half an hour. We were interupted by a security guard that came out and told us the roof/pool/spa was now closed and we had to leave. I asked him ""What the hell is that?"" and he looked up and says he has no idea. We agreed that the lights were well above commercial flight altitude. The security guard was an older man who said he was retired military and he had never seen anything like it either. After a few minutes he made us leave the roof. My wife and I walked all around the building looking out windows trying to see the lights but the angle was wrong. We have talked for many years now about what we saw. I am curious if there are any other reports during that time frame in that location. ((name deleted)) Plano, Texas ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Anyone that has seen the shuttle or any other launch knows this. I have thought of this night for several years. Tonight I did some resurch to see if anyone else reported these lights. It has made me believe I should tell what I saw. I was at sebastian inlet on the south side jetty doing some fishing.I seen mostly the same as everyone else. The sky only had a few clouds in it.these clouds could be seen clearly due to the moon was high and bright.I came to notice the lights in the sky due to the fact they turned night into day...These where large white lights, Not like the flames of a rocket...As well as they appeared in the sky, Not launching from the ocean.. As I stated I was fishing,[There was nothing blocking my view}.. To me the lights seem to be almost conected as if part of one object. These lights seemed to be several miles off the coast of sebastian..These lights overpowered the moons light. I would clearly say these lights where brighter then a night time shuttle launch as well. They did not seem to move at all.Just stayed in one place,not moving like rocket..No sounds at all.The only sounds was of everyone on the jetty trying to figure out what it was..No rumble sounds like a rocket,no flames,no smoke. It seemed to me when the lights where going out they { Rolled Up }..They did not turn out..This is when it seemed to be one object to me. The way it just seened to roll up as if it was turning to the southeast..This is when things got loud. Several fighter jet {I would say comming Patrick Air Force Base} where not wasting any time heading in the direction where it the was..I had counted two groups of around 12 planes.. They where moving very fast, Yet I could see the flames coming from the jets.The planes came back by about 30 to 40 minutes later..This time flying much slower..I remimber people joking that they didn't get there in time,Or seen what it was and ran...The only naval operations I believe took place was to try to get a look at the object or odjects..Why would you send US jets to a test sight if they where launching missles? There is a no fly zone every time they have a launch at KSC...My farther was in the navy for over 25 years.I grew up in a navy life style I have see many launchs in my 36 years of life...This was no launch...This object I would say was the biggest thing I ever seen in the sky ...This is something my friend and me tells everyone we know..",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

These objects that I saw were not that strange as it appeared at the sky. Most however won't notice these things because they seem to resemble like ordinary stars. When we heard about this comet in the news somewhere around those years 1997, 1998 that it would appear clearly in the nightsky. Me, my brother, my dad and two of my cousins would go out to watch how beautiful it is. Not until we keep looking around that we notice other objects in the sky moving irregularly the same way how houseflies behave in the morning.  The objects looked like stars but it moves then it slows down, some even cross paths. We thought that they were airplanes at first then fighter planes then it got too weird and it flew too fast at that distance we decided they were sattelites and their reflections. We never stopped seeing these things in the sky for the past years but we didn't mind them that much since we always knew there were other beings out there that needn't challenge our beliefs. But just seeing these things stimulates ones mind.  My father however who works at a government based envirorment protection agency kept seeing several flying objects in the sky as he and his team perform their duties in the remote regions of the province. It was no surprise that many of his friends wondered and were in doubt to what these were and concluded there on that these were alien crafts. My father back then sometimes comes home and tells us that he and his friends saw several UFO's in greater numbers that what we see here in the city. Mainly because it was darker in province where their lights cannot be obscured by our the city's.  So one day my dad couldn't take it anymore called our local meteorological station called PAGASA and begin to report and if by any chance they could somehow pick-up flying objects in their radar besides our aircraft. They answered ""No.""  I haven't seen the same flying objects in sky recently which is quite disappointing but I always try to look and stare up just in case. Yet I was glad that we weren't the only ones out here seeing strange flying objects in the sky. People tend to try and talk about these things once you start and it's surprising but its true.

I looked straight up, because the facility is well lighted, both inside and out, making star gazing less than spectacular.  I happened to focus on what I believed to be two ordinary stationary stars. One star was of medium brightness, and the other star, at the 3:00 o'clock position, was very dim, just half as bright, and about the distance of a quarter held at arms lenght from the other star.  Suddenly, the dim star, just a speck of light, made sharp, angular manuevers, all within close proximity to the other star.  I remember exclaiming to myself ""holy mackerel, that thing is moving"".  I nearly ran inside to get my work partner, but I was afraid to lose track of it, so I just kept watching. Then the pin prick of light made a circular move, which brought it to the opposite side of the stationary star, to the 9:00 o'clock position. These moves only lasted 4 to 5 seconds, maybe a moment more or less. It hesitated for a split second, and then headed south.   I had the presense of mind to start counting: one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand, four-one thousand, five-one thousand, six-one thousand, gone!!!  over the southern horizon, where I lost sight of it at about 15 degrees over the horizon.  This speck of light had no sound and no tail.  It never flared brighter or dimmer. This speck of light, which I perceived to be very high in the atmosphere, crossed half the night sky in six seconds!!  It did not blink.   After making its manuevers and going south it did not accelerate, but simlpy arrived at its intended speed and went absolutely straight.   This once in a lifetime observation has annoyed me since it happened and I'm pleased to report it. I have since retired from that line of work.  I look forward to spending many pleasant summer nights observing the the night sky and watching for stars moving in ways that neither the stars or our known military craft should be able to do.
