My experience was about missing time when I was living in El Paso, TX.  On December 3, 2014 I was sleeping and I woke up like other nights.  I saw the clock that is on my table near me and I saw that the time was 1:11am.  This surprised me a bit and decided to get up to go to the bathroom.  I’m quite sure (because I was awake) I was in the bathroom two minutes.  When I return to bed, I look at the clock and it was 2:43am. I missed 1 hour 32 minutes.  I know I will not remain asleep in the bathroon because I remember everything I did.  This is very disturbing to me because I find no explanation.  Sometimes I can not sleep thinking abóut this and trying to find what happened to me. About seven years ago, I was living in Fort Worth, TX, and I had an episode of sleep paralysis.  That morning, when I woke up I could not move.  With great effort I could look at my husband who slept beside me.  I tried to scream to wake him and could not. I tried to calm down, closed my eyes tightly and when opened I could already move. Another episode I think was a sleep paralysis as well happened to me about five or six years ago (in Fort Worth, TX)  When I woke up this morning, my bed sheets were clenched as if some unknown force were grabbing the covers and pulling them down.  In this three experiences, I do not remember seeing anything unusual in the room, like lights, shadows, etc.",2015-05-22T00:00:00,31.7923281835206,-106.3748488764045

So instead of just heading into the library I parked, grabbed my phone, and walked out to the main road to get a better look if it was still there and it was. And it still hadn't moved an inch. If it had been like a blimp or a plane or anything like that- it would be moving and trust me- I know about the white blimp that hovers over Dundalk, MD, the thing is though is that I drive through Catonsville to get back home from work and I have NEVER seen the white blimp from Catonsville. It was definitely metallic in structure. From my standpoint I could see the sunlight reflecting off of it because I could see this bright almost halo-like thing around it.  It was completely spherical in shape and honestly I cannot think of anything it might have been other than a UFO.  Now as for background of the observer: I had just gotten off work that day and was heading to the library to visit with my young nephews. I have never drank or smoked in my life and I have never done any illicit drugs. To my knowledge I do not have any mental illnesses that would cause me to hallucinate and even so I have a picture of the UFO to prove that it was there!",2015-05-22T00:00:00,,

The object was very bright, the same sort of luminescence and coloration of burning copper.  It left a trail and smaller pieces seemed to break off of it and burn out as they streaked across the sky.  By my estimation, I'd say that it was no more than 1000 to 2000 feet above the ground. I filed a report of a similar object that I saw around March of 2007 here on the NUFORC database as well.  I'd always thought these fireballs were just common meteors that may have penetrated deep into the atmosphere, but I'm no meteorologist or astronomer.   After sighting the fireball mentioned in this report and reading about a similar sighting here in the database, I did some internet digging and found that green fireballs have been investigated by the Air Force in what was called ""Project Twinkle.""

Then all of a sudden, they just disappeared.  They did not fade away or drift off,  just disappeared.  As if the lights were shut off. After seeing a few more appear above the lake, I went in to tell my friend, who came outside and saw them just before they disappeared.  She, being more of a skeptic, thought it was a plane.  However, the way they just hovered there, moved slowly, three at a time, right across the sky and then to just vanish was unsettling.  If I remember correctly there were nine or twelve.  They were definitely grouped in threes.  They came all in a straight line over the clear sky.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,,

It was VERY fast when compared to the size or a airplane, around 10x the size of a A320 following a domestic path, this when looking at the same supposed distance/height, a height where you can clearly distinguish the winglets/ tail lights.  Compared to a star which is only a small dot it would be roughly around 100x's the size, alot brighter!  Regarding the brightness: this object was very bright, enough to made me turn my head and aknowledge it's presence.  It made a small straight path horizontally, this while getting brighter.  Just imagine 1 (one) true white led of a flashlight, now put it in a dark room, make a small path with your hand holding the flashlight and you have a rough idea. Then, the most impressive thing about this sight, it pulsated for about 1 second, and it switched direction  in a rigid ""V"" shaped maneuver and it left a trail in the sky for about 1 second that quick disapeared while bliking the eye.  The pulse was obvious, as also was the trail. It was basically like the Entreprise warming up and going to Warp Speed in the well known movie.  But alot more distance in this one. No idea of the origin, who made etc.  Just clearly something not natural, like the shooting star that preceeded it around 4m.  The type of light, movement nature (something not being propeled with fuel combustion engines, much more smoother), the relative velocity of the path in the sky and way it went to ""warp"" in a V-shaped 180º change of direction.... just unbelieveble.

This was a slow but not too slow moving object.  And unlike a falling star that appears to fall in a vertical line or appears to be be falling in general, this object wasn't falling. It was moving horizontally or parallel to the earth.   The reason for comparing it to a falling star was bc it had a tail behind it.  But this tail wasn't bright like a star that's falling. It reminded me of a jet with the stream of smoke behind it.  But this object appeared to be too close to be a jet and way too big.  It was long and cylinder shaped or cigar shaped, and from where I was sitting it looked to be over a foot long or maybe more; longer than a ruler.

The base of the triangle was on the top with the third light underneath, closer to the horizon.   As I watched, the three became larger, but their configuration did not vary, still a triangle but a little more orange in color and much brighter, resembling an amber-colored street lamp, i.e., a sodium vapor light.

Erratic flight characteristics. On April 15, 2015 11:45 P.M. 	I was working on building a new front porch on my home.  It was nearly midnight. I had to work late on my project because I had been exceptionally busy at work.  I was cleaning up my tools and debris and carrying them west towards my garage.  As I walked I glanced south and saw what I thought was the planet Jupiter.  I spend a time behind the telescope looking at Jupiter, Saturn, etc… and only because of that fact did I realize that something was out of place.  During that time of night and time of year, Jupiter has already passed the tree tops on the western edge of our property.  Realizing that something seemed out of place, I looked more closely at that the object that I had mistaken for a planet.  The size in the sky looked correct, also the brightness was comparable to Jupiter. 	At first the object seemed to be just hanging in place, I then wondered if I had mistaken it for another planet but then it started to move.  It kept a relative track of west to south east.  Suddenly, it made a very substantial, very abrupt turn due south, then another, equally sharp correction back to the east, then it began a sweeping arc back to the south. The movement seemed far too sharp for any aircraft that I have ever seen.   I ran in the house and grabbed my 8x binoculars that were sitting next to the door and returned to my front yard.  By the time I returned (roughly 15-20 seconds) the object had really picked up speed.  It was moving far faster than an aircraft.  I yelled for my wife but she didn’t hear me (as she was in the back of the house). 	I got the binoculars on it and could make out very little detail but this is what I saw. It appeared to be triangular in shape, it had one single, exceptionally bright white light that appeared to be centered in the object (it was so bright when viewed through the binoculars it did give the object a bit of an aura), and I couldn’t give a definitive size as I had nothing to compare it to, it had no landing lights, beacons, etc… just the one light and it made absolutely no sound.  The night was quiet, except for the frogs (which had gone quiet during the event, not necessarily because of the event, as they do that from time to time at night).  As the object began to move out of sight the white light seemed to take on an orange glow, like the moon seen through air pollution, then it just blipped out.  The whole event couldn’t have lasted more than 2-3 minutes.  The angle of my view must have dropped 15-25 degrees in elevation and 30 degrees from right to left as I tracked the object.  The night was completely clear, the temperature was 45-50 degrees.  It seemed very fast but, in fairness, not being able to judge the size or elevation of the object, I couldn’t say definitively, how fast it was actually traveling.  It seemed to move about as fast as a satellite, when you watch them pass over. 	The object would’ve had to cross over or very near the flight path of Joint Base Lewis/McCord. We lived in the base’s airspace for nearly 4 years now.  I have seen just about every type of aircraft come off that base, from Osprey, Chinook and Blackhawks to F-18’s, C-130’s etc…  I have never seen anything come off that base that resembled, in any way, what I saw that night.  The closest comparison that I could come up with was watching a satellite with the exception of possible size and flight characteristics. 	I did not report this to the authorities because I didn’t want people to think I was crazy. I know it sounds cliché but it’s the truth.  I have seen some strange things in my life but I’m sure they’ve all had logical explanations and this may very well have a simple, logical explanation but I couldn’t come up with one.  I found your site while searching the internet to see if anyone else might have reported something of this nature.  I did tell my wife, knowing that I am a very honest and pretty logical person, she believed that I did, indeed, see something but she still had to chuckle when I came in and told her about it.  It would be nice to know that I was not the only one to witness this phenomena. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Here is what happened on my way home from work May 11, 2015, in the afternoon around 5PM:   Recently, I saw some kind of UFO ship that you might be interested in hearing about.  I would never have believed that I would see something quite like this.  I was on my way home from work earlier this month May 11, 2015, about 5PM in the afternoon.  I spotted a ship in the sky as I was leaving Redlands while traveling West on the 10 Freeway for several miles, until I was too far West to see it anymore.  It was North of the 10 Freeway, and it was above the 210 Freeway around the area of North-East San Bernardino and just above Highland California.  I thought that it was something from the military.  My health is not so good these days, and my only thought was to get home to keep with my schedule.  In hindsight, I wish that I would have driven over towards Highland to get a better look at it, to take a picture of it, and to draw it to the attention of other people in that area at the time it was there in the sky.  I wish that I had taken pictures to prove what I am saying. I had trouble staying in my lane with my truck because I was amazed at what I was seeing.  I saw it from the side, as I looked North towards the San Bernardino Mountains.  Specifically, it was closer to Highland California and was near the San Manuel Indian Casino area.  I had a very clear view of the ship under the much higher clouds.  I got a very good look at it for about five minutes.  It was stationary in the sky, and it did not move an inch the whole time that I watched it.  If it was a balloon, you would think that it would at least have moved a little.  It just hovered there from my view, about 3/4 as high as the top of the San Bernardino Mountains.  I saw no ropes or chains under it to hold it in place. What I saw hovering in the sky above San Bernardino/Highland California was rectangular in shape. I saw no lights on it, as it was daylight still.  It was much longer than it was high.  I would describe it as about 180 feet long and around 30 feet high or more.  It had square sections to the ship.  It had no wings or propellar that I could see, and it emitted nothing.  Most of the ship was silver/metallic in color, but it did have some other dark colors too that made it look like it had been manufactured and put together in sections.  It looked like something that could have been man made, but it was so big.  However, I have never seen anything like it before, and I have no idea how it was staying so still in the sky.  The separate sections reminded me of being similar to the ship that crash landed in the beginning of the science fiction movie, ""Pitch Black.""  It was like something from out of a movie. I thought that it would have been on the news later that night, but I did not see anything on television.  The very next time that I drove to work on the 10 Freeway, it was gone from that area of the sky.  I have ran a search on the Internet, and it seems that someone else did see it later that evening.  Here is the report they issued at this website that I am also about to post on:   http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118948.html  This couple saw it from their house in Highland several hours later that evening after my sighting.  But that shows that I am not the only one who saw it.  You would think that with that many people living in San Bernardino, Highland, and surrounding cities that others would have noticed it too and would have reported it to the newspaper.  I only hope this is a ship owned and operated by our United States military.  Anyway, I will probably never find out what it was.  There is nothing much more to tell, other than what I have written here today. In addition, I have written the San Bernardino Sun newspaper to find out if there has been any other information that has been reported. I believe in God.  My dad and I have seen meteorites hit the ground out in the desert on our way back from Arizona before, but I have never seen anything like this in all my life. I never thought things like this were important.   Thanks for your interest.",2015-05-22T00:00:00,34.15461809338521,-117.30409630350195

My girlfriend and I were sitting on the ocean shore in Deep Cove (North Vancouver), B.C., facing 60 degrees NE and looking up at the stars/planets and identifying some of them with an iphone app that I have on my phone.  The sky was clear and there was a very bright, almost full moon to the east of us. At aprox. 21:55, I was gazing out across the water when my girlfriend exclaimed ""What is that!!??""  She was pointing up to the sky almost directly overhead. I saw nothing and asked her where and what she was talking about.  She again exclaimed ""There!!!"" and was pointing towards the handle of the Big Dipper.  I still saw nothing... then a few seconds later I saw a bright pulse of light in the sky...it was the size of a star...but much brighter than any star in the sky.  The pulse/flash lasted maybe half a second.  A few seconds later it flashed again, but had moved further NORTH in the sky....holding my hand out at arms length I would comfortably estimate the distance between ""flashes"" to be 2 inches in the sky. I thought that perhaps it was space junk or the space station glinting sunlight but then a few seconds later it pulsed again but now it had moved 2 inches to the EAST. It was very high up in the sky...from our vantage point, if it had stay! ed illuminated, one would have thought it was just another star in the night sky. It was not a plane or drone or anything of that nature.  A few seconds later it flashed again but now it had moved 2 inches SOUTH of it's previous position.  A few moments after that, it flashed again but now it was 2 inches WEST of it's previous position. Essentially it had done a circle.... then the weirdest thing happenened... From it's last position there was a streak or line of light in a northward direction from it's last position. I have seen many meteors and this was not that! As a meteor moves across the sky, it's tail moves with it... this was different... the light traveled about an inch or inch and a half across the night sky (with hand held at arm's length)but the starting point to finish point stayed illuminated in the sky for a brief second.... like a ""line of light"" in the sky.  A few seconcs afterwards there was another pulse/flash of light aprox 2 inches to the NORTHEAST of where the ""line of light"" had ended.  The whole experience took place over a 2-3 minute period. We watched the sky for about 10 min longer but there was no more activity. My girlfriend said that the first time she noticed it (before I did), it had made a ""line of light"" in the sky but that it seemed so unnatural she didn't believe that she had actually seen that... then she saw the pulse/flash in different spots across the sky a few times before I picked up on it. I can't emphasize enough how srange and bizarre the ""line of light"" was. I don't know how that could be replicated...  You could physically see the bright object moving, but its start point remained illuminated in a line all the way to the finish point..then it all disappeared at the same time before the final flash to the northeast.",2015-05-08T00:00:00,,

My service toss is in an area directly above my head as I face West.  I tilt my head up as I look at the area in the sky where I want to toss the ball into.   I look up an toss the ball and stop.  Directly in the area that I'm tossing the ball I see a object every high in the sky reflecting the light from the sun.   I say to my partner look at that and point.  He can't see it.

Friday, May 29, 2015 at approximately 10:30am, my 11 year old son & I were driving East on Highway 18.  We were roughly 20 minutes West of Big Bear Lake.  The morning was clear.  Blue skies, not a cloud in any direction.   As we were driving on this narrow two-lane, winding road, I saw a shiny, round ball in the sky, I’m guessing it was a couple thousand feet up.  It looked like metal, and reflected the sunlight like a really nice chrome finish on a classic car.  It was textured, like it had different shapes of metal covering the outside; it was not smooth or flawless.   We were listening to music, so I can’t confirm if there was any sound associated with the object.  We had the car windows down, but all I heard was music and the sound of our own engine.   It didn’t look like it was moving, and appeared to be stationary in the sky, although I can’t say that positively because I was in a moving vehicle.  I looked at it intermittently for approximately 5-10 second! s. It didn’t look like it was connected to anything, however I figured it must be. Then we drove around a curve in the road and my view was obscured by trees and hillside.  This mountain area has a good amount of forest cover.  I remember wondering what it could be, and figured once we came around that curve it would be obvious what it was… I was expecting to see the ball connected to something else, maybe on a wire.  It didn’t look like a vehicle of any sort.  But once we were around the curve, maybe 10 seconds later, it wasn’t anywhere to be seen.  I was looking all over, as best as I could while driving, but didn’t see it anywhere. Before I could say anything about it, my son commented about how he had seen a shiny ball in the sky.  He had seen the exact same thing I did.  But like me, now he didn’t see it anywhere either.  We talked about it for a few seconds, then I pulled over to the next turnout on the road, and it happened to be a part of the road which came to an overlook for a huge valley.  We were mainly facing East, but we had a good view in all directions, due to the fact we were at a valley overlook.  There was no shiny metal sphere in any direction, nothing in the sky, nothing on the hillside in the trees.  No balloons, no helicopters. I’m willing to accept any logical explanation, but it didn’t look like anything I can think of, and the fact that it was up in the sky and then gone within a matter of seconds throws me off even more. I have no idea what it was, but “unidentified” certainly is an accurate description.",2015-06-05T00:00:00,34.2395,-116.8685

I stopped by the roadside to take a picture of it, and when I looked at the picture on my tracfone, I discovered this curious item up in the top left of the picture.  I did not see it at the time that I took the picture. It is an acorn shaped object, without the cap, and if you look closely you can see two short antennae sticking out the right hand side of the object, as well as a couple of dark spots on the front right, and a square light spot on the front left of the object. Unfortunately, no one was with me at the time, but I can assure you that this is not dust, snow, or water on the lens. I am going to email this picture to you, I find this to be rather curious, and I hope it helps you, if you find it worth noting. I’m sure this sounds bizarre, but I will note that I have been watching a very old house below where this picture was taken.  Every time I drive by, something seems different about the windows, curtains, and old stuff inside, which is partly visible from the road.  I had just mentioned to my grandson that I was considering that the house was either haunted or that somehow someone was inside even though there are no footprints or snow plow action around the house.  It probably has nothing to do with anything, but I thought you might be interested. Thank you for all you do.

We had several inches of fresh snow and it was still overcast, no stars or moon. I was pulling up to a red light (A) on US-31 at the Franklin/Whiteland town line, central Indiana, USA.  I was the only car at the intersection.  I was pulling up to the light, facing east and i noticed two lights right behind the tree tops off to my 1 o'clock, they didn't seem to be moving but i didn't think twice about it because sometimes planes seem to be standing still from the right angle.   I came to stop, checked it was clear and saw the two lights, white, steady on, still hadn't moved.  And i noticed they were pretty far apart, roughly a city block and tilted down to the (my) right maybe 20°.  I'm guessing ¼mi to ½mi. away(B).   I turned right on the red light, eyes now glued to the lights looking for distinction.  As i moved south down US-31 a third light came in to view to the right of the first two.  Nearly the same! distance apart it appeared, it was also white but flashed red at a little faster than once per second.  I drove nearly a quarter mile, under the speed limit, rolling down the window, turning off the music and heat, and staring.   I pulled over (C) realizing how unsafe i was being, silently watching, as it remained static, pitched, for around two full minutes.   At this point i had still not heard any noises that wasn't one of the ten cars that passed me the entire time or my jaw hitting the road outside.  After the approximate two minutes of watching three lights and hearing no sounds the aircraft leveled off allowing me to see the two white lights move together and reveal there was no further leading parts of the aircraft ahead of those points.  Straight across that edge.  After leveling it continued to pitch, this time to the NNW at maybe 10° and began moving, blunt edge first, in that direction.   I saw it start moving and threw my car into gear and zipped to the next pass thru in! the median watching it the best i could.  Still almost no traf! fic i wa s able to get going north bound before it got far.  It didn't leave quickly, just suddenly.  I'm having trouble estimating it's speed, it seemed to triple mine at the least, but not shockingly fast, no bright flash or anything.  I got turned around and up to 60mph+ and was looking at the tailing end of it. The craft never ascended or descended.  Remained just a few hundred feet off of the ground. I never saw any other lights, or heard any sounds.  Even though i was able to watch it from two different positions I never got a glimpse of its silhouette, just the shape of the three lights and the angle change when it pitched forward at the ""front"" before it left.  I followed the best I could, maybe 30 seconds watching the two steady white lights at the sides, and the white light flashing red centered right in between them, until it again faded behind the tree tops a few miles ahead of me in straight line(D).  I saw no other planes helicopters or crafts any time before or after.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,39.4835,-86.0478

There are no homes or businesses or lights in that area, as it is rather in the midst of foothills\mountains.  When I got home I unpacked the car and noticed the rather brilliant light was still in the (clear, cloudless) sky so I grabbed my HX300 20MP camera. Setting was on low light, sharp shoot, which reduces blur and noise automatically.  The camera has a built-in anti-shake function and a zoom of 50x, optical.  The photo’s were taken consecutively but with minor pause between frames as I rest my elbows on the hood of a car. The object was witnessed by another person up until just before the last shot at which point thereafter the object simply blacked out.  Having directly worked with many military and aviation designs, the key matter to me was the fact that there were no strobes or flashing lights about the object – strongly suggesting the object was not a standard military, private, or commercial type of aircraft. Through the lense, the object initially appears as a disc shape, then begins a morphing transition over time which resulted in observations unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed in the past.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,39.57104725274725,-119.67573992673994

I think you received the two reports because an old classmate of mine sent me your link after filing one and then asking me if I wanted to contribute.  Our experiences were different but I believe it was the same event or around that same time.  My father was a military contractor with the Iranian Air Force back then, and it was all the talk among his cohorts.  Dad was very much an unbeliever and wrote it all off to atmospheric conditions and the pilots' active imaginations.  I don’t go along with that, as from my point of view, the night was very clear, and I saw what I saw.  For me it was exactly what it was, an Unidentified Flying Object - no more, no less.

I hopped onto the wall that surrounded my home, from there up to my balcony and just before I opened the door to my room I heard the roar of afterburners overhead.  I looked up and saw an F-4 full throttle screaming across the sky above me.   Thinking war was about to happen, I hunkered down, but continued to watch as this jet fruitlessly tried to follow a darting light in the sky.  For the next 5 minutes or so I watched a light bounce and dart, like a pinball, around the sky while the Phantom doggedly tried to pursue.  From east to west, north to south they played a game of tag.  On afterburner, off afterburner, the plane was way more interesting to me than than its target.   The last view I had of the object it was chasing was when something split off from the light and dropped down, in the direction of the airport.  The F-4 hit  the gas, full afterburner, in that direction.   After a couple of minutes of silence, I gently opened the balcony door and crept back into my room hoping my parents were still asleep.

The trail(s) looked whitish blue.   Really weird, no noise, but a few minutes later there was a lot of wind (no wind before).   We were looking east and it seemed like it was headed south and ascending.  Finally disappeared into the cover of darkness after seven to twelve seconds, too fast to get it on camera...not enough time... unlike any unidentified object I have ever seen.

There also appeared to be 5-7 small grey or silver short  humonoids too the side or behind the taller creature  they at first looked to me like gnome like creatures  I don't em ember seeing eye color just that they were about 2-4 feet in height  with 2 arms 2 legs.  Unknow fingers or clothed.  Just solid grey color.  I noticed them first and my other passenger said it looks like signs on the road ahead.  As we got closer the outside environment stated to get very blurry like it looked felt like the trees bushes and side of road were shaking rapidly also the creatures seemed to be shaking or vibrating to I stopped the car cause I felt fear my passenger told me drive go go  The creatures seemed to be getting closer as if shaking vibrating towards us  I put Ford Explorer in reverse sped back about 30 feet to next side street turning down that street I made a right  and in front of me it was the same creatures like they just instantly appeared in front of us again I slammed on brakes and stopped there Now it gets very vague on what I can recall. I felt fear panic shock I rember thinking or saying get a picture take a video And so many thoughts of people believing me  worried about getting away it was frightening My next memory is almost a clip of me frozen in vehicle seeing one of the smaller grey creatures right outside my drivers door I had the feeling it was coming for me then I felt remember nothing everything seemed extremely calm peaceful  in what I thought was a blink of an eye I'm driving out of the rural range road and back towards town on paved road as I was driving back towards home I could only rember seeing red lights and some blurry stuff.

He only recalled seeing some strange red lights that were moving in front of us I told him what I remembered and he was shocked that he had forgotten it was like a total recall and  said he felt sick thinking bout it.

At this point I saw what I can only explain as a shimmer.  The rear most light shimmered as if someone put a fine cloth in front of it.

It was sometime after midnight on 04/09/15, when I was woken by a noise coming from my dining room area.  I have been leaving my dining room light set on dim for a couple nights because I have been seeing something or someone every night going across the dining room door, which is off my bedroom. My television was still on.  What I seen was someone that was transparent or translucent walking into my bedroom from the dining room.  This has not been the only time I seen this figure. I have a window light in the kitchen and a night light in the bedroom at the door.  I could see right through this figure and it was moving to the side of my computer cabinet after it passed my computer, I was not able to see it.  At this time every hair on my body stood up. My first sighting happened on Monday, 3/16/15.  My dog’s barking woke me up around the hours of 3a.m. and 3:30a.m.  I put my dog in the back bathroom which is on the other end of my house every night before I head to bed.  He has never barked during the night. I was not sleeping well because of his barking and when I am woken, I yell for him to shout up.  It happen the next time he barked, I happen to turn over and notice a person in a suit with a helmet on.  His face glowed and you could not make out any face futures.  The color of his suit was a light tan and glowed all over.  Once he notices me looking at him, he walked out of my bedroom.   ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he assures us that the sighting report is an honest account of what he remembers.  PD)) The hairs on my body stood straight up and I immediately got out of bed and walked into the dining room and no one is there.  I checked all doors and windows which they were locked.  I went back to the bedroom and couldn’t sleep. The next night on Tuesday, 3/17/15, in the morning hours between 3 a.m. to 3:30 a.m, again when I turned over in bed, I looked around towards the bedroom door and notice two men in suits standing there looking at me.  One was in the same color suit I seen the previous night and the other was in a red suit.  They notice me looking at them and both started walking out of the bedroom.  These guys were about seven feet tall and both uniforms were glowing lights and again, I could not make out their faces in the glass helmets.  Again I walked into the dining room and there was no one there.  I was really frighten now and did not know what was going on.  I did not go back to sleep for the rest of the night. Both times I slept during the day. Again on Wednesday, 3/18/15, I was too scared to go to sleep so I stayed awake for the longest until about 1a.m, I notice a figure of a person who was transparent and I could see right through him.  It was walking into my bedroom, around the room. I just froze right there in the bed looking to see if I could see him. I did not see anyone or anything afterwards. On Thursday, 3/19/15, around 2:30a.m., I was woke up and looked into my dining room because I heard a noise.  At once a bright white light flashed in the dining room and all at once my dog started barking.  I was too scared to get out of my bed to investigate it.  I made it through the night staying awake looking at television. On Friday night, 3/20/15, I thought I would bring the dog into the bedroom so he would alert me if something came into the bedroom.   Once in the bedroom I just went and closed and locked the bedroom door.  Around 3a.m. or there afterward, I had the bedroom light on and went to lay down to sleep, the dog started growling at the door.  He then walked and sniffed under the door, then came back to lie beside my bed. In closing, I do not understand what they want from me or targeting me.  I am tired of being frighten in my own home. I waited a couple days and tried to find out who I could report this too and found a website and filed a report. I have not heard back from the site.  They just did not respond to my telling this incident that really happened.  I cannot understand why someone I told this to will not believe me.  I am a Preacher at my Church and well known in the community.  I have nothing to hide or lie about.  I know it is going to happen again tonight. PLEASE!  I need your help. Rev.

((NUFORC Note:  We seriously question whether this is a serious report.  Source indicates he is a journalist, but he doesn't write with the skill we would expect of a professional writer.  PD)) Sitting in the hot tub at 10:25 pm Thursday night my wife and I notice a medium bright flash, about as bright as the brightest star out that night.  My wife, a major UFO skeptic, saw a flash overhead and south of us, about 10 degrees from vertical overhead.  I am a journalist and a trained skeptic, but a UFO buff.  About 5 seconds later it flashed again, but this time to the left of where it had been. A few seconds later it flashed again, about 25 degrees south.  There was no sound, and the flashes equaled the brightest star out at the time in the overhead sky.  The Big Dipper was visible to our 11 o'clock if facing south. The flashes were brighter than it.  Trying to determine what we were seeing, we ruled out what we knew:  There is an air traffic lane from Denver coming over the mountain range to the east, on approach to salt lake airport.  There is a life flight helicopter that makes frequent runs along the mountain range between spanish fork canyon and provo ho! spital.  There are occasional helicopters flying north and south to the west, either private or military, going to or from either spanish fork or provo airports or salt lake international, or military helis going to Hill AFB or camp Williams.  There is a park the next block south of us where Hobby planes are flown.  And one night a brightly lit UAV was flown "" dang, wasn't a UFO!"", we have seen satellites and shooting stars from our back yard. It was none of those. Aircraft may appear promising at first, but after a minute you can see their nav lights flashing regularly and they generally move along air traffic lanes. Another  flash caught our eye, at a 30 degree position, farther south. It flashed a little fainter, about as bright as the medium brightest star out, and flashed at random times 15-30 seconds apart, moving down to 50 degrees, left 15 degrees, left and up  about 10 degrees, then right 20 degrees and down, then right again, flashing dimmer and dimmer, we ! assumed it must be moving south while flashing consistently br! ight. Th ere was a slight amount of light pollution from downtown and a shopping center and walmart due east about two miles. There was minimal cloud cover, almost completely clear with one or two thin wispy clouds. I was staring directly overhead when a clear bright flash occurred in front of or through a cloud. None of the flashes seemed to close, all seemed to be far away. one appeared IN a cloud, lighting up the surrounding vapor like a headlight in a fog for a brief second. The flash appeared again to the right of the first position, moving by about 10 degrees. I did not see it again. The flashes seemed to be moving in general directions south, but not directly. Appearing randomly in clustered areas as they generally moved southward. The brightest 2 flashes overhead did not appear to have a general direction of travel. In January this year There were UFO reports over Duschesne county in the northeastern part of the state near Vernal, near where the famous Hardware Ranch is locat! ed. Within days at least 3 cattle mutilations were also reported, although news reports and police reports were pretty general and bland. Like they didn't want to say much about it. Cattle mutilations and UFO sightings, usually within the same time frames, have been frequent in this part of the state for 40 years or more.

We were sitting at a round table, I was facing out toward the city, and I could see most of the towers in the city.  I was visiting with my family and looking out at the buildings, when I saw a yellow/gold object kind of glide out from behind the tower I was looking at. The way it moved almost looked like it was floating on water or something as it came in and out of view from behind this skyscraper.  Just really smooth hovering, gliding, deliberate motion.  It was coming out from the left side of the building and going back behind it.  It never crossed to the other visible side of the building kept coming out the left side.  It did this over and over for a minute. The distance was a mile away I would guess.  It did not look very large.  This object did this for a couple minutes until another object came into view.  Almost looked like it appeared, or went from very small to visible, or like it came from far away into view to look just like the first one my family and I have been watching now for a few  minutes. Remind you, this rooftop was completely full, but I didn’t see anyone else looking at it, but we were.  The two objects stayed for another 30 seconds or so, kind of hovered around a bit until a 3rd object came down, almost like it was telling the other 2 to come back. I saw all three there for about 8 seconds, the third a bit smaller because it was further away, until all three took off.

UFO Rumors Swirls After Jamnagar Refinery Spots Mysterious Object UFO Rumors Swirls After Jamnagar Refinery Spots Mysterious Object Reuters.   According to reports, a red lighted object was found hovering in the sky on Jan 24.  Although the sighting was unusual, it did not trigger much anxiety until the same object was spotted circling around the same area three days after the first sighting.  The reappearance of the object left people and authorities little worried. The sighting of the object has been reported to the government as there was a report earlier that oil refineries including the one in Jamnagar are under threat from Lashkar-e-Toiba. ""On 24 January, 2013, around 8.30 pm, one unidentified bright object, perceived to be of the size of a volleyball, was seen hovering over the refinery.  It was seen to circle four times before disappearing,"" RIL executive director P M S Prasad wrote to Petroleum Minister M Veerappa Moily, reported The Indian Express. ""It could have been treated as a one-off occurrence, however the morning of 27 January again witnessed the same phenomenon between 6.30 and 7.00 am. Process cameras installed in the refinery caught some images.""  The refinery has managed to capture the images of the object in the second time.  Prasad has also asked Moily to take this matter further to the defense and home ministries. He wrote, ""Local forces and capabilities are ill-equipped to deal with high-technology air-borne assaults, should anyone try and attempt them.""  According to the police, a complaint has been filed and the security officials are on high alert.  ""Immediately after a complaint was lodged by the refinery at Meghpar police station, army and air force officials visited the spot along with us.  There are various theories going the rounds, but we are on high alert.  There were even reports of finding some unidentified particles and batteries near a cement factory, 150-km away from here,""  The Business Standard quoted a police officer as saying. The photos and footage have been sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) for further observation.  Security has been beefed up at the refinery and nearby places after the sighting was reported",2015-03-13T00:00:00,,

It was in late September early October when I witnessed this event. Me and a friend where sitting outside when I seen what appears to be 2 single lights.  The lights where off in the distance but the way they were moving immediately struck me as odd..they were positioned cade corner from eachother .by the way they were moving in a way that caught my eye..I asked my friend what he thought they were and we watched the lights for about 5 minutes..we both threw out suggestions of what we thought it was..my best description was that it moved like a helicopter. After watching for a few minutes and calling my brother to come look at what we were looking at the 2 lights that appeared close to eachother a moved one left one right in a blink of an eye to either side of the sky.. My brother was spooked and went inside in a hurry.me and my friend stayed outside ..The lights were now accross the sky from eachother..The one that moved to the left appeared to be coming in our direction.the one that went to the right was farther from us and our attention was on the one nearest... We watched this single white light come closer at a very low speed.i couldn't see any shape at this point but from the way it moved and how low it was flying I knee something was very odd. Keep in mind.i do live by an airport and see planes all the ttime and never seen one move this wsy..The movement was more of a hover.the speed was very slow. we could tell it was coming towards the area we were at.i don't know the exact distance it was from us but it was getting closer and closer and we still didn't hear any noise coming from the object. My friend was then spooked and tries to run inside .I grabbed his arm and asked him to wait with me .We stood there another minute and it was getting closer to the point where I agreed and we both ran inside. As soon as I get inside my curiosity just starts eating at me and I ran back outside .I look towards where I last seen the object.nothing there.i look straight up in the sky and it was directly above me. It was a triangle shaped aircraft.i didn't see the white light anymore but red lights that lined the front in a v shape.the rest of the craft was pitch black. My parents property is is a little over an acre and this craft looked every bit larger ..it seemed to be so low I could throw a rock at it.it was completely silent and moving at a low speed.i was in shock or awe from what I had seen. One thing that I still don't understand is why I didn't see it fly away.i forget if I ran back inside or what I did.my mind was running a thousand mph it seemed. I just remember looking back up at it and didn't see it any more.there was no noise or vibration for me to look in its directiom.it was just gone. I started talking to the neighbors right after this took place when 2 jets with huge spotlights .I mean lights that lit up the land huge ,started flying in a big circle around this area. Never has anyone heard jets that loud fly so low or jets with massive spotlights on them around here. This was definitely an odd occurance.i mean those jets were odd due to the fact that no one has seen those either but the triangle shaped craft that flew directly over my mom's house without a sound was scary odd.it was like watching a paper airplane in the air.not a noise.

There were more and more over the next few minutes so I grabbed my telescope to get a closer look.  There were about 12 objects total floating within about 15° of each other.  They were all clearly the same design, definitely not natural, but looked like nothing I’ve ever seen. I am a four year Air Force veteran and have been obsessed with flight my whole life and these were nothing I’ve ever seen before.  The finish was white and highly reflective.  They were crescent shaped with sharp points on opposite ends and what appeared to be a disc shaped center.  Over the next approximately 10 minutes, one of the objects, clearly larger than the others, moved directly north of my location and rapidly descended, disappearing behind my neighbor’s house.  My wife grabbed out camera and we captured them as best as we could with the equipment, a Nikon D60 with a stock lens.  They slowly disappeared to the NE and at about 3:10pm one was spotted directly east, flying very quickly, level with the horizon from north to south.  There were at least two commercial aircraft flying in the vicinity and provided a clear distinction that these were not typical aircraft. The pictures don’t do what we saw justice.

It was pretty overcast, but the clouds were solid and flat so it was like a grey background.  It was still pretty light out, light enough for me to have shades, which I removed when we got where we were going.   The people I was with had decided to stop the truck at this random campsite and we all got out.  I was just kind of standing there by the fire, not really paying attention to anyone, just looking around the campground, since I hadn't been over to the field before then.  I looked behind me and saw this really bright red/orange light coming from the southwest headed northeast.   I turned around and thought, ""Wow, that's a really bright light.""  Of course I thought it was a plane and that I was just standing at the perfect angle for it to look so bright.  What the hell else could it be but a plane?  It was as bright as a flare from a flare gun when its brightest. I'd say it was a good 10 miles out from me coming directly towards me.  The light never flickered nor did it blink at all.   So I turn to one of the guys that I came with and say, ""Kevin. Look at that light. Is that a plane?""  He looks for a few seconds and says, ""Yeah, it's a plane.""  He's apparently done with it because he turns back to his conversation.  Now, I watched this thing approach for a good three minutes.  Three minutes is a damn long time from the time I saw it first.  Had it been a plane, it would have flown over us and been gone LONG before this point.   I noticed it when it was probably ten miles out.  It was at about 5000 feet or so, pretty low, and got to within, I'd say, a couple miles and did this extremely slow turn to the south.  The red light was gone.  That's when I got a really good look at it.  There was not a single light on it.  None.  It was a black shape against the grey sky and it seemed sort of octagonal.  I say seemed because that's just how it kinda felt.  Not sure if that makes sense, but... No flashing lights, like ALL planes are required to have.  No lights AT ALL.  I didn't see any type of wings, nor a tail fin, landing gear, nothing.  It was moving WAY slower than any plane could and it took the turn to go south in a much tighter arch than a plane could.  Not a 90 degree angle, but at least a forty degree angle.   I watched the thing for a good 5 to 7 minutes. I was waiting for lights to come on, that maybe it really was some kind of plane and it had lost power or something, but nope.  It cruised serenely across the sky.  There was no sound of any kind and the only music was way on the other side of the field, so if it had been any kind of plane, I would've heard it.  It was close enough that everyone would've heard a plane.   I was so tripped out it didn't even occur to me to ask for someone's phone.  Mine was on the charger in my tent, of course.  It was like watching a train wreck or a tornado.  I was just freaked.  I could only stand there with my mouth hanging open until I couldn't see it anymore.  It was NOT a plane.  It was not a drone, at least not one I've ever seen or could find on the Internet, and if it was, what the hell was it doing cruising over the middle of nowhere Wisconsin?  It was not a weather balloon.  It was not a Go-Pro.  It's course was far steadier than a plane and much slower.  I say steadier because it was almost as if it were moving on a ruler edge.  Straight as hell.  Also, a plane would fall at that slow of a speed. It was not a stealth bomber; it had no wings or tail fin.  I simply do not know what it was. Period.

As the three moved North I noticed a round object in around the same area as I surmised the jets were moments before. The object itself was not a jet as the object was pretty much stationary except for an obvious wobble and moved slightly to the South and then back to it's original position.   Also, I surmise the object was not a jet as it left no contrail and was maybe three times the size of the jets.  The jets to the naked eye were about the relative size of an ant while the object was about the relative size of a large silver dollar.  The object itself was round and very shiny. If you were to hold a silver dollar at arms length and point it at the sky then that is what the object looked like.  It was very distinct against the setting sun and very clear. I could tell that this was not clouds! , smoke, an after image, a planet, or anything I could easily identify.  A common problem with sky watching around the Dartmouth and Halifax area is the prominence of air traffic due to the proximity of the local airport.  This object had no lights or any identifying markers that one would normally see with a common passenger air plane. After watching the object for about a minute and a half I wanted to get my girlfriend so she could see it too.  I opened the door to go inside and noticed that coming from the South, moving the same direction in the same path, was another jet with an obvious contrail.  I immediately looked for the object and the object was gone.  I did not see it leave. Later on in the night, I went outside for another cigarette with the hope of sighting the object again.  Instead I saw three more jets traveling the same direction and same path as the original four. Again I assume they were jets based on the contrails. I assume that if it was a true physical object then it must have been seen by those in the jets - maybe not the first three but the fourth one must have seen it.",2015-05-22T00:00:00,44.67892469512195,-63.55159817073171

I saw two stars that were close together, kind of similar colors, and I admired their beauty.  Then, I noticed one was kind of moving away from the other... Which stars don't do...  So I kind of laughed at myself for mistaking something for a star and continued my breathing techniques.  So I started wondering what it could be..  Maybe a satellite?  As I continued to ponder the that, I noticed it was flying towards my apartment building.  I was confused. It seemed to be flying lower now... And it was a grayish ship with a big white light and a tiny red one.  I remember it had a pointy cockpit looking thing? It was kind of in the  shape of a bird with a box for a body and without wings.  It had a long neck and then the head, which I thought was probably the cockpit.  I tried taking a video but my memory is full from all the spotify I download. &#128547;&#128516; anyways, I was really sure what I was seeing and wanted to record information that I could review later.  So I tried taking pictures.  Nothing showed up. I saw for a total of about 10-15 minutes total.  I was staring at it when I thought it was a star, because all I could see was the bright light and it was low on the horizon near a bright star (from my perspective).  Then it moved I towards me and flew over my building. It kept going.  I tried calling my mom to run to the front of te apartment facing the way in which the ship flew but she was in the elevator at the time coming in from smoking a cigarette and was not able to see it. When I went to look out our bay window but nothing was flying. I believe in UFOs and believe they can connect us through astral projection(in which case a ship would be unnecessary), but I am a scientist at mind and need more evidence to validate my personal experience.  I hope others report seeing at around 5/15/15 1:20am.  It was a weird shape..  And it didn't make a sound.

On an August night between 9-10 P.M. 1998 in Shawnee mission Meriam, Kansas, three friends and I witnessed something we cannot explain. It was a summer night and we were hanging out on top of an elementary school roof, next to an apartment complex one of our friends lived at. Across from the school on the otherside of a sewer drainage ditch there was a Hardeys and Perkins restaurant, and over in the next parking lot was a retirement home highrise. We were on top of the School roof when we saw this bright light come up over behind us and continue on over to the upper floor windows of the retirement home highrise,  Our first thought was that it was a police helicopter.  All we could really see was the bright light and was hard to make out any real shape but it reminded me of the spotlights I'd seen from police helicopters, but it just hovered around the upper level windows of the retirement home. Then it seemed to spot us and it came down closer to us and concentrated its light on us I thought that the police would be yelling at us on their loud speaker to get off the roof of the school or tell us that we were in some kind of trouble, but then after shining its light on us for a few seconds it suddenly shot up into the sky and darted around at speeds so fast it left streaks and trails of lightin the sky like nothing any of us had ever seen before. Then if came back down and shown its light on us again we were all stunned and in shock looking up at this object of light that we now realised was not a police helicopter. There was some sort of shape or mass behind the light like a helicopter but as to the exact size or shape was hard to make out. After probably about no more than 30 seconds after it came back down and was now shining its light on us I gotherd my thoughts and told everyone lets get out of here and we took off climbing off the roof and running across to our friends apartment complex, I remember after reaching it we could still see the object in the sky for a while Ive seen other stories on t.v. of U.F.O. around retirement homes and its made me wonder is there and connection between retirement homes and U.F.O. It seemed to deliberatly been going there before it saw us or so it seemed. After it saw us and then darted around we knew this was nothing we had ever seen before and had no explanation for all I can say is we saw a U.F.O.

My friend 1st noticed the craft to the northeast, and asked what it was.  When we first saw the metallic cigar shaped craft, it appeared to be about a mile away, moving toward us steadily and slowly.  Not knowing the object's size, I'm just guessing at these distances. It got to a distance that appeared to be about 400ft.  It looked like it was rather large, like could have been the size of the Goodyear blimp.  The shape was not ""blimp-shaped"", more cigar & shiny, possibly surrounded by a haze, but it may have been sun glare of the craft's shiny exterior.  Again I do not know how big it was, nor the exact distances. As we pointed out the craft to the others they came over toward us.  At this point the craft just stopped and hovered.  There was no sound, no wind, just the shiny object floating. We all agreed that we had no idea what we were looking at.  I asked my son to fetch the binoculars.  As he ran back to the house the object stayed, when he started running back with the binoculars the craft flew away silently, steadily, and rapidly to the northeast until we could no longer see it.",2015-04-30T00:00:00,,

They were silver-colored craft that flashed colors of green, red, blue and yellow, like flashing strobes.

The houses are single-storey. They appeared to be perhaps metallic, reflecting the setting suns light. Their flight was bird-like, and I consciously blinked to make sure I was actually seeing what I was seeing. Their paths crossed and they veered North as they passed just to my left as I faced North. I estimate their height above ground to be 100 - 150 feet, above the tallest treetops, which are about 60 feet. I estimate the objects size to be about two feet along the long axis. They also proceeded sideways by which I mean the flight was not like a "" tight spiral"" of a skillfully thrown football. The sky was clear and the planet Venus was just becoming visible. It was still T-shirt weather. I told my wife and she thought it no surprise with the Air Force base a mere mile away and with their mission possibly going to an all-drone base, this might not have been unusual. However, these objects were in no way aircraft or bird shaped. They emitted no sound and seemed only to reflect light with the dull orange glow.

Staring at the flying object I was in doubt whether it is a balloon or plane or at least a flying toy of a child playing near around.  As it is got closer I saw a  light shining at the top of it like the reflection of the sunlight from the surface  of a metal.  But what was strange is that the object was rotating or it is  better to say that it was tumbling while getting closer and closer. It wasn’t in a standard shape with a whole body in total white. I found out  that it wasn’t an ordinary flying object.  After 20 seconds it had an altitude of  almost 1 km and a distance of about 100 or 200 m from my standing  position, when it realized my existence.  Due to my bad luck it changed its direction to south east and slowly gained altitude to reach the top. In my  estimation in the nearest point within me reach the object had the diameter of a ball. I came down to come up with a camera so quickly. When I returned it had  reached an altitude of about 3 km at that direction.  It started to circle  around with three sudden jumps, then the object went up and up and got  disappeared in the clouds.  Each time the wind moved the clouds I took a  photo from the unveiled flying object.  Meanwhile I got aware of a second flying object with an altitude higher than the previous one in a stationary  state.  That wasn’t clear enough to be watched.  After about 4 min they  gained altitude again and moved toward northeast along the clouds.  1 hour  later it was almost impossible to sight them clearly. One day later in 23.1 at about 11.30, I went to the roof once again with a  camera.  After 5 minutes of searching the sky, surprisingly a white shining  object took my attention at my left side.  It was moving from northeast to  northwest with a high speed in a straight line with an altitude of 200 m in a  distance of about 400–500 m.  while I was turning my camera on (after 5  second) it completely stopped and just in one second I saw the object above the mountain like a bolt out of blue.  It means that just in 1 second  the object has made an unbelievable jump 1 km above the mountain or I have a made an optical illusion. At that moment, I doubt deeply of my observation, if I hadn't took a photo a day before I eat several narcotic tablets with three day of staying in bed talking to nobody.  Anyway after the jumps the object stopped for seconds  while it was suspending.  Then it started to circle around upward like a day  before and jumped for several times to be leveled with the clouds.  I got  shocked.  I was totally confused.  I turned the camera on but before I could  zoom on, it gradually paled and disappeared completely. For the third time in 27.3.2015 around 11 or 12 pm, I was about to see  another case moving again from the southwest to the northwest with a high  speed.  But it wasn't recognizable anymore and passed above our house in a completely strange and unpredictable line from those of which observed  a day before.  The point is that a white translucent light was at the top of the  object.  In addition its motion in a crinkle way accompanied with increasing  in altitude, periodically.",2015-04-23T00:00:00,,

Cloud cover was 100% with no breaks in the clouds.  It was not raining at the time at my location.  There were no stars or planets visible, nor was the moon.

It was white in color and would dim slightly and then brighten in a pulsating rhythm with an occasional green flash at the bottom of the light.  It hovered in the same spot, not moving at all.  I called my boyfriend outside to see it and he watched it for a few minutes, but had no idea what it could be.

Sky Watchers, Hello, my name is ((male's name deleted)).  On Saturday morning May 2nd, 2015, while on my way to see a friend near Soddy Daisy, TN, in Hamilton County.  While driving on Sequoyah Access Road at approximately 9:25 – 9:26 A.M. E.S.T. an object flying at an extremely high speed flew from behind my right shoulder position past me going due south.  The object I’m estimating was approximately at an altitude of 5000 Ft AGL, it clearly wasn’t at any course altitude that typically commercial airliners often fly; 25,000 to 38,000 feet, nor was it just a few hundred feet above the tree tops that military fighter jets fly during booming training flights.  The weather was beautiful with a clear blue sky, and the air temperature was cool, around 45–50 degrees.  Other words, no fog or smog was in my field of view.  The sun was bright, but not in view of my vision as I was driving in a southerly direction on this slightly curvy road which does change directions.  The sun was to my left, but not high enough in the sky to be seen at that point above the tree tops.  However, since there were no reference points in the sky and no way of knowing the size of this object, the altitude of 5000 feet AGL is truly an estimate.  But please keep in mind it was very clear to see even though this event happened extremely fast.  In fact, I had to process in my mind what I was seeing very fast.  My first thought was a day time meteor sighting, but this had no burning trail behind it and the object looked to be silver in color. My next thought that went racing through my mind it was a section of the Russian space rocket that failed and was falling to earth or some other space craft.  I thought, oh God this is going to crash in Georgia or Alabama and could kill someone.  But, no burning trail, no smoke, no fire!  My next and final thought was I had just seen either a super secret space craft from our government or some other government or a UFO not from this planet.  I don’t know what I saw, but wh! atever it was, it was real!  It was silver in color or it look! ed silver because the sun ray’s was hitting it.  It flew across the sky at an extremely high speed.  My view time was 1.6 to 2.0 seconds. It looked to be either a; Disk, Sphere, or maybe even a SUV shape object.  From approximately 5000 feet away, and with my angle from the earth to the object in the sky, and at that extreme speed, I truly don’t know what shape it was.  On Saturday May 2nd, 2015; I did watch the evening Chattanooga and national news, I heard no mention of any falling objects from space.  On Tuesday morning; May 5th,2015 I revisited this area along the road I traveled Saturday morning May 2nd, 2015, and took photos of my sight of view and timed the event as best as I could envision the event as it happened.  I worked from 1986 – 2001 as a Motions, Methods, Time Study Analyst.  I’ve had a life long interest in aviation and model aviation.  Currently, I work in insurance.  I’m licensed in Tennessee as a Health, Life, Accident Agent and a Crop Insurance Loss Adjuster. Would the FAA release any radar data for that morning in the Chattanooga area to you?  If others living in south east Tennessee or northern Georgia seen this object, I hope they too will report their sighting. Be it from plant earth or beyond.  It was real!!!  It was there!!!  I never seen anything move that fast!!!    Thanks,  ((",2015-05-08T00:00:00,,

I sent him running for the camera and caught a few pictures of the second one.  Not long after that, a jet (with a contrail) could be seen chasing after them.

There were no clouds in the sky where these object passed by.  The duration was only about 5 minutes. The object must have been a long ways up as the image pixels start to distort the object some when really zoomed in.  Before the image gets too distorted, the object's body can be described as horizontally cylindrical and gray metallic color.  There are no strobe lights as most aircraft have.  The tail section has a bulge on the upper side and the tail wings are attached to the side and top of the cylinder body, like a missile. There is a strange black object on the underside.  In one picture, the black object is under the nose, while in another, the black object is under the mid section.  It is very hard to say that the object has wings, but there is a different coloration at the mid section of the object.  While the rear of the object is in generally good focus so you might say it has tail wings,  It is strange that the objects wings at the mid point of the craft are not clear.

Reflective and bright white to completely clear (invisible). Saturday, May 30th, 2015,  	Just to start off…  It was a warm day with a clear blue sky.  I was sitting facing somewhat South?  The object was moving South-West. 	I went out to the backyard to have a smoke on the porch.  After lighting my cigarette, I was just looking out over the street and saw what I first thought was a strip of cloth floating down across the street.  After a few seconds of examination, as it was falling slowly (swaying), its appearance was as such; really large, thin, kinda flimsy, kinda heavy, almost belt shaped, yellowish clear with burn marks on it, mica mineral-esque, kind of metallic?  But with cloth like properties.   Anyhow, I watched as it drifted downwards across the street and over the house next door.  My first thought was, “that was weird,” and then I began thinking, “Where the hell could that have come from anyway?  Where could that have fallen from?”  I considered the angle, and it appeared to be falling in a way that it was much too heavy to have been picked up by the wind at all (there was only a slight breeze), as it was just drifting downwards.  My next thought was, “well whatever, that is just weird.” 	  I then started looking at the clouds, a few seconds after seeing the weird metallic/mica/cloth/burnt thing.  Immediately catching my eye was an incredible bright object a ways off in the sky overhead.  My first thought was, “wow that’s a shiny plane.”  hah But it wasn’t shaped like a plane, and it immediately stopping reflecting light.  I thought I lost sight of it, but then it suddenly got extremely bright again.  To compare it to something, I’d have to say it was like just the bright spot on a mirror where it’s reflecting concentrated rays of light.  I didn’t think it was weird, as I thought it may just be a plane catching light at a certain angle while spinning or something.   Then as it continued forward (still suddenly really brightly reflecting then not being visible), I realized it wasn’t flying like a plane should fly either; it was kind of dipping down and then back up, and then down, and back up, in the same pattern (you know how they animate planes in cartoons that suddenly run out of gas and putter down and back up; kind of like that), but it was more skipping like a stone across the water.   So, now my brain is processing seeing a strange flying object that suddenly gets really bright and then invisible while skip-flying. It wasn’t like a plane diving down and back up. It was more like a wave riding, hopping motion.  Anyway, I immediately decided, “that can’t possibly be a plane, because it doesn’t look like a plane (doesn’t have much shape at all); it’s not spinning or twisting at all or doing anything in any way to reflect light so intensely in that very consistent pattern…” It couldn’t have been a balloon either, as there was no wind and it was moving quickly and everything else I have and will describe.  A balloon could not ascend and descend that quickly either, especially in that consistent pattern.   Its hopping/skipping/dipping pattern made me think of that of an extremely large bird with an extremely large wingspan; the way that the b! ody of the bird would dip as it thrusts its wings up and then ! down, but a slightly extended duration at great speed.  For a split second, I thought it might even be a really large bird, because of that, but it obviously was not a bird.  Birds do not shimmer, or turn invisible, or flap without wings, and they aren’t larger than planes, and aren’t shaped like weird squashed oval triangles.  It did not have wings or any specific shape.  The object also made no noise at all, and it didn’t leave any contrails, despite its speed.  I forgot to mention that the craft had no lights on it, other than the reflected bright white, and it wasn’t any other color but clear and bright white light.  It didn’t have any appendages or anything either. The object wasn’t aflame or anything.  It was just really extremely bright white reflected light. After blinking my eyes a couple times for a second something odd happened.  The object was apparently so bright that when closing my eyes it created the spot that you get after looking directly at a bright light (even though it had only been a few seconds).  This gave me a good idea of the shape of the “craft” I suppose.  It was like a stretched oval, kind of like a squashed very rounded obtuse triangle.  The shape was hard to discern as it became so bright. The surface appeared pure white, which is I’m guessing because of the crafts reflective properties. I have no idea.  I watched this skipping bright then invisible object for a couple minutes until it got to a good distance away. It was moving much faster than a plane at the height that it appeared to be. Another thought I had while I thought it might be a plane, before I noticed everything about it, was that it wasn’t heading down! . The first couple of skip/dips I thought might be plausible for a plane in turbulence that was suddenly damaged (though the sky was clear and no wind), but the pattern was exactly the same every time and the vanishing + reflecting really bright without spinning obviously made it clear that it wasn’t a plane. There was also no smoke or anything. It didn’t have a plane shape, and it was a consistently skipping/dipping really bright then invisible non-descending object. I’m super guessing that it was maybe about 2-5 miles up in the air. This was so astoundingly different and unexplainable that I actually wanted to report it on the national UFO sighting website. It happened. I saw it. Something presumably fell off of it and landed a few houses away (which there is no way I’m going to knock on my neighbors door down the way and ask if they have the weird metallic mica mineral like material that fell near their house). Afterwards, as I snuffed my cigarette out in the dirt, I jus! t thought, “Whatever, like the other random weird things peopl! e see in the sky; I’ll just ignore it and go about my day. Unexplained stuff happens sometimes and I’m not going to jump to conclusions or get all tin foil hat about it.” Anyway, I thought it was over, I was just going to ignore it and whatever. I went back inside and got on my desktop computer. After about 15 minutes….. Something happened. A loud BOOF shockwave like sonic boom sound and the house rattled. The power immediately went off. The pressure and the sound came from the direction that the unidentified skip/hop-flying bright then invisible thing was going. The power went out everywhere. 5 minutes after that there was another smaller pressure wave sound sonic boom-like thing from the same direction. It didn’t sound like an explosion. Both sounded like…. I don’t know.... BUFF or BOOF? Haha Like a massive highly pressurized air pocket the size of a few football fields burst a few miles away? It’s hard to explain. Some of these details may sound like a hot air balloon, but in no way could a hot air balloon do exactly what I saw, or be made of the material that came from it, or create the massive BOOF (that’s what I’m calling it now) and sh! ockwave that turns off electrical devices.  Everyone was outside asking one another if their power went out and whether they saw anything.  Everyone was looking around for smoke and checking all the transformers. None of them had blown. After about another 8-15 minutes, the power came back on of its own volition. The outage was reported to the local electric company and I checked their outage map. A couple thousand reported people in this area of the city were affected and a few stretching outwards from the direction of the BOOF. There were more concentrated outages closer to the direction of the wave. There aren’t any large transformers that power everyone around here in that direction that I know of. This was written within a few hours of them happening. The events transpired at some time between 3:20 pm and 5:50 pm. It is now 9:31 pm. The electricity company reports that the cause of the outage is unknown and still under investigation. All these unexplained concurrent events could just be highly unlikely coincidences. Murphy’s law, so whatever I guess? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2015-06-05T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

The house is located in Sullivan, Maine. The sky was clear and air temperature was in the single digits F, with no wind. They heard a whooshing noise, and all looked up and saw a circular object (perfectly spherical), bright white, with a close halo of bright yellow flames, moving north to south, coming from over their house at an estimated altitude of probably more than 300 feet, and probably less than 1000 feet. The brightly lit object's luminance overpowered the stars or any planets which might have been visible directly overhead. It was moving slowly, approximately 50 to 100 mph estimated (this speed is slower than a typical small plane, though similar to a helicopter).  No ""airplane"" or ""helicopter"" sounds were heard. The object, having first appeared directly overhead over the house, as the three stood near the house, came in toward the ground to the south on a curving trajectory.  The three witnesses saw this object for 7 to 10 seconds.  One witness described the object as sized larger than his hand if he held his hand up to try to block out the view of the object in the sky.  His estimate of the actual size ranges from that of a softball to the size of a basketball, but no larger. The object did not appear to ""maneuver"" but it did make a ""whump"" as well as a loud ""sizzle/pop"" when it sounded as if hitting the deep snow-covered ground directly to the south of the house, and it must have landed in deep woods, not in an open field, so the actual impact at ground level was not visible to the witnesses. The male witness believed that due to the dense woods, the object's light would not be visible at ground level if the light had somehow continued shining rather than being snuffed out by the impact.  The male witness estimated that the object must have landed perhaps 200 feet to 500 feet from the house, in dense forest.  This location is at least 50 feet or 200 feet into the adjacent property to the south. Due to the fact that the landing area is owned by a large landowner who is extremely prohibitive of any trespassing, and does not welcome any foot traffic on his land whatsoever, the male witness does not believe he can get permission to enter the property to look for the landing site and the object, even though it may be within merely a few hundred feet of the house. All three witnesses have agreed they heard the object ""whoosh"" overhead, and all agreed they heard the object hit the snow-covered ground, with a ""whump"" sound and ""popping"" or ""sizzling"" sound.  The male witness was reminded of popcorn popping also when the object hit.  The ""flames"" or rays emanating from the object would only have been short, perhaps a few inches.  These ""flames"" were evenly distributed all around the perfectly round (spherical) object as it traveled overhead (the front flames were not swept backward).  The white central round area had no visible variations within it, but the object was presumed to be spherical. No media, police, FAA, or airports have been contacted as yet in regard to this sighting.  A proxy is used to report this to NUFORC, as the three actual witnesses have not agreed to report anything and have not agreed to identify themselves, at least not at this time.  If the proxy can get permission in future, it may be possible to provide identification of the three witnesses to this event.  (Flight radar systems may show some tracking of this object and need to be checked ASAP.)  This was a low-flying atmospheric object which could have been an extreme hazard to passenger or military aircraft.  Location of sighting is on the coast of the Gulf of Maine, directly south of Bangor International Airport, Bangor, Maine. No recovery or investigation on the adjoining property for this object has been initiated yet due to lack of permission from the property owner.  It is highly unlikely permission would be granted if asked.  If any future permission is gained and if a search is done, more information will be provided to NUFORC.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,44.5404,-68.2186

This occurred just beyond CR21. I was on the porch (open type) looking to see if there were any lightening storms that might be seen coming our way as I like to take photos of lightening.  It was cloudy but puffy clouds that had openings or space between them. Something made me look up and I saw something that looked like flat black metal coming very slowly cruising above the clouds.  I saw it for about 2 minutes as it came out of one cloud and into another.  I could not believe an airplane could fly that low and have absolutely no sound.  No sound at all and no lights unless they were on top of the ship but I didn't see any beams of light in the clouds. i thought it must have been huge because I saw a large section of this ship and there was not one bolt or screw to be seen.  Yes it was low enough that I would have seen that. It dawned on me then what it probably was.  I looked out by hanging over the porch railing to see if I could see where it was going and what shape it was.  That was when I realized it was coming back towards me, from the other end of our long porch.  I thought to myself how could such a big ship turn around that fast.  I then got very nervous and stepped away from the railing of the porch to the side of the house, waited about four minutes and looked again.  It was gone. I realized only later that duh an alien ship probably does not have any screws or bolts if their ships are of high technology like the experts say.  So it may not have been as big as I thought but it sure scared me.  I don't go out on the porch anymore if those puffy clouds with space between them are up above us.  My dog was very nervous and panting and I thought she felt a lightening storm coming. After the ship disappeared, she eventually calmed down.  I also had my camera with me but I was so floored by what I saw initially and then becoming frightened,  I didn't take any photos and have been kicking myself about that since then.

I was leaving work late one night with my girlfriend (at the time) and another friend—we worked in a performance theater, and had finished a show. It was around ten at night.  As we were preparing to get into the car, I happened to be facing the North-Western sky. My girlfriend also had a general view of that sector, but the other friend was distracted and looking elsewhere.  The sighting lasted no more than a second. Very suddenly, I see a light zoom over us in a north-westerly heading (I couldn’t discern any sense of a body—just a light as if from an afterburner).  I judged its distance from its trajectory:  it wasn’t travelling “across the sky” but very perceptibly forward. Also, the size of the light subtended the same amount of area as, say, a golf ball held at arm’s length (as it passed overhead).  These observations together led me to believe that it was relatively close to the ground-at least within 500 - 1000 feet.  That’s just the sense that I have, judging by how it moved across my field of view.  I didn’t feel like it was very far above us (not as far as a helicopter would be, for example). Its speed seemed notable:  it appeared and disappeared within less than a second, which, given I had a clear line of sight for quite a distance, is remarkable. The color of the light (or afterburner) was also notable: I remember it being not orange but a pale blue/green. Perhaps the most notable aspect of this sighting was the sound—or lack of it.  As it passed over us, I heard no sound.  Not an engine, not even the sound of a body moving quickly through the air.  Even a commercial airliner can be heard from the ground at some heights. Judging how close this seemed from its trajectory, I was so surprised that there was nothing. The night was as silent as before it appeared. After the quick moment, I exclaimed to my friends. As hinted earlier, my girlfriend had also seen “something”, though my other friend had not been looking at the sky (and without a sound, there was no reason to look up).  My girlfriend didn’t know what to think of what she had seen—she would only ever say that, sure, she had seen something—I think she was less willing to attribute the sighting to anything and more comfortable with shrugging her shoulders. But I was surely confident that it was something extraordinary.  It may well have been just an advanced aircraft tested by the military, but it was certainly something you wouldn’t reckon you’d ever see.

A huge red light came on just left of center inside of the cf the craft. I was amazed to say the least, so was my friends. The light stayed on for several minutes then just went out.  There was several red lights on the object that weren't extremely bright like an aircraft would have and had only red lights no other colors. The object moved off to the left, our viewpoint was going to be blocked by a mountain so we ran towards it to get a longer look at the object.

Shape:  Disk  Duration:15-20 seconds **   Additional Details for Occurrence:  3/72015 20:40 hours  Reported:  3/9/2015  Posted: 3/13/2015**  The very next day, Sunday 3/8/2015, I was not at home, however my wife reported to me that she heard the very same intense noise occurrence’s twice, during the day while she was busy inside the house.  The first one at approx. 08:30 hours and a second one at approx. 13:20.  I asked her did she make it outside to see whether or not it may have been the same thing?  She stated the first time she heard it she was headed toward the front door to look but about half way there the noise diminished as quick as it came about but shook the house and rattled windows just the same as the night before. Then later in the afternoon the same thing, so she didn’t even bother and sure enough had she tried but due to not being that close to either the front or back door to the house she would have missed it.  Both occurrences this time would have been in broad daylight instead of after dark the evening before when she saw whatever this “perfectly round object” may have been in the sky.  What has really played upon my mind was when this first occurrence woke me up out of a sound sleep as stated, sounding like a jet air liner flying way too low for whatever reason.  The distinct high pitched sound of jet propelled turbine engines and of course the intense noise of something really cooking through the air. It wasn’t until I read another report from this web site which occurred on 3/6/2015 from Conroe, Texas, (the very day before) where the author apparently familiar as a former Navy cryptologist writes about the “Alert/Intercept single pilot Fighter Jet deployed in full afterburner” maneuvering through Houston IAH Airspace as such to gain maximum speed. That an alert exercise would not happen right through the holding pattern of Houston IAH.  I take that to mean holding patterns of two significant airports that I know of in Houston, Bush International and William P. Hobby including what air traffic still coming and going from Ellington Field Air Force Base in South Houston and several other smaller private airports in the surrounding area.  What little I know about the reported sightings of these unidentified flying “disk shaped” objects is usually they are silent.  At best some sort of low pitched humming sound if that? Which perhaps explains what I heard, my wife heard and saw and perhaps what she as well, didn’t see?  Could this have been the case regarding this ground shaking noise (jet engines)?  One or more of our “fighter jets” that for whatever reason my wife didn’t or couldn’t see, perhaps perusing or attempting to  this “perfectly round object” with the two red lights with a single bright white one in the middle as described in my original report? All kinds of questions arise in my mind as to just what the heck was this particular event? If this was the case then why couldn’t she see any jet in addition to when s looked up just in time to see its approach, then straight up as it flew directly overhead as “it then took off out of sight like a shooting star” regarding speed, sight, sound, everything to do with it, gone with in a split second! In attempts to rationalize the distinct sound of a jet engine winding down or up could this craft have perhaps been jet powered itself? Or if there was a fighter jet in pursuit it would seem logical enough reason for the distinct sound of jet turbines associated with it? Very plausible if it came in from the Gulf, which would have been in the same direction it came from and just a few miles away as “the Crow/or a disk in this case, flies” and basically took off as described, leaving any type of jet far, far, behind in an instant? What now stands out is why couldn’t a jet engine still be heard afterwards until fading in the distance in going away from a stationary position on the ground?  There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind what so ever that my wife did not see, exactly what she described. Of which I failed to mention, even though the lighting conditions was dark the sky itself in the area we live was light enough to distinguish the difference in the configuration between a low flying air plane, helicopter, or as in this incident this blacked out perfectly round disk with the exception of said lights up front which may have assisted her in seeing the thing at all. Now she wishes she hadn’t seen it as she remained perplexed for a few days like I did upon seeing what I saw on 05-04-12 while on my way to work (a spectacular light show of these multicolored to white and ! then orange light orbs) one night and knows now how I felt for quite some time in trying to figure out what I saw and still to this very day. Upon checking back with this website (N-UFO Reporting Center) in seeing my report was posted regarding a 03/07/2015 Santa Fe, Texas sighting, I noticed the following reports of sightings reported also in the same general geographical area and close proximity to each other  within one day plus apart. Note to Director of NUFORC: Please feel free to edit or not even post at all due to length. I will also include additional contact numbers in the proper fields of report submission form should an investigator already tried to contact me and couldn’t get through as I am willing to assist in any way with in my ability to perhaps do so. For any potential interested experienced investigator since there seems to be enough activity in this particular area of Texas (along The Gulf Coast and within a radius of I’d say 300 miles or so inland) not to mention Texas alone having such a high collective number in totality.  I have taken the liberty to cut and paste some of your most recent posts from your website regarding this area for any investigator perhaps not recognizing all these towns and cities by name as to their proximity to each other and incorporating them  into my supplement. By pulling up a map of Galveston County, Texas, and cross referencing with your website you will see that just about each and every city and unincorporated area (towns) it appears, has added multiple sightings over and over again. Especially regarding these orbs of light. I begin with the first one being most interesting to me as it is the one which coincides with the sighting my wife saw the very next day following this persons sighting regarding unusual activity of one of our own fighter jets. If this persons conclusion is correct, then just WHY was this fighter jet sent up in the manner described and for WHAT if anything it may have seen for itself? Not something most any of us could or would get an answer to in making a simple telephone call to the proper authority.  This occurrence was/is only approx. 73 – 81 miles from our residence taking a jet once in the air in afterburner mode if sent up again the very next day for yet another unknown air craft investigation possibly coinciding with our report, a matter of minutes to get from Conroe to the coast?  ** Denotes added by this author** National UFO Reporting Center Sighting Report Occurred : 3/6/2015 14:35 (Entered as : 03/06/15 14:35)Reported: 3/8/2015 9:27:08 AM 09:27 Posted: 3/13/2015 Location: Conroe, TX  Shape: Other Duration:3 minutes **located about 40 miles (64 km) north of Houston ** Alert intercept/fighter in full afterburner, manoevering  through Houston IAH airspace.

It was a mixture of a rectangle on its longer side and an oval shape on top and bottom on its shorter side. I observed this strange light for two straight nights in Sedona, AZ, night sky.  Two nights later, on a plane ,36,000 feet in the sky, I would realize that this exact shape was the same shape as the spaceship that I encountered . My Encounter:  March 8, 2015, I was a passenger on Jet Blue Flight 136 out of Phoenix, AZ to JFK, NY. It was a red eye. We took off about 11:00 pm. I was looking out my window facing north in my window seat. I saw what looked like the same strange distant star I had been seeing for two nights in a row in Sedona. It looked like a red star at first but then I realized that it had those same blinking lights on it. With my naked eye, again it seemed to have green and then red shooting out of it's right and left side, again like the nights before. I was sorry I had packed my video cam away.  This light was just below the constellation Cassiopeia. At first,I thought it might be a plane, but it stayed almost stationary ,in one spot, for about two hours. Then it moved very slowly a bit right and left for about a half hour. Then it  gradually moved to the east towards the front of the plane and out of my view.  About two hours after that, I looked out the window again and I see it moved back near to where it was originally just below Cassiopeia. But this time it sat just a little further to the right, toward the East.  I was so surprised it returned. I'm staring at it again for only moments and it suddenly appears to get bigger and bigger.  Then I realized it was soaring towards the plane. I couldn't believe it!  It slowly flew right over where I was sitting on the plane and I could see the craft!  I believe it slowed down when it approached the plane.  It was about 30 feet over the plane and I could see detail! I saw its bottom, front and left side as it flew over me. I was in shock!  It's shape was straight along the edge on its left and right side but front and back slightly rounded. Same shape as the strange lights I saw in Sedona.  It had some lights on in the front of the craft, but small and uneven number on front right side to left.  I remember 2 on the front left and one on the right.  The craft appeared to be a dull off white color.  It had 2 obvious huge indentations on it's left side on the bottom, where what looked like these 2 huge spotlights shown down out from.  They were positioned on the left side bottom of the craft like headlights on a car.  I imagined it had the same type of two big indentation lights on it's right side but I couldn't see that side as it flew over me on a slight angle.  It didn't look very big, it was more like a  medium-thin module. I have never seen a UFO, space craft or anything like this before.   I asked my Stewardess and the Captain if they saw anything and they said no.",2015-03-20T00:00:00,,

DATE OF SIGHTING:  June 12, 2015  TIME OF SIGHTING:  Approximately 7:00 pm  	 I was standing in my backyard.  The weather was odd; very tropical for a pass situated just about seven minutes west of the desert.  It feels more like Florida today than Beaumont, CA, which is located in Riverside County.   The sun, while setting, was still lighting up the sky enough to call it daylight, rather than twilight or dusk.  To the south, the clouds were generally spaced apart with large patches of clear blue sky in between them.   To the north, there was a complete cover of darker clouds.  There was a light sprinkle in my backyard at the time, and I was indulging in the few scattered cold raindrops, which were a welcome escape from the heat that had prevailed during the earlier part of the day. 	As I looked up into the sky to watch a small number of tiny birds flapping around above me (almost straight up and a little south), a small, spherical object caught my eye.  At first, I thought it was just another bird.  But as I followed its course, I realized it was an actual craft of some sort on a particular flight path (moving in a straight line from the west to the east). I also realized that it was much higher in the sky than the birds I had been watching.  In fact, as it passed a few of the scattered clouds in that area, I could see it actually pass through the very bottom of a few of them. 	The object was black (almost a matte black, to be exact), although I’m sure that at that height, it’s impossible to be sure that it wasn’t just shadowed due to the weird time of day and the strange, partly rainy, partly sunny weather we were having at the moment.  To my naked eye, it was a smaller, black sphere going about the speed of a prop plane.   As its straight vector took in either into or behind a fairly small darker grey cloud, it disappeared from view.  I waited longer than needed given its speed and trajectory, but never saw it emerge from the cover of that cloud.  There was no sound, may have been multiple witnesses (I’m not sure, it being less than an hour since I saw it) due to the fact that the Beaumont Sports Park is only separated from my backyard by my picket fence, and from the time I noticed it to the time it mysteriously disappeared, I had personally viewed it for maybe 20-30 seconds. 	One small final detail that somewhat solidified for me that what I had just witnessed was not normal was this:  Maybe 2-3 seconds after the object had disappeared behind the cloud, a fair sized propeller plane came into view from behind the same cloud, on nearly the same trajectory as the sphere, but moving in the opposite direction (from east to west)!   There was absolutely no way that what I had seen was this plane for three reasons off the top of my head:  One – The sphere had no extensions protruding from it anywhere.  It was just a perfect sphere, while the plane was instantaneously recognizable by its perfectly distinguishable wings and tail…  Two – There was no way a plane could have banked and done a complete 180-degree turn in 2-3 seconds…  And  Three – The plane, as it passed overhead, made the humming sound that all propeller planes do, while the sphere that I had seen only seconds before emitted no sound whatsoever.",2015-06-15T00:00:00,33.9494,-116.97749999999999

At about 7:50 pm (19:50) on Firday April 10th me and my girlfriend were heading back from University Mall in south Burlington.  We had just gotten on interstate I89 South via Exit 14-E, it was dark enough were everyone had their headlights on, but not quite enogh to see stars yet.  The treeline was black but the ski was a deep blue.  About 5 minutes after we merger to the interstate I saw a yellowish light low in the sky at to the left of me at about 10 o'clock.  At first I thought it was Jupiter because it was so vividly bright compared to the rest of the sky, and it looked like the first start out.  After looking at it for a second more, I realized it was too orangey yellowish and too bright, and almost seemed to be getting brighter.  After about  30 seconds I can see its perspective changes making it seem like it is much closer than a star, and seems alsmost fixed in the sky over the ridge line maybe three miles away, andaune about 5,000 feet up.   At this point I wake my girlfriend up in the passenger seat and say ""babe what's that?"". She looks at it for a second and says ""A light on a tower like an airport?"" but it was not blinking or flickering, was very yellow and Orange, not red like an airport.  Also there was only one light and it was so bright there was a little halo of yellow in the clouds around it so you could see there was no tower below it, and there is no airport south of Burlington. After about abother minute of watching it, it is directly left of us, 9 o'clock, and it just sort of zooms away from us. It appeared to move due east at extreme speed. Seemingly no acceleraton period,'an disappearing over the horizon as quick as you could snap your fingers. I would guess less than 0.1 seconds. That was the last of anything strange I saw on my 2 hour drive south that night. I was watching the sky carefully cause I was so unsettled from what I saw. Me and my girlfriend are both 17 year old highs highschoolers who were in Burlington for the day. Neither of us drink, do drugs, smoke or take any medication. We both felt fine all day and when we saw it, other than my girlfriend just woke up. I have an intrest in UFOs because they raise compelling questions and involve ideas I am interested in, but I have no real knowledge other than a few things on the internet, and convorsations with my Physics and Chem teachers. The only thing I could think of that would be helpful would be that the light was the same exact color as old High Pressire Sodium street lamps.

My friend thought it must have been an airplane but fortunately a few degrees to our left were planes flying to JKIA, so it was very easy to compare and tell if this was a plane or not.  Definitely not a chopper because we were close enough to here any sound that could have been emanating from it.   We finally got cold and tired and parted ways, but on getting to my apartment, remembered that I had forgotten to buy groceries, so without thinking, picked up some coins and left.   After a few minutes I was climbing my stairs when I decided to check again.  This was almost an hour later when I noticed that the big glow was now so dimmed but i could still make out its position between two trees due to security lights and the moonlight.  But now there seemed to be another smaller light that was busy hovering around the same house as though trying to look for an opening to get in.   I stood there for another few minutes, shook my head, and walked towards my house.   By the way, I must mention that the following day, my girlfriend complained that she had, had nightmares like something was tampering with her body at night.  She complained of being tired and disturbed overnight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Probably not — but something strange in the sky caught the attention of several Telegraph readers Thursday evening. According to Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society (AMS), reports of a fireball came from across the state Thursday evening. “The sightings were clustered right around Chicago,” Lunsford said. “We’ve only received a couple from the St. Louis area.  We have 34 total sightings. St. Louis seems to be on the southwestern edge of our reports.  It was apparently seen as far away as Ann Arbor, Michigan.”   Lunsford added that similar sightings came from Texas and Louisiana around 2 a.m. Friday.  He said the southern fireball had about half as many reports as the one over Illinois. Such bright fireballs are common in February, March and April, he added. “This is the peak time for evening fireballs,” he said. “I have no doubt that it was a meteor.”   Lunsford said most of the reports claimed to have seen a large green fireball, but some were blue or yellow.  According to Lunsford, the seemingly strange colors are actually quite common when a large chunk of space debris enters Earth’s atmosphere. “Entering the atmosphere excites the oxygen molecules and creates a sort of greenish glow,” he said. The AMS is still investigating the case, which includes looking for evidence that the meteor metamorphosed into a meteorite by hitting the surface of Earth. “There’s still a possibility that it did,” Lunsford said.  “We look for signs of sonic booms that indicate that the object entered the lower atmosphere.  We haven’t had any of those so far.”   Social media in the Riverbend was abuzz with chatter about the fireball — or whatever it was — late Thursday and early Friday.  Facebook user Jason Cox wrote on the Telegraph’s wall that he saw the object around 8:30 p.m. Thursday evening while traveling north on Homer Adams Parkway off Broadway. Another user, Berthal Allsman said he saw a similar object on Homer Adams Parkway and described it as “kool as h—-.”   Mandi Carroll wrote that she saw it while driving on Missouri Route 367 towards Alton. Most Facebook users that claimed to have seen the object on the Telegraph’s page described it as a meteor.  Others jokingly theorized that it was a spaceship, a methamphetamine lab explosion or popular Star Trek character Spock, portrayed by the recently deceased Leonard Nimoy, reaching his destination on the final frontier. The Alton Police Department said that they did not receive any calls on the matter. Alton Police spokesperson Emily Hejna speculated that it was most likely not a visiting life form from the far reaches of the cosmos. The Telegraph also reached out to NASA regarding the matter, but nobody from the administration had responded to the request as of press time.  An official did confirm they were investigating the reports, however.  The official echoed the belief that it was probably not a spaceship.",2015-03-13T00:00:00,38.9455,-90.12820000000002

The boat was doing work ups getting ready for deployment, we had a full deployment crew. Me and a couple of other ET's heard some of the watch standers on the island talking about seeing something crazy, they said something about trying lock on to it with the Nato Sea Sparrow Director's onto the object.  Me and a handful of guys on the night shift ran up to the O-10 where the watch standers were watching it.  They had the mounted Binoculars trained on the object.  I thought they were mistaking two stars one of which looked like a pulsar (due to my pretty extensive knowledge of astronomy).  The object then appeared between the two stars again, the other guys saw the object as well.  We all thought we might be imagining it, asked each other a couple of times if they saw it too.  We all agreed that it was there. When I first noticed it, I thought I was imagining it.  How could a star disappear then reappear right in front of me?  I watched it through the mounted binoculars changing colors between blue, white, purple, and pink at high speed, it kept pulsing. It seemed to stay motionless, the problem was that the altitude was just high for any of us to make out exactly what it looked like, from our vantage point we could see that it may have been hovering and possibly moving but just can't say for sure.   After about 5 minutes of viewing the object as we were all trying to get a look at it, a bright flash filled the sky in the location of the object, it looked like it shot with an incredible speed and was gone.  We were traveling North, the object was northeast of our Northerly heading.  Our speed was approximately 15 to 20 knots. The three watch standers at there post reported that two similar objects had come out of the main relatively stationary object and then rejoined the main object. During my time watching the object CIC (Combat Information Center) was trying to get a radar lock on the object with the Nato Sea Sparrow Missile Directors.  The directors (which are radar directors, fire control radar) kept trying to lock onto the object then it would drop back down to the horizon, the OS's (Operation Specialists) trying to drive the director back there again.  Every time they would drive to get a lock the lock would fail and the director would be driven back down again.  It seemed to me that the object was overriding the directors drive control or that the radar receiver was being over powered and being forced by internal programming to protect its receiver, (to get away from the source of the electromagnetic radiation) it could have been over-driven by the object being to close but more than likely the object was jamming the radar.  I can't say weather it was jamming the object passively or actively, just that the radar was being jammed. After the sighting I checked the SPN-43 and SPS-49 radar in CATCC, neither of them had a radar return, although at that altitude the chances of a radar return are very slim. I tried to report it to my chain of command, they laughed at me and said that we didn't see anything.  We probably just excited, I didn't expect that reaction especially when CIC reacted the way they did.",2015-04-30T00:00:00,36.889383361064894,-76.26208236272879

Then I started counting,realizing this is a single object.  There was fifteen rows and between some sets a single light.  It looked like this  :  : - : : : - :::: on a long cylinder that was flat black.  At the slow speed it was moving it appeared to be at least the length of a football field and lights were on each sideline.   I held my hand stationary over a set of lights to make sure that it wasn't a star making an optical illusion with the clouds and the craft continued moving past my hand and through and just above low the clouds.  I tried to take video but I was so excited showing my wife I flubbed it. This was a truly paradigm changing sitt! ing!

It was 5:55 pm, sunny, and most people in suburbia here on Long Island were on their way home from work. What caught my attention first was the fact that the object was up so high.

It had descended and as I watched (with my prescription sunglasses on), from my car in a parking field, the object went from a northeasterly direction on my right towards the west on my left.

I had changed and was about to exit the bedroom onto the balcony to join him and I noticed as I looked in the direction of the bay (west) a huge dramatic cloud formation and suddenly before I knew what was happening, I heard myself saying, “Look at that cloud, there is a UFO inside it.”    We were both a little shocked to hear me say this, I do not know what possessed me, but sure enough no sooner had I said than the cloud parted and I just recall seeing it closer and there were I think like 6-sided lights all over it, in various colors, like green, red blue, blinking and changing colors.  I could not make out a shape to the “craft” as the oddest part was that it seemed to be cloaked or something, with different parts being exposed and concealed like a clocking cloud moving around it?!  Neither of us knew what to think – could not prcess what we were seeing other than it was extraordinary!   Then, we must have said something like the aliens are here and with that my husband jumped up on the railing and hung on the roof eaves as it passed over our heads (!!!) and he shouted, “Take me!  I immediately shouted “Over my dead body!”  -  (which we joked about for years after!)   As it moved overhead it seemed HUGE like a football field or something but we never saw anything but these cloaked lights and that it was huge.  And silent, completely noiseless!  I knew to check time, had heard stories about missing time, we we did not miss time, but I do not recall how it disappeared maybe disappeared over roof to other side of bldg. out of sight, but then almost simultaneously, we noticed there were federal agents suddenly swarming on the apartment complex, battering down a door on a ground floor apartment (they had ATF on their shirts) and they carried out boxes of stuff and disappeared after an hour, or so, maybe.

Friday, 16 February, 2007, at 02:15 A.M., returning to San Francisco from a cruise of the Mexican Riviera on the Dawn Princess.  We were located off the California coast, cruising at a fast speed (20-22 knots, the Captain had said that night), and reached the Golden Gate at 06:00 that morning. I was coughing up a storm at ~2 A.M., and my husband went to find a hot lemonade.  I was awake anyway, so I pulled back the curtains and stood in the window to watch the ship’s churning water – mesmerizing!  After about 5 minutes, three softly glowing objects came into view – three uniform, nearly spherical objects, evenly spaced in a line parallel to the ship’s hull and hovering just above the water surface.  Based on the appearance of dolphins from the window, and of people seen standing on piers, I’d say that these spheres were somewhat larger – maybe 12-15’ high.  Perfectly smooth, and with a pale bluish-white glow.  They appeared to stay in one place while the ship moved past them.  They were hovering, but didn’t disturb the water below them. Just as they went out of my sight, the left one (toward the bow) splashed down into the water and disappeared. Of course I hadn’t thought to tear myself away from the window to get the cell phone or camera (both in the safe, and of doubtful use through a window at night…).  And, of course, three more glowing spheres, hovering in a straight line along the edge of the wake, came past the window ~2 minutes later!  ~4-5 minutes after that, two more spheres were seen, but farther away from the ship.  The first and second groups had been located just where the ship’s wake or foam line ends.  The last group was about twice as far away.  The “bow-ward” of these last two also dropped down into the water and disappeared.  I was still standing at the window, in amazement, when my husband came back with lemon tea.  I told him about the spheres, and we watched for awhile, but no more sightings.",2015-02-06T00:00:00,,

I have a interesting story to share.  It was May 17 in 2008 & it was a beautiful spring day with mostly clear blue skies.  My band was set to perform at an star studded private music event for charity.  Members from Lynyrd Skynrd & Marshall Tucker were the most famous of performers.  The event was hosted at the home of the musician who put this whole thing together.   Throughout the evening, every band that performed had a electrical problem with their sound & a few times the power completely shut off leaving the sound engineers puzzled.  I was so afraid that when it was our time to perform that we too would have the same power problems.  We performed around 4:00 p.m. &, surprisingly, throughout the entire hour we performed, we didn't have any electrical problems.  We were so relieved & felt lucky.   After getting off stage & mingling with other guest,I decided I would take some photos of my own.  It was now around 5:30 p.m. & the sun was closer to setting to the west.  We had the ""General Lee"" car from the Dukes of Hazzard there & I took a few photos of different guests at the car.   Within the next 5 minutes, I remember thinking that a photo of the mountain side with the visible moon would be a good photo.  The landscape of the property was beautiful.  I took my photos with a Aiptek brand HD camera with a 6 mega pixel photo resolution.  For 2008, this was decent. The next day, I start to view all the photos I had taken.  2 photos struck me to be odd.  The first photo was a photo of some guest standing by the General Lee car.  I noticed in the distance, a solid blue orb in the bushes.  You can zoom in & see it better.  I'd say it was at least 100 ft away from us hovering there observing.  There were no balloons.  At that time I google searched blue orb & had only found 1 other & was not satisfied.  Now there is more photos showing blue orbs & mostly from ufo reports.  The photos before & after the blue orb showed nothing.  The third photo after the blue orb, I see a black saucer looking craft right above the trees on the mountain top.  You can zoom in & it doesn't look like a bird or hawk.  It seems to have an antenna on top of it that is slightly tilted.  But it's just not clear enough when zooming in for me to tell.  I always hoped that someone with pro photo software could zoom in without distorting it to get a detailed view. I've loaded these photos up at mufon also to share with others & to compare since more folks are getting similar photos.  This site should let others see the photos submitted.  This has intrigued me every since that day.  I immediately connected this as to a ufo or paranormal experience.  A lot of times people will say that around an ufo or ghostly paranormal event that they'll have electrical problems or an power outage & this came to my mind.  I also see the light orbs that others report.  Whatever these things are, they are spying on us.  I feel no need in being contacted by Nuforc because the owner doesn't live at the property anymore.   What you see in the photos is what you get.   Thanks for reading my story.",2015-02-06T00:00:00,36.373,-85.9094

It was a rainy night that night.  I work in a data center so I get off late at night.  Around 2:30am, I am standing outside smoking a cigarette.  The rain had subsided, but there were still strong winds being blown around in all directions.  I was speaking to a buddy on the phone looking out into the night sky.  The clouds were hanging low and the street lights were giving the clouds an eerie orange glow.  It also lit up the sky.  I caught something out of the corner of my eye moving from the North.  I am facing due West at this point.  It was just under the clouds and moving at a good pace, about 100mph if I were to guess.  It was traveling South just above 75 Central Expressway.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen, or may ever see in my life.  It was a black cube 80-100ft tall.  I was awe-struck.  I really sat and took in the moment even with my friend on the phone.  I knew this was special.  It didn't make a single noise and was about 500ft off the ground.  It literally looked like it was carved out of a rough black stone.  There were no lights to speak of.  There were no pipes or anything industrial on the outside of the craft. When the craft was directly in front of me I could clearly see the details.  The side facing me was framed on the edge.  I mean that it had a line carved into the stone that ran the entire edge of the side.  Within the framed edge was a circular pattern.  It was obvious to me that it was a deliberate pattern.  I can only say that it would take an understanding of mathematics to create the circle.  As it went from my right to left, North to South, it left a vapor trail that swirled in the disturbed air behind it.  Like I said, it made no sound.  It was absolutely huge.  The rain started to come down again as it left my sight.  I immediately told my friend to go outside as he was South of my location.  He waited out in the middle of his street for 20 minutes looking for it. He was never able t! o see it as conditions worsened with the rain.  I cannot stop ! thinking about this incident now.  I cannot stop looking for this craft.  It is monumental in terms of what kind of an impact this has had on my life.  This changes everything.",2015-02-06T00:00:00,33.09563333333333,-96.64254298245615

It sounded like something out of a sci-fi movie.  Closest sound that I can relate to it would be a lightsaber from star wars.  I know it sounds crazy but we both heard it and it scared us.  After it passed us it turned back to a bright red but there was no sound this time that we could hear.  Then it flew back over to the neighborhood next to ours, maybe two blocks away and came straight down as if it landed.

I thought to myself that it has been a long time since something happened that was definitely unusual, almost no doubting that the sighting is 'different'.  There were not many stars out and the sky was cloudy. Saturday evening, May 3, 2015, I was in my room watching TV and decided to warm up my left over pizza.  I was heating my pizza and checked the sky out the slider door and immediately seen a single blue light, flying about the altitude that a small plane would fly but it was emitting a blue beam angled downward.  It wasn’t very far from my apt. and coming my way.  I grabbed the binoculars but this confused the situation as I think the kids dropped it recently because I seem to get two of things now.  So, now it looked like two blue lights as if one were on each end of a wing.  Set binoculars down and was going to dart to the bedroom and get the camera but didn’t because it would probably be gone by the time I got back.  Grabbed the binoculars again and now it was one red light flashing but the beam was still there.  It was coming towards me so the front of the craft would be facing me and the beam shone out from its left side.  The beam was the same circumference from beginning to end and it ended or was not visible about half way to the ground. It didn’t sway/search but was one steady beam as if it were fixed.  I tried to follow the beam with the binoculars but it would be invisible half way out from where it originated.  I only seen this for about 2 minutes and then it was nearly over the apt and out of sight.  I could not make out any shape of whatever was emitting the beam.  I was in the apt and could not hear a plane or helicopter sound. This immediately reminded me of a similar sighting like this last year.  However, I spotted the object for a longer period however the beam was exactly the same.  It was flying basically over residential neighborhoods but there is a large field in between some housing filled with sheep and livestock.

I also would like to add that I still witness a  very bright flash above me in the night sky on a more than regular basis, and whatever it is seems to be very interested in either:  SW Montana, or my family and I.  (Report Follows)   This morning, at 3:45, my wife and I had gone outside to let our dog, and while sitting on our back patio  waiting for the pup to do his business (un-obstucted view south over the Bridgers to Livingston)  We were admiring some very large, irregular, puffy, smoke like clouds that seemed to be thin enough to let the moon shine right through them; very odd looking indeed.  I happened to be facing South East and looking up at the sky and had a clear view of the stars to the North, South and East with the strange clouds pushing in from the West.  I am always searching for satellite movement and was  focusing my line of vision on a random group of stars in order to catch anything moving, when suddenly a large, very bright, solid white ball of light literally appeared out of thin air, maintaining a constant speed for what seemed to be only a few seconds and then disappeared into thin air again.  It appeared so abruptly that that I could only say ""wtf, was that"" as an instant reaction to what I saw, leaving me mumbling in confusion and my wife looking at me like I was a stranger to her.   As fast as I could explain what I saw and point it appeared again in the same manner as before, only it was further south than before.  Again my wife wasnt paying attention again leaving me speechless and looking like a crazy person.  When it appeared the third and final time we both saw it enter in a way that makes me think of the word, ""Poof,"" and then it disappeared ""Poof"". The object seemed very large.  It looked as though it was the same distance as the moon or closer even. Very bright, white light that didn't flash, strobe, but remained the same color and brightness each time. Came into view in a way that was not natural, jumping into our dimension and jumping out. Like I said after my last report, I feel that something big is happening and we all need to pay attention.",2015-05-08T00:00:00,45.9666,-111.1124

Just as these two passed out of the frame of my window, another 2 lights followed, spaced out the same.

They were too low to be commercial aircraft, and I have seen military helicopters and private planes fly at this altitude, but there was no sound or flashing beacon light.

The object was traveling east in a serpentine manuver, making frequent stops, as if surveying the terrain.  Since it was a full moon I could see the outline of the mountains.  Using the mountains and the surrounding terrain, my best judgment, the object was conducting its maneuvers over the city of Price.  After it was well east of Price, Utah, the object headed north north east as the mist thickened until it vanished.

"Giant object hiding behind clouds.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a shadow, cast by a high-altitude cloud.

This evening, my family and I went to Danville, Va, to watch a movie.  Upon exiting the theater, my sister pointed out an extremely strange shadow beyond the clouds of a thunderstorm.  The enclosed photos show details of an object with extremely sharp edges with protrusions.  Judging by the shadow that was visible, I estimate the object to be the size of a Mountain if not larger. Several other patrons were exiting the theater at the same time and noticed the shadow cast on the sky.  Once we got in our vehicles, we went to another location in the city to enjoy the afternoon sunset before the thunderstorm got to Danville. Again we observed the shadow.  Once home while using Google earth, the direct line of distance to the second sighting location of the shadow is 2.66 miles.  Using the Dan River as a sight tool and observing the radar display of the storm cell on the Weather Channel app,  I was able to determine the cloud base to be between 10 to 15 miles west of our location.  I have lived in extremely mountainous terrain and also visited nearly all major metropolitan cities in the US.  With that being said, I have never observed such a shadow being cast in the sky during sunset by either of the two.  There are no jagged mountain peaks such as you would think that would cast such a shadow in Virginia, only gently rolling hills. The highest point in Virginia is Mount Rogers at 5,729 feet above sea level.  Mount Rogers is approximately 120 miles due west of the location of the second sighting.  Again using Google earth, the direction of the shadow, the location of the storm cell, and using the river as a sight tool does no add up to any known land based objects being able to cast a shadow this high into the sky.  Therefore, I concluded the object to be airborne and stationary.  I also am able to rule out cloud formations as a cause due to not ever being able to recall a cloud produce such a pinpoint and exact shape across the sky.  There were a total of 6 persons in my party who witnessed this anomaly.  Their ages range from 13 to 55.  The photos were taken by an Iphone 5s with HDR in the off, auto and on positions.  The photos were taken just outside the theater.  The time stamp indicated 20:04 on the first photo and 20:05 on the last. There were 8 photos of this on my phone when I downloaded them at home.  I was unable to obtain photos from the second viewing site because I left my phone in the car to charge. Whatever it was,  It was enormous.",2015-06-05T00:00:00,36.62852387096774,-79.49231483870967

By UFO, I mean Unidentified Floating Object – it was not flying – had no wings, no tail, no rotors. There was no sound, though as far away as it was, even if it had been an airplane I might not have heard it.  There was no condensation trail behind it.  The movement of the cigar-shaped white object was so slow that it appeared to be simply floating along at perhaps about 30-40 mph.  There’s a possibility it may have been a drone – I’ve not seen all the types of drones the Military has these days, and there is a Base nearby, so who knows?  It could have been ours, but maybe it wasn’t. I don’t know.  Here’s what happened. I had just pulled out of the Post Office parking lot on Jefferson Street in Olympia, Washington, and turned right (north).  After one block Jefferson Street makes a curve to the NW and as I was looking ahead during the curve (first gorgeous blue sky day we’ve had in a while) a white cylindrical shape in the distant sky caught my attention.  As a cloud watcher I am often looking at the sky, and this object caught my attention as it did not look like a normal airplane.  It was long, cylindrical, no wings, tail or rotors, no windows as far as I could tell.  It was hard to tell how far away it was – I would guess perhaps anywhere from 1.5 to 2 miles away.  Elevation (guessing again) may have been 0.5 to one mile high.  It’s really hard to tell as there was nothing to triangulate it with.  I am a pilot, though I haven’t flown in years, and I’ve sailed across the Pacific Ocean from Sausalito, CA, to Hawaii, and hiked many wilderness trails alone for up to three weeks at a stint, so I’m used to seeing unusual things, but never anything like this before. As I was driving on Jefferson and it became Adam Street, I decided to watch it as it was so intriguing, so I pulled over to the sidewalk in front of a yellow fire hydrant (there was nowhere else to park) and watched it for perhaps 3-5 minutes before I couldn’t see it anymore.  Here’s what it did during those minutes. From my viewpoint it was to my WNW, and was headed south, maybe a tweak to the southwest, moving very slowly, silently, for about one minute of my watch time, when suddenly it veered sharply to its right – due west – so now all I could see was the dot of its circumference.  The whiteness of the object was getting dimmer as it moved further west, and suddenly I noticed a bright pomegranate colored flash below it to the south, then another less brilliant flash a little further away, then a third even dimmer and further still away.  They were like light flashes, nothing exploding, not flares, and were all in a single Southern and lower trajectory from the craft.  That was bizarre, then a few seconds later the craft made an abrupt turn and was longwise to my view again, pointing south.  It seemed to just hover there for maybe ten seconds, not proceed further south.  Then it abruptly turned West again and within a few seconds there was another brilliant flash off the side of the craft – a brilliant whitish green electric colored flash – white on the far side, greener closer to the craft. That flash was fan shaped, different that the burst of round light previously seen.  The fanned-out part of the white-green flash was away from the craft, while the narrow part of the fan-shape was right near the craft. I kept watching and it got harder and harder to see, as it was moving slowly further away. I started up the truck and drove over to a parking area on Capitol Lake, got out and continued looking for it, but didn’t see it again.  Lots of people were out walking around the lake, and after maybe an hour of me walking around it slowly while still searching the sky, I finally got back to the truck, drove to do a quick errand, then decided to drive back to where I had originally seen it.  I took photos of the location, made a quick video, got back in the truck and was about to drive away when I saw something that almost looked like the same white cigar shape again – Same location in the sky – only this time it was higher and harder to see than it had been the first time.  I watched it closely but it disappeared as it headed south much more quickly than the first one – within maybe ten seconds – due to its higher elevation and distance from me – not to its speed, as it was still slow. There is an airport to the south of Olympia and I frequently see low flying planes coming in on approach, but that flight pattern is different than where these objects were flying.  These were too high for approach and way too far west.  The best I can figure is they were above West Olympia and the southernmost shores of Puget Sound heading southwest and west which would take them (or at least the first one) over Black Lake and perhaps on over to the Capitol State Forest.  Don’t know what they were, but I do know they were not planes, helicopters or any other craft I am familiar with.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,47.03031595092024,-122.89693098159509

I go back to the large bedside window and see an 8-10 foot tall rectangular billboard just across the path from from my cabin.  All white light but brighter in the middle as if stretched from center to all 4 corners (as a photoshop gradient tool creates).  I wonder why they put up that massive thing to light the road and if there's others on the path.  Why not just little tea lights?  Then I wonder if it's a giant sun lamp and think ""who needs a sunlamp in daily 90* weather?""   I push the curtain aside, making noise that others heard, and look from different angles through the glass thinking maybe it's some kind of illusion but it appears to stay where it is. I try to open the window and it shifts just enough so I can see clearly but it's too noisy and I don't want to wake anyone up so I stop pushing it. I got up and went to the door to see but as I put my hand on the doorknob a feeling of dread came over me. I had considered going outside but became scared as I flashed on me alone and the brambles of the jungle ground just outside the door in the pitch black and also thought the thing might disappear if I go out- I go to the bathroom instead and then lay in bed reading until the sun rises.  For some reason I thought it would just be/stay there. When I did walk out in the morning there was not a trace of anything where it should have been.  No damage to the grass or disruption in the gravel directly across the road- most of all- no billboard!  I remained baffled all day and began to look online.

Reluctantly I took him out the back and over to Patterson Park.  It was a crystal clear night, very pleasant weather and only 1 or 2 other dog walkers out.  As we rounded the Pagoda on the home leg of our walk I was looking south and could clearly see the constellation Orion just off to the SSW.  I remember saying to myself, ""So clear, I’ll bet I can see Taurus  (my Zodiacal sign).""  Started to swing my head to the west and out of the corner of my eye, approaching from the south, I saw something I cannot explain. At least 9 amber/orange lights in formation and 3 or 4 more lights not in formation, meandering around the formation, were rapidly moving across the sky from almost due south to due north.  I was dumbfounded.  I observed this for about 15-20 seconds. The formation consisted of 3 v-shaped flights in a chevron that was rock solid, all flew in unison.  The meanderers seemed to circle and wander around the solid chevron as they tore across the sky at incredible speed. Flabbergasted, I muttered a few expletives.  Trying to get a grip on myself I struggled to get my phone out but just as it cleared my jacket pocket the phenomenon disappeared over the horizon to the north. I looked around to see if anyone else in the park saw this.  There was nobody around except Gadget who, sensing my astonishment, looked at me with concern as if to say, “What’s up with you, ((name deleteed))?  Why so frantic?”  Completely blown away we stood there for a few moments.  I Goggled the number and called in the report to UFOReports.com right there from the park. Bewildered we walked home and I made an online report of the sighting. I tried to explain it to myself most of the rest of the night. Was it reflections of street lights off my glasses?  Their color was similar to sodium vapor street lighting.  No I surmised.  I had to swivel my head from south to north to track the lights and they never wavered in their flight path.  Arrow straight the formation flew, no wavering or smearing you would expect if it was a reflection. Space junk?  Maybe, but the formation was so solid the flight appeared to be on an intentional course.  And to have 9 lights in solid formation and 3 or for in a seemingly random formation is a mix of trajectories and not likely to be a single object that broke up on reentry.  Such junk would all follow the same path and would leave a trail of some sort.  There was no flaming trail. Aircraft?  I've never seen anything move that fast in the atmosphere.  I've seen satellites, the ISS, Skylab, these moved just as fast if not faster across the sky.  The meandering lights also seemed to take a non-ballistic course and moved in ways no aircraft I know of could reproduce. So, there you have it.

Appeared to be one to two thousand feet above ground.   As soon as I saw the object, I thought that it was different from anything that I had ever seen before.  Called others to witness object.  One witness thought it was an incoming helicopter since we were viewing it from a hospital with a heliport.  However, it failed to grow larger or move significantly over the approximate 10 minutes that we continued to observe it as an approaching helicopter would have and it eventually just disappeared from sight.  No lights observed.  Other witness thought it looked like a balloon but, again, it did not move for around 10 minutes of viewing with wind speed 3 to 13 mph at ground level.   Did not really look like a hot-air balloon to me and I used to live in an area where hot-air ballooning was popular and it appeared to be way too high to be tethered.  Sighted this while at work so it became necessary to leave and when I returned after approximately 5 minutes the object was gone.  Hard to define exact shape, due to considerable distance.  If I had to describe the shape I’d say dome shaped on top, less curved on bottom but not flat with more of a vertical than horizontal displacement.  Kind of cone shaped I guess.  Honestly, from that distance it did not look unlike a weather balloon but, again, it remained essentially stationary in the sky for over 5 minutes and was probably too big to be a weather balloon.",2015-03-20T00:00:00,39.79686141732284,-76.99284251968503

In the mid 1960's, I witnessed a spherical-shaped UFO on the opposite side of the play ground of the school located across the street from my house.  The object emitted a pulsating sound and the luminance was pulsating as well.  I would estimate that the object was approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter. My original impression was that this was a meteorite.  However, I later believed this to be incorrect, as a meteor of such size would have razed the entire neighborhood.  The object had to have made a soft landing, indicating that it was under intelligent control. The UFO was on the ground for about 2 hours, which prompted one of the other witnesses, a girl who was rather brave,  to walk in close proximity to the UFO.  I remembered being afraid for the girl's safety since she was getting dangerously close to the object.  I would estimate that she was within a few feet from the object, when I left the scene and headed back to the house. Upon entering the house, I informed my dad about what was happening out on the playground.  However, he found the whole story difficult to believe.  I also remembered showing the site to a fellow classmate the following day and noticed the impression in the ground at the location where I saw the UFO. I informed Peter Davenport that I would attempt to locate the girl and that search is ongoing.  I have also supplied a satellite photo of the area with markings that approximate the locations of each item. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",,41.753,-83.6319

There is missing time.  and I could tell of another instant when I was six but ... It was in the summer months of 1977.  I was 13.  My family and I were inside our home in NC.  It was around 6pm when we all (my mom, dad, little brother and me) heard what sounded like a diesel truck idling.  That was weird to us because we lived on a private road 4 families that lived on that road including ourselves.  Our neighbor who was a long distance driver was on one of his long distance trips.  My dad thought perhaps he was back early and asked me to go to the front door to see.  I did; I saw nothing.   I’m telling you this because this sound is what compelled us to go outside.  My dad sat for a while longer and asked my mother to look.  She saw nothing but we all still heard the noise.  Finally, my dad went to look. He walked through the living room.  I followed him (I knew I saw nothing), then everyone else fell in line.  I saw my dad take the one step down off the porch he then looked to his left and I could tell something had caught his eye and he looked up and quickly started toward what he saw. Here is a memory gap.   I don’t remember walking out to the edge of the field.  (There was a 2 acre field that had been cleared a year earlier) I found myself standing at the edge of the field looking up at a saucer shaped hovering object.  The object was big but it could have landed in the field if it had a mind to.  This was around 6pm it was daylight mind you.  The sound was gone.   I was dumbstruck, mesmerized maybe, but I was not afraid.  We were so close to it that I could see it was made out of one piece of gray metal (it looked like what we call Teflon now)  No windows, no people getting in or out.  In fact it didn’t even land. Now here is another memory gap.  It is now nighttime I’m standing in the same spot I was and staring at this thing.  It was darting around at impossible angles and speed.  I am trying my hardest to figure out what it is.  A plane?  No planes do not stop and hover in mid air.  A helicopter?  No it does not have propellers and there is no sound. Copters can’t do that.  Then what is it?  (This is what I’m thinking)  I look up to my dad who is standing right beside me and his eyes are huge and his mouth is gaping like a scream should be coming out of him, but he makes no sound, and he looks like he is stiff.    Now it dawns on me that we might actually be in a life threatening situation!  Now I’m terrified!  Then as we are standing there, the disk just shoots straight up and is gone in a millisecond.  We are still standing there looking up into the sky for a couple of more minutes like we are waiting for someone to say “ok, shows over”. Like I said before it was night now, everyone walked back into the house in silence.  We all just stood in silence just wondering to ourselves, what did we just see? We reported what we saw to the police over the phone.  They called back the same night and said we had probably seen a weather balloon.  My dad trying to rationalize what we saw (and probably trying to keep us from freaking out) told us we probably saw a government flying machine of some sort.  “It is probably top secret stuff” he said.  So he very soberly and sternly and frightfully told us that we were never to talk about this again among ourselves or anyone else.  We never did, until I called my adult little brother and asked if he remembered that night.  He was silent for a while and then said “no.”   I asked him if he remembered the conversation that followed in the kitchen that night.  He said he did. Since then, I have had some very strange happenings in my life that I cannot explain or prove.  I have had even weirder dreams.  Sometimes I want to go through memory regression to remember what happened in the apparent missing time periods.  Then I think “maybe you can’t remember for a reason” and I become unreasonably scared.  Another odd thing about that night, my dad had dogs, the neighborhood had a lot of dogs and we also had game fighting roosters and hens, they would bark and the chickens would cackle at almost any disturbance.  They were all silent that night and no one else was at home that night down our entire road. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

From my distance it was about the size of a street light when you're waiting at an intersection, but was higher in the sky and was clearly a large craft.  It was motionless and still, sitting in the sky.  It was hovering near some large metal power lines behind the subdivision, which were very close to where I was standing (about a 5 minute walk from me).  I was utterly stunned and realized I was seeing my first and thus far only UFO ever.  The craft was completely silent, there was no engine or rotor noise.  It also had tiny little orange lights that blinked in quick succession just below the large orange light on the craft, almost like a highly sophisticated landing or warning light system, but the lights were probably about 10-20 separate tiny lights (barely perceptible) each blinking one right after the other in a quick successive pattern.  It was highly sophisticated looking, and appeared technologically advanced.  It definitely appeared mechanical and artificial, not a natural phenomenon.  The lights were meticulously timed to create a very specific succession pattern.  It appeared obvious there was more to the craft, but since it was dark I could not see the dark portions that had no lights.  Based upon the faint outline of the black unlighted portion of the craft in the night sky, it appeared to be either oval or more likely diamond shaped.  All of the lights on the craft had a crisp color to them, almost like a laser, and the light had no shimmer to it as you would see with standard aircraft lights.  I turned on my hazard blinkers and stepped out of the car.  As it was very late, all neighbors were in their homes and likely sleeping.  No one was outside, except a car that passed from behind me which appeared oblivious to what was going on above us.  Almost as though the craft saw me, i! t immedi ately slowly began rising higher into the sky (or shrinking, it was hard to tell which), and then just ""poof""- disappeared.

At approximately 2:30, in the afternoon on 05/06/15, I was heading south on Dale Mabry Highway near the Northdale Drive area.  The sky was overcast in patchy sections where there were areas of clear sky between the clouds.  Cloud ceiling looked to be around 6-7000 feet.   I glanced up at an airliner that was making an approach to Tampa Int'l Airport, traveling on a SSW heading.  I estimate the aircraft's altitude at about 3,500-4000 feet.  As I watched the airliner, I spotted another object drop out of the clouds above and slightly in front of the airliner.  The object was shaped like a football with the ends more narrowly pinched together.  It was uniformly gray in color.   It described a smooth arc downward for maybe 500' or so, then pulled up and into the next cloud bank.  The sighting lasted only a few seconds, but the object was clearly visible, and I could see the airplane and the object together.  I would estimate the object to be slightly smaller than the airliner so perhaps 100' long.  It had no wings, engines or other visible characteristics or marking.   Its movement was very smooth and fluid.  I'm not sure if anyone on the aircraft was in a position to see the object as it was almost directly above them and perhaps 1000-2000 feet higher.   When the object ducked back into the clouds, I continued driving south in hopes I might see it again but it did not reappear.  Not sure what it was but very unusual looking and appeared to be controlled.  It was moving slightly faster than the aircraft so maybe around 200-250 knots.

At this point, I knew it  wasn't a star or a planet because it was moving in the wrong direction. As I continued to watch the light, it flew slowly SW.  I figured that it was just a high-altitude aircraft.  I looked over  at Venus again, looked at it for ~5 seconds, then turned my head north again -- and much to my astonishment, the light had  moved much, much more quickly (est. 85° azimuth now) than my 5-second glance at Venus would have allowed had the light  been a terrestrial aircraft.

Both of us continued to watch the light as it flew overhead and disappeared behind the limb of our roof. The light was white (not yellowish or bluish) and had no colored strobes that would be indicative of a terrestrial  aircraft, and exhibited no engine noise whatsoever.

I was out enjoying some exercise when I noticed a series of large, bright, spherical, red-orange lights floating south over the mountain/valley.  There were 3 in an obvious triangle formation, and a 4th floating West on this side of the mountains.  The triangle slowly grew in size and shifted, increasing the angle until they formed an arch in coordination with the 4th.  As this happened, the lights grew brighter until they were illuminated a golden color. During this process of lining up, there were many planes flying in normal formation southwest toward the airport.  They looked obviously like planes, with landing lights blinking in red and white.  These orbs were MUCH larger, despite being further away at first. As the Arch lengthened and became more equidistant, I observed a 5th light come out from behind the mountain (or from the surface of it?) and join the line.  Not long after the 5th showed up, a 6th appeared, blinking into existence or appearing as though it had come very quickly from the south.  The 5th slowed down and allowed the 6th to join the formation before proceeding.  They all lined up in an arch and proceeded westward at an equidistance.  At one point they were flying in front of a plane at the same altitude and an object flew directly in front, obscuring it.  It disappeared (?) as the craft crossed its path. Each object was perfectly spherical, starting red orange, intensifying to golden yellow as the numbers increased.  Eventually several in formation seemed to begin emitting bright yellow flickers like a bright spot in an welding arc. They looked like they were heading toward Tooele over Chipper Peak.  Line of site was lost with most of them behind a building before I left to go tell others about the event.",2015-03-13T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

I of course didn’t think much of it, because of where I live I am used to helicopters checking the area for Marijuana in the hills.  I simply just went inside after thinking that it was nothing.  An hour later I still saw the same light floating, this time i was a bit worried, so i grabbed my whole pack and started to watch this thing in the sky.  I sat for 6 hours as the same light move at breakneck speeds, and move in directions that were in a zigzag formation, (it moved in other formations as-well, but that what the most significant one, along with circular.) the object also had blue and red flashing lights from time to time, but remained a bright white for the most part.

I have seen satellites and honestly, I felt this was nothing of the sort.  No sound, nothing odd in trajectory as it moved east-northeast.  Simply larger than any satellite I have ever witnessed.  It moved further on its course but never faded. 		We then re-attempted to get ready to leave.  Within a minute of the first light losing our interest, we noticed three more lights coming from a similar west-southwest position.  I could tell they were not moving in straight lines.  The first of these three was a little smaller than the light that had passed moments before.  The third in line was similar to this size and brightness.  The second of this line was the slightest bit smaller. 		The second light started to move off of its course and got behind the third light.  When they were approximately at a 90 degree above us, the smaller second light sped up and seemed to contact the third light that was ahead of it.  The entire time there was no sound what so ever.  The second and third light continued to ""dance"" across the sky until they we at a 45 degree, still following a general east-northeast path.  Here they moved into a line.  I relate it to Orion's belt.  They stayed in this position for many minutes, with binoculars we watched them for ten minutes or more, almost as if they had paused in place.

We were in our backyard between 10:00 and 10:30 pm and my husband had walked out to the middle of the yard to throw the ball for our dog.  He looked up and told me to come look at something.  It was a round, very vivid deep orange circle of light moving across the sky at a fairly slow and steady pace.  It was very low and so close that it appeared to be right above our neighbor’s roof.   Another one came behind the first one and as we were watching these I saw several more coming through the trees in the back of our yard.  When they cleared the trees we could see that it was three in a perfect triangle formation.  These three stayed the exact same distance from each other the whole time.  One more followed after that.  They were coming from the southwest and moving northeast, and were completely silent.    We watched each one as they passed over our neighborhood and then seemed to “disappear.”  We could see the flashing navigation lights of planes much higher above and I do know that these were not planes.    Unfortunately, we were so mesmerized and in disbelief at what we were seeing that we didn’t run inside for our phones to document it.  It is so difficult to comprehend the fact that we actually saw what we saw and at this time I have no explanation for it but would truly love one.

After the flash, about a second later, an odd loud electric warping sound occurred. Never have I heard anything like it or seen anything so bright. The circle of light was the only thing visible and all surroundings were black.  Most historical moment in my teenage life so far and may be most historical event in my life when I’m dead.  In a more depth description, the circle of light was so bright, everything around it was pitch black and I couldn't see any city lights or surroundings in general.  Directly after the light flashed, it was followed by a sound none of us could ever imagine hearing.  It was this really loud, electrical current mixed with warping and a crazy zoom noise.  Even my description is pretty bland.  It's just to hard to explain well.  You just had to be there. Two of us looked directly at the light and saw the circle and just pitch black.  But one of our friends was looking up in the sky and said he had been blinded for a few seconds and only saw white.  This was a once in a lifetime sighting for sure.  All we keep asking ourselves is; why us?  Why did we happen to be there at 3:00 AM and see this?  How come there were no cars or people outside in site? Just why us?

I thought the object had primary oval shape as well as much less pronounced rhomboid features between the color changes--maybe like a metallic pin cushion whose sides briefly deformed into smooth planes.  I checked my weather app at 18:03 after I had lost sight of the object, and it indicated winds were 5 mph from the southwest.  The total view time was about thirty seconds before the object seemed to disappear into very faint wispy clouds or haze.  It is difficult to describe the flight path from my point of view because at first it was moving almost parallel to the ground for a few blocks but then, perhaps as it began to pick up speed, it quickly gained altitude while following a s! traight line.  I believe latex helium balloons I am familiar with from childhood would gain altitude along a parabolic path if observed from my vantage.  My guess is the trajectory of the object I saw would be an absolutely straight shot less than 20 degrees above the horizon.  If the object I saw was three blocks away as it appeared to be, it was at least twice as large as a stop sign or perhaps half as long as a smaller car.

My sister was driving me home from her house in Brooklyn Center.  I live in Saint Paul, Mn. We were traveling on Hwy 694 East and having just passed the Rice Street Exit, I looked southwest and found lights in the sky that caught my attention.  I've been living in the Twin Cities for 59 years and am aware of the flight paths for TCIAP.  These lights were just north of that corridor. As we continued south on 35E toward down town Saint Paul, I continued to watch this object.  I mentioned to my sister about the object.  It was triangular in shape - but not in a traditional sense. Take one of the equilateral sides and make it longer that the other two.  This was the leading edge, it was convex but not overly so.  Along this edge were four large white lights positioned equally in distance from one another.  The four lights were brighter and larger than any I've seen on an airliner.  The white lights were blinking in unison.  At the tail were two small red lights side by side..these were not blinking. We drove on, and I noticed the white lights stopped blinking..they were on continuously now.  I was now viewing the object from the rear as it was pointed westerly.  I was getting rather excited, my sister was giving me a hard time as my first sighting happened at our family house in North Saint Paul.  I was six years old at that time.   She is well aware of my history of the sightings I've had through out my life.  I am now 61 years of age. She was clearly frustrated as she was driving and couldn't see the object.  Now two miles further down the road my view was obstructed intermittently by trees and homes.  My sister decided to exit the freeway, in hopes that she may  see it as well and perhaps find a spot unencumbered by obstacles.  We proceeded toward my home and both agreed that Mounds Park--overlooking the Mississippi River--might be the place to pause for a look. I had - on the way to the park - caught a glimpse of the object.  It should have been further to the north-west but through the broken clouds it had seemed to be closer to us now.  It slid into the low overcast and disappeared.  Despite our stopping at the park and spending some time watching we were not to see it again. At the park, we were able to observe that flight corridor and a number of aircraft to Twin Cites International Airport..which allowed me to better judge the size of the object.  I would estimate the width of the object  to be 300 feet.  I went to the internet and estimated the dimensions of the 727 aircraft I am used to seeing in this area. Conditions during encounter:  after dark, cloudy with a low to higher ceiling having had rain through out the day. Time estimated during sighting:  15-20 minutes. I did talk with the Saint Paul Police to see if any other reports were made.  None reported at that time.  That call was made ~9:30pm. I do state that all the above is true.  ..

I then noticed two orange orbs, which I initially though were balloons, floating side by side next to each other heading in a southerly direction.  No moon was out, so the orbs seemed to be self-luminous with a soft orange glow.  The orbs flew directly overhead and then drifted out of sight. Regarding size, the orbs appeared to be, if looking at the back of an outstretched hand facing the sky, a quarter of the size of the pinky nail.  As they moved, they seemed to have a slightly wobbly motion, as if they were balloons.  A local dog began barking when the orbs flew over. Keeping my eyes trained at the sky, I then noticed stars moving.  First one, then another, then a third and fourth over a period of about an hour.  One of the stars seemed to strobe brightly for a time (five seconds) and then its light dimmed.

I noticed an orange light hovering over SLC to my south, similar to the ones I saw previously.  I was close to where I saw the previously mentioned formation and so was it.  I decided to let it be, as it wasn't moving, and wasn't really behaving all that interestingly. I came back to my previous line of sight after about 5 minutes and it was still there, and was in the process of being joined by a second, dimmer, orangish light from the southwest, slightly higher than it.  They formed a binary pair for roughly 45 seconds, the new light making a roughly 15 degree rotation in a clockwise northeastern motion around the first.  The new light then proceeded to reverse that motion halfway, and made a course change toward the west.  It lazily drifted out of sight behind a building, while the original continued to hover in it's spot. After roughly a minute, the original made a sudden, similarly slow shift to the west and followed the 2nd's path.  A plane was heading to the east at this point, it appeared to be south of the object.  The orange object produced a small orange flicking light that would blink almost white similarly to the navigation lights of the plane headed against it's course, assuming a fake plane form.  It finally was lost behind the same building as the light that joined it before. These lights appeared to be the same type of orange orb seen on 03/06/15. I will try to capture video the next time I see these orbs, as this is the 2nd time I've seen something that fit this description that has behaved notably.  I've seen similar looking lights multiple times since my previous and convincing encounter.  However, most of the time they just hover for a bit before either disappearing or I am drawn away from watching them.  I saw a similar looking light on 04/03/15 from between some buildings but trees obscured what I was looking at so I didn't report it.

I saw something fly across the sky last night as I drove north through a rural area of Route 301 in King George, Virginia.  This craft was huge, was not moving very fast, and I couldn’t hear it make any noise.  (I even opened my car window because I felt like I SHOULD be able to hear it.  But I heard nothing but my own car.)   About 3-5 minutes passed from the time I noticed it approach on my right until I couldn’t see it anymore on my left (trees in the way).  This happened at about 10:10pm the night of April 23, 2015.    I continued to drive as I watched it go by, not having a safe place at the time to pull over.  (Unfortunately, the camera feature on my very old model of phone does not work.  Darn it!)  From my view this object seemed like a large rectangle.  The shorter ends had white lights, three (or maybe more) across the front and at least two on the back with one red light blinking in the middle of the rear (between the white lights).   The object seemed very large because of the diminishing perspective of the row of lights, which at first made it seem like it was tilted at an angle but then I realized it was actually a row of lights covering a long length (the way a long fence seems smaller and at an angle the farther away it is from the viewer).   The two rows of lights remained equidistant from each other the entire time the craft passed by.  (It was definitely NOT two planes flying in sync with each other, which my rational mind was trying to make work as an explanation.)   It was dark in the area between the lights.  Though I seemed to be able to see “sky” between the two rows of lights, I don’t remember actually being able to see stars.  It was like a large rectangular piece of glass floating by with lights at both ends.  If you have ever seen a large commercial plane landing, it seemed to be moving a little slower than that.  It seemed to be flying parallel to the Potomac River on the Virginia side (crossing Route 301), maybe heading toward northern Virginia or Washington, DC.   Size?  I wouldn’t be surprised if this thing was at least 100 meters by 300 meters or so. VERY INTERESTING! ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello.

It appeared at times humanoid in figure (arms, torso, head), ""divine"" dancing light if you would.  Other times not so much, I rode it off as deceived perception.  Then I kept seeing a flash of light over the right shoulder of the object and this too, rode off as a plane heading to the airport.  Then I saw the flash again, and again, and again.  That's when it really didn't feel natural.  Even if the flash of light was a satellite in fixed position, why was it fixed, was it keeping an eye on this thing?

There is a church next door, with orange street lights, so that was my first thought, that this object was just a street lamp.  But as I walked to the street, to my car, the object was floating far above, away from everything else manmade.  It looked somewhat like the moon so I looked on for a second and then hoped in my car and headed home.   I turned around and headed west, towards my house and looked up again and the object had transformed before my eyes.

At this point I noticed the orange lights where on the bottom of the objects.  They seemed to all go different directions, with two sets of two going in the same directions (north and south).  One kept a west to east direction and got fairly close to my location.  The orange glow was in a ring shape on the bottom of the object. The object still traveling west to east shut off its single orange “light” as it moved over the city.  I could make it out in the still slightly lit sky.  The object looked like a pyramid spinning, almost slowly.  It slowed and lowered in altitude.  It seemed to be within a mile of me and larger than a large size van. When it was due south of me, the object had leveled out and begun to fly over just south of the downtown area.  The object rose slightly and sped up as it started to gain altitude.  I then lost track of it behind trees and houses.  I looked to see if any of the other objects were still visible.  They were not.",2015-04-30T00:00:00,46.92450254041571,-114.02240554272517

On Saturday, April 18, 2015, at around 8:pm EST, I looked out the window to watch the stars come out.  I noticed a brilliant white light, in a tall triangular shape, in the NW sector of the sky, from where I was located in a house atop a hill in the West Brighton neighborhood of Staten Island, NY. The light object was much brighter than the stars appearing, even brighter than a planet would normally look from the naked eye. Its shape was like a thin Christmas tree; I observed a red spot on the top of the “structure,” white triangular long base, and three white dots positioned under the base.  From my perspective, the form was atleast five times larger than the other visible stars, and atleast two to three times bigger than planets I have seen in the night sky. The object appeared to be stationary.  I saw it scrunch down in size briefly, to approximately two thirds of its original size.  I was viewing it from inside the window at this time, and altered my position to see if it was a reflection, or distortion due to the screen, but I was seeing it from the clear pane of the window, above the half screen, in any case. I went outside to the front porch to view it again. It was still there (maybe ten minutes had passed), and had a soft white halo around it.  It stayed in the same place as I studied it from the porch, with no obstruction blocking or changing its image, as far as I could see. The tall triangular brilliant white object with the red top beacon, outshined the visible stars in the sky, as well as looking much larger than them (same size as listed before).  It remained in the same spot, as far as I could tell, for the duration of five minutes that I watched it.  I went back inside and checked it from the window.  No movement. I decided to check on the light shape the next hour, and when I looked out at 9:pm, the object was gone. On Tuesday, 4/21/15, I saw what appeared to be the same object, in the same basic spot.  It did look smaller, and this time I saw it slowly move away, towards and above Bayonne, New Jersey’s, skies, a bit further to the left of where I first saw it on Saturday 4/18/15.   It continued to move on a steady course, appearing to decrease in size, though I think that was due to it leaving the vicinity.  I lost sight of it when it moved to the left and my view was blocked by a neighboring building across the street.

Very unusual, in my sixties I have never seen anything like it.  None appeared to be clearly moving although atmosphere may have created that affect.  Looking at them at time I could see several colored light emissions.  Some were brighter and closer others smaller and faded due to distance and clouds perhaps. I looked at the 2 clearest ones through a pair of Sears wide angle 40x binoculars and they appear white, initially like an enlarged snowflake, but as I studied it, trying to hold the binoculars steady, the spheres seemed to have horizontal channels across them from top to bottom and appear to be shifting which again may be atmospheric affects. I have taken numerous photos using my 16 megapixel Samsung Galaxy 5 smartphone and its burst shots.  In the photos and binocular views there appeared to be a haze surrounding the sphere.  I have also captured it via video but none of the shots show much more than white.

The bat was flying somewhere above the vicinity of Main Street & Cross Street.  We were watching the bat, when I noticed what I thought to be a single craft with two dim, semi-hazy lights located on the front and back.  (No craft was actually visible, just the two lights. If this was a craft, it would be cigar-shaped.)  My roommate whispered, ""Oh my god...do you see that?"" The lights flew above the bat but below the cloud cover, and were moving at a faster pace than the bat.  They moved at the same speed, without sound.   Instantly, the lights jumped forward and to the side, changing direction slightly from a northeast-path to a more northerly path. (Based on iPhone compass app, original path was about 60 degrees, and changed to 35 degrees.)  The jump forward in distance was roughly the same length as the distance between the two lights (or, if it was a single craft, the length of the draft, itself.)  After the jump, the two lights kind of vibrated, like if it was one craft, it was wiggling ever so slightly and rather quickly. After the jump, the bat immediately did a 180 and booked it to a nearby church steeple. This was flying too low to be some kind of satellite or meteor, and there was absolutely no sound, so definitely not a helicopter or plane.

My background includes well over 14 years military experience, general knowledge of civilian and military aircraft operational procedures, and I am very familiar with the area that I work in.  My co-worker has worked this area longer than I have and is very good with land marks in the area. At approximately 1:40 am on June 2, 2015, we were doing some work near Mildred, MT.  My co-worker had just stepped outside and came back in 3 minutes later looking puzzled, and said ""Hey, come look at this"".   I thought there may have been an equipment issue so I got up.  I got out the back door and he was just pointing at this light saying what the hell is that?  I looked and saw a strange white light.  My co-worker initially thought he was seeing things as we had both been up all day already.  That was why he got me in the first place. We initially thought maybe helicopter or drone, but, I have never seen a drone with white light for a spot.  Given that civilian and military aircraft have flashing marker lights, we didn't observe any.  We decided to flash our flashlights at it which initially got us a response. It shined a bright light at us.  We ""played"" with whatever the object was for the next 2 hours.  I went to continue my work while my co-worker was still playing with it.  While he was to my rear, the object that would be to my then 10 o'clock, emitted a brighter focused light towards us.  We figured had it been people, somebody would have come over to inquire as to why we were shining lights like we were. I gave some directional signals with my flashlight motioning it to come here, go away, and stop.  We also used the lights on our equipment to also flash at the object.  Generally the response was the same, we flashed it, it would flash back, whether it was flashing the intensity of its light g! etting lighter darker, or shining a light towards us. We left the area about 4-415 am and we were still able to observe this in the same general location and spot. The weather was light to moderate rain, with some heavy downpours and cloud cover was thick. It would have been below the clouds. The size that I would compare it to, is 3-4 times the size of Venus as viewed by the naked eye. Comparing it to my right pinky finger, to watch for movement, the light would appear to be half the width of my finger. Maybe a quarter of an inch. The colors of the light emitted were blue, greenish blue, to a reddish orange. It would also shine a bright clear light. I do know that the moon was more west by southwest of our location and was hidden behind clouds for another 20-30 minutes after we had left. I would also rule out other celestial bodies due to the cloud cover. I do not recognize any of the characteristics of this object when compared to what I normally see in this area. The object did move around a small area during the time we watched. It would move in a north to south, south to north area. Looking at it if I held a ruler up at arm’s le! ngth, it moved maybe 2-3 inches. Back in forth. There was also some movement similar to the curve shape of a satellite dish, moving in one direction, go down then back up, stop and come back in a similar pattern. We are both certain that this was airborne. As a general reference from the railroad track, it was in the direction of 280 degrees, so west by northwest. The location we were looking towards, goes slightly downhill.  From the ground, I could vaguely spot the top of the tree line in the distance and it is my belief that what we observed was in the air, at least over 3-500 feet. Whatever it was, I haven't noticed anything like that before in the area. You learn to recognize the terrain by noticing features that stick out. Lights stick out a lot in an area that is very sparsely populated. Given that it is ranch land mainly in the area, I would not believe it was a rancher, it stayed in one location to long. The people in the area are generally pretty friendly and are quick to help a neighbor. I would think that if it had been people, somebody definitely would have come over, or had someone else come over, to see if we were okay. We couldn't hear any sound from it. Whatever the source of the light was, it was absolutely new to me in the area, and as such, unidentifiable.",2015-06-05T00:00:00,,

At approximately 9:30pm on 6/2/15 I was with a group of people fishing and having a small fire on the beach in Avon.  The night was warm, the weather clear except for some small patches of clouds and a little haze but the moon was out and visibility was good. I was looking over the water when I noticed a bright orange object had just appeared a good distance down the coast and over the water.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane that had broken out of the hazy clouds, but then the object did a short, quick dip down and suddenly one object “blinked” or “split” into six to eight other similar orange objects and into a V-formation.  This formation moved across the sky for a few moments and then almost in perfect unison “blinked out” and disappeared.  Of the 12 or so people on the beach, only myself and one other witness witnessed this particular part of the event. Five minutes later, at about 9:35pm, two orange fireballs appeared in the sky closer down the beach to my location.  These two craft came out of the clouds flying nearly parallel and almost mimicking each other’s movements.  They looked very much like planes at first, but then they would pulse bright fireball orange on and off.  They sped across the sky inland, at one point coming to a complete stop and hovering for about a 20 second time period.  The two craft then reversed and started heading back over the sea where they shone bright orange and then blinked out and disappeared. The odd thing about this second part of the sighting, which all members of my party now witnessed, was there was an actual sound for a brief time.  Whether or not the sound came from the craft or not, I cannot say, but it was deep and sounded like a jet engine at first, but then it kind of mimicked the sound of the surf and waves of the beach, but noticeably louder.  It was at the time of this sound that the craft disappeared. One more of these orange balls were spotted well inland at approximately 10:15pm moving over Avon and its beach houses.  It too moved well across the sky only at one point coming to a near complete stop and hovering.  It stayed like that for a few seconds before moving on then blinking out and disappearing.  Three people witnessed this. Fireworks, military flares, light effects off the clouds—this was none of that. These things seemingly moved with purpose and intelligence.  I have never seen anything like it.  Oddly enough, it was noticed that hardly any commercial aircraft or aircraft of any kind were in the skies on this night. After some quick research and checking online to see if anyone else saw what I did, I found on Youtube some footage taken in 2012 at Myrtle Beach which shows exactly what I saw, but I saw a more intricate V-formation of sorts.

I was at the Diridon transit station in San Jose, California, waiting for my train on my way to work.  Diridon station is a busy station, in an urban setting with lots of city noise and bustle.  I decided to take some pictures of cheery tree blossoms.  The time was 12:13 p.m.  I took two photographs of the blossoms and then noticed a security mirror on a pole that was reflecting the trees and the rail tracks and I thought it would make a nice picture so I positioned myself to photograph that as well.  I snapped one photo, glanced at it and decided to take another.  The second one is slightly closer to the mirror and more centered.  The two photos were taken at 12:14 and 12:15, respectively.  Both photos show three lamp posts on the right. I sat down on a bench in the shade to review the photos.  In the one taken at 12:15 I noticed a white shape above the lamp post in the foreground.  Wondering what it was, I zoomed in and was amazed to find I had captured an object in the sky that was the shape of a flat half-circle and appeared to have a light emission or vapor trail surrounding it.  I'm convinced I managed to photograph a UFO. I did not actually see the craft in real time, as I was focusing on photographing the mirror.  I did not hear anything that led me to look at it, either.  There are airplane flying in the area as this transit station is not far from the airport; however, the flight path is in the opposite direction of the photographed object. This morning I was reviewing the photos and zooming on each of them and have seen in both photos of the cherry blossoms that there are glowing objects, lines and discs in the sky.  In total there are 5-7 between the three photos. I am a 42-year-old female, mother of two and I work at the public library as a circulation clerk.

I pulled out my phone and took 3 pictures while driving on the Henry Hudson Parkway going northbound [hard to do driving 50mph].   Orbs were approx. 90 ~ 100 ft. above Hudson River at a distance from my vehicle of about 2 city blocks when first spotted.  Orbs were traveling southbound @ perhaps 40mph?  Second glance I saw the second orb trailing behind the first [probably 30 ft. distance] and also descending and getting closer to the River.  This time I tried to figure out their sizes but couldn't really determine it so I guessed that the circumference was about the length of my car [15 ft.?] They continued on their southern path at the same speed. I slowed down my vehicle to try to get a 3rd and a better look [some Brokeback mountain guy in his Lego set Toyota was honking his horn behind me until he saw me pointing out my window and at the object.  I saw his jaw drop and his eyes open via my rear view as he saw the orbs]  I ignored the driver behind me and looked to see that both orbs came to a complete stop in unison for about 5 or 6 seconds, then they continued to move southbound at the same speed I mentioned previously.  I lost sight of them as I continued to travel northbound. Both orbs were a steady bright luminescent orange with a slightly yellow tinted center [took a better look when they stopped].  I couldn’t hear any sounds as the orbs flew by due to a commercial plane flying overhead and there was a good amount of cars on both sides cancelling out all other noises.    At first I may have assumed they were military drones but I couldn’t find any reason to that [if military then why orange orbs?] especially when they completely stopped in mid-flight for more than a few seconds and then both continued their flight at the same time.   As I approached the George Washington Bridge I noticed several helicopters flying around and what seemed like 2 military jets circling the area as if they were searching for something.  This was really strange.   The 2 orbs were definitely UFO's [not saying a spaceship carrying aliens from another planet as many people ALWAYS assume that about UFO's]  I couldn’t stop talking about it at work while people are staring at me listening to the story like I’m crazy.

First and foremost, I need to state that I selected fireball as the shape of the craft because that's the closest description.  I posted a video on YouTube and will provide a link at the end of this report. On May 7, 2015, I was standing with a buddy on our friend's front porch having a conversation when, above the house across the street, we see a bright orange ball cutting across the sky, moving from north to south.  At first we thought this was a fireball or maybe a meteor falling thru the atmosphere (in the video you'll hear me state this).  After a few moments I change my assumption because there was no discernible smoke trail, indicating that it couldn't be a fireball.  We followed this object for a few minutes until it became difficult to see. I need to be clear about a couple of things that lead me to believe this is a UFO.  When we first saw the object we assumed it was a fireball since it was coming towards us and we could see the ""heat shield"" as if it were falling thru the atmosphere at us.  The reason I changed my assumption is because we got turned around 180 degrees from the porch we were standing on and could still see the same ""heat shield"" from the rear of the object and there was no smoke trail.  It couldn't have been a modern day jet or plane either because we wouldn't have seen the jet's flame until it was going away from us but we clearly saw the color as it was coming towards us and going away from us. Here is the link for the video. If you have any information please leave a comment on the youtube page.",2015-05-13T00:00:00,30.128008631578947,-81.75236315789473

Took dog for a walk.  We were on our way back home, walking down Elm Street.  I turned to my left, looked up and seen a bright orange light in the sky.  The brightness excited me because not many known aircraft are bright orange around here.   The night was warm, the sky dark and clear, many stars out.  I thought to myself, that's super bright.  Walked a few steps, looked again and it was coming in my direction.  I had my binoculars in  my bag as I am always watching the sky.  I looked thru them and could see that it was definitely bright orange and sphere shaped and was drifting in my direction.  I watched it for about 30 seconds and it just disappeared.  I thought to myself, 'that was weird'.  And continued walking for about 30 steps and looked back.  There was another one or the same one???  It was further back then the last one I seen. So, I stop and look thru binoculars and it looks like the first one but has red tiny spots inside the sphere.  I lower the binoculars and suddenly another appears behind where it appeared.  I am super curious now and watching the second one which is heading towards the same direction as the one before it.  I'm not good with directions so all I can say is that they all appeared just above the flight path, above a field next to Mission Avacados, most of them appeared there, bright red and rose up above the horizon and moved to the east towards Lake Tapps area except one would always move in my direction.  One after another they would fade out and disappear.   This time, I walked about 1/2 a block to the 4 way stop at Parker Rd & Elm and here's two more.  I began watching them and then two more appeared.  The ones that closest to me, did not emit any sounds.  None of them moved past me.   This time one appeared directly across from one and began moving quickly to the other one - I thought! they would collide but it just moved directly underneath.  Then moved across so they looked like headlights, coming in my direction and then they disappeared, all of them gone.  Sometimes, I get a little paranoid and to get to my apts, there is a big field and I was nervous about it.  That's when I fell in a hole and scratched up both of my knees! We come around the corner and no lights.  I get in the apt and ask my daughter where the camera is and in my search for it out in the car, I see another bright orange light in the sky.   I wanted to video it but once I found the camera it was too late. Throughout this sighting, I seen at least 3 airplanes flying about.

My wife and daughter saw a strange bright light in the NW sky over my house and were looking at it through binoculars, they came in the house and got me to look at it and I definitely saw a very bright light in the sky at about a 40 degree angle in the northwest night sky.   At first I thought it might be the International Space Station which we have seen before but after looking at it through binoculars I could tell it was definitely not.  I looked at it through my binoculars and it seemed to be a very bright cluster of lights in a the shape of a sphere but it was only halfway illuminated by what seemed to be anywhere from 30 to 50 very bright individual lights.  As I watched the object through the binoculars it started changing shapes and colors.  It would vary in size and shape from a half illuminated sphere to what seemed to me to look like a lobster claw to a hand to back to a half sphere to a full sphere black with only exactly half illuminated.  The colors a! round it changed from white only to some green around the edges and then some red around the edges.  While we were viewing it I called the Midland Police department to report it and they gave me the phone number of the National Weather Service here in Midland located at our airport. I took about 20 pictures of the object on my smartphone and my daughter took some pictures of it on her smartphone also. After looking at the pictures, they don't really show the shape as we saw it but there are definitely some strange images almost looking like a nebula or a blurred shape with different colors of light. There was a local professional baseball game going on at the stadium due west of my house and at the end of the game there was some fireworks set off but the object was almost like it was northwest of us and the game and the illuminated part of the sphere was on the opposite side facing the game. This object was definitely not part of the fireworks show, my daughter and I saw the! object higher and further northwest of the game and fireworks! show. M y neighbor across the alley was in his back yard along with his wife and I called them over to look at what we were looking at and they saw the light too and both of them looked through my binoculars and witnessed the object and it changing shapes and colors. We watched it for about an hour and it kept getting a little lower on the horizon but it was not really moving with the stars, it was really not seemed to be moving at all, just getting lower and lower until it finally disappeared beyond what we could see above the tree line from the balcony of my second story balcony. We could see the big dipper in the night sky next to it to the south but this object did not move with it and it appeared to be much closer than any star, it seemed to be in our atmosphere. My binoculars are not that great but it was very clear to all of us. I am going to contact our local TV stations tomorrow morning even though it Sunday morning now and see if there was anyone else who witnessed this ob! ject also.  My pictures are very interesting but limited to the quality of my phone camera which I had on full zoom. Still there was something there and we all saw it.  Just wanted to report this to some site tonight and googled your site and this is the only place I have reported this too online.  I'm not looking to get in or on the news just wanted to see if anyone else saw this object tonight.  In my opinion this was definitely not man made.  I am not a pilot but have flown all of my life in our own family planes and commercially and know enough to know what I am looking at in the sky and night sky.  I can send images of the object if you would like them, I will try to send the images from my phone to the link below but they are kind of blurry and my phone will only let me send like two at a time.

I debated on whether or not to mention this, but at this point it is a must.  I will actually recount 2 occurrences within 72 hours.  Both occurring in Emeryville CA. 1st, Friday April 10th at around 6pm.  I saw a strange sphere resting toward the edge of a cloud.  It was perfect in circumference and appeared to be whitish with a faint hue of blue around certain parts of its edges most likely due to reflection of the bright sun that was out.  It was sitting perfectly stagnant.  It caused me to lose focus on my driving and almost hit the driver in front of me at the stop sign at Peralta and Mandela Parkway on the Emeryville/West Oakland border.  After slamming on my breaks I got out of my car.  The man in the car I almost hit must've noticed me noticing it, and noticed it then himself.  He also chose to get out of his car.  I asked if he was seeing what I was seeing and replied simply ""yes. Wow"". This man was in his 30s and more than likely middle eastern but I did not confirm this with him.  I then asked him ""who in the world will believe us?""  He smirked and simply replied ""no one"" and re-entered his car to drive off.  When I began walking toward his car to ask his name, he began to leave.  Having a broken cell phone I didn't have an operable camera to use nor did I think of it at the time because I was too busy being perplexed.  Fast forward around 19 hours and that brings us to this report.  I thought long and hard before reporting but this time was very uncomfortable.  I was driving home from work in Berkeley, CA, and was driving down the 580 toward west Oakland when I glanced out of the driver's side window to the left looking at Emeryville as I was passing it up when a bright light, white in the center much like it was burning that gradually faded into a green ""aura"" surrounding it. A green ""essence"" if you will. Imagine the ozone around the Earth (without the holes), then turn that sky fil! led area between the Earth itself and the ozone layer a radian! t green and that's what this was. A layer of green around a brilliant white. What was bothersome to me is it ENTERED our atmosphere and shot toward the ground. It left a green trail in its wake like you'd imagine something burning toward us would.  As soon as it reached near ground level it disappeared into the topography of the city.  Like it would've landed in the upper Berkeley hills area.  Which is not far. 10 miles. 15 maybe.  Normally I wouldn't take the time to report something like this. But that is 2 strange occurrences over the short time of Friday April 10 to Sunday April 12.  And that's too frequent not to raise concerns. Believe it, don't believe it, doesn't matter.  I'm sane, sober, rational and know what I have seen lately is not familiar and unsettling and I've now done my part by telling you.  Something is going on, alien, government, I couldn't discern if I wanted to.  Something is going on, I know that for certain.",2015-04-17T00:00:00,37.83406666666667,-122.28949770114941

Tonight, March 6, 2014, I walked outside and was looking at the stars, and saw one that appeared to move, only short distances at a time.  It is possible that my eyes are playing tricks on me, especially since when I walked 20 feet to make sure my viewing was not affected by a tree, I saw Orion and realized I was looking at Sirius (just out from the right foot of Orion). Sirius did not appear to move more than the viewable distance between two of the stars of Orion's belt at a time.  It would move to the side, up or down, sometimes in a circular motion, for a portion of or one full circle.  While focusing on it, 2 or 3 times I did see a streak of light similar to that seen in a meteor shower, in my peripheral vision. I quite often look specifically in the sky for Sirius, usually by locating Orion first.  What caught my eye tonight was that it appeared to be moving.  I attempted to rule out movement of my body as causing the perception of the movement of the star, but leaning up against a vehicle did not eliminate the movement.  I realize that does not mean that the appearance of movement was not caused by movement of my body, or possibly by movement of my soft contacts. I am aware of how Sirius appears to flicker and shimmer, and that it may appear to have blue or rainbow colors in the flickering.  As many times as I have admired Sirius in the past in the night sky, I have never had any perception of movement, simply admired the various colors or the flickering. Weather details:  The Weather Channel statements and radar show no clouds, 34 degrees F, 34 degree wind chill, last night was the full moon.  Viewing time:  10:15 thru 10:45 PM CST. I am quite disappointed , as I initially thought I had seen my first UFO.  Not having expertise or training in climatology, I am curious to know how Sirius could  appear to be moving?  Ockham's Razor would dictate that it is 34 degrees outside (34 degree wind chill) and that it is impossible to keep my body from tensing up against the cold, thus the appearance of movement in Sirius is actually my own.",2015-03-13T00:00:00,32.5215,-94.9665

My brother had spotted a glowing object and had come to get me because he was confused as to what it could be.  At first I figured it was a planet but when I saw it I saw it was much too bright and was slowly moving across the sky.   Very slowly it started moving toward the horizon, so slow that we almost couldn’t tell it was moving, believing it to be our eyes playing tricks on us.  It was very bright, and my brother swore that he saw it shoot up towards the sky which is how it caught his attention in the first place.   We continued to just observe whatever this thing was over the next half hour or so, even climbing on the roof to get a better view.  We had each commented on how the object seemed to be varying in luminosity and to have shown little specks of red blink occasionally.  Again, I must emphasize that it *seemed* to do these thing because we were all staring at it so long that it could very well have been our eyes playing tricks on us.    As we were watching, we noticed that it had slowly shifted its color from a bright, almost star-like, white glow into a deep orange and yellow.  This was for certain, there was no way it was an illusion caused by focusing on something so bright for so long.  Remember, all of this happened over the span of around thirty minutes so the changes were subtle except for the eventual change in color.  It continued to float down towards the horizon and slightly towards what would be north from our perspective.  My brother grabbed his Iphone to use his Starmap app to verify that it was not a planet or star.  It was WAY bigger than anything else I had ever seen, that I suspected was not an aircraft seeing as it was so steady and “floaty”.  One last thing that we remarked on was the fact that it often looked as if it partially blended with the sky.  We thought it could have been something blocking our view but it was only a part of the object at any one time and whenever this occurred the (I want to say distortion) was the exact color of the sky behind it.  It was definitely one of the strangest things I have ever seen.

To me it sounded as if it were a large jet airliner flying way too low as if it were in some sort of mechanical distress about to have to make a forced emergency landing any second, as I briefly cringed for a few seconds wondering if our house was going to be the first one taken out. By the time I got out of the bed and went through the house into the living room my wife was just coming back inside from the front door.  I asked her, “you hear that dammed jet”!  She had this weirdest look on her face saying, “Yes I did, that’s why I went out the front door and that was no air plane of any kind, I saw it”!   She was watching television in the living room and heard the same approach when she jumped up off the couch and stepped out the front door.  She stated that as soon as she cleared the overhang of the front part of the house and looked up in the direction the approaching rumble was coming from (the south east) she could clearly see three lights to the front of a perfectly round object.  Two red evenly spaced and shining at an angle off to the side with one intensely bright white light centered in the middle shining straight ahead as if were a headlight or spotlight for the pilot/operator.   She further stated upon me questioning her that it looked as if it were! going to brush the top of a row of tall pine trees we have down the side of the yard (approx.. 30 feet high).  That as she could see it was no plane of any kind as it cleared the tree tops she could then tell that it was may be three times the height of the trees above them.   As it flew across the top of the trees going right over our house headed North West upon her looking up at it trying to follow it with her eyes once it cleared the house, “That it was gone with the speed of a shooting star.”   At this time, she could tell that it was may be two to three times the height of the pine trees above them which would have been may be 90 feet or so?  I know it’s extremely difficult to impossible for most of us to accurately estimate distance of most anything in the sky.  Furthermore it looked as if it were may be as big around as our living room which is somewhere around 10 X 20 feet of which I have no idea as to just what size larger that would be 90 plus feet above?

Last night (5/17/2015) starting at approximately 21:30, I saw the same strobe type lights flying while I was on my back deck.  Like originally posted, there was only one object but this time it was flying erratically at a lower altitude.  Once the lights disappeared, I continued to watch the sky from my back deck.  I did not see anything else over the next ten minutes so I went inside to take care of a few things.  I started thinking that since I saw the object twice now within a week, that the chances are I may see them again if I go out into the yard and watch the entire sky for an extended period of time.  Once I was finished taking care of a few things inside the house, I came back out and sat on the back deck with my wife and told her if I saw these lights again, that we would go out to the back yard to watch for them.  About 10 minutes later, I saw the strobe lights ! for a single object flying high in the sky and quickly disappeared.  The speed these objects seemed to be flying was incredible like I noted in my last report.  I went out into my back yard and started watching the sky around me.  Within a few minutes, I noticed that while facing east, there were dozens of these lights that appeared to be flying within and around the group of trees in my neighbors back yard.  I called my wife out and we watched the lights ""strobe"" effect for several minutes.  These lights looked like mini LED flashlights that flicker brightly.  The color is pure white.  Fireflies are a yellow-green color when they flash and fireflies flash at a much slower rate.  Given the way these ""bugs"" (as they must be some type of bug now that I have seen them fly within and around trees), I did some research on the Internet about reports of white strobe lights flying around trees.  There are many reports on different web sites about this phenomenon! and there is much speculation as to what they are.  While sea! rching t he Internet, I am not able to find any bug that emits a solid white light, so this is till a bit of a mystery and these ""bugs"" may explain a lot of what people are seeing since the initial report I filed looked like a high-flying craft with strobe lights and seemed to fly at incredible speeds.  Since these can only be seen at night and since they appear to be small, I do not think they will come out to well in pictures or video.

Shreveport, Louisiana, around 10:15 pm CDT  Duration of sighting:  5 minutes  Angle of view: 45 degrees above horizon  Estimated altitude of craft: 5,000 ft gal  Estimated speed of craft: 50 mph  A triangle shaped craft was observed flying slowly and silently over Shreveport on a northerly heading, most likely flying directly over Interstate 49 which is a north-south highway in the city. I was observing from a distance of one (1) mile east of Interstate 49 with a clear field of view, in the southeast section of the city.  Weather conditions were clear and calm. At arms length, the craft appeared to be the same size as the width of my thumb, which is an average-sized adult male thumb. I was also able to view the craft using a high-quality pair of 10x50 binoculars that gave an enlarged and more detailed view. I could not discern any distinct structure, but did observe that background stars disappeared from view as the craft passed in front of them. The shape of the craft was an elongated deltoid triangle with a single blinking red light centered underneath, and non-blinking white lights on each of the three corners. There was no green light, which is normally required on the right wingtip of all aircraft. With the binoculars, a row of three dimmer non-blinking yellowish lights could be seen along the starboard leading edge of the craft just aft of the most forward non-blink white light. I surmise that these were windows. I observed the craft as it continued to fly north of the city until if became obscured by trees on the horizon in the distance. The speed and altitude seemed to remain constant during my observation. There was no audible sound at any time. This is the sixth time in the past year that I have observed such a craft flying over my city at night, and it has always been seen in this same way, in the same place, flying in the same manner and direction.

My back door faces south. Its been so cloudy lately so i noticed the stars right away. I noted arcturus and then scanned to the west and noted jupiter.  I need to say that i am overwhelmed again suddenly as i write this  tears flood and i feel overwhelmed and i promise this is not a joke.  as soon as i noted jupiter i look just to the left and up of it because two orangish very distant and even seemed like stars just started to dance and rotate almost orbit each other rapidly i stepped back in the house and said ((wife's name deleted)) but she didnt come out.  i looked back and they horizontally and rapidly sped away in opposite direction.  i could have sworn they just stopped and turned into stars you now what i mean?  did they dissapear just in front of that star?   i just didnt know.  I have to say that i have experienced anxiety and depression in t! he past and even recently but this type of anxiety and feeling is way new.  Just thinking of it and imagining it is making me feel so tense. my eyes get wide and tears just pour out litterally.  im not crying though...  It was just so amazing. also, i yelled for my wife ((name deleted)) because i think it was end of march when we were both sitting out here and bothed wathed what we believed to be a tea lantern floating slowly up and both said how pretty it was. and then it just stopped. and it floated. and it never burnt out. and i can tell you now 1000 percent honest that it turned into or burnt out perfectly in front of arcturus. so. i stepped out immediately lit cigarette. looked up immediately saw plane traveling normal height blinking lights red and white obvious plane.  then notice acrturus pretty uch south above it look west immediately see them next to jupiter going crazy around each other. from me stepping out to watching them spinning around time lapsed about 10- 20 seconds.  stepped in ((wife's name deleted)) stepped right out immediately saw them travel opp! osite di rections horizontally. time lapsed now maybe 30 seconds. i stare. nothing. i look south perfect horizontal white non blinking perfect steady moving like a satelite and dissapears. ive seen many satelites. i just wouldnt call it one. arcturus is my favorite star and jupiter my favorite to look at through telescope. i not an alien wacko.

Hello. 	I am going to say, I don’t know what the heck I saw……… Last night, at about 2320 hr MDT on May 18, 2015.  I happened to look out of my living room window.  The windows on that side of my home face directly West.  I was looking out my patio door windows, so I can look over a pretty large angle of view.  So, I have been watching the planet.  Saturn (I think it is), it has been VERY bright in the sky directly West of my home, at that time of the night.  I have been watching the sky for years and know what the difference looks like between a star and a planet.  I have also seen the ISS fly over at least 4 times, and have seen satellites passing overhead many times.  What I saw was none of those.   What I saw was a very bright YELLOW light.  It appeared to be the colour of a flame or perhaps incandescent light. It appeared in the sky about 30 degrees from due West towards the North.  It was about 20 degrees up from the horizon, like I wrote above; I first noted it at about 2320 hrs MDT.  I used my binoculars in an effort to gain a somew! hat better view, but they did not seem to help very much.  This “thing” seemed to be oblong in shape and the bottom of it seemed to be kind of waving. Almost as if the bottom had a flame.  The thing had no blinking or flashing lights or anything like that, that I could see.  I live in a small town and I am sure anyway that it was too far away to have been able to hear any sounds.  I could not make out any real defined shape. Whatever is was finally disappeared over the Western horizon at about 0130 hrs May 19, 2015.  During the time I watched it, it appeared to move down but also slightly more to the West   *Note:  Because my town’s Downtown, is mostly West of my home,  it has the effect of raising the horizon a little higher, thus  if  the buildings were not there, it might have been visible a bit longer.  Either way this thing moved faster than the “stars or planets” in the regular night sky, but way too slow to have been a helicopter, or an airplane, or the ISS or such. ! Hopefully, I am not the only person who saw this thing in the! sky las t night.",2015-05-22T00:00:00,52.67679999999999,-113.5815

The pin point lights followed each other in the same formation through the sky from the north side of my vision until I couldn't see them anymore to the south (about 30 seconds).

My teenage son and I were behind our apartment. His hamster had passed and we were looking for a spot to bury her.  We looked up and saw what, a first, we thought was a tower with lights that we had not noticed before.  It was a bank of lights that were very bright and a bit blurry so I cannot be certain how many - I would say four or five, my son thinks three.  These lights were in a straight line and, as I said, we thought this was a tower we had not noticed before because the lights were very low in the sky. However, when we looked up again they were closer.  There is a small craft airport near us and had the lights been headed in that direction or coming from that direction I would have dismissed them - they did neither, however.  The craft was slow, much slower than a plane or a jet would have been especially at that altitude.  As it drew closer we could see that the object was triangular.  All of the lights were very bright, and all white. It passed over us s! lowly, seeming to get lower as it went.  Because the lights were so bright we were unable to see anything distinguishing other than the shape and an obvious metallic sheen.  As it passed overhead we heard a noise no louder than a semi would make passing on a highway.  This sound was much lower than any jet or plane - however small - I have ever heard.  We could talk easily in low voices and hear each other though it was quite close.  As it passed overhead we ran through the breezeway of our apartment and out to the front where we watched it - still extremely low - pass over some trees and out of our sight.  We watched the skies, and listened, for a full half hour but did not see it return.  We were concerned maybe it was some sort of plane that was crashing as it was so low but, as I said, it passed much too slowly to be a plane.  We heard nothing after that, nor did we see anything more.  As it did not leave from the direction of the small airport nor did it travel in that directio! n I do not believe it was a small aircraft.

It was hard to judge distance, but this seemed fairly high up in the air, perhaps 2.5 to 3 hand-widths off the horizon (if one could see the horizon from my location)  At first, i thought the light might be a plane with its landing lights on, making a very tight turn. However, the Moscow-Pullman airport is west of town, so i should have been able to track an aircraft with its landing lights on traveling East to West. And i doubt the regional airport is open that early in the morning. About 8-12 minutes later, i noticed a second light do the same 'bright-to-nothing' off to the East-North-East of the first light. This one seemed a little higher in the sky than the first, and it was not as bright as the first light.

I stopped to take some pictures of the clouds and the sunset.   As I was taking a picture, I noticed a yellow circular shape moving through the trees.  I was taking a panoramic picture as it was moving and then it abruptly stopped, seemingly  to hover in the trees.   I continued to take the panoramic picture, and as I was getting ready to stop the photo, I saw through my screen display, the object shoot through the trees, and then shooting into the sky.  I photographed the circular object hovering in the trees, as well as it entering the clouds in one panoramic photo. z object did not leave any type of vapor trail that I could see, it moved so fast that I was able to catch it in one short panoramic photo.  Both as it hovered, as well as it in the clouds.  The object had tree branches in front of it, and it blocked seeing tree branches behind it.  Also, the object is also seen with part of the cloud in front of it, and it's blotting out the dark clouds behind it. I cannot really determine the size of the object, may be six to eight feet in diameter.  It was  A bright yellow or white in color, it seemed like it was flashing.  I tried to duplicate the same picture, but there were no objects in following pictures taken.  This helped me conclude that this was not a dirty lens on my camera or a raindrop. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) As an ex professional photographer, I know that it was not a camera flare, especially with a non smart phone and in a car with tinted windows. The object was on the left side of the road hovering in a rainbow then went over the road to the rain cloud and that's when I got the picture of it.

At first I suspected it was Venus, but the object didn't act like a star.   I had my wife keep eyes on the object while I retrieved two sets of binoculars, and we both observed the object.  The object appeared to resolve as a tiny disk vice a point, so I had my wife continue to observe it while I retrieved my camera.  When I returned, she reported that a tiny object appeared to swiftly go by the larger object, while the larger object appeared to remain stationary.  I photographed it through a 250mm lens, and the image showed a round bright white object connected to a tiny object by a thin line. Next, I retrieved my 750mm telescope.  My wife reported the object slowly creeping east southeast. Its speed made it difficult to keep up with on the telescope's equatorial mount, and its speed seemed to increase toward the ESE. When I finally got it in view, I observed it through a 7.5mm eyepiece, and it resolved into what appeared to be a white sphere connected to a small object via a dangling cable.  The sphere was about 2 times the size of Jupiter through the same eyepiece.  The slow speed of the oscillation (&gt;1 second) of the dangling object implied a relatively long line, and the oscillation would occasionally tip the sphere and expose an orange object at the interface between the line and the sphere.  My wife, eldest son and I observed for a few minutes. At this point, I recalled the successful bombing of the mainland U.S. by the Japanese in World War II via hydrogen balloons, so I looked online for where to report this ostensible balloon.  I quickly came across the National UFO Reporting Center, so I called them at 8:17 p.m.  It was about when I called when the object faded out of view. The center operator requested I write this report, and suggested I call local law enforcement if I was truly concerned.  I contacted Fairfax County Police, and they said they couldn't take action if the object were as high as it appeared (whereas they could respond for an aerial object threatening people on the ground, e.g., a rogue quad-copter). As I was compiling my data for the report, my wife came across a local news channel interview online with the National Weather Service about their radiosonde balloons.  The balloons in the video looked much like the object we observed, so I called the UFO reporting center back.   The operator suggested I do a winds aloft check to verify the direction of the object.  The local airport at Dulles didn't have an available report online, but the Richmond, VA, and Westminister, MD, airports did.  The winds aloft report from Westminister indicated that the balloon probably originated there:  for the object to be stationary and then drift east meant that it passed between 18000 and 30000 feet.  Moreover, the winds from the surface to 18000 feet would have taken the balloon south and then west, which is where it was relative to Westminister.",2015-05-08T00:00:00,38.84920832049307,-77.31409306625578

I looked to the north and saw the SAME light pattern on another object also moving north then east.  I was narrating the events to my girlfriend and she said to take a picture.  I did but the picture doesn't show the shape or colors.  Then, I scanned the sky and saw three more to the northeast very high in the sky.   I have a federal and military background and can estimate the altitude of the lights over Broomfield at around 600-1000 feet above ground level.  The same pattern lights seen to the high northeastern sky had to have been at least 30K feet.  Two of the pattern lights were masked by a thunderstorm cloud moving north.  The top of that cloud could have been 40K in altitude.  Hard to estimate with the lack of light.",2015-06-05T00:00:00,,

It was a full moon and absolutely beautiful outside, and at approximately 11:45 PM EDT, I went down to the beach to sit around for a while.   I got to the beach and was standing in ankle deep water trying to take a picture of the moon over the water, when I noticed something more directly overhead and to the right, which was south of my exact location.  Upon further investigation I saw a bright orange glow in the sky, and immediately thought “plane”.   I looked at it for another second or two and realized it wasn’t a plane at all-it was too bright, too consistent in color, and at the distance that I could perceive it was, moving far too fast to be a plane.  To serve as a point of reference, I immediately thought of planes that fly in on a regular basis.  Just earlier in the evening, I was sitting on the balcony with my grandparents, watching two planes circle over the ocean, before going back inland to land at Myrtle Beach airport.  They moved much slower than whatever the glowing orange thing in the sky was. I’m a Coast to Coast AM insider and overall nerd, so I immediately stopped trying to take a picture of the moon and started trying to get a picture/video of the bright orange glow in the sky.  Despite my best efforts, I couldn’t get my camera to focus on it and get a good look with my phone.  I don’t know if that was user error or something else. Also as a point of comparison, when you see a plane, and particularly soon after takeoff, it appears to go upwards, but also horizontally-it looks like its climbing at a steady rate.  While the bright orange glow was moving quickly, and upwards, after a couple seconds, it went straight up.  Its horizontal motion was short lived and once it started going straight up, it was completely out of sight within seconds. I took a second to gather myself and called a friend who is a fellow nerd and MUFON member.  My iPhone call record states I placed that call at 11:52 PM EDT, and I deduce the approximate time that I saw the bright orange glow was 11:50.   I only got to see it for 20-30 seconds, but there’s no doubt in my mind that whatever it was isn’t from around here. More about me; I’m a church music director in a denomination of Christianity you’ve heard of before.  I have a undergraduate degree in church music, and I’m currently back in school working on an accounting-add on to my degree, with intentions of becoming a CPA.  As far as anyone can tell, I have a clean bill of mental health. I count myself lucky and blessed to have gotten to see something of such coolness on such a beautiful night.  The only thing I hate about it is no one else got to see it with me; my girlfriend turned in early, and I’m kind of mad at her about it.",2015-06-05T00:00:00,,

I was at my home of which is located out in the country within the rolling hills of East Tennessee; it is worth mentioning that we have good views of the sky from our home.   I had been shoveling snow out in the driveway and also along the front walk of our house; the sun had set and so I decided that it was time to call it quits and go inside for the evening.  I had been looking down at the ground while I was performing the work, but upon stopping the work I lifted my head and turned towards the house so as to begin making my way back towards the front step.   As I took a couple steps towards the house, I immediately realized that the brighter planets and stars had become visible in the evening sky, and so I paused so as to take in the view of the evening sky and enjoy the moment; that is when something else caught my attention.  As I was looking towards the western sky I saw what I thought at first to be an extremely bright planet or star visible in the sky; it appeared from behind a low hanging cloud.  Now there were a several clouds that were hanging low in the sky but beyond the scattered clouds was a crystal clear winter sky.   When I first noticed the object it appeared to be moving and so I immediately began to assess whether it was moving or if it was a stationary planetary object with the low hanging clouds moving across the sky instead; within a second or two it was obvious that the object was traveling west to east at a rather high rate of speed.  It appeared to be traveling at an altitude that was consistent with the low hanging clouds or just above them due to the clouds would momentarily block my vision of it as it traveled across the sky towards the east.  It was close enough that had I had my 10x50 power binoculars on my person I would have likely gotten a much better look at it and could have likely at least identified a particular shape if not much more detail; for instance, at the distance and altitude of which it appea! red to be I would have easily been able to clearly identify a ! typical aircraft if I had viewed it through my 10x50 binoculars.   Upon almost immediately realizing that this could potentially be an interesting aerial anomaly I considered running to get my binoculars, but taking into consideration how fast it was traveling I realized that it would only be visible for a few seconds unless it slowed its pace and so I just decided to try view it best I could from my current vantage point.   Its appearance was like that of a bright planet except; more like a light than an object. The color of the object (or light) appeared to me as the tone of yellow/light-orange (much similar to the appearance of afterburners from a conventional fighter jet and had it been only flying away from me then I would have considered this to be a reasonable consideration). The color of the object/light stayed consistent throughout the siting; it stayed a solid tone of yellow/light orange.  When I notice this object it was located looking towards the western sky; I watched it closely as it traveled from west to east.  It was traveling at a speed that in my opinion is consistent of a fighter jet traveling at least normal cruise. It was quiet out and I was intently listening to see if I could hear any sound coming from the object; I heard no noise coming from or produced by the object,  I only heard a dog barking intermittently off in the distance.   I am most certain that had this been a conventional aircraft I would have heard some sound associated with the object.  There was absolutely no contrail or exhaust visible to me coming from this object.  I would say that from my vantage point, when I first saw the object I would have been viewing what should be the side of the object and as it traveled across the sky I would have been looking at the rear of the object as it went away (off into the distance); this prevented me from considering the possibility that what I saw was any kind of landing or taxi lights of an aircraft.   I am a former State Section Director for MUFON and so I try to always be on the look-out fo! r things that are out of the ordinary; this particular light or object I felt was worth a report, for it is not often that something appears this low in altitude and close enough that you should be able to hear sound emitted of which I cannot easily identify.   If it was an aircraft, then I would certainly think that is was likely of the stealth due to the lack of sound emitted.",2015-03-06T00:00:00,36.50270386100386,-82.5479583011583

I first saw directly in front of me front of me for about 1 or 2 seconds (in the direction of a farm pond on my property), when it was right in front of me it vanished (I could not see it for 1 of 2 seconds) then it again appeared to my right about 20 feet farther to the East continuing in the same direction it had been traveling and I saw it for 1 or 2 seconds as it traveled away from me.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get the camera to focus on it as it was moving, in order to take a picture.   What it looked like throught the lens was a ball of fire with back ""wings.""  I would say the shape almost resembled a large plane completely engulfed in flames with no back half, only the front through the wings except the wings reached back behind.  Through the lens, there was no mistaking the orange glow and flames.   Considering its size with the naked eye it had to be comparable to a 747, at least.

We were discussing whether the object had circled when we noticed several more appearing from the same direction.  I then went in to the house to grab my cell phone to take some photos and get my wife to come out to look at what we were seeing.  Within the next 20 minutes we observed approximately 36 of these lights all the about the same size, with the same color characteristics, flying the same direction from the same area as the others appeared, with no noise and eventually going dark at about 3 to 5 miles from our location. Their speed was slow almost to the point of what I would call floating but definitely moving faster than a balloon but slower than a helicopter. At several times we had 6 to 8 objects in clear view and several times it appeared as though they were flying in V shaped formations. There was one instance when it looked as though 2 objects were going to collide and at the last second they both changed direction to avoid collision. The objects did not have any distinct markings or defined edges. As they pulsated they appeared as almost opaque.  At first we thought possibly the military was doing maneuvers since it was Friday night but then we became more skeptical as to what these lights were. I talked with a neighbor about ten minutes later and he felt it may have been the military flying drones. None of us who witnessed this event quite know what we saw and were in total dismay because we could not come up with a definitive answer as to what the objects were or why they were in the area.  I have photos on my cell phone but to the naked eye they appear as small dots in the dark sky and I was unable to see as much as I did with the naked eye so they were no help. However if you want to see them I will supply them upon request. I have been looking to see if anyone else had the occurrence for the same area and time",2015-05-13T00:00:00,39.8294,-77.9785

Close encounter 5th kind - CE5.,Okeechobee,FL,1994-10-12T21:00:00,disk,unknown,"Occurred : 10/12/1994 21:00  (Entered as : 10/12/94 21:00) Reported: 3/21/2015 4:13:48 PM 16:13 Posted: 3/26/2015 Location: Okeechobee, FL Shape: Disk Duration:unknown",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117952.html,"Close encounter 5th kind - CE5. This is a completely true, but amazing, experience, and I strongly feel it will interest you.  It’s another strange thing that’s going on with some people, a twist of things happening in recent years, worldwide.  It was Wednesday, October 12, 1994.  In what follows, a name is changed, withholding a man’s identity.  Everything else is exactly as it happened.   That day around 9:00 p.m., we arrived at Okeechobee from our day's work in Boca Raton.  Okeechobee is a Seminole Indian name meaning, ""Big Lake.""  Joe was with me.  We are computer engineers developing an important product for a big client.  It was a difficult job.   We needed a change of scene and he was glazed over too from the day’s problems.  A ride in the country would give us a change to rest our heads.  Escaping our noisy hotel was part of the answer, so driving eighty-five miles to Big Lake was welcome.   The beach is usually good but typically it’s a parking problem.  At Okee, there’s cool, clean, air with a chorus of wild creatures to hear all around ... Relaxing.  There‘s no stress or tension.  What a place!   We arrived with just time enough to fix a drink and walk outside by the rim canal. It felt so fine being there on a perfectly clear cool moonless night.  The air was wonderful and stars were bright.  Looking to the right we immediately saw a light coming.  It was over the canal about 800-feet in the air a quarter-mile away.  Something close was flying our way.  I was thinking, ""This ought to be interesting.""  Little did I know!  It seemed like a helicopter by its speed and height, with a big light under it.   At the same time there was a twin engine plane flying out over the lake, just behind it, about two miles away.  The plane was noisy and gaining altitude from take off at Okeechobee Airport.  So, it’s natural that I wouldn’t hear a helicopter coming our way.  Only it wasn’t a helicopter, not a plane either, and it’s coming along in the air too quietly.   We’re near Route 441 with some distant sounds of traffic going by.  But I couldn’t hear this thing coming and it’s getting close.  We saw a steady bright glow under it, like a big searchlight playing into the canal.  Whatever it is, it had no flashing lights of any kind.  But all aircraft are required to have strobe lights at night.  As it came from behind a nearby tree into clearer view, we saw it’s a brightly lit disk and still  moving toward us.  I said, ""What the hell is that?""  Joe was glued.  I just watched without a thought and looked hard trying to decide what it was.   The disk was still flying toward us, slowly, maybe 20-mph.  It flew the same way over the canal until about 300-yards away.  Then it went gradually higher to about 400-yards, almost over head.  It’s changing direction slightly now, moving to the opposite edge of the canal and over a point about 100-yards in front of us.  It slowed, descending as it went by.  It’s absurd not being aware that it’s a UFO but it never entered my mind.  A UFO is exactly what we saw, the real thing.  I never saw one before and this one is really close.  It didn’t get closer than 200-yards to where we stood.  As the craft flew by, it was perfectly circular, about 35-feet in diameter give or take five.  At that height it looks bigger than, say, a full moon rising on the horizon and it’s brighter.  As it moved it made a bright white glow with a hint of yellow, bright but without a strain... easy on the eyes. No sound, I said – it was totally silent.  By then there’s no noisy plane nor any road traffic being heard, no more distractions anywhere.  The craft was coming down, low, slowing to a stop and moving east 100-yards toward Nubbin Slough.  In five seconds, it flew from high over head to where it’s hanging in the air over the levee.  We saw it clearly, parked a little above the levee up a 20-degree angle.  As it descended the disk-glow was harder to see the lower it came, because the angle was smaller and the glow diminishing.  It came to a stop, suspended motionless in the air 100-feet past the ridge of the levee toward the lake, a distance of about 250-yards from us.  The craft became dark.  Two small soft lights appeared, one each side, square light images although not big as windows.  They are reference lights to help us with what happened next.  It’s on edge-view and I saw its silhouette, because there’s a lot of light in the haze behind it from the well lit power plant 15-miles! away.  The plant was under construction around the clock and covered with lights for the night shifts.  It looked like a vaudeville straw hat on edge view. The upper part of this thing was dark but showed a rectangular silhouette, flat on top, and not as wide as its base where we had seen the glow.  The top is a shallow wide cylinder shape.  The top part is three times thicker than the base and eight times wider than thick.  The base is thinner and a third wider than the upper part...maybe 15% wider on each side than the top.   I looked for how the base is connected to the top, curved or straight, but couldn’t see it.  It’s a lame description but it was dark.  When the craft came low and to a stop, I was thinking, ""Now I will see what they’re doing!""  Without thinking UFO I knew they weren’t like us inside.  This was really different.   It amazes me, not realizing the things I know.  Like, how might I know ostensibly never having seen one before?  Did they send me subconscious thoughts already?  And I mean, Lake Okeechobee is a military operating area, and there are rumors we may have flying craft of similar appearance.  But this craft is nothing of ours.  No question, this technology is special. Very quickly after this thought, something happened to me. I didn’t remember it clearly for weeks.  What I remembered instead was, that at about this point we turned and went into the house for a few minutes, then came out to look for it again.  It’s still visible, glowing over the levee about two miles down, past Nubbin, toward the southeast and Indiantown.  Again, we turned away with it still in view and went back into the house.  The clock read 9:45.  Wasn't that something?  Joe said, ""Yeah, you know, some things just happen.""  He couldn’t function either, both of us were subdued.  I was drained.  Sitting in the house, I was tired and empty of thought.  I just couldn’t put two thoughts together.  I went outside looking at things again and found my vision was different.  I could see really well in the dark but soon came back inside.  We immediately turned in for the night without a word.  Next morning it’s never mentioned by either of us, nothing.  Joe never brought up anything about it, not ever.  It’s awhile before I came around to it with him. Months later after remembering most of what happened, I phoned Joe about what he recalls.  He said Nothing.  Months after that I sat him down and probed him to see if he remembered them talking to us.  All he’d say was, ""Maybe they were talking to you.""  And with a grin, he said, ""They found no intelligent life here and moved on.""  It seems all he remembers was seeing a ‘fast moving’ light.'  It’s a clue ...maybe he’s on different ‘time’ than me in this experience.  I’d been thinking He simply didn’t want to remember.  And he doesn’t want to talk about it at all.  At least he knows they came, I’m thinking.  He’s my witness. We saw the most incredible event in anyone's life experience, uncommon in all human experience, yet we lost interest in it?  We turned our backs, headed inside and simply went to bed.  Nothing like this could happen in normal circumstances.  But there’s certainly nothing normal about these circumstances.  Something very different happened that October night.  After they left us, I was mentally washed out, tired and just about dysfunctional.  It’s the chance of a lifetime for two curious people like us, who are no pedestrians to technology, and who earned educations in four scientific disciplines between us. We could’ve done much more investigating at the time, because there were binoculars, a camera, and a 2½-inch refracting telescope, all within five yards of the door from where we stood.  None of it mattered.  We simply couldn’t function acting on our own will.  We had no initiative, none, zero.  Best I could do was look and wonder. After weeks of trying, memory and the details began coming.  I did it mostly while driving to work with plenty time to think.  Eventually I got nearly everything back.  Here’s what happened.  We watched as the craft came lower, stopped, and became darker.  Two small lights appeared.  The craft was parked in the air just inside the levee of Big Lake maybe as close as 200-yards away.  As we watched, something hit me, a marvelously happy feeling and I knew at the time it was coming from the craft.  I thought THIS is a really good sign whoever they are. The happiest feeling of anticipation had suddenly come upon me.  I knew to expect something wonderful to happen between them and me.  They were doing something to affect my mental state giving me a wonderful feeling of euphoria.  It‘s nothing like anything I’ve ever felt, a totally joyful happy feeling beyond description.  I was so glad they were here and understood, waiting for something.  I dared not move a muscle although knew I wasn’t restrained.  Whatever came next I wanted to be part of it.  Next, I was sensing a projection of thought to me, when soon thought-speech appeared in mind in my own idiom.  But there’s some fumbling, because I first heard some unintelligible words and a series of growls.  I thought It’s growling at me.  But it definitely seemed like a recording coming up to the wrong speed.  Sure, as in, they don’t know how to operate their ship.  Much later I saw they were showing me that technology is being used.  It sounded like technology was being engaged and directed to me.  It’s growling, why’s that? ... thinking This might become difficult... how very odd all this is.  Next, I heard the word…Mrep!  (Visitor) Mrep, what the hell is...?  With that exchange we were talking.  It’s like they’re tuning on what I was getting.  How could they know?  Yes, they’re already reading my thought responses.  We’re communicating!  They’re talking with me and the warm feeling of expectation was at its height.  I thought this is actually happening, happening here and right now.  Right now!  Wide-eyed I couldn’t believe it, thinking It’s too fantastic... they’re real, what a discovery!  A man’s voice was very friendly, saying, ""Yes, up here.  We’re here.  You’re looking at us, and we can see you.  You hear us talking to you.  We know you’re interested in us.  It's okay, we won't harm you.   (Visitor)""   At this exact moment Joe said Damn!  Obvious excitement, because he realized he could hear them too.  They’re here and they’re talking to us! But there’s a problem, I notice these speech-thoughts went by really fast for a typical English-speaking dialog. It wasn’t like two people speaking with each other, where more time is inserted between thoughts, where we allow each other time to think in the process.  It was going by as a flood to grasp, near my limit. I found it difficult and didn’t want it this way, but it was also all clearly heard and understood.  There was only time to respond, no time to form any questions, which may have been deliberate.  It seems to account for speed of the exchange.   They were deliberately pacing the exchange so we couldn’t ask them any! questions.Next the voice said…We want to meet and show you around.  We do stop and show others sometimes and they have a good time.  We want to be friendly. Would you like to see everything here and have a ride?  (Visitor) Immediately, a silly image of a guy popped into mind. The guy was sitting in a deckchair with sunglasses, a blue blazer, white slacks and shoes, with a captain's cap. If this was supposed to be an image of me having a good time, it struck me as totally bogus, because I would not imagine something so ridiculous in my situation.  They must have sent it.  I thought nice try. But it’s also okay with me.  My thought in exchange made it okay, because I obviously knew it wouldn’t be like that. It was humorous.  I’m thinking now, these guys do have a sense of humor.Imagine that?  I’m invited.  I was so excited and thought Really!  ...and emphatically thought Yes!  I was so happy, so excited and grinning hugely.  I shot a glance at Joe.  He had on his biggest smile, too, although he didn’t look at me. Quickly, I looked back to the craft feeling they didn’t want my attention anywhere else. No voice said so but I underst! ood a thought to be…Now look here a moment.  (Visitor) I replied thinking Okay ...doing just that. We had switched from our explicit dialog to a direct implicit thought-flow between us; telepathy, explicitly vs. implicitly.  Between reference lights I could see a tiny spot beginning to boil and enlarge.  There’s a grayish-green circular spot and it’s getting bigger.  A fuzzy spot had formed and was expanding but slowly at first. It appeared to be swarming with motion and became a cloud-like image emanating from the edge-center of the craft.  It was swarming in the sense that it appeared to be boiling with a lot of motion and was fuzzy to look at.  It was fairly uniform. Next I saw circular arcs being traced out one at a time.  The circular cloud was growing out of a tiny port on the craft.  Arcs appeared at the edge of the circular cloud at twelve o’clock and moved on a curve to its center at the port.   Arcs emanated from the same point-source and immediately began getting bigger, growing into a tear-shaped envelope.  One of the yin-yang symbols on the South Korean flag comes to mind, the one curving left, but was narrower. In all five or six formed, each growing onto the upper right side of the circle-like cloud.  After they were all formed the cloud became more oblate, squarer with rounded corners.  The envelopes formed sequentially, the first beginning from the 12 o’clock position. Each one was growing on the lower edge of the preceding one. The tear-shaped envelope is a sort of bottle. Next, I saw contents of the bottle growing from the smaller back at the edge toward its larger front at the port.  It’s growing into the space rather than filling into it.  This is a biological process and how it grew was amazing.  The process took only a few seconds to complete each teardrop envelope of its contents.  Growth would suddenly appear in discrete steps, not gradually filling within chambers of the envelope.  I saw its compartments being filled in. Each cell of the envelope is irregular in size, shape, and volume.  It reminds me of compartments of a complex soap bubble, itself being formed of bubbles within the biggest bubble.  The inner bubbles are the cells being filled in a flash-instant of growth.  There’s a tiny pause, then the process moves to an adjacent cell.  The progress of moving between cells reminds me of how water drops suddenly connect together moving down a dry surface.  Just a tiny hesitation before they merge.  The next one would get its space filled, and so on until the envelope was totally complete.  Each cell was filled with different stuff; some of it was light, some was darker color.  The only thing coming to mind that’s similar is tadpole jelly from the swamp I played in as a kid. As each envelope filled with growth, a new envelope was immediately traced out under it.  It would fill and so on until all of them were complete. The envelopes developed in a clockwise stack under each other, the last one! being grown at the five o’clock on the cloud-circle.  When the processing was complete the cloud-object changed its character, getting bigger much faster.  It changed to greenish-yellow from gray-green ...more yellow now.  Next it began coming, moving rapidly down to us.It traveled the 200-250 yards in under three seconds, closer to two.  I was startled to have it come so fast but I wasn’t scared.  As it came, it changed the angle of descent twice. It started down steeply and changed to half the angle at half the distance.  Within the last 100-feet it changed again by half the angle, arriving with a shallow slope only slightly above us as it swept in.  As it came I saw the cloud was 3X taller than wide, luminous but not bright and without distinct features. That is, except for a perfect black ellipse centered in its upper third, the major axis at vertical.  The cloud was symmetrical about its vertical.  That is if you could fold it in half, both sides would match exactly. The black object seemed like a tunnel in the cloud, like a big eye, but wasn’t.  I searched hard as the mist approached, looking for any definition but saw no detail anywhere.  The elliptical feature disappeared without me noticing as the cloud arrived. I feel it’s there merely as a focus, a diversion but nothing significant. The cloud was strange-looking, much bigger than us but wasn’t itself a creature. At its edges I vaguely recall seeing separate forms the instant it arrived, the kind of thing you can see if you don’t look directly at it. They came so fast I couldn’t focus my eyes fast enough.  It’s like they’re on each side of it, the landing party of workers sent by who’s ever in charge.  I’m thinking This is my chance to see something ...but no way. Another interesting point; the light cloud approached low over water, yet I saw no reflection from the water as it came.  It’s low enough near the end and I should have seen it. But it didn’t happen.  For a year the subtlety escaped me, as in, what’s wrong with this picture?   What sort of light is that anyway?  I know that Joe saw the cloud come, too, because as it arrived he hollered No!  Joe felt threatened, and anyone would trying to hold onto normal reality.  Here is his only known world.  Something like this has no place in ordinary life experience… does it? As the light cloud swiftly engulfed us I felt nothing different.  We were immersed in a yellow mist.  I struggled to see something, anything.  Then looking down and to the right I saw motion.  Something smaller was moving toward Joe.  I saw a small person like a five-year-old shuffling past at a half-run followed immediately by another exactly like the first.  I only saw them from the belly down.  The glare of yellow light was masking everything.  No one came toward me.  They went toward Joe, standing to my right four feet away. Besides their size I made two other observations of them.  Their knees are simpler, the same thickness as their thin non-muscular legs.  Their knees are nothing like our thick knobby knees.  When they run they don’t lean forward enough as we do.  Their backs are nearly straight.  Nobody runs like they do.  I’d fall down trying to run like that.  I’ve imitated their posture trying to make a step but couldn’t move.  I’m thinking they’re really lightweights. Their upper bodies are minimal.  As I watched them go I’m thinking There's no sidewalk over there.  They loped past about three feet over the edge of the sidewalk, out over water.  Their loose silvery metallic-looking clothes glowed from the surrounding mist, but less bright than the light.  How many came I don’t know, I saw only two.  But an interesting thought comes to mind. I’ve seen bodies of these workers being custom grown, all six of them.  A biological process happened just before they came.  Seems they use such bodies to work here with us, like we wear our jeans and jacket.  If it’s so, what technology!  But it makes a guy speculate about what form they’d normally take, to assume biology-wear as a work suit.  It’s what happened. The mist was a nuisance, I couldn’t see much.  I looked carefully at what there was to see.  I remember looking at the bright yellow light source at floor level. The bright object was lighting the cloud creating the mist. It’s on the ‘floor’, parallel and even with the edge of the concrete sidewalk but beyond water’s edge about four feet. The light’s a half-ellipse two inches high, eight inches long. It’s the mechanism making a platform under them, extending over the water where they’re working. The light had bright radials sticking up from it in the vertical plane and was located parallel to the edge of the concrete sidewalk. I saw the bigger radials of light are separated at 20-30 degree angles from each other, bright from the source and quickly becoming less distinct, fading a few inches above source. Radials would all shift together at irregular intervals, hopping back and forth, yet holding their places and distances to each other as they all jumped to another position. My impression was, it’s compensating for load dynamics on the platform as the workers moved about. I closely studied this light show until I understood what it’s doing. I looked up and forward into the mist thinking Now, what next?  Then I felt I was going... Going?  It’s really subtle. No weight off my feet or of being uplifted, but a feeling of departure, upwards. Then... blank. I was blanked for a time, because next I remember coming to, realizing I’d been blanked. I was again conscious, present, feeling some air.  I seemed to be back on the sidewalk where I’d been. My body was still standing there just as before.  I felt the gentle air from the canal. My eyes were still closed, although I felt I could open them if I wanted but didn’t.  Seems, somehow I knew we weren’t finished yet. I heard a slow vibration, about 8-Hz, like a flutter. Then quickly it’s gently against my forehead. In a moment it went in. It’s inside my head!  It was not interfering with my mind, I could still think. But I’m being buzzed by a wave, a gentle, extremely low frequency (ELF) wave... thinking What's it doing?  ELF wave was getting harder, slowly rising in intensity and in frequency. I felt like it was charging my brain, like a capacitor, more, more, and more. It kept on increasing, the frequency going up, up, ever upwards.  On and on and I’m thinking Will it ever end? …Knowing it’s going to my limit and wishing it would find it soon.  But it kept going higher, higher. How could it go so high?  I wasn’t happy with the wave continuing upward. It’s tough to take but it went to an unbelievably high level before finally hitting my limit. It abruptly stopped with a pop at the top of my head. Receiving the buzz was an extremely rude experience.  I was grimacing, eyes and jaws tightly clenched to withstand its powerful effect. There’s never any pain, just a force. When it ended, I got released and it doubled me over spinning me around clockwise. I saw Joe's feet where he’d been, still standing next to me. I shouted What the hell was that? Damn!...Thinking I am back.  Have I just landed on my feet? . I’m on my feet.  It felt strange being back, like where had I gone? Physically I don’t feel I went anywhere.  I was zapped hard by something and was afraid, thinking Maybe I’m ruined.  It’s the most physically stunning experience.  I staggered around a long moment, 10- or  20-seconds, trying not to fall into the canal. I was cursing trying to get a grip on reality, trying to get my balance. Everything’s distorted, nothing making any sense as I look around.  For once I’m scared, thinking I might stay this way. The wave was forceful and its release was like having grabbed a 240-volt AC line... new meaning to the word stunning. It also cleared out my thought processes but not where I live in my mind. That part was still unaffected, because I was myself the whole time.  Rude as it was I still had the glad feeling like before. Maybe it’s all in friendship, and if so I’d hate to be on their other list. Good time, is it?  The only thing coming to mind was that they’d given me a capacity test, taking a measurement. But Guinea pig?  There’s obviously nothing else it could be.  Finally I was coming out of it, looking around for them. The disk was moving away, flying over the canal a mile to the east. It made a curious maneuver, a small move to the right to back over the levee. But it did so in a spiral motion, first moving left then rolling in a downward circle coming up to the right, all the while keeping its horizontal axis parallel to the ground. It’s a victory roll.. Way too odd! I’m thinking Someone’s got a real sense of humor in there.  Their job clearly has some humor in it, watching me deal with effects of the Buzz. More than coincidental, the maneuver was for my benefit, because I understood it as a wave goodbye. The little buggars!  They had to know I was looking, like they were watching through my own eyes somehow.  But what’s the relationship and why so friendly?  Well, I’d actually discover why four years later. There’s more ahead about them, you’ll be impressed. It’s easy for me to see their maneuver, because my eyes were so slowed down. My eyes were now like a video screen, with light-paint lingering, delayed in a sort of light-smear, tracing out its path as I watched the craft circle moving back over the levee. I was thinking Fishermen at Nubbin Lock are getting a big surprise as this thing flies low over them ...right ...about ...now.  I laughed to myself about it.  Shortly later I looked toward the Nubbin again, still getting my bearings.  White lights all looked very yellow now, blurred ...even smeared. They’re much bigger than usual although not brighter. What seemed different was, when I moved my head, the lights smeared to over where I was now looking. Then the smear slowly faded. Also, I had tremendous night vision, almost like day. I could see everything around me, up and down the canal. Everything is clearly lit by a yellow light glow.  There’s more. I also had eagle vision at will. I could will myself to have a close-up frame of any object I wanted to see. It would simply appear closer and bigger. Such total surprise! I stood looking at things in a residual yellow-light effect. I could see better by it.  The light cloud was gone, of course.  At the time, there were very few lights down the canal and not big. But that night they helped light up the whole canal. Otherwise it’s blackness down there when there’s no moonlight. I enj! oyed my newly given ability only briefly, because we were washed out and tired.  At that point we stopped looking and went inside but soon came out, again, for another look. I saw the disk glowing brightly two miles down, still near the levee. Back inside the house it was drab, really dull and uninteresting after being outside seeing things. Artificial light so close to me inside was annoying. My vision had changed. I was sensitized to see by different light and its effect is awesome. If the Army only knew that a directed ELF produces fantastic natural night vision.  Fat chance though, that they’d make anything happen like this in a hundred years. It’s modulated ELF. We sat in the house a few minutes saying nothing.  I felt so different than normal, like being at arms length from myself. I could still think but I couldn’t scan-think, like in thought synthesis. It‘s the processes needed for reaching conclusions. Thoughts wouldn’t flow in that way.  Then without discussing it we headed for the bedrooms. I threw myself down on the bed and stared to the ceiling, trying to rethink what happened. In the pitch-black room my new night vision didn‘t help. I couldn’t see.Next, it’s morning ...a dreamless sleep all night. Like flatline, there’s nothing in my head.  I woke up rested with the event first in my mind.  Again, Joe and I didn’t speak of it the whole way to Boca.  It’s perfectly ridiculous, but we’re keeping the same ‘secret’ from each other. It’s too taxing to discuss, besides I only wanted to relive it privately. By that night my special night vision was gone. But my eyes played tricks concerning eagle vision.  Sometimes it’s in, sometimes it’s out. It gave me problems driving, because scanning for traffic in the mirror sometimes a car seemed too close, nearly on top of me.  Seconds later, it’s back to normal. The car was where it should be.  It’s annoying and dogged me for days. Weeks passed. I’m rethinking the even! t everyday while driving. Gradually more and more came back and I wrote everything down. Finally I had it all except for being blanked.  That part wasn’t recovered... if I got my ride after all. PS: Years later someone explained to me that ELF is extraordinary stuff.  It’s like my visitors used a handheld device, working up close while doing me with ELF.  That’s interesting technology, because governments communicate with their submarine fleets using ELF. But there’s a difference. All our efforts need an antenna big as a football field to create such long waves. As a result of the encounter, he wrote four books with the information they gave him and asked him to write in astounding detail.  The contents of these books provide the rationale for our lives and the answers to questions that mankind has been asking since the beginning.",2015-03-26T00:00:00,27.252879687500002,-81.0074328125

The light(s) reached a certain altitude (30-45 degrees up from the horizon) and hovered for what felt like 30 seconds.   I got out of my car to look at it, because the initial movement (and the subsequent lack thereof) was so unusual.  It just hovered there for an oddly long stretch of time, then I noticed the light(s) were red, as though it had turned around abruptly.  It still hovered for a few more seconds, then took off again in a different direction, flying off out of sight, maybe with green lights again.   I should have recorded all this right after seeing it, but my kids (who saw it too) were a little freaked out, and I had to downplay the whole thing.  Can't remember if I ever saw red and green lights at the same time.   The initial ""shooting up"" movement was much faster than a commercial plane, though perhaps could have been a fighter jet?  No sound was heard, though.   My kids suggested the ""hovering light"" was a flying vehicle heading towards us, hence the appaearance of not moving.
