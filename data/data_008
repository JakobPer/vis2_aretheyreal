The object took approximately 10 to 15 seconds to make the transit. The object was in sharp focus, not fuzzy at all. The moon was also in focus at the time. It appeared as if out of nowhere on the eastern edge of the moon, travelled across the moon's face from east to west, then disappeared into the black sky at the moon's western edge. I looked to see if it was visible with the naked eye after it had passed the moon, but it was not. I do not recall exactly which eyepiece I was using at the time, but I am sure the magnification was somewhere in the 30x to 60x range.

It was about 5:30 in the morning and still fully dark.  I had an extremely painful toe which was keeping me awake.  I'd just gotten up to doctor it and returned to bed, lying on my side facing the window with foot hanging off bed to let medication dry.  In this position I suddenly became aware of the fact that something was beginning to pass over the hotel from south to north.   At first I saw just the lip, then more and more of it, almost floating slowly northward. It was round and lit from beneath or within with white lights, not uniform in brightness, but some spots brighter than others and I recall thinking it looked like a tentacle-less jelly fish...why?  I guess because it was sort of translucent appearing.  That's the best way I can describe it.  It didn't make a sound though was no more than a couple hundred yards over the hotel.   I jumped out of bed, speechless and staring in awe.  When I found my voice called my husband and the urgency in my voice bolted him upright so he was beside me instantly at the window.  However in that brief period, the slow, leisurely speed it had had vanished and it absolutely streaked away so that in the space of just a couple of seconds, it was between 3 and 5 miles off.  Thus, my husband only was able to see it disappearing in the distance and it was far enough then that he saw only red and white lights disappearing, but could not make out the shape.  (I'd seen only white).   It was such an unbelievable sight and I am so thankful he saw it as well, otherwise I'd be doubting myself. Made one call, very sheepishly to Savannah police who had had no other reports.  Made another call to a local tv station to see if they had had any.  They wondered if I'd mind appearing on camera as a human interest story but in no way would I ever have considered it. It's almost an embarrassment because most people don't believe in UFO's.

The helicopters and the jets stayed mainly on the perimeter of the objects, which at times were in an area of the sky, of about a mile.

The lights rotated clockwise, then the lead light turned towards me as the object banked, as an aircraft would turn, I thouht it to resemble the B-2 stealth bomber.  The shape of the triangle was incorrect though.  The object was equal on all sides, as the stealth has a longer base at the tail than the shorther two wings (an isosolece triangle).  As the object moved towards me, sped down the winding road, only looking back as I could, to horrifyingly see that this object was moving parallel to my direction of travel. the road curved, and i lost sight of the object over more trees.  A few seconds later I stopped to turn left on US route 6 and saw that these lights were still there.

Couldn't clearly make out the shape, but it had approx 10-12 lights, most white, a couple yellow and red. Hovered, disappeared, and reappeared for under less mminute intervals 4-5 times over approx 15 minutes. It reappeared a couple of times in same position, appeared couple times in different positions but close to original.  Lots of small aircraft in the area which is normal. Our house sits on a bluff and overlooks the front range of Colorado Springs. I was in bed watching TV.  Our bedroom has a big window looking out at the front range.  On this night, there was a lot of aircraft flying across the front range, probably from the USAF Academy and/or Co Springs Airport.  It was fairly clear with a few clouds.  I saw the object several times without paying too much attention to it, before it finally sunk in that there was something different about it--it didn't seem to be moving, just staying in the same spot.  At first I was trying to figure out what kind of airplane it was, but it had more lights than I've ever seen.  It wasn't familiar. I thought it was strange---but again didn't think too much about it--doens't necessarily mean anything.  Afterall, I'm not intimately familiar with all aircraft.  Then I also realized that it didn't seem to be moving.  Maybe it was a dirigible.  Don't know why one of them would be in the area, but who knows. Or maybe it's an aircraft with all lights on coming straight at me---but it didn't seem to get closer---but couldn't honestly really tell.  But then it completely disappeared (all the lights were gone). That's when it got my full attention, and I began searching for it.  A few seconds later(maybe 15?), it reappeared in the same spot.  I looked closer and it's not moving.  It disappeared again after a short time (again less than an minute).  It appeared and disappeared (I think) 2 more times within a short distance of the original spot, and then didn't reappear.  Each time it appeared, it didn't seem to move, just hovered.  It was the lack of movement that gave me the idea it might be a UFO.  It was hovering somewhere over the Academy Blvd business district.  Pikes Peak was to the right, the mountains in the background, and the object was a little more than half way between Pikes Peak and the end of the mountain range to the left.  It's impossible to say how far away from my house it was. I'd guess the base of the mnts are approx. 5 miles a! way. Using that as a reference, I'd say it was a mile from me and was about 6-8"" wide. Perhaps that can help give you some perspective of size. It was much larger than anything that normally flies in the area.  The Academy flies small Cessna type aircraft, and I've never seen the larger aircraft from the airport fly this close--they have always much farther out next to the mountains. I just wish I'd had a camera handy. I had hoped to see it on the news with an explanation or confirming that I wasn't crazy--but there wasn't anything. I have been associated with the AF for 29 years.  I was in the AF for 6 as an aircraft mechanic, my husband is AF, I've lived on AF bases, and I currently work for the AF as a civilian.  In other words, I've been around airplanes most of my adult life.  Also, I'm not ""into"" the UFO craze.  I've always been very skeptical--I have always thought their existance was possible, but since I hadn't had any personal experience, I reserved judgment.  My theory has always been that most sightings could be explained (including this one), the witness saw what they wanted to see or they were telling tales, or the sightings were just military test aircraft.  However, what I saw the other night, has gotten my attention.  There's probably a good explanation of what it was.  I'm hoping your organization may have an explanation or reports from others.  I'm reporting it to you in hopes that you may know of someone else who observed it.  Right now, I dont't feel like telling anyone (other than my husband) as they'll think I'm nuts.  I wish I'd had a camera that would have captured it. Have you received any other reports about it?",1999-01-28T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

As approached, went up in altitude.  Directly overhead, shot up quickly to a pin-prick size, then disappeared completely. At 5:45 A.M. Pacific time, I looked out my kitchen window and saw a bright, intensely red light. The sky was clear, no clouds. We had just switched to Daylight Savings Time last Saturday.  The red light pulsed bright-dim approximately every second.  I looked at it for approximately thirty seconds, noting that it was not moving.  I went upstairs to get our binoculars.  I raised the blinds in the bedroom, waking up my wife.  I told her, ""Come here, there's something in the sky.""  She observed the same red light.  We both determined it was not an airplane.  In fact, we are near the approach flight path for Lindbergh Field in San Diego, and during the event, we saw the lights of a jet on final approcah, and the plane's lights were below the height of the red object.  We also determined it could not be a helicopter.  I would also like to note that it was extremely early in the morning and there was no traffic noise, and we heard absolutely nothing from this object.  If it had been a helicopter, we would have heard the blades. My wife went downstairs to get our 35 millimeter camera (autofocus-type) to take a picture of the object.  I retreived the binoculars and went downstairs also.  My wife took two pictures of the object, hopefully one at its bright pulse and one at its dim pulse. To my observation, it moved slowly from the southwest toward the northeast, but not in a straight line.  It moved in what I would call a Lazy S configuration.  During all of this time, the pulsing of the lights did not change.  When it got directly over my head, it stopped and it seemed like it disappeared.  I looked for it through the binoculars again, and I found it, but it seemed much smaller and dimmer than when we first observed it, and then it completely disappeared.  It seemed to me as if it went straight up very quickly.  My wife did not see this movement because she had gone inside to try and find someone to call. My wife observed the object through the binoculars, and she reported that it appeared to her that the object had seven marquise-shaped lights that were glowing brighter than the surrounding part of the ""structure"".  The largest one in the middle seemed to her to be the one that was pulsing.  Each of the marquise-shaped sections were yellowish at the centers, graduating out to orange, and then red, with the spaces in between red also. I am 44 years old, retired USN Chief.  I work as a Draftsman/Design Engineer for a metals manufacturer.  I have never seen an object like this before. My wife is 43 years old, works as a freelance court reporter.

Many miles away at a 60 degree angle from horizon. It has been several years since the event so my memory of the specifics, such as date, time, and number of objects, is not clear. I was up in the Bremerton, Wa. area on a crystal clear night. It is not a big city area so there aren't many city lights to detract from the view of the sky. I was on the balcony of my apartment with my girlfriend just enjoying the evening and chatting when we both noticed several solid red lights in the sky about the size of 4 or 5 intense stars put together.  They were very far away in the sky. I would say many miles away. They were far up in the sky, probably 60 degrees off the horizon.  I do not remember the direction. And do not want to guess as it would be just that. They were, at times, in formation where they would be close together and then in a split second they would shoot off in different directions of no certain pattern or common distance.  They moved with amazing speed, with no tail, and stopped on a dime and then would change direction effortlessly. It seemed they were covering great distances because they seemed so far away and would cover 10 t0 30 degrees of sky in a matter of a few seconds. Then as quickly as they'd separated they would one by one, in no certain order, come back together (not touching) again as if to huddle. They did not pulsate. They did not change shape or color. They did not seem to move any closer in our direction but for the most part seemed to travel on a constant plain of distance.  They did however seem to move both longitudenally and latitudenally. Meaning that if someone a hundred miles away from my position was directly under them they may have appeared to have a change in depth perception. My first impression, as I mentioned to my girlfriend, was that we were witnessing and extra-terrestrial event. We were obviously surprised and in awe but not frightened. I am very much a pesemist when it comes to this sort of thing and tried in every way possible to figure a logical explanation (planes, helicopters, lasers,...etc.) but nothing I! 'd ever whitnessed made sense. I've only mentioned this to maybe 2 or 3 people and never reported it or followed up because I figured it was pointless. But I have never forgotten it. I've often wondered if there were any other whitnesses and only report it now because when I typed in ""UFOs Washington"" last week and found your site and saw the story about the mother and daughter and the red fireball it blew my mind.  I felt like I should let you guys know. I don't know what you will do with this information but I hope it helps.  I also wonder how you are able to determine if someone writing to you is telling the truth or fabricating a story. Please take this as the truth. I work in mainstream society and am very busy (I don't have time to write fairy tales on the internet). I would not share this with my associates as they would probably think I was nuts. I only do this now because it has always been stored in my memory since then and I never forget it and also because of the account I read in your site. I don't know if they're related but if they aren't it is a hell of a coinsedence.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,47.599319157088125,-122.6697122605364

I was taking a lunchtime walk around an industrial area in Poway, CA on 02/23/96. At approximately 12:40 pm, I was heading in a NNW direction on Stowe Road, 1/4 mile north of Scripps-Poway Pkwy.  I looked up into the sky and noticed a white point of light about 60 degrees above the northern horizon.  It was slowly moving toward the south.  The weather conditions at the time were as follows:  mostly clear skies, scattered cirrus clouds, temperature about 65 degrees, winds from the SSW (both at the surface and aloft), with wind speed about 10 mph at ground level.  By 12:43 pm, the object became stationary at a position about 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  It appeared to hover in that position until 12:45 pm, when another similar object ""blinked on"" just to the east of the first object.  At that moment, both objects began to move fairly slowly towards the west, with the first object pulling slightly away from the second.  Both objects appeared to pass under the cirrus clouds in the area.  At 12:49 pm, the first object changed direction towards the SW.  The second object continued to move toward the west.  The distance between the two objects continued to increase to the point where I could no longer keep both of them in a single field of view.  At 12:51 pm, the first object was approximately 50 degrees above the western horizon when it suddenly streaked across the sky from west to east and disappeared over the eastern horizon.  The elapsed time of this high-speed exit from the area was 10-12 seconds.  I immediately looked back to where the other object had been, but it was gone.  I did not see it leave. I have made the following conservative altitude and velocity estimates: 1.  Scattered cirrus clouds at approximately 25000 feet 2.  Both objects were below the cirrus clouds. 3.  Distance travelled by first object during high-speed exit from the area assuming altitude of 15000 feet = 25-75 miles 4.  Estimated velocity of first object during high-speed exit = 6000-18000 mph It is clear to me that these objects were not conventional airplanes, balloons, meteors, stars, etc.  They moved against the wind, hovered and displayed high-speed characteristics beyond anything that I've ever seen or heard.  At no time did I hear any sound from either of the objects.  There was no sonic boom during the high-speed maneuver.  Both objects appeared as white points of light with no other details observed.  They were both clearly under intelligent control.  The sighting took place in an area where there were frequent flybys of Navy F-14 and F-18 fighters returning to Miramar from training exercises over the Pacific.  However, no military or civilian aircraft were seen in the immediate area over the entire duration of the sighting. I believe my estimates of altitude and velocity are conservative, my gut feeling is that these objects may have been at an altitude closer to 25000 feet and the velocity during the high-speed maneuver may have been more like 20000-25000 mph.

September 18,1997, Thursday. It looked like a slit in the sky to me. To him it looked like a red, round, stationary, glowing light low in the sky not making any sound. It kept changing colors of red, green and white, with what appeared to me to be a beam of white light shooting straight off the bottom of the rounded-elliptical top that kept flashing and changing colors. Two other objects were seen very near, or on the ground. I was looking west when I saw them take flight separately and start moving slowly to the east. They passed within 50-100 feet of the observers. Later that a.m. two more objects were seen near our home. One was a white, round light remaining stationary at treetop level as I was looking south. The other one appeared as two white, round headlights flying from the east to the west, then south. They simply blinked out right before reaching the location of the other object hovering in the southern sky at treetop level. Here is what we saw on September 18, 1997, Thursday at about 4:15 a.m. E.S.T. from the upstairs bedroom of our home. My husband and I saw an object hovering in the sky about one mile north of where we live. It was low in sky and he says it looked like a red, round light that was not flashing and it remained stationary in the sky.It was not making any sound. It did not look like any aircraft he had ever seen in his life. It appeared to be close by and was very bright and glowing. He kept waiting for it to move, but it did not. Then he left to go downstairs to the bathroom and afterwards went back to bed. He looked before he went back to bed and it was still there. He claimed he went to sleep immediately and could not stay awake at all. He left for work at 6 a.m. and looked to the north to see if it was still there and it was not. What I saw was a rounded-elliptical object, flashing red, green and white lights that looked like a slit in the sky.It was low and in the north with no sound from it. The object appeared to have a beam of white light streaming from the bottom of it when I first saw it at 4:15 a.m. from downstairs outside our front door. I am the one who saw the two red, oval objects close to or on the ground that passed near our home within 50-100 feet of where we were. They were at or below treetop level after taking flight from or near the ground. By the time I awakened him, they already had taken flight and I was watching the first one that took off go silently by the edge of our house. The other one had re-stationed itself as a white, round light behind a tree across the alley about 100 feet away. The first one passed by at treetop about 50 feet away from us. I never did see the one across the alley fly away, it just was not there anymore by the time I went downstairs to photograph on video camera the one in the north that we both saw that was still there. Here is what I saw happen after I had seen the bright object in the north flashing and beaming a white light off the bottom of it. I went back inside to an upstairs bedroom to get a pair of binoculars to have a closer look. While there, I looked out of the window to my right to see if it was still there and it was. At that time, I also saw two more objects south of it on or near the ground. I was looking toward the west. They both were red and oval-shaped. They each rose off the ground in an odd pattern of flight. The first one rose straight up to treetop level and stopped, hovered, then moved to my left and stopped again. Then it moved back to the right and stopped again, before moving in a straight line east, toward me. The other one rose off of the ground in a diagonal movement to the left, about half as high as treetop. It moved in a straight line to the east toward me, too. The first one changed shape and color as it approached within 50 feet of where I was. It veered to the south a bit and passed out of my line of sight after it passed by the top of the treetop in the yard next to ours.It was obsured from view by the edge of our house as it continued to pass to the east from the west. They both moved very slowly...maybe 5 miles per hour. I awakened my husband (he worked on an aircraft carrier on airplanes and had a Top Secret clearance that would have been extended to Krypto clearance had he chosen to work aboard nuclear-powered submarines, but he declined, while he served in the Navy for six years. He presently works as a Machine Job Setter. He has been employed by the same company for the past twenty years). He said that it did not look like any aircraft he had ever seen while in the Navy or otherwise. He saw the one hovering in the north while I watched the one pass silently out of sight past the edge of our house. I am a housewife and mother of two children. I recently finished a Medical Transcription course. It was such a brilliant white in the center that I could hardly look at it directly. It did not cast any shadows on the treetop or the ground, which seemed strange to me, too. As it passed by the yard next door it appeared to be round in shape and white in the center with a reddish-orange outer edge. We did not see any solid structure on any of them. The second one that left the ground flew across the alley and stopped behind a tree. It had changed shape and color to a round, white light. I kept watching to see where it went, but did not see it fly anywhere. It just was not there anymore. There was a well-lit moon in the sky, no wind and it was not cloudy. When I went outside to videotape the one in the north, I could not get it to appear in my viewfinder. I went outside to start taping it about 5 minutes after reporting it and having first seen it from our front door. I could clearly see it still hovering there and it appeared very bright in the sky from just outside of our back door where I was trying to tape it from. After approximately fifteen minutes of trying to get it on tape, the battery decharged. I decided to go inside and recharge the battery. After putting it on the charger I went back out to see if it was still there. It was not. I looked around other parts of the sky for anything else unusual and saw a round, white light at treetop in the southern sky. I went back in to wait for the battery to charge up. When I got inside, it was already charged. I put it on the camera and went back out to tape the other light in the south. I was taping it when I saw an object flying from the east to the west approaching towards me. It had two bright, white, round headlights on it and then began to fly south toward the other one I was already taping. I moved my camera to tape it and it blinked out. I looked to see if it was a solid object flying without any lights and saw nothing of it anymore. I refocused my camera on the one I was taping before this one appeared and then went inside. I am not sure what time it was, I think maybe 6 a.m. because my husband had already left for work. I was very tired and went to bed. When I got up a few hours later, I played back the tape of the recently videotaped object in the south at treetop. It was not on the tape. It was very upsetting to me after all that I had seen happen that morning. I went back out the next morning to see if the one in the southern sky was in the same place as the morning before, it was not there at all. I thought maybe it was a planet or a star in the southern horizon and should be there the next day as well, if so. I am still uncertain why nothing appeared on the tape of it or what the ones were o! n the gr ound or in the sky for that matter. It especially bothers me that I can not account for what happened to cause the battery to seemingly charge up in a matter of minutes and why the one I was taping did not appear on the film. Not to mention having seen the odd pattern of flight that the two on the ground made when getting airborne. I cannot compare or identify them with anything I have seen before, neither can my husband whom I told about the other ones and what they appeared to look like and do. To add more mystery to the matter, our computer crashed several times prior in the week to seeing all of this on Thursday morning the 18th of September, 1997.",1999-10-02T00:00:00,39.8946,-84.6103

I was shaking with excitement, as I had never seen anything this large.  I knew the ceiling was low because of the cloud cover, I knew the size was huge, not only by virtue of the obvious appearance of great size, but that aircraft were making landing approach to White Plains airport and appeared miniscule by comparison.  Also, they were flying well under this UFO. I went inside to get a pair of binocs, one of which was hanging from my 4 inch reflector.  The binocs are 20X.  I saw the object at greater amplification, but no further detail. I called out to my wife to come out and see this, (onto my terrace) but she did not hear me.  She was in the shower.  I reported my sighting to a chuckling tower person at White Plains, FAA on Long Island and to MUFON.  I never filled out a report to MUFON, as I was not at all impressed with the caliber of individual who was sent out to interview me.  This also, I recently reported to MUFON.  I have since dropped my membership.  But that's another story. To my knowledge, no others in my condo complex were out that evening, although if no one heard me screaming to my wife to come out, I'll eat my hat.",1999-10-02T00:00:00,41.0222,-73.8125

Suddenly something also caught my attention. It was like the headlights of an oncoming car,but it wasn't a car. It was an object to the right of the moon,slightly larger than the north star and brighter. It was round and looked like a small sphere. First we thought it was the north star but it began to move.  It was very shakey and unstable looking. Then I saw another object approaching it ,a plane. The sphere had being hovering in one place but as the plane got nearer the sphere began to move again. It moved from side to side quickly. It began to rise to the left. At this stage the plane was very near. Suddenly the object shot straight upwards to the right until we lost sight of it.

I have tried to establish the approximate date. I was outside my home, cutting hedges on the East side of my home and took a break.  I was looking at the sky admiring the light clouds and blue sky.  There were 2 cloud levels.  One up high, maybe 12-15,000 feet.  A lower one, that was approximately 8,000 feeet.  I know it was fairly high, as the lower clouds were wispy, not stacked cumulo Nimbus clouds.  I also live 2 miles from Willard Airport, outside Champaign, IL so I am used to watching planes fly overhead as they use the transponder here at the airport. I had on sunglasses due to the brigth sun, and my eyes are sensitive to it.  I was looking East and suddenly observed a round object appear out of nowhere.  The object was circular in shape. I observed the object appear to make a lazy left turn.   The object appeared to be a dirty copper in color and was huge.   I state the object appeared to make a left turn as I observed the underside of the craft.  It appeared to swing up.  The underside tilted up towards me at an approximate 30 degree angle.  I could definitely see almost the whole underside of the craft, and see it's circular shape.  The object then slid back flat, and disappeared !!   I couldn't believe it. Thinking about it, I could not see the craft until it tilted.  This has bothered me.   Why couldn't I see it until it tilted, and then after it returned it disappeared again.  It was large enough, and close enough that I should have seen something !!! Using basic geometry I figured out it's basic size.   A cloud level at 8,000, even less, and an approximate angle of 45 degrees in the sky one can reach some conclusions.   I figure the object was approximately 2 1/2 miles from me.   I live in a small town, and estimate the size of this craft to be approximately 100 feet in diameter, based on comparing barns from approximately 2 1/2 miles away.   Smaller then a full moon. Would be approximately the size of  full moon and add a half moon to it.  Larger than a half dollar held at arms length. I declined to report this for fear of what our gov't is doing.  I work in law enforcement and don't need to be labeled crazy.   I have dated a young woman who has a family member in  the military.  He told her to stay away from Internet sites that delt with UFO's, as they are all monitored by the gov't.  When pressed for mor info, he refused to answer more.  I do listen to you on Art Bell.

At that time we all started looking toward the northern sky, about 5 minutes later my younger friend saw what he believed to a low flying helecopter.

We watched the lights for about 10 mins. but it never got close to here the turbine engines or the hum or rumble of a approaching aircraft. That`s when we all agreed that we were witnessing a ufo, because this object never got close to determine what it was. What we saw was a bright light moving slowly at first then getting faster as it went in a southernly direction. We were pretty excited at what saw that at that time i turned to my left facing west to see the same object i reported before. I quickly told the others to look in my direction to see what i was seeing. This shape(triangle with lights) was coming very fast from the western sky.

Turned away for a minute or two, object is still there in the same place. Simultaneously there is a very bright white object about 40 degrees to the West of this , I'd say due West geographically. I thought this to be a planet (Jupiter?). This object was stationary the whole time. After observing for a few minutes I looked at my watch, it was 20:48 MST. My 15 yr old neighbor was visting my 14 yr old son, and came out of my house. I asked him to come take a look. We both watched for about 10 mins. Green and red object started moving at this time. I went in and got my 7x35 binoculars. We were then joined by the neighbor's Mom and 15 yr old sister. We all watched this red and green object move. A little zig-zag, some up and down motion. It shot off several times and winked out, only to reappear in the spot it winked out from. In the binoculars it looked like a red and green ring, like a wedding band with a yellow white spot like a diamond on a wedding ring. It was turning. I sent for my wife son and daughter to come out. Now there were 7 of us watching. The red and green object shot off beams of light several times. Keep in mind these are objects are miles away so everything looks pretty small, the beams were distinguisable, but not real intensely bright. About 21:15 we started looking in other areas in the sky and spotted 6-8 other moving objects. I looked at several through the binoculars. Looked like the edge of a ring. Dull yellow to tan color, not real bright. About 21:20 the bright white object I thought was Jupiter, suddenly shot to the North and winked out while in motion. It did not reappear. By 21:30 the sky was getting very cloudy, and observation was concluded. I have no fears about being contacted by you or answering further questions. I have not reported this to any Law Enforcement agencies, Military or Newspapers. Please advise proper course of action to follow.

I was driving down 67th avenue, going towards lakewood, when I saw this big fireball type object in the sky.  There were many cars on the road and they all slowed to about 5 mph gazing at the sky.  The object resembled a type of firework, yet much much much larger, about as big, lengthwise as two 747's, and as wide as two of the bodies.  the fireball was by and large all red and went down towards the ground very slowly.  At this point I thought it was a crashing plane or some new spectacular firework.  My view changed when the fireball suddenly began to rise again almost like a dragon during the celebration of the chinese new year.  A week later a person that I worked with explained that he had seen the same thing while working that evening and nobody believed him.  This is an extremely likel;y scenario because i had seen the object over fircrest golf club, where we both were employed at the time.  He said nobody else saw it because they were emptying the trash during the sighting, and during the summer months, the trash is done right around 10pm.  The sighting left me speechless, although I do doubt that it was an alien craft because it seemed to be ablaze, and totally unfit for life. ((NUFORC:  A sighting somewhat reminiscent of this report was reported to us regarding an incident on 04JL98.  In the latter case, the report was accompanied by a video of the phenomenon.  In the latter case, the peculiar ""stream of fire"" turned out to be a helicopter with a type of sparkler, or spark generator, attached to it, and it was doing abrupt, aerobatic-style maneuvers.  It leaves the viewer with an impression of a cascade of sparks.  This explanation is only conjecture.))",1999-04-02T00:00:00,47.2012,-122.5419

The next day in the SeaTac airport I saw a strange skinned blond man looking at me. It was two years ago when I had my first private contact with biengs who I believe are very likely extraterestrials. It happened during a time in which I was descovering non-religious spirituality as a new way of thinking and living.  I was eighteen years old at the time.  The event took place while I was sleeping in a hotel room in Long Beach during winter break.  At approx. 3:00a.m. I felt something or someone awaken me. I awoke to see a brilliant white ball of light floating anD ""dancing"" outside the room balcony sliding door. It was about the size of a large grapefruit and moved through the closed sliding glass door. It came into the room and I had a strange intuitive feeling that this lightwas here to see me.  It moved towards the second bed and then to my  bed which was farthest from the balcony.  It came right up near my face (approx. 5inches away)as I sat in bed. I was not afraid but was worried that it might harm me so I ran to the bathroom and shut the door.  I stayed in there for about 20 min. and then I returned to bed and the light was already gone.The next day when my father and I returned home to Seattle in the evening I had another strange encounter at Sea-Tac airport. As I walked off the plane down the hall to the baggage claim ther is a mural on one of the walls of magicians doing magic tricks.  I had a strange feeling that someone was standing there waiting for me, so I looked at the several people standing against this wall.  I saw a young white male dressed in army fatigues who had unusually clear and radiant skin.  My initial reaction was that he was a manequin because his  skin looked like that of a porcelaine doll or plastic-like. He looked to be in his twenties and had non-U.S. fatigues. He was a bit over six feet tall maybe 6'3"".  He was waering a green beret and he had reddish-blond hair.  He had a very pleasent expression on his face, he looked happy as he looked at the blank wall across from him and then at me. Another thing he was doing was standing in the ""at ease"" position! .  I stopped for a short time to look at him. He stood in this position the entire timeand I left so that I would not get lost finding my father who was ahead of me.  I wondered if I should have went up to him but I wasn't sure so I didn't.  The thing that stuck me about him was his serene, happy expression. Usually total strangers do not behave in such a way and do not stand totally still with good posture. A few months later I happened to hear of a woman in Australia who had encountered blondish aliens dressed in army fatigues.  I also heard of another case in which a woman had telepathic communications with a blond alien who visited her in the form of a ball of light while she was in a hotel room during a U.F.O convention. Finding this out after the encounter made me think that this person might have been an alien.  Since then I have often felt that I am in telepathic comunication with some beings.  I notice that the more focused on spirituality I become the more these things happen to me. Recently on March 13, 1999 Iawoke to another ball of light in my bed room.  It was a bit bigger than the other one and it chenged colors from, white to lavender, to orange, to green, to yellow. It left my room through the window after about 15min.  Also when I am afraid to fly I feel as if someone takes all of the fear away and I know it is not me doing it. Unfortunately I do not have any photographs or video as I was unable to get to a camera of some kind. However, I could draw pictures of the events.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,,

The next part is were it gets weird because I have heard no one ever describe the movement or actually the speed of the movement of a U.F.O in such a way: There are plenty of trees and power lines that acted as reference points and we were not shifting our positions or even our heads (certainly not to the degree the object moved)... As I continued to talk (on my rant, we still had not made it known to each other we were both watching it), this pure white light that was pulsating slowly seemed to move up (up like into the upper atmosphere, not North), and it moved back down, what is strange is the following: The way it moved was kind of odd because it was a keen to watching the minute hand of a clock (you can not really see it moving but you know it has by it's relation to other things on the clock face). It moved in a weird pulsating slow way up and down as I said extremely slowly. I used a utility line that was right in front of my windshield as a reference point, and the light would move above and below the line by some distance (the power line as I said is a reference to knowing the thing moved not a reference as to how big or how far away it was, because the power line was extremely closer to us than the light was). By this time my rant had ceased as I was watching this light move up and down in nonsensical ways. I asked my friend if he was watching the light (his head had been pointing in the general same direction mine had been) and he said yes. So now both of us had watch independently the light move in this weird way. We got out of the car and stood at the front to see it better and it continued briefly doing what it had been doing, before it began to pulsate, I guess you could say at a slower modulation (meaning it wasn't just blinking on and off for longer duration's of time but rather it pulsated at a slower rate almost like a heart beat slows down but more smoothly and of course visually). When the pulsating change to the slower rate, it seemed to be losing it's consistency and actually seemed like you could look through it if you were close enough. It would come back a little strong then go back to being weak but never as strong as it originally was. It did this until it pulsated slowly into nothingness (meaning it looked kind a like how a candle does when the wax builds up so much that the flame is just barley flickering slowly and then goes out very gently). I thought it was all over when the next thing I knew, an airplane, flying extremely fast and low (keep in mind, we live reasonably close to an airport and there are always planes in the sky, passenger jumbos and smaller personal planes, as well as helicopters. So although I can not be for certain because all I could see were its lights and speed (and hear its roar!) but my guess is it was a military plane. The lights on the plane were brilliant blue and red on each wing (a blue light on one wing and a red on the other) and they alternated VERY FAST (faster than I had ever seen lights blink on a plane before), it was almost like a strobe effect. The plane made a beeline for where the light had been at, in an almost perfectly straight line. The plane came out of the West/Northwest sky where Fort Cambell army base is about a county or two to our West (the object was in the North/Northeast sky). I can not state enough how fast the lights strobed from wing to wing, back and forth (I do not know if that is a sign of a military airplane or not, but it&#8217;s the only plane I have ever bore witness to whose lights strobed that fast). I and my fiend do not do drugs, we had not been drinking, and although we have expressed interest in U.F.O. and ""Art Bell"" related topics, the last thing we thought we would ever be witnesses to was an actual U.F.O. If you e-mail people back about their requests, I was wondering if there had been any other sightings in our area similar to this. My brother supposedly has seen a similar object but did not pay as much attention to it as me and my friend had.",1999-10-02T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

I then assumed it was a very bright star. I continued to watch the object, and noticed it did not move. There was no contrail. Suddenly, the object began to fade and lose brightness, and appeared to almost ""implode"" upon itself, until it disappeared completely. It was like watching a star burn out.

He was facing towards the south and the object was aproximately 80 degrees above the horizon, almost directly above his position.  The object catches his attention because of its brightness and that it seems to be moving around.  The object is not confused with normal air traffic, which was present at that time, planets or a satellite because of its intensity.  Observer1 calls his friend out to witness the object.  Observer2, who was a sniper in the Army, easily sees the object and three other objects in near proximity to it.  Observer1 goes inside to get his binoculars: West German, Steiner, Commander Pilot S, 7X50mm with a built in compass. With binoculars, Observer1 is able to see the other 3 objects noticed by observer2.  Observer1 is not able to make out some substance and colors to main object.

It was about a quarter to half mile in front of us and never at any point made any noise. This is very flat land and a still dark night it is impossible to not hear engine noise(jet or piston). Now this is where it got very strange. As it passed to the left at about a 45 degree angle it turned right about 45 deg so it was almost going away from us, as it turned it had to very large yellow light side by side on its rear.They were much to large for standard size jet engines.

We originally were planning on going to Porcupine Mountain State Park to check out the eclipse, but due to the length of the trip we decided to cut it short and stop in Munising which is located in the upper middle portion of the UP.  We found a good isolated spot in the Hiawatha National Forest to set camp.  The sight was right next to a small lake called Hovey Lake.  On the second night at about 10:30 I went to the lake to see if I could spot any falling meteorites(there was supposed to be meteor showers visible for two weeks during that period).  When I looked into the sky I noticed a flash in the sky so I waited to see if it would do it again.  Sure enough it happened again, but this time I managed to spot its location and called my two friends over.  Of what I observed the flash was coming from this object that would glow very brightly and then fade out.  The object was moving from Northeast to Southwest, but did not maintain a straight path( it reminded me of a tadpole swimming in water).  It looked like a star but every time it would speed up it would start to glow bright orange and expand immensly(like when metal becomes so hot it glows), and would change direction randomly.  This continued 'till about 11:00 PM, then it disappeared out of sight.  The next morning at about 4:30 we all woke up and went to a spot that we picked out earlier to see the eclipse.  (Little did we know that from our position on the globe it wasn't even possible to see the eclipse).  We picked a beach in town along the shore of Lake Superior so we could get a good view of the Sun as it rose over the horizon.  While the three of us were lying there on the beach I noticed the strange object from earlier that night was back in sight and up to its same tricks.  It continued to fly high over Lake Superior when it started to go berzerk!  The object started to zig-zag and do crazy loops as if the pilot didn't know how to fly the! damn th ing!  This continued for about 5-10 minutes before two more similiar objects came from the same northwesterly direction and continued until they both stopped and formed a triangle with the other one over Lake Superior. The triangle formation that they formed was huge given how high they were. They must have been about 50-60,000 ft. high.  They stayed in that triangle formation for about 30 minutes; it was almost like they were waiting for something cosmic to happen.  Eventually as the Sun rose and the clouds got thicker the three UFO's begain to fade away.

It had banked showing us the underside, hovering over the median, then swooped over the car, righted itself and speed off behind us.  At that time we lost sight of it.  The underside displayed three small, dull, lights in a triangular form with two dull concentric circles of light.  The shape of the craft was generally batwinged with a central payload area.  The coloring seemed to be a deep slate grey, almost black, leaving a dark on dark image in the sky.  On the ""forward"" area of the payload area there was a half moon cut out with two pointed ""antenna"".  It made no sound and no exhaust.  I am retired from the military with 23 years of service.

I'm not a religeous person but am becoming more spiritual with each passing day.Based on the information my cellular provider gave me is there are apparently forty-five minutes I cannot account forthe eve of Aug.19,1999..There are other events to report; being trapped at Mt.St Helens May 18,1980when it erupted...I think my spiritualism was borne of that... By the way Peter...this is Sharon from Seattle..I tried to fill out a report for you 8/30/99 but for some reason it would not submit..I was am continue to use others pc's while I set up in my motorhome.

I was sitting in my office at my residence, using the Internet, and listening to my police scanners.  The Christian County Sheriff's office dispatcher started having problems communicating with all of their patrol cars in the field.  (freq. 155.565 transmit and receive) I could hear a humming sound that was effecting the radio and I could hear the humming in my office.  I thought that we had just had a power surge that effected the town of Ozark, MO, and that is what I was hearing.  About five minutes had past and I was still hearing the humming and the dispatcher was getting frantic.  She called Radiophone Engineering, Inc. ( the people who handle radio problems ).  I was very interested about the humming so I finally walked outside my residence.  Looking to the west, I saw nothing, the sky was mostly clear but a bit overcast. As I walked down my front porch, I noticed a silver-gray disk object directly above my residence towards the southeast.  It was approx. 100 yards long and 15 feet high, it was tilted at about 25 degrees towards the earth.  I live next to the power transformers for my subdivision, and the disk just hovered approx. 250 feet above me and the power lines for at least twenty minutes.  The humming sound continued constantly.  The disk had a blue, then white, then red light coming from the bottom moving in a perfect circle.  The sheriff's dispatcher was still having problems with her radio transmissions as I continued to hear on my police scanner.  It then moved directly from the southeast to northwest of my location, along the Finley river that runs through the town and disappeared strait upward. Special notes:  Sheriff's radio cleared up after the disk left the area.  Brake lights on two vehicles at Dennis Hanks Chevrolet dealership where stuck on ( two calls to the ozark police department as heard on the scanner).  Many ozark citizens standing on main street right after the event looking into the sky.  Five minutes of time was ADDED to my watch.  Many jet aircraft and helicopters where heard and seen around ozark for approx. one hour after the event.  Earthquake occurred at New Madrid fault line ( southeast tip of Missouri ) approx. four hours before this sighting.

The boys,(ages 8 yrs/10 yrs),were swimming in the Surf with me at Kalaloch Beach, off Hwy. 101. Wa Olympic Penninsula. They both started screaming and yelling and pointing, behind us , up at the sky, yelling, ""WHAT IS IT!!!???WHAT IS THAT?!"". I got up,turned around and saw something BRIGHT SILVER ,gleaming it seems in the sun. No wings. Seemed at an angle. Deep in height. A wave knocked me down. When I looked again it was going up at a steep angle, high rate of speed. Looked white in co lor against a perfect clear blue sky, and was saucer/disked shape. It was travelling so so fast and went far up quickly, becoming very small and, high. I was knocked down three or four more times by the water, each time getting up, and finding it and tracking it until we could barely see it at all. Way up in the atmosphere, it appeared to suddenly change direction, heading more vertical, and away from us up the coast. We screamed and yelled at family on the beach , but with the surf pounding and the distance they could not hear us, and didn't see what we were pointing at.  I have never seen anything like it.  I wished I would have been looking earlier, or have saw it exactly when the boys did. I saw it just after.  I was camping, at Kalaloch Campground , which I have done many years.

I am a regular person.  I grew up out on the Penninsula, and have no reason to make this up.  It seemed to be that as soon as we started pointing and yelling, the object (flying), left.  I don't know that to be true either way, as I don't know how long it was there before we saw it. As I said,  I saw now wings, was smooth, larger, and silver...then when it turned and went up, at that angle it was white , and disc/ saucer shaped.

The second commentator was still talking about the game when he was interrupted by the first commentator saying emphatically ""I want to know what THAT is!"" Play resumed on the field and the camera did not focus on the object again. I waited expectantly for the evening news, thinking that the story would be earth-shaking. The news had no mention of the event, either that evening or the next day. No newspaper picked up the story. Apparently the entire episode became a non-event. Over the years I gradually forgot about it, until about a year ago. I gave this report to another internet UFO site, but never heard anything from them. My story should be easily verifiable. All the networks keep video tapes of all the sporting events they broadcast. Even if the game turns out to be football rather than baseball, going through the videos for August and September of 1976-1977 shouldn't prove too difficult.

Silent propulsion.  Technical performance could NOT be duplicated by anything flying today.  Also witnessed by two adult relatives. Clear, cloudless skies. No obstructions.  No reflections.  Not birds.  Not insects.  Glowing ""metallic"" discs or spheres. While working with star maps in by own backyard, in the summer of 1950, when I was 9 years old, I noticed a glowing object approaching at moderate speed, high altitude, from the west. It got my attention because it was completely silent.  As I watched, the object (a warm colored sphere or disc seen from the bottom) was about to cross my zenith when it came to a complete and abrupt stop.  There was no time between when it was moving and when it stopped.  As there was no sound, I knew I wasn't seeing high altitude helicopters.  And there were no silent 'copters back then! I was exteremely mistified as to what I was seeing. I would estimate the altitude to be anywhere from 15 to 30,000 feet.  As I watched, another object of the same exact size and colr approached the first, coming from the east, at exactly 180 degrees.  When the second object reached my zenith, it too came to a complete and abrupt stop. Both objects hung there in complete silence for moments. I would estimate that the distance between them was approximately twenty diameters (twenty craft diameters). I have no way of estimating the craft dimensions as there was no reference whatsoever for comparison. I can only use my sixth sense. As I continued to watch, the two objects began traveling in a small, tight circle, orbiting one another. First slowly, but quickly accelerating. I was alarmed and called for my parents. My father and my grandmother came out. I pointed the objects out. They had no idea what they were seeing. By this time, the objects were moving so fast that they appeared as a hard-edged glowing ring in the sky! We watched with our jaws dropping. Moments later, the two objects slowed and came to a stop again, hovering in the same place they started. Moments later, one object moved off to the west, and the other to the east. They disappeared into the horizon. Neither made a sound. They flew in mechanically straight lines, not wavering or drifting, but with absolute perfection one could ""feel."" The incident lasted several minutes. We checked the news reports for days afterward but never saw anything. Many yaers later, in a publication similar to Project Blue Book, I came across a reference to a similar sighting by two brothers in Ohio. They described the spinning/orbitting objects as looking like ""Two bright dots on the edge of a spinning record. But what I saw was spinning not at 33 or 45 or even 78 rpm - more like 400 rpm. These were not insects or birds. This was not a meteorological phenomenon. As a young student of astronomy I knew the difference between a celestial object and a manufactured object. I was aware of news reports of ""flying saucers"" in those days, but had never heard of Roswell, though this was a mere few years later. I consider myself to be a rational, scientifically-minded individual, perhaps even more so as a child.",,40.73847222222222,-74.17999255952381

I didn't think much about it, not being familiar with the area, I just assumed that it was probably a crop duster or something of that sort. As we got a little closer to the object, I noticed that the lights were much brighter than that of a crop duster! The entire desert was being illuminated by this craft.  I woke my wife up, asking her if she believed in UFO's!  She was upset at being woken, and smarted off to me ""Why?""  I simply told her that I was not a big believer, but that what ever I was seeing off in the distance was certainly making me believe.  When she looked, she too was shocked. We were getting real close to the object which was black in color.  We noticed that it was not one bright light, but a series of bright lights shining down.  The craft had one in each corner, one in the middle, and several others red, possibly amber, surrounding it.  A semi driver that had been in front of me this entire time pulled off to the side of the road, as did we.  The craft was actually hoovering over the desert with the middle light shining down bright on the ground.  It was as though it were looking for something.  The craft would then move very slowly twoards us, and as it got to where the highway was, all the lights, except the amber lights, would go off until it crossed over the highway.  Once on the other side all lights would return.  The craft was not moving incredibly fast while over the desert but, as it crossed the road it would do so in a hurry.  It concentrated most of its time on the south side of the highway and it passed directly over us severaal times.  It was a very warm Arizona night and we had our windows down, yet heard nothing.

Victorville, CA While relaxing on back porch with my dog here in Victorville on a hot, day with blue skies, except for sporatic cumulus heads, I saw silvery disk wobbling and relatively stationary to reference point (my roof tiles). CLouds moving from SW to NE, but object and relatively  smaller round and white orbs zipping around the main disk. Main disk shimmered from the side and when it turned on its side you could see an inscribed dark inner circle. I had rand into the house and got a pair of 9X25 (5.6degrees) Nikon binoculars. The objects were not affected by the winds above which moved the sporatic clouds at pretty fast speeds. After some time, seeing how it appeared to be intent on staying around awhile I went to find a camera, but only my Nikon 35mm had film and this has no telephoto lens. However, upon blowing up the objects in Photoshop you can see the Saturn shape and its companion which resembles the ""X"" shape of those craft that Luke Skywalker flew in the final battle in the movie Star Wars. THese ""Xs"" seemed to have emitted from the craft, but I could be wrong. THey were hard to see and seemed to leave some kind of visual blur (not a contrail, but could be mistaken for one). I am a college educated professional of 38 years of age, who majored in geological engineering and my wife is a geologist too. I am an amateur astonomer with 10"" Newtonian and 8"" C-8 with computer and am familiar with the local sky. Often we see strange craft coming out of Edwards AFB nearby. Incidentally, the craft would have been just south of the Edwards AFB southern boundary. I can send a map to anyone interested. I am not mistaking this sighting for conventional or any kind of typical experimental aircraft. I am an aviation buff and have done consulting work for leading pioneering contractors in military aerospace. One more thing. I could see jetliners passing nearby and clearly below these objects. So I estimate that if the cumulus clouds peaked at 55,000 feet that the object was somewhere above this, maybe at 75,000 feet. Therefore, the main object must have been much larger than large airliner and the smaller orbs about the size of the airliner. Keep in mind I viewed with binoculars. I have 30 hours in flight training and my wife is a private pilot. I am sending you the photos by e-mail attachment.

I thought it was a big truck, or something but I soon realized it was not. It was a strange object that just glowed and moved around the edge of the woods.

It hovered over head for about 3 minutes, changing colors every few seconds. I can tell you it made no sound, but I could feel the heat coming off that thing. I just stood there, scared to death! Suddenly there was no light, and it looked to be metallic and about 35 feet across. I am not sure what color, because It was so bright before my eyes could not adjust. It shot straight up in the sky and disappeared. I nearly passed out. I could not even go into work that day. All I could do was sit on the couch and shotgun budweisers till I passed out. I still get scared when I think of what happened. I am really scared it might come back. I have had the runs ever since I saw it. Do you suppose I was abducted? I need some help! I had to tell somebody, but I have been too scared. I have not been sleeping, or eating, or living since that morning. I am sure with time, I will adjust. Thanks for listening.

While I watched, the fireball grew bigger, then faded to a long flat object with what looked like wings projecting from the top and bottom, like it was a very long tube like airplane on its side.  As I was watching it move from west to east, I spotted what looked like a smaller large object move in the same direction, parallel with the large object, but lower in the sky, making it seem to be a great distance away.  The first large object seemed to grow larger in size as it moved seemingly farther away.  the second object continued to track the first.

After hearing Ron (sic) Davenport this afternoon, on the local radio station in Nevada City, CA (KVMR-FM), I decided to give my account of the sighting on 01 Sept 99.  Being fairly isolated up on this mountain, I had been wondering if anyone else saw what I saw that evening in the northern sky.  Here's the account, word for word, that I wrote the morning of 03 Sept 99 in my journal.  Having heard the show, I now think my timing is off for the duration of the event.....having believed it was a group of meteorites when I wrote the following, and couldn't imagine such an event taking longer than 12-14 seconds to traverse that expanse of the horizon.  It's easy to lose an accurate sense of time at moments like this. Written on Friday morning, 03 Sept 99 ""It was one of two things.  I convinced myself they were probably man-made, but now I suspect otherwise.  Around 9:30 p.m., after the Drew Carey Show, I went out to ((deleted)) for a change.  Looking up in the NNW sky, just below the Big Dipper, marched a gang of light trails headed eastward.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first.....one of those wonderful all-too-rare gapes.  (I think it may have something to do with the surprise of finding myself at the right place - at the right time.  Sad, that.) The motion was steady, but  slower than most, if not all, meteorites I've seen before....and so many all together at once.  At least eight, four in the front group, were visible during the last couple of seconds, which I viewed with the  binocs.  I wanted to dash for them sooner, but stood transfixed, unwilling to take my eyes off something so amazing for the first 8-10 seconds.  As they seemed to head toward Reno, I took a chance, got the binocs, and watched them 'flame-out' one by one.  It's through the binocs that I counted the eight.....there could have been a couple more in the progression, earlier. The duration caused me to suspect military craft of some sort, that didn't want to be seen as they approached Reno, so perhaps they cut their engines one by one and flew in a slightly disarrayed order to throw off any observers, and glided back to some secret place in the Nevada desert.  But if they were aircraft, they moved fast, albeit subsonic, and the lit-up trails of gas are something I've never seen before at night.  Could the smoke particles that have been lingering for over a week cause that? Went out again the next night (02Sept99), and noticed another meteorite lower to the horizon, redder, a little faster and only a few seconds in duration.....but definitely a meteorite.  So I've changed my mind....from a conspiricy of craft, to a cluster of rocks....maybe billions of years old, coming into land. So incredibly better than a movie."" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A couple of notes in retrospect......using the Osborne Firefinder (using true N), I later approximated the portion of the horizon from when I first noticed the objects, to the time of 'flame out', to go from ~330° to ~80° from my position, or about a 110° span.  A very rough guess, but they seemed to be approximately 7° vertical from the mountaintop when due N. The mention of smoke above refers to the large fires that had been raging on the Plumas N.F. for the prior week.  I thought perhaps some of the particles might have scattered higher into the atmosphere and caused the light trails, but evidently not if others saw the trails prior to the objects reaching the Sierras.  I believe the trails were rather greenish in color, though I'm not sure I trust my hindsight on that. I now believe the duration of the sighting was probably closer to 30 seconds, but still don't quite understand what I was looking at.  Were all those objects with light trails, F-15's with afterburners on, as was mentioned in the radio show?  Were there really at least eight of them?  In any case, it still gives me goosebumps when I recall the amazement of the moment.  Now if I can only figure out how to be in the right-place-at-the-right-time more often.......…",1999-10-02T00:00:00,,

We agreed that it looked much like a shooting star. Wednesday, September 1, 1999 at approximately 9:30 p.m., my husband and I were traveling eastbound on hwy. 37 in Marin County, Ca.  The location was approximately 1.5 miles from the Black Point/Atherton exit.  We saw in the sky directly above our car what looked like three long, thick, fingers of light traveling at a very slow speed, they looked very much like super high beam headlights shining through a thick fog, (there was no fog that night).  We continued to watch this light show while we looked for a place to pull over on the highway.  As the lights crossed directly over hwy. 37, we saw what looked like a small missile, or shooting star, shot off the side into an easternly direction.  The lights looked as if they had come from a north/west direction, and they were crossing over hwy. 37 in a south/east direction.  At the time of observation, my mouth filled with the taste of having bit down on aluminum foil on a tooth filling.  I had the sensation of metal emitting from an upper back crown in my mouth.  This taste stayed with me for approx. 10 minutes after the viewing.  The next morning I woke up with the insides of my lips feeling sunburned. When we arrived home (which is 1 mile north off of hwy. 37) our 12 year old daughter told us that she had been sound asleep and was woken by the popping sounds of the vertebra in her neck, her mouth was filled with a ""bad taste, like a burning taste"".  At this point she looked up through her bed side window and saw bars of bright light going over our house.  She remembers that her bed side clock read 9:30.  The three of us felt exhausted the next day.  We all sensed that what we saw was some kind of pre-empt of something much larger to come.

At first we all thought that it was a flare or firework, but it moved too fast and went much too far.  It also left a glowing trail which lit up the clouds for three hours, until well after dark.  Everyone who saw it agreed that it was not a firework or a flare. It happened at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and at first we all thought that it was a fireball.  Someone even said, ""Look! A fireball.""  We watched it arc up from behind the blocks of flats and hotels on the skyline.  It was a fiercely intense point of light, like a distress flare, except it was white.  It moved very fast from right to left in front of us, rising, then performing a loop and almost immediately shooting down towards the sea.  There was no sign of impact, no sound, no flare of light indicating an explosion.  It might have vanished over the horizon, or it might have entered the sea, there was no way to tell.  The trail it left in the sky, which resembled glowing smoke, we continued to watch, since it showed no sign of dimming, and it fascinated us.  It even seemed to get brighter as the daylight waned.  We waited until well after sunset, when the sky was pitch dark and full of stars, but the trail remainded, hardly dimmer than when it was made.  In fact, when we eventually left, it was still there, so I don't know how long it took to fade.  It was the glowing trail that convinced us that this was no fireball or flare.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,,

I was eight years old. I remember because my sister was an infant and she is eight years younger, born 11/01/77. I must admit that I saw ""Star Wars"" but there were aspects that I only came to understand many (14) years later. My Mother, Sister and I lived in one large room of a guest house on a ranch near Topanga Canyon Blvd. and Chatsworth Blvd. in the San Fernando Valley, California. For a few days prior to the sighting I would walk outside on the ranch. I would look into the sky and say to myself ""I know they're coming, I know they're coming..."" over and over again. After a few days of this I looked straight up into the stars and was only moderately surprised to see one very bright (like Venus) ""star"" slowly move toward another that was about 3-5 degrees of arc away from the first. When the first ""star"" reached the other ""star"" the moving one simply dissapeared into the other. Three nights later I awoke in bed and was drawn to look for where the bright orange light was comming from. I sat up in bed to see about a 15 foot wide circle or sphere of orange light moving slowly from left to right behind some big eucalyptus trees which were on the far side of a horse corral. The object was less than 100 feet away. I could see a, possibly, solid core with a glowing corona around the edge. I thought I should yell for my Mother who was only 20 feet away and in the same room as I. I did not yell; instead I had a very strong urge to grab the 110 Kodak Instamatic camera on my window sill. My next thought was ""No, I don't want to scare 'them' away."" As the light slowly moved down and to the right, behind some large bushes, I yelled ""Mother!!! U.F.O."" She sat up in bed just in time to see the light but not the 'craft.' The next day, at school, I told my friends. They asked me to draw pictures. I drew pictures of the 'craft' changing shape, moving toward me and prepairing to land. I told my friends that I then yelled for my Mother and 'it' flew away. The reason I mention about my 'lying' about what I saw was that 14 years later I went to a hypnotist. I was not seeing the hypnotist for any reason at all related to the U.F.O. In the hypnosis session I began to see my childhood drawings in photographic form. I was not in deep hypnosis so I clearly remember the images, much to my surprise. Only later in life did I learn how children sometimes tend to draw their suppressed memories. I have done very little more significant investigation into my sighting. The date of the sighting IS APPROXIMATE but it 'feels' very accurate. The true reason I picked that date is the 1/9/78 4:30 AM Thousand Oaks sighting listed in this same list. Thousand Oaks is only about 15 miles from Chatsworth. I strongly feel that we may have both seen the same craft. I do know that the year is correct and that the day of month is approximate.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,34.28657054263566,-118.6139007751938

Mr. S was also a good friend of my parents (my mother worked with Mr. S's wife), and with our familiarity, we  commuted to the night class 2 nights a week. One particular evening, Mr. S's wife joined the trip and remarked ""What a funny looking light in the sky"" in an unusual tone of voice. I've seen many UFO sighting in the area of Cloverdale my whole life (due to my love for stargazing), so I instintively reacted to her remark. Sitting in the rear seat, I craned my neck back and looked up at the sky through the rear window. It was fairly dark, the sky was quite clear with whisps of stratus clouds. Hovering over a grape vinyard/Russian River on the east side of HWY101 just south of Cloverdale near Asti. The craft was apparently motionless and hovering at approx. 500-600 feet. It was comprised of a large, central red light (which appeared dome like) surrounded by a cricle of numerous small white lights. The large red dome pulsated from bright to dim illumination while the ring on small lights flashed momentarily and sequentially around the red light. I could not ascertain as to what the shape of the craft was, but there was visible depth to the light formation, but the amibient light levels are fairly low on that particular portion of the highway.

This event I relate to you is second hand, as the participants have died or cannot be located. A father and son were driving south from Montrose Colorado early one morning to go to work in a Uranium mine in the town of Uravan, Colorado. The son was trying to sleep in the back seat and the father was driving the car. About 20 miles south of town the father saw an odd and brillant light coming from the west over a ridge. (This highway was two lane and in a deep valley the entire distance.) He continued driving wondering what the light could be as the Sun rises on the opposite side of the valley and a plane couldn't be a light source of this intensity. He drove for a short time longer and at that point the Light broke from behind the mountain and was of such an intensity as to be uncomfortable to look it. He stopped the car and brought it to the attention of his son who had already noticed the light. They got out of the car and paused in total wonder and stark fear as to what this thing could be. It didn't fit anything they had ever experienced or heard of. At this point other cars had stopped in both lanes of traffic as others became involuntary witnesses to its sheer power. They described the thing as being (roughly oval shaped) of an intense Blueish hue, much like a welder arc but no definite form could be made from it as the light was so bright, sharp images were impossible to see. It filled the entire valley with its light, making the landscape and surrounding hills totally visable. It traveled without sound and at a very slow pace in a West to East direction. Proceeding across the valley and eventually was obscured to vision by the ridge opposite of its entry. They said it was very large and low over the mountain but never gave an estimate as to size. As it escaped from direct view its glow was seen for many minutes as it lazily departed the area. They were both left with a feeling of absolute astonishment to have seen something so unearthly but glad that others had shared this experience. The motorist all spoke for a few moments and had no conclusions as to what it could have been. This father and son only worked at Uravan for a short time after this event but were always unnerved to drive that stretch of road (in darkness or daylight from that point on) dreading a second encounter with this ""Thing"".

But maybe looking toward the East at approx. 75 to 85 degrees from horizon, we saw 15 to 25 objects at first star like in appearance, also seemed to be at the same distance to us as the stars. Upon closer examination these objects were moving, side to side{appox, 40 degrees either way} & up and down. Their movement seemed nice & fluid sometimes in a flying wing then changing direction & slowly fitting back into a flying wing. They did not seem to be flying very fast but if our perceptions of distance were anywhere near accurate they had to be going astronomically fast. Their changing directions often, yet staying in a certain grid seemed to make no sense either. One of the brothers went in to get their parents, they came out & watched with us, and to the best of my recollection we all described seeing the same thing. I think one of the parents went in to call some sort of authority. We watched for quite a while 30 minutes maybe more, honestly do not remember if they stopped or we went on to something else as this was very strange, but not threatening in anyway. I did not keep track of the Brothers or their parents, but their parent were solid middle class or better judging by their house and area of residence.

We had been visiting my grandparents and had left at 10:00 pm.  (THE TIME IS VERY IMPORTANT.  WE ALWAYS LEFT AT 10PM BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS WATCHED THE 10:00 NEWS AND IT WAS OUR SIGNAL TO GO HOME.)  At that time I always drove in the right or slower lane.  It was clear - no rain or fog.  We were coming to the exit to Ellington AFB which was approx. 2 miles to our right or east of the freeway.  I saw a well-lit object on the ground to our right and pointed it out to my family.  I pulled onto the shoulder and was trying to talk my brother into getting out with me to take a closer look.  My mother became hysterical and insisted I get back on the highway and so I did.  No one else stopped during this time, although I could see cars coming in the opposite direction from Houston and on the exit overpass. At that time, the area was not developed as it is now.  It was mostly used for cattle to roam about and feed on.  An almost continuous barbed wire fence about 4 ft high ran alongside the feeder road about 10 feet from the curb.  The fencing had been there for years.  The object was in front of a small grove of trees on the opposite side of the fence from us.  We could see the upper part of it but not the bottom and I am assuming this was because of the uncut grass and bushes that usually grew up alonside the fence.  The object was about 20 ft wide and 10 ft high.  It emitted a bluish-white light from the entire object.  I could tell it was round because the light was rotating in a counterclockwise pattern (my left to right as I viewed it), reflecting off the treetops when it got to the most extreme right of the object and before it reappeared on the left.  The best comparison I can make is that of a lighthouse.  I could make out rectangles set longside down, rounded edges rather than squared off, and set within a thin frame.  Each was the height of the object and several feet long.  The entire object emitted this light and in addition, each rectangle got extra bright in the counterclockwise sequence, one after the other.  This was also apparent when the light was reflecting off the trees.  We didn't hear any sounds, but we had our windows rolled up.  That's about it!",1999-02-16T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

It must have been around 8:00pm and it was just after dark and the weather was warm, clear sky, no clouds. Stars visible. I was the oldest and the ages of the other kids ranged down to about 8-9. We were in our own neighborhood and standing at the end of the street. Exact intersection address is N.W 42nd Ave. and N.W.9th Street The kids started yelling for me to look at some lights approaching us from the North. The first thing I saw was a soft red light approaching us thru the trees. And as it approached closer I could see two more red lights coming with it. My first thought was...what is that? As it came into the clear spot from behind the trees, the shape could be seen....a dark sharply outlined Equilateral Triangle with Three round-globe softly glowing blood-red lights, one on each corner where it would have come to a point if the lights were absent.It was Approximately 25-30 feet tip to tip each side although it could have been slightly larger.It was moving about 3-5mph...this I know because after we got a good look at it, we ran ahead of it in the same direction. The purpose of was to get my friends parents outside so they could see it too.they were only about seven houses down on the same street we were on (9th). And we were able to run ahead of this thing which was not too much higher that the trees... maybe 60ft up but less than 100ft. Well my friends parents Did witness this... But I will say this...I have never really understood their reaction to what we saw. The Father, who had been in the army and in Germany and tinkered with free-flight gas engine airplanes, saw this, and went back in the house and didnt say anything....I think he was spooked.... but when I asked him several times during the time after..even years after..he said He didnt know what it was, but would not discuss it... The Mother was spooked and didnt understand what she saw..now this is from my viewpoint of course... but I know how they acted at the time and remember it.But as far as my friends go, the two brothers and sister, They have all talked about it in the years since....we all know we saw something very strange. This machine, and it was a craft...was SILENT and if there was a sound, we didnt hear it.I could answer questions about this easier in person... because this typing is draining.. I have never been able to forget this experience. I was not afraid but really want to know the answer... I want to know if there was any other reports of this back in 1967 in Florida or elsewhere... and there is more to this story....something related happened 11 years later and about 60 miles away in Ocala National Forest.But this is too cumbersome here for me to say it all...

I was 30 Years old with wife and 2 step brothers, a step sister and their neighbor. My name is Dave Oblad, an electronics Engineer. My wife was 28, also Wendel (15yrs), Darcy (13Yrs), Karl (9Yrs) and a friend of the family (15yrs). The kids where spending the weekend with us. We had gone out for burgers about 6:30Pm. I saw a cigar shaped object on the north east horizon. Thought it was smoke but was too straight and perfect. After a bit, it became evident that it was moving towards Hacienda Heights. I decided to go see what it was. We left the burger place and went to fullerton road, north of La Habra that goes over the heights. We had lost sight of the object within minutes of heading towards it, the ufo having passed into the heights. When we got into the heights, the sun had set and we cruised the roads looking for it. We were about to give up and head home when we came around a bend and it was nearly overhead. I stopped the car and we got out. It was about 100 feet over head. At first I thought it was a big hang glider. We could not see any detail, but the shape was high lighted against the overcast sky, the clouds were lighted from underneath via the city lights of orange county and pomona. The size became apparent when we thought it would crash into a tree and instead passed behind and well over the tree. There was 2 white lights at the rear wing tips and a dull red light at the front center, but not so close to the front tip as the whites on wings. It made ZERO noise and I estimate it's speed to be about 10 mph. It was going against the mild wind heading west. It passed over the top of a hill, so we jumped back into the car and followed the road around the hill, turned right onto a westward street where we saw it again. The road didn't stay under it, so we got out again and watched as it slowly headed for Los Angles over the Hacienda heights. Before flying over any city, it BANKED right and headed north. We couldn't see it after it went into some hills just east of LA. From the heights we can see most of orange county and a lot of LA. I thought at the time we had seen a very strange shaped blimp. I supported the idea that it was some kind of USA experimental blimp/wing glider with very quiet muffled engines. My main reason is that it BANKED and was taking advantage of normal airflight via wings and banking. Most ufo's we had heard about never seemed to care about air or gravity etc. Anyway...It was a UFO because we had never seen anything like it before or since..until recently on the news. I am a VET, Engineer and Programmer with an IQ of 154. No mistake in what we saw. We went back home and called the police. They said no one else had reported it and that they would take care if it (what ever that means). So we see each other on occasion and we still don't know exactly what it was. End Report.

It did not appear to move vertically or horizontally.  It did not get closer or farther away. After a period of time it just was gone.  I did not know what a UFO was at the time.

As we were filling up, the attendant pointed out somthing unusual in the sky, at first could not see it but as I looked up in front of me facing a northern sky I saw a orangish-red colored object/craft. It stood out aainst the sky, it was shapped like a stretched nerf-football, almost ovular, but with cuved top and botton wich came to faded ends and surrounded by a arorea of light. At first the craft was in a vertical positon, and proceeded to move down very slowly at a relatively high altitude(I'd dare a guess of 2-6 thousand feet up) then the craft, well,I guess the word is flipped or rotated into a horizontal postion in place, maintaing the same saucer/ovular shape. It then proceeded to very slowly move across the sky towards the north/east but in a line right across just as it had gone in a line staright down. Then suddenly it bolted of the east and was gone. The sky was relatively well lit as it was fall in that part of the country, and this whole event we witnessed for about 10 minutes. I have no idea how long the craft had been in the area or of other sightings. It made no noise, but all 3 of us concured it was like nothing we had ever seen. At first we thought it might be the exausht fire form a hot air ballon or some other plane, but when it did those manuevers, I knew of nothing and still do not that could do that. When it took off it bolted, I mean....just slightly slower than you can blink, so it went from crusing to that in nothing flat. I drew a picture when I got home, but do not have the original, both I and my  father told my mother about it upon arrival home. That is most of what I can recall of the event, although my father,myself,and the gas attendent are sure we saw some sort of craft-unlike anything I have seen. I have no idea what it was to this day.

I was video Tapeing a paper machine rebuild where I worked at the time. This was the reason  I had my vidio camera with me. As I was going to work that early morning. It was crystal clear and about 4:45 am. I was walking out my door with my vidio camera in the case. From my doorway looking straite west  ruffly 5 mile there is a large hill we call Irma hill, known for the small villiage on the west side of the hill. From my location I had  a very excellent view to the western horizon with the hill slightly outlineing the it, the horizen.. As I was closing the door to lock it I noticed a very bright shineing object directly over  Irma hill coming directly towards me. It was round and very bright and pulsating. I knew right away it was not a star, planet, or plane. When I   When I was younger I was into Astronmany, had my own telescope and farmilier with the nightly skies. It was much more brighter then the planet venius at its brightess point and at its dimmest point of pulsastion hardly visiable. I stared in almost disbelife ruffly 3 or 4 seconds, then reliseing I had my vidio camera with me I quicly as possible bent down and opend the case grabbing  my camera and pulling lens cover off also turning the power on I would estimate this took no more the 7 to 8 seconds being very familiar with my camera. I looked towards Irma hill where I observed the objedt but no longer could see it anymore I quickly looked straite up over me and spotted the object moving very fast in a easterly direction. I brought the camera up and foud it in my view finder and caught it on tape as it went away from me and disapeared. I stood there in complete disbelife asking myself what the hell was that...It took no more then 25 to 30 seconds from the time ! I spotted in the western horixon to disaphere at about a 35 diagree angle in the eastern horizon. When it was straite overhead before I could get the camera on it, the brightness was almost shiney and crome like. there  was absoluity no noice from the object. There was no wind and it was one of them mornings it was perfectly dead quite. The only thing you could here was early morning robbins. Ive had this tape all this time and over the years showed a few friends no one else has realy seen it yet.

It continued straight for five seconds, then made an eighty degree left turn to the n.e. in about a quarter of a second, continued in a straight path for another four or five seconds, then made another quarter second right turn to due east. We observed it for two or three more seconds, then it appeared to vanish. As it passed through several star fields, my friend noted he could make out what appeared to be a sort of transparent triangle shape around the central light, which I did not notice. He said it was rather large,as large as the full moon. We guessed the craft was quite low to the ground.

Immediately, we noticed 2 very bright lights in the western sky and they appeared to be flying quite low.  I assumed they were helicopters because they were too low to be planes, plus they were not going very fast.  Within a minute, we lost sight of one of the objects and it never did reappear.  What happened to it, I do not know.  The other object, however, was within view during our whole trip home.  The farther west we drove, the larger this object began to appear.  As we neared home, the object was nearly overhead and it seemed huge.  It was triangular in shape.  We were so concerned with what it was that we pulled over the car on a side street and got out to get a good look at it.  We could not figure out what the hell it was!  It was at least the size of a commercial airplane, but I believe it was possibly quite a bit bigger...it was hard to judge the actual size and distance away, but it was flying extremely low...I would estimate it was flying no higher than 1000-2000 feet above the ground.  There were a few lights on the sides and one or two in the middle...cannot remember the color of these lights, but I believe they were white and possibly blue.  The object produced absolutely NO SOUND WHATSOEVER.  That was how we were certain that it was not a plane...unless it was some kind of military craft, but rarely do any military craft fly over Rockford, and even if they did, why would they do so at 1 am?  This object was flying towards the south at a very slow but steady rate of speed, but then took an extremely sharp turn to the west, and we then lost track of it because trees were blocking our view from where we had gotten out of the car.

We had just walked up to the top of the hill pulling the sled and Charlie said, "" look Bill, What in the world is that?"".  I looked to where he was pointing, The sky was very clear, with a full moon and going from north to the south was a cigar shaped object which had no wings, no high tail fin no tail fins, it was just shaped like a cigar. There were two green lights on one side and a blue light on the other side.  Coming from the back of the cigar was a beam of white light that shown to the ground in a 45 degree angle, what was so unusual about this light was that the beam was the same size all the way down,( it would look like a laser beam, which we did not have at that time) and it was white.  This cigar shaped object, was completely silent.  We rushed into the house and called the tv station, the radio station and the Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel newspaper offices.  The tv stations said that they had many reports and would air a report on it on the eleven o'clock news and the newspapers said that they would have a complete write-up on it the next morning.  We were informed that commercial pilots had seen the same thing over the Mississippi River. When the eleven o'clock news came on, there was no mention of it, the next day in the newspaper, back in the back of the paper was a little tiny column saying that the Air Force had reports on it and it was the ""a piece of a rocket returning to earth"" and a few months later, the Air Force Blue Book said that they had made a mistake, that it was the "" tail of a comet.""

As we approached the main road, we saw dozens of cars pulled off the main road (Rte 165 - 3 miles north of Jarrettsville) and people scrambling up the embankments to watch what we were also witnessing.  The lights looked like the headlights of a very large jetliner, but as it came closer we realized that they were too low to the ground and too big to be jetliner lights. And as it came closer and went overhead (apxy 20-30 feet above us), it had NO sound, NO shape of any craft joining the lights together.  They travelled in unison, going maybe 10-20 mph.  As they drifted silently above us, several of us reached up like we were trying to touch it, it felt that close.  The really strange thing was that after it went over, the lights were still visible (as headlights would not be going in the opposite direction).  Everyone stood quietly mesmerized until it disappeared over the Eastern horizon. When it finally disappeared everyone just sort of looked at one another and let out a nervous whispered giggle and said ""What the hell was THAT!?!""  No one knew.

My family and I were working on my sister's house.  It was approximately 9:30 in the evening.  It is important to note that the dining room windows of the house face the Kentucky hills and the Ohio River Bottom lands.  We were finishing up for the night, when my sister (who was emptying a thermos out the dining room window) reported having seen a strange ""red"" light in the sky.  By the time we got to the window, of course, what she had seen was no longer there.  Our curiosity was arroused enough to go outside in the cool Autumn air. We were standing on the corner of the house (me, my Mother, Sister, and very small niece and nephew) when from the North, over the house which sits on a hill in front of my sister's house came the first ""craft.""  I would like to mention at this point that I am an avid fan of aviation, and very familiar with aircraft (although I do not have a pilot's license).  The craft was ""elliptical"" shaped approximately the size of a 747 (today) if a curved lines were drawn from wing tip to wing tip and from nose to tail.  It had a superstructure.  Quite frankly, although this was YEARS before the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, I would have to say that it resembled a smaller version of the Mother Ship in the movie that came over Devil's Tower.  It had a band of very irridescent lights on it's rim, which seemed to flash in a red-colored sequence.  There were windows, or ""portholes"" on it's body, and superstructure.  Except for a very low, almost inaudible hum, it made no noise.  It slowly passed over my sister's house, went approximately another 200 yards, and hovered over the fields of the river bottoms. We stood in amazement at this event, and while we watched in awe, another craft, identical in description flew over and hovered close to the first at a lower altitude level.  Then, a 3rd, 4th, and finally the 5th craft.  Once the final craft was in position, it seemed as if they were communicating with each other using the sequencial lights, and some very bright lights on the superstructure.  Suddenly each one emitted a very bright white light, and then went totally dark.  The time frame from fly over of first craft to the darkening of the ships was approximately 30-35 minutes. After the crafts went dark, they each did a ultra-high speed vertical climb, as their form could be seen in the clear, moonlit night.  Although my family and I did not report this to officials (and I'm somewhat nervous about reporting this to you, although for all these years I've wanted to tell someone other than the VERY close friends that I have told) for fear of being ridiculed.  There were reports in the local newspaper the next day of ""Strange Lights Appeared over Ohio Night Sky."" This event to me was proof-positive that there is life out there.  In addition, being a person who does believe in a ""supreme being"" I find it ridiculous that in this vast-endless universe, on this tiny planet, that we are so ""special"" as to be the only form of intellegent life.  The event of the late 60's has also left an embedded desire to see crafts, or have an encounter again.  I find myself looking up to the heavens a lot of times when I'm outside at night.",,38.7915,-82.9217

The object was shiney on the upper section and rather darker on the under side due to being shaded from the sun, however arrayed around both upper and lower sections were dark panels, those panels on the shaded underside were more pronouced then those on the more shiney upper section. The object never moved during this whole duration then suddenly shot in a northerly direction with a speed that was astonishing... being stunned at this tremendous acceleration I yelled at my cousin "" ..did you see that !!...""  he said yes it disappeared,I said "" no it didnt it shot to the north like a bullet "" this object never made a sound, and no shock wave was heard. My cousin wore glasses and I don't know if contributed to his failure to not see the sudden acceleration of this object .......in later years when I began to look into this phenomena I looked over this area on maps and noted there was a Naval Air Station very near the area of this sighting. I have refrained from reporting this sighting due in part to the unfortunate witnessing of other objects dureing other times in my life, realizing that the chance of seeing one ufo is remote, but to have other sightings years apart is even more remote, how ever I will submite these other reports also so that perhaps others whom might have witnessed the same object during those time frames might have some comfort knowing they were not alone, and I would gladly take a polygraph in all reports that I have submited.......",1999-08-10T00:00:00,37.3934,-120.89449999999998

Cutting across the rear of the adjacent school parking lot, a bright streak of light caught my eye. After a few seconds, the streak reappeared and I followed the light in the direction it was traveling.  Whirling to my left, the streak of light came to a halt and revealed a shape like that of a jet aircraft fuselage.  It had a tail fin but no visible side wings.  It had an overall color of light yellow and lightly colored bands of various colors running along the length of the fuselage. The object emitted no sound and there was no noticeable trail of exhaust. The incident I’m about to reveal occurred when I was about nine years old.  For several days after this incident, it was something I thought about quite a lot but soon I put it aside in my memory and never really thought much about it until several years later when I was a teenager.  It was then that I sat down, drew a picture of what I saw and jotted down a few short notes about what happened.  Although this happened some 34 years ago, it feels (the emotion of the event) as though it happened just yesterday and I remember it quite clearly. I was walking to church very early on the morning of May 5, 1965.  It was still dark as I was heading to church to serve at the 6:00am Catholic Mass.  From the subdivision where I lived there were a set of concrete steps from street level up to the back of adjoining school grounds.  I got to the top of the stairs and began walking across the rear school parking lot when a bright streak of light, off to my left, caught my eye.  I looked to the left but saw nothing.  I continued to walk around the side of the school building when again a bright streak of light caught my eye.  This time I stopped and faced the West to see if I could catch this streak of light.  After a few seconds the streak reappeared and I tried to follow the light in the direction it was traveling.  As I whirled around to my left the streak of light came to a halt (at a position about 180 degrees from when I first caught sight of it) and revealed a shape like that of a jet aircraft fuselage.  It had a tail fin but no visible side wings. It’s overall color was light yellow, which seemed to glow and it had lightly colored bands of various colors running along the length of the fuselage.  This horizontal pattern continued up through the tail fin.   It’s hard to determine exactly how far away this object was from me.  It was not hovering directly over me but it was stationary, off some distance in front of me as I faced the East.  It seemed to be quite huge.  I’d say, at arm’s length and using my thumb as a site, this object had to be some 10 feet or more in length. The object emitted no sound and there was no noticeable trail of exhaust such as there would be from a typical aircraft moving through the sky.  My gaze was so fixed on the object itself I cannot say whether or not the object’s illumination cast light on the ground or nearby homes (less than 100 feet away) that it seemed to be hovering over.  I stood there looking at this object for what felt like a full minute.  First in awe at something I had never seen before and then extreme fright.  I turned and began to run as fast as I could around the school and toward the church.  I could feel my heart pounding and as I began to run my legs felt wobbly and I fell down.  I got up but again my legs felt very heavy and I fell a second time.  I began to cry and covered my face.  I felt that if I could cover my face I would be safer.  After what seemed like a minute or two, I got up and was finally able to run but all the while feeling like the object was still stationary in the sky.  I ran all the way to the church, opened the front door and went in.  I was 9 years old at the time. Although I always have had an interest in space exploration and science fiction I do not remember being preoccupied with such stories before this event that could have led me to dream or make up this story.  I do admit that when this event occurred I did embellish the story about physical evidence that would indicate the object did appear.  I thought that my parents or other adults would never believe me without this added information.

I was 13 years old and was leaving a doctors office in the company of my mother into the parking lot when we looked up slightly and noticed a silver-shaped disk stationary in the sky against the blue sky. There were scattered clouds here and there that were moving rather briskly across the sky at the time. We stood there for a while and some passers-by saw us looking and looked up as well wondering what it was we were looking at. About a minute or so after that it started to slowly move from its 10 o'clock position ( from our POV ) across the sky to about 2 o'clock ( against the wind ) where a small cloud was, like some others in the sky, moving briskly. Well, it entered into or behind the small cloud and the cloud just continued moving. I expected to see this object emerge from behind the cloud but it didn't although we stood there for a while until the cloud passed out of sight. The sun was low to our backs during this sighting. This was the first and only time I have clearly seen anything like this. We never reported it ( to whom??) but it is significant in that it was just a day or so before the ""Great New England Blackout"" so my approximate date of sighting can be narrowed further. I don't remember the exact day of the blackout. I think it was a week or so after that Life Magazine came out with their famous "" Week of the Flying Saucers "" issue.

See e-mail from Craig Johnson, dated 30SE99.))   Earliest encounter, half-moon shaped object shot paralyzing light beam through bedroom window. I've always been reluctant to report this (and another I'll be posting) until I found this website.  This event occured when I was right around 5 years old, so although the memory burns bright, the exact date & time is an approximation.   It was winter, and near Christmas - and also happened very late at night.  But I know I got the year right. :)  Late on an early winter night in 1968, I was awakened by a medium bright whitish or bluish-white light coming in through the window. It was many times brighter than any moonlight could ever be.  When I toddled out of my bed and stepped into the beam, I quickly became paralyzed and unable to move. The object I could see out the window had the appearance of a half-moon, but was tilted at a bizarre angle and the ""flat"" side wasn't flat, it had a kind of scalloped edge like you might see on the tops of medieval castle towers. It appeared about double or triple the size of the moon, from my perspective. Being so young at the time, it's really difficult to estimate; but I'd say it was hovering in place no more than a few hundred feet away, probably 150 or so feet in altitude.  I don't remember any sound, no haze or mist appeared around it (the outline was sharp and vivid), and I don't remember seeing any aliens. Just the object and the bright beam of light it shone upon me. What I remember after that is very little; but immediately after the light went away my hearing was highly enhanced; a pin dropping or a floor beam creaking would sound like a piece of rebar being slammed down onto concrete; and I had (what I might now describe as) a kind of altered sense of awareness for hours afterwards. Following this night, I had very freqent and repeated (often nightly) instances of a kind of dream-like state, but each would start the same: square or rectangular blocks of brilliant yellows, greens and blues would appear in my visual field; rapidly appearing and superimposing themselves over previous ones; shortly thereafter an area of scintillating green would appear at the center. My hearing would be ""enhanced"" as it was the night of the event. At this point, I'd become paralyzed and unable to move; yet would be wide awake; often this would occur well before I'd even start to fall asleep or would occur in broad daylight while playing or at the table. A sense of great fear accompanied these.  Over many years, I learned a technique that would ""snap me out"" of these most of the time; and after that they slowly decreased and finally, virtually disappeared by the time I was 20 or so.  Only rarely, do these ""visions"" ever appear anymore, and I can almost always abort them before they go into their fear-inducing paralytic stage. I firmly believe I was visited; and always have believed.  But who do you tell? Until now, only a couple of people over all these years have ever known. It's time for this to come out and become public.",,58.53633908045977,-134.71346206896553

The sun was down but you could make out the horizon line.  I saw a circular light approximately the size of a dime held at arms length, travel across my field of vision, above the horizon line.  It was green, hazy on the edges and traveled across my field of view and disappeared below the horizon in 5 to 10 seconds.

The Pa Air National Guard continued to operate a few planes but not fighters. 2) The airport was not ""across the river"", but small planes used the New Cumberland airport, on the York County side of the river.  Some large-scale maps (Rand McNally Road Atlas of US, Canada, Mexico, 1979 Edition) show 1 airport symbol at New Cumberland, location of old airport.  Maybe this report comes from someone not familiar with area, although the mention of Swatara Creek suggests this is not the case. 3) The object had red top and bluish bottom, suggest astronomical object near horizon in conditions of atmospheric refraction. Sun had set, but sky was overcast. 4)  Details remembered, such as exact air temp ""about 55"",  yet nine years off in the date, is a puzzle.  Other details suggest fantasy.  Jets seemed to take time to come from ""across river"", yet Olstead is at M'town, jets would be airborne and be there already! The Three Mile Island accident occurred in 1979, two years after 1977, not one year later. 5) Size of object ""30 '"" is simply an assumption, as is the distance.  Jumping from 10 to 11 oclock could have been autokinetic motion of the eyes. Conclusion: the object may have been astronomical.  The event either happened at least nine years earlier or details were imagined or fabricated. The report was made 20 or 30 years after the event.

I remember we had found about three different lights that seemed to pulsate red,white, & blue but our science teacher had warned us in all the excitement that the atmosphere can make starlight pulsate.  The lights were far enough away to be indistinguishable from stars.  We tried to convince ourselves we were seeing UFOs but they weren't moving. So we were about to call it quits.  But while we were looking at the brightest of the pulsing lights, it glowed even brighter for a second, then streaked to its left, then up and to the right, completely out of sight.

He didn't see anything and smiled and went back inside.  It moved so fast, it was incredible.  I still get chills when I think about how it streaked out of sight right before my eyes.

Being the gadget guy that I am, I was fascinated by how humans had put into orbit such crafts.  I usually would observe 5 to 7 satellites a night before retiring to bed.  Then at around 9:30 p.m., I observed 3 satellites that were closely and perfectly equidistant from each other.  The trio caught my special attention.  I thought I was so lucky to have been witnessing a rare coincidence.  They were moving with identical velocities from North to South.  One object led the other two.  Then, without warning, they all STOPPED for at least a full second!  The manner in which they stopped really surprised me because they did not slow down to a stop but simply stopped dead in their tracks.  Then they moved again immediately with the previous velocities, but in three different directions: the leader continued southward, one went 45 degrees to the left, while the third one went 45 degrees to the right.  It was an amazing sight.  I watched them all until they disappeared into the horizon.  Even at that time, I thought about what technology, if earthly, could do that... or from which country.  But to this date, over 21 years later, I know of absolutely no air or space craft technology that could do what those three objects did.

I got onto route 4 west about 1:30 - 2:00 am I just pulled onto the highway when i noticed on my left side on the east bound lane I saw what i thought was a helicopter i slowed down to look at it and i took a good look at it and i knew it was'nt a helicopter. I rolled down my window to look at it and i did'nt hear any engine sound it was silent. When i noticed it was cigar shaped i got scared and steped on the gas to get away.

It stopped and hovered in silence across the other side of the highway.I got out of my car and there was a dead silence it moved from the tree tops down to the front of the trees and i could see inside the windows on the side of the craft and i saw two figures that did'nt look like human beings and when i saw that i jumped into my car and sped off to the on ramp of route 17 north i looked behind me and it was following me and i don't remember getting on route 17 north the next thing i remembered was i was pulling into my driveway in Middletown New York and it was daybreak the sun was starting to come up It was about 5:00am.

Next made a bee line to our car, then shot straight up. Awesome color as it shot skyward. I heard Peter Davenport on Art Bell mention that he would like people to report their UFO sightings, even if they are in the distant past.  My incident occurred in the summer of 1978, sometime in August.  My father was a pilot on many occassions flew the family to California to visit relatives.  We returned to the Pendleton airport and were on the way home when the indident occurred.  It happened approximately half way between Pendleton and Athena in the state of Oregon.  I was only eight at the time, and as a child could never sleep in the car.  The car we owned at the time was an Audi, which had a shelf-like dash behind the rear seat.  I often used the shelf as a rest as I looked out of the rear window to view what we had passed.  That night was no different, and I rested my elbows on the shelf and looked out the window.  The sky was overcast, as evident by the lights Pendleton reflecting off the low clouds, but the ceiling was relatively high due to the fact that the red warning light was visible on a tower located on Cabbage Hill.  The object in question was seen soon after turning around in the back seat to look rearward.  Before the object was actually seen, a pulsating glow was first observed through the clouds that appeared greenish in color.  A few seconds after noticing the change in cloud color a turquoise-green ball of light appeared as it dropped from the cloud ceiling.  It hovered exactly half the distance between the cloud ceiling and the ground, just to the left of the towers on Cabbage Hill.  The object emitted enough light to reveal the trees and grasses around it.  The object remained hovering for several more seconds, and the best way to describe its action was as if it was looking for something.  Our car was the only car on the road for as far as the eye can see, and it didn't take long for the object to pick something out.  In a flash the object was streaking directly toward us, and it took no more than two or three seconds to traverse the distance that seperated us from it.  I was unable issue a warning partly because I was frightened and partly due to the rapidity of the entire event. I thought that the object was going to hit us, when it shot straight up and disappeared into the clouds.  I feel that it is important to emphasize that the at no time that the object moved was there any type of arcing trajectory or slow graceful movements.  All movement and change in direction was rapid, quick, and at angles I know could not be made by conventional aircraft.  When the object shot straight up into the sky the entire interior of the car and the surrounding area turned a brilliant turquoise colored, no other color could be seen.  It was as if everything had faded to turquoise. Everyone else in the car was asleep, except for my father who was driving, and did not witness the incident.  My father only withnessed the aftermath of the object's departure as the world around us turned that brilliant color.  Events immediately after the sighting is fuzzy, and I am not sure if my father pulled over, or continued to drive, but I then told him what I saw.  sometime later he contacted one of his buddies in the Airforce that had some knowledge of certain aircraft and asked him if he knew of any experimental aircraft that looked like, and could move like the object I had described; he said no.  Rumor has it that the object harrassed a nearby airplane and then was seen near Mcnary dam on the Columbia river.  Although the event lasted no more than ten seconds, the memory and detail is embedded in my brain as if it happened yesterday. I know that this event happened quite a long time ago, but I figure that it is better late then never when reporting the incident.  I'm sure your organization can use this information to establish a timeline regarding this type of object.  I didn't report this incident not because I was afraid of being branded a kook or a weirdo, but rather because it happened so long ago.  I am also aware that many of the sightings are associated with natural or man made aircraft.  This object was in no way, shape, or form a conventional aircraft.  I have also been told that what I had seen was St. Elmo's Fire or ball lightening.  I've seen St. Elmo's Fire associated with the numerous types of aircraft I have flown in while in the army, and I have seen the beautifully graceful movements of ball lightening while in Panama, again while in the army.  There is no way that the actions and speed of the object that I saw could be described by either of these types of natural phenomenon.

The second was a SHOCK WAVE perhaps fifty miles in FRONT of the object, of super compressed air which also was forming streamers, but of a much larger diameter, like pushing a large flat serving bowl.  The intensity of the object did not diminish, and it passed right on through the atmosphere and out again, into space.

Small white light in same location shone beam.  When Beam turned off the light source changed colors several times, then silently flew away at extreme high speed straight and climbing. The time of my first sighting was during the pre -Christmas season of 1959.  At that time my husband had completed some college in the electrical engineering program.  He is now a forty year computer professional.  I was a high- school grad at that time but now have a  B.A. in psychology.  I was pregnant with my first child. My husband and I were driving from Highland Park, CA to Hollywood, he was behind the wheel and I sat beside him.  We were at the intersection of Eagle Rock Blvd. and Verdugo Road.   Because the traffic was very heavy we had to sit through several signal changes. While waiting at that intersection, my attention was drawn to an enormous intensely white aerial light.  The view occupied a minimum of four inches of the top left quadrant of the driver’s side windshield.  (That put it south-west of our location.)  My first thought was that it must be a nearby helicopter operating some sort of huge search-light.  But I quickly realized that it was too large and too stationary to be a helicopter (it did not even waver).  After watching it for a couple of minutes, I asked my husband what it was, but he didn’t know. I kept watching it as we approached and finally crossed the busy intersection.  Then we drove a short distance up the hill on Fletcher Drive below Forest Lawn Cemetery before we pulled to the curb and parked.  Being parked on the hillside put us much closer to the altitude of the object which was about a quarter of a mile to the south-west (at most) and probably no more than fifty feet higher than us. My husband got out of the car to have an unobstructed view.  I declined, wanting to stay out of the cold night air.  As I recall, we communicated about what we were watching through the open driver’s window.  The light was completely motionless and silent. We saw no apparent structure above or around the light (that doesn’t mean that there was no structure, only that we could not see the structure).  It appeared to be an enormous two-dimensional intensely bright white disk- shaped light source.  (It was more intense than advertising search-lights.)  Below it was a clearly defined, sharp edged, three-dimensional field of illumination.  Within that field of light which encompassed the rooftops of some old buildings, everything was as clear as if it were daylight.  My impression was that the buildings were turn of the century hotel or business structures.  My memory for the details of the experience is growing hazy, but I don’t believe the light reached all the way to the ground. Based roughly on the assumed sizes of the rooftops and their geometric relationship to the disk I estimated the size of the disc to be about",,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

The incident posted on 9/12/99, regarding the 7/4/1969 sighting over Otis AFB was accurate, except the correct year was 1968.   I was with the 552nd Air Police Squadron and on the evening of 7/4/1968, I was guarding the Falmouth Gate-one of the three perimeter gates.  That evening was uneventful until ~2100 hours.I received an urgent phone call from my Sergeant, who ordered me to close the Falmouth Gate, adding that we had been placed on Full Base Alert!  After approximately 1 hour, he called back to say that the Alert was over and to re-opened the Gate.  Later,the SGT came out and informed me that there had been an actual UFO hovering over our underground missile site; that our F-4 jets had scrambled and were on an intercept course. The intruder then initiated a 360`maneuver, accelerated at an unimaginable speed and was gone. ((END))",,,

It hovered for awile and then it was gone in a flash.  It was not Fixed, Rotary, or any other known flying craft I know of!  22 years in Aviation Industry! I was heading back to my post with friends and family when visiting in PA and was retuning to Camp Lejuene NC as I was an active duty Marine.  We were heading southbound on Interstate very late in the evening.  The vehicle was a 1965 Chev. with a sloped back window.  I was a passenger in the back with my wife and my friend and his wife and sleeping young son was in the front.  I leaned my head back, and saw what appeared to be a bright object moving swiftly across the sky and doing erratic right angle fast turning manuevers at 1st I thought it may be a reflection, so I rolled the window down to get a better look and saw that it was in fact something in the sky!  Well, it ws cold so I immediately got objections from all the other passengers!  But I continued tracking it and saw that it was getting much closer and following a similar path path as we were!  At it's closest point it was less than 300' to my left and was totaly clearly visable as a saucer shaped craft!  Up to that point in my life I did not have any desciption or drawing of what I saw, since then I have seen T.V. programs, movies and Newspaper descriptions of what others saw since then that summed up what I saw.  I grew up just below the flight path for final approach for Philadelpia Intl Airport, and was always around military aircraft during my military career, I know beyond a shadow of any doubt, that what I witnessed was in fact not of this earth's technology!

It really drew my attention not only because it was low but you never see any aircraft flying in that direction over my house because of the circling pattern of all of the aircraft waiting to land at Lambert Field.  Have also seen a bright green light falling to earth but it burned out right above my privacy fence so maybe SOME of the reports of the bright green glowing fireballs are just meteor showers even tho I must say I have never seen bright aqua-green meteors before.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,38.772866865671645,-90.55506208955224

I looked out the passenger side of the car and saw a saucer shaped U.F.O. flying past the car heading towards the ground. My dad, who was driving, said ""look at that"". I turned to see hom looking out the top of the windshield of the car and I looked up.  There was another U.F.O. flying over the top of the car, heading towards the ground and over the highway.  I remember him saying ""There's no engine noise"".  The U.F.O.'s were a bright, but not blinding, white light.  The one that flew over the car, I could see the underside, which was dark.  But I could see rounded shaped objects, about 3 or 4. Perhaps lights enclosers?  The U.F.O.'s then both flew towards the Highway meeting near the ground. Then they BOTH WENT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE DARK SKY, SIDE BY SIDE. They seperated once they got very high into the sky.  One went over to the left and the other went towards the right..  There they sat still, real high in the sky.  The one on the left, I was able to watch a while, was blinking on and off it's light. The U.F.O.'s were saucer shaped, and they were of a white light. They whistled when they were traveling at a great speed.  It sounded like the front window vent opened of a truck or like the window vents of the older cars of the sixty's.  The whistleing became louder as they went past us.  The light coming off the U.F.O.'s was bright, but NOT a blinding light.  I was amazed, to say the least.  My dad to this day will NOT talk about it. The U.F.O. that went over the car was round and dark when I looked up, but as it came down in front of the car, I was able to then see the sides of it. It also was a white lighted, and saucer shaped.   The two U.F.O.'s then met each other, VERY close to the Highway, in front of us, ABOUT (Approx.) 200 hundred yards, then they shot STRAIGHT UP, side by side, into the sky.  They seperated, once they got very high into the night sky.  The one on our left, went to the left and the one on our right went towards the right.  I sat there watching the one on the right out the right side of the car for as long as I could see it.  It moved around a bit, from side to side, then it sat still.  It looked like a star at that point.  It was blinking on and off it's light.  We were traveling on I-4, heading East towards Deltona, where my parents live.  We were out side city limits of Altamonte Springs, Florida.  I want to say around Lake Mary, Florida when we saw them.  I have read many books of U.F.O.'s since then.  My father still will not talk about it when ever I bring it up, which is very frustrating for me.  The U.F.O.'s were Approx. 40 feet in Diameter. I was absolutly amazed when they shot straight up.  Nothing happened to the car while we observed this.  There were other cars on the Highway, besides us.  The cars that were heading West, on the other side, looked like they slowed down a bit when the U.F.O.'s were coming down in front of us.  I talked to a Mr. ((name deleted)) about my story once, back in about 1994.  He claimed that he was a U.F.O. researcher and he knew people that seriously researched U.F.O.'s.  I felt really good telling him about it.! I wasn' t met with ""yeah right"" sort of thing that most people react to.  I have NOT told any one else about it exept my husband and of course my mom upon arriving to my parents house.  I know that my dad has not told anyone.  I have only gotten him to say that he saw ""Something"".  I am now 42 years old. I was 31 years old when we saw the U.F.O.'s in the Fall of 1988.  My dad is now in his 70's.

I at first thought it was the same plane that made it doubling back along it's own contrail, but the shape of the craft was so radically different than anything I had ever seen, I was amazed. Then the strange craft made a high speed right angled turn followed almost instanly by another, and then disappeared completely in the clear blue sky right next to the contrail! 5 or 10 minutes later, a nieghbor boy [about 14 or 15] stopped by, and I excitedly started telling him about what my wife and I had just seen.  The lingering contrail was still there, as I pointed out to him where we had just seen the strange craft, and he looked and said ""I see them!""  I replied ""Them? Whadda ya mean,*Them*?  He said ""Now there is like 3 or 4 of them.""  I quickly stepped over to where he was and low and behold, I saw 4 metallic spheres, in the same area where I had seen the single angular craft just minutes earlier, even as we watched, the spheres covorted lower and closer to us, and then the young man said look, there are more over there!  Off to the right we spotted several more spheres, and within a minute or so the entire area to the east and south east of us was literally filled with the spheres. I was, with great difficulty able to count 12 but there could have been a few more, as they were each moving independantly this way and that. During this time, a small conventional aircraft came into site and we were able to compare the airplane's look and sound with the spheres which were heigher and completely silent.  A little later a sea gull flow under the strange spheres and we could compare the gull with the spheres.  I estimate the spheres came as low as about 1,000 feet, and perhaps 500 to 600 feet from being directly overhead.  Some were heigher and some where lower and when one would ""wink out"" it was as if someone flipped off a switch.  They would disappear instantly and reappear [or not] in a different location. About two years earlier I had seen in broad daylight a single metallic like sphere in this same location, and this one appeared to be about 100 feet off the ground at about 150 yards and appeared at this distance to be about the size of a volkswagen bug.

We thought at first that there was a car up there, but then became confused because of the strange way the light was acting. It kept growing stronger over a period of about 15 seconds.  We then thought maybe it was a helicopter, but there was a noise. Not even a noise really. I've only been able to describe it as more of a vibration operating outside the range of human hearing. It seemed to have the properties of a very low cycle oscillation and a very high oscillation at once. It was very eerie. Anyway, as the light grew brighter (around 15 seconds elapsed so far) This gigantic blue-green ball appeared over the ridge. It seemed to shimmer and pulsate a blue-green light.  It was very bright and light up the valley(mountainous logging type area) we were in. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and tears well up in my eyes. It was clearly a gigantic glowing sphere. It hovered there for around a minute, it was about 1-2 miles and it wa huge. I'm guessing at least 1/4 mile across. I mean, it was ridiculous. It lit up the entire area like day. After standing there in complete and utter awe of of this thing for around a minute saying things like, ""holy ((deleted))!"", my friend and I began to run down the road in the direction of the sphere. Believe it or not, we were yelling,""take us with you!"". We got about 50 yards and the mammoth sphere started to rise straight upwards.  Its speed seem to increase at an exponential rate (slowly, then faster and faster). The time from the begining of it's accent until it was completly out of sight(on a partly cloudy night) was about 3-4 seconds. It moved very very fast the last second or so. It was very dis-appointing. For a moment we both thought we could make it up that ridge. I think I was in some variation of shock. It wasn't until the sun came up that I could really see how big the ridge was that it came over and the surrounding area. It was then that I concluded that it must have been about 1/4 mile wide.

I traveled Bub Wilson Road on the way to work from Saddlewood Subdivision toward Union Road every day. Each morning, before daybreak,  on the way to work I saw a triangle formation of three lights in the sky, west of Bud Wilson Road. Knowing that their is a small public airport in that direction, I did not think much of it the first morning. The formation looked as though an airplane had a nose light and two wing lights. The formation changed as though the airplane was making performing maneuvers(sp?. I thought it was odd though, because I lived around the airport for thirty years and know what to expect as far as how airplane sound and look. This aircraft had no sound and the lights seemed to stretch apart and contract further that a normal light formation  on any aircraft that I had ever seen. The next morning, I saw it again. This time I slowed down to get a better look. Once again, the formation was very odd and their was no sound. Their is a mojor International Airport aprox. 20 miles past the small public airport that I mentioned earlier, so I thought that perhaps I was witnessing landing trafic at that airport. But that did not turn out to be the case either. The third morning, I slowed down once again and studied the formation. The lights traveled in a triangle formation. The two trailing lights would stretch apart untill one of the trailing light would become the leading light and this would continue with the lights alternating. The road that I traveled goes South for aprox one mile, then curves to the west and goes about two and one half miles, like two sides of a rectangle. I could tell that the formation was confined to this area. Finally, on the forth morning, the aircraft decided to follow me along the road. It was not directly over me. I could look out the window and see it(the lights that is). Still no sound. Keep in mind that this is a very dark and quite area at 6:00 in the morning. Their are no buildings or traffic. Just a cattle farm on one side and some hunting land on the other. By the time I got to the end of Bud Wilson Road, it was no longer there. I lost it while tring to stay on the road. Then the fifth morning was the one that really onvenced me that this was no airplane or passenger jet. This morning, when I first spotted the formation, I pulled the truck over, rolled down the window, cut off the engine, and enjoyed the show. The formation appeared first to the west, over the trees. I watched the strange change of formations for a few minutes. Then the formation  came toward me. The change in formation did not always coraspond(sp?) with a change in direction. TIt came so close that it no longer appeared over trees, but directly in the sky above me. Finnally, the formation traveled south of me, became one light and suddenly flashed off toward the sky at the spped of light, never making a sound. Other than the lights, I never saw the craft itself. I have always been interested in such sitings since this event, but have only herd of one such sighting like my own since this happened.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,35.23324977973568,-81.17918458149781

At the time of this encounter I was 42 years-old.  I have a Bachelor of Science from the University of Michigan (in psychology) and, prior to this event, I had no particular interest in the subject of UFOs.  Like everyone else in the civilized world, I suppose, I'd seen ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" in the 1970's.  Beyond that, however, I knew very little about this phenomenon and tended to be skeptical - if not completely dismissive - of the occassional reports that I'd see in papers, on the news, etc. It is noteworthy, though, that on the day before this happened to me almost the entire front page of our local newspaper (The Flint Journal) was devoted to reports of UFOs sighted near Holland, Michigan (the past week) and sightings over crowded, residential areas within the City of Flint the previous evening.  The headlines that day were, in fact, in reference to this spate of sightings. At the time I'd picked up a temporary job in a small factory about 50 miles south of Flint and was scheduled to be at work at 6:00 AM.  Traveling south on I-75 (and then US-23), as my car crested the Bristol Rd. overpass, I saw two very bright, airborne ""headlights"" off in the distance; it was clearly an airborne object of some sort though the lights were quite low on the horizon.  Since the airport was to my right (at the southwestern intersection of I-75 and Bristol Rd.) I simply assumed a very large plane was landing. For the next few miles my view of these lights was often obscured by buildings and foilage because they were, as I've said, quite low on the horizon.  At one point the freeeway curves, and from about three-quarters of a mile away, I could see that whatever the object was it wasn't moving - and it was, indeed, very low to the ground. Approaching the object I had a very ominous feeling.  It was sitting just to the right of the freeway and hovering slightly above a grove off full grown trees.  The northern-facing ""headlights"", even from a distance of an eigth-of-a mile, had a brilliant, phosphorus look that was just plain weird.  I would estimate that the lights were about forty feet apart.  As I got closer to the object, which made no sound whatsoever, the lights seemed to be vibrating or to have some sort of internal motion - it's difficult to describe. Frankly, I was terrified.  I slowed a bit as I passed almost directly underneath the object.  Bending forward to look up at it I saw that it had a red light that was pulsating on it's bottom.  This light illuminated the outline of a large, triangular craft whose underside had striations - or a ribbing of sorts - and which appeared (as much as I could determine) to be made of metal.  It was very, very large and yet, as I've said, made no sound at all. I floored the car in terror and, then, about 100 yards down the freeway hit the brakes and looked back.  I could see it's outline hanging there above the trees and it was as motionless as a cinder block sitting on an oak table. At work I talked to 3 other people who'd seen it and we were all dumbfounded - and scared to death.  The next day, an air traffic controller at Flint's Bishop Airport gave me the number for MUFON (I'd never heard of it) and they came to my home a few days later to take a report.  The air traffic controller, by the way, chuckled as he listened to my story but also stated that he'd ""seen a lot of things"" he couldn't explain either (no one, he said, had seen anything from the tower the previous morning - this is something which I absolutely DO NOT believe).  He said, to paraphrase, that since Uncle Sam was signing his paychecks he wasn't going to elaborate on any of his own sightings. The Michigan director of MUFON came to my home, as I've said, a few days later and took a report.  She also told me that she'd been contacted by two women who, while carpooling to work at 10 PM the night before my sighting, had seen what I'd described hovering over both lanes of the freeway at precisely the same location.  She went on to say that the women had only seen the object after they'd suddenly realized that they were inexplicably traveling north on I-75 (instead of south) and had exited and turned around; they had no explanation, she said, for how they'd left Flint on southbound I-75 and ended up a bit dazed and headed north (having to turn around to head in the direction of work). Now - this all sounded like a lot of malarky to me.  Even though I'd seen this thing my initial impression was that the lady from MUFON was some sort of kook.  Then, on Tuesday of the next week, a lady with whom I'd become friends approached me at work, looking very upset, and asked me to call her after work. In a nutshell, she had overheard me relating a few details of my conversation with the lady from MUFON with people at the shop.  She seemed like a sane, sober individual (strong Baptist, sang in the choir at church, etc.) but, on the phone that evening, told me of flashbacks she was having of a classic UFO abduction.  She, too, was carpooling that morning with another young women and didn't see anything.  Her van, however, started spinning out of control and she thought she'd hit ""black ice"", as she put it.  The spinning, however, accelerated and she could remember - she said - ""going up"". These two ladies, also, found themselves driving north on I-75 (and don't really understand how this happened), experienced missing time, etc.  The women I spoke to was hysterical, at the time, and - as I've indicated - seemed very normal otherwise.  I have no reason to doubt her story (which included seeing her reflection in the large eyes of some big-eyed being). Obviously, the latter part of this is anecdotal but I believe that these two women had experienced what they described - a UFO abudction.  I know exactly what I DID NOT see: I didn't see a helicopter, swamp gas, the planet Venus, nor state-of-the-art human technology. I've typed this extremely fast so I hope it makes sense.  I hope you continue to get at the truth - someone need to.....",1999-05-24T00:00:00,43.014164735516374,-83.70674685138538

My friend and I were walking to my house (he lives down the street) when we stopped to look at the moon.  My friend was at the time around 11 and I was 13.  We had been friends since he was in Kindergarten.  I was starting my fascination with outer space around that age. We started looking at stars and naming them, then he spotted one above and to the left of the north star that was somewhat bright (but very far away like a plane would be).  This ""star"" was keeping it's possition in the sky, but what was weird about it was that another star with a much lower magnitude seemed to come out of the larger one and travel about 4 degrees across the sky and stay there for about 5 minutes.  After that, it simply went back to where it came from.  I never considered that part of the sighting because it was too far away to tell what it really was.  What I consider the sighting is explained below. After seeing the strange star-like pinpoints across the sky, we began looking for more to see if it was an isolated phenomena.  We continued to walk and look when strait down the road between the rows of suburban houses and over the top of the circle's trees (the circle being at the end of the short road we live on) was a very bright light, my guess being with about -5 or -6 was just sitting there.  At first it didn't click in my head because there's usually red lights in that part of the sky anyway because of power lines in the field.  Then I realized the light wasn't red, it was a white light.  We were now halfway down the road, standing in awe at the 3-way intersection and stared at the light.  I looked to my friend and asked him what he thought it was, and when I looked back I saw that it doubled in size.  It was coming at us, straight down the road.  We thought it was a helicopter, so we ran back to his house like we were fugitives (we always pretended like that).  When we got to his driveway, it was almost directly overhead and still no sound was coming from it.  I took charge and told him to get his mom (I knew without an older witness that no one would believe us).  He ran inside yelling and his little brother came running out, followed by my friend and his mom.  Now the diamond-shaped craft was directly overhead and hovering like a copter. The rest of the description gets blurry now, I believe there were 4 lights on bottom, the 2 sides being white or dull yellow, the front and back being red. As far as I can remember, it was only there for us to regret not having a camera, then it tilted up at about a 30-35 degree angle and zipped away above his house pretty quickly. The only way I remember this many details about it is because I immediatley wrote it all down in my journal when I got home because I didn't want to take the chance of forgetting it, or having warped memories about it later.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,41.3581,-86.3122

I could even see what I initially thought was the planet Jupiter glowing orange in the distance.  I then began to think that it could not be Jupiter, because it was not in this part of the sky.  It must be something else.  Sure enough, the object was moving along side of the plane.  A big orange ball!.

There were some clouds to the West of us. After the small plane circled for a few minutes, an object came out of the clouds. It was either the size of a fighter plane at about 1000 feet, or something larger much higher. My 7-year-old son who has very sharp eyes said it looked like a fighter plane to him, but I couldn't make out the exact shape. It didn't look like any fighter I was familiar with, but was roughly that shape. What was odd was that there were two glowing orange circles on the back of the object like it was a fighter jet on afterburners, but it was completely silent. It was not that far away nor that far up -- a fighter on afterburners sounds like a freight train. After the object came out of the clouds, the small plane stopped circling and they both headed off to the East. If it was a fighter on afterburners, it was moving much too slowly.

Ones light was solid and others was flashing. I was driving around the parking lot of The community college here when I saw 2 lights in the distance to the NW.  Being in close proximity to a military installation (Ft.Huachuca) that seems to be constantly practicing night aerial maneuvers, I thought this was merely two planes or helicopters flying in formation, one a little bit in front of the other.  However, as I continued to watch, the craft in the rear seemed to be getting closer to the lead craft (the one whose light wasn't flashing). At this point I parked my car and watched because I had never seen maneuvers like this before. It was as if one was chasing the other. The flashing (not really flashing like a strobe but rather like turning a very bright light off and on slowly and seeing the bulb fade as it cools)craft continued to get closer to the other one until the lights almost seemed as one. Then the flashing light was gone and only the constantly lit craft could be seen. While this was happening the 2 lights were traveling in a counter-clockwise direction from northwest to west and ended up directly over the Fort here. I still thought at this time that I was looking at 2 planes or helicopters and one just blacked out all its lights--they seem to do that a lot around here. When the light that was still visible got directly over the fort it ended its circular direction of travel and headed due-east torwards where I was parked.  It was not traveling very fast and I could still only see the one solid light.  As it got closer I again saw the flashing/pulsing light along with several more. I was amazed at the absence of sound as it approached. From the silence and the odd light clusters I could now see I thought perhaps this was one of the unmanned aerial vehicles they test here or maybe a balloon/blimp of some sort.  It wasn't. It was not flying very high and (luckily) passed directly over me and the entire campus here(there were several people in the parking lot and milling around the campus but I don't know if anyone else was paying attention).  As it passed I was amazed at its size and the silence (a faint rumbling/humming almost like a jet very very far away could be heard). I could not make out a shape because it was dark but, I could clearly see an unusually high amount of lights on its underbelly. Their were several small almost incandescent-like amberish lights clustered about what I'll call the nose section. The mid section only had a few lights grouped in pairs of two close to the nose, and then the rest of the mid- section was dark and very long. Towards the back, or tail-end, was the flashing light I saw earlier with a few other non-flashing lights.  Looking at the arrangement of all these lights reminded me of a stingray-like fish with a large head/body, and a long skinny tail with a point but I can't really say what shape it was only what the light configuration reminded me of. What I originally thought was one plane chasing or just gaining on the other was really the lights on the front of this thing and the flashing light on its tail. As it turned it created the illusion of one going faster and closing the gap on the other. After seeing this I still wasn't sure that it just wasn't a military excursion umtil about 5 minutes after it passed over me. It was at this time that I saw several small planes and/or helicopters flying at very low altitudes over the Fort. They seemed to be spaced out pretty far and just circling small areas as if they were looking for something or waiting for something. One large commercial-like jet could also be seen but it wasn't circling, it and two helicopters headed in the same direction as the craft did and all three passed directly over me as well as if they were following but not necessarily chasing whatever I had originally seen. These planes and helicopters around and directly over the Fort for at least an hour.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,31.57512718446602,-110.18160679611651

I ran home and got a pair of binoculars and continued to observe the object for approx 45 minutes until the object simply winked out. This was observed in either the fall of 1974 or 1975. I was in high school at the time and did not yet have my drivers license. It was in the evening around dusk, probably around 17:30. I was walking home in a residential area on a clear evening just after the sun had set. It was still relatively light and the object appeared moving west to east very rapidly and stopped just overhead. The object was initially a bright white ball of light which I had to shield my eyes from. It came in so quickly and was so bright that it seemed to streak in like you would expect a meteor to do. At the same time a car was coming down the street toward me. Upon noticing the same object, the man inside slammed on the breaks and jumped out of the car asking ""what the hell is that"". We watched the object for several minutes. It was 200 to 300 feet in the air and made no sound. The obect began moving very slowly and the light eminating from it began to steadily dim. I observed a triangular outline on the bottom and a short beaker like area sitting on top of the triangle. The light eminating from the object was still rather bright so it was difficult to see more. After observing the object for a few minutes I quickly ran home and got a pair of binoculars. The object was out of my site for perhaps 90 seconds while I was in the house. My mother followed me out to our back yard to continue observing the object. The object continued heading east and continued to get dimmer. We watched the object for approx. 30-40 minutes. At this time it was completely dark out and there were many stars. My mother and I then heard jet engines and noticed three lights approaching the object from three different directions. The object, that now appeared about the size of a star, suddenly shot up as the aircraft approached, stopped and then winked out. I did not know the man that stopped on the street to observe the object with me and I never saw him again. My mother was a house wife with a high school education who was very interested in UFO's but had never seen one before. We did not report it. I am an engineer and have been very interested in the UFO phenomenon since that time. I have seen several things, since then, that I can't explain. That sighting, however, was the only sighting that was clearly something I could not attribute to something known and I still often wonder just what it was.

There was commotion outside. I was at my boyfriends house I went out and Saw what everyone was looking at (Many people on the street were standing infront of their houses looking up) this craft was huge it had lights all around the perimeter Like a floating football field. And it made no sound.  It seemed to be following the street...which was a dead end so the police cars which came wizzing along had to turn around and go back the way they came when it glided on past.  There was talk about the sighting for a breif time but excuses were made that some jokers from west point were flying in formation. Also A blimp was mentioned I believe.  I know it was not the airforce flying in formation, Because the lights were all connected. I could tell this because the distance between them remained fixed. Also what I saw was very low and made no sound. I am skeptical about the blimp explaination because It was not confirmed that there was infact a blimp hovering around after dark at that time...I would hope the police would know of such an event. But they didn't.  This was a long time ago but I recently saw a similar craft cought on video on T.V. Also some I witness accounts were Familiar From the lights to the slow speed to the lack of sound.  And this account came from a police officer I was hoping it was the same sighting I was wittness to but it wasn't. I have heard nothing else about the event.  I looked online to try and find some record. I thougt that maybe someone else would corroborate the event for me but I see no listings For Croton - On - Hudson.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,,

They came back with a reply that they had gotten many other phonecalls from the same area seeing the same thing. They (HQ's) then said they had called the Westchester County Airport and was advised it was the Air Force. To this day I dont believe that.

As we turned onto the dirt road that led to the campground we observed a large saucer shaped craft hovering about 100 ft. from our car.  It made absolutely no sound and sat motionless as we watched it.  As we drove away I spotted it flying over a lake at an unbelieveable rate of speed and then it rose to about 100 ft. and vanished. My neighbors had taken me camping in Steubinville and Mrs. **** and I had been shopping at a local department store.  I recall the time because the store closed and we had to leave. We drove along a very rural road and as soon as we reached the dirt road that the campground was located on we spotted a large object in the field to our right.  It was very close to the road. My neighbor stopped the car and we just sat there and watched it.  It made no noise whatsoever and it appeared to be hovering approximately ten feet off of the ground.  There were red, blue and white lights blinking around the middle in a sequence that, at that time, I had never seen before (I have since seen laser Christmas lights that resemble them).  There was a very bright white light imminating from the center of the bottom that lit the ground beneath it.  I think there may have also been a small light on top but I'm not certain.  I also don't recall the color of the object. We watched it for several minutes and eventually decided to leave.  We continued up the road and I happened to look toward the lake to our left and saw it again.  It was literally ricocheting around the lake.  This craft absolutely defied explanation.  It darted toward the bank at an unimaginable speed and then changed direction and headed toward the other bank.  This area was extremely hilly and, to this day, I know of nothing that could negotiate those kinds of turns at that rate of speed. It made a triangle shaped pass across the lake and then rose at an angle to a height of about 50 yards and then just shot off. I never told very many people about this incident but I've always wondered exactly what it was that we saw.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,40.385021153846154,-80.6819673076923

I was 13 years old and living in Springfield, Ohio. At approximately 9 p.m., I was in an urban shopping mall parking lot, sitting on the trunk of my father's car while he and my brother finished shopping inside. There was dense low cloud cover, perhaps at 1,000 feet altitude. I was tossing a toy up in the air and catching it ... once, twice. But on the third toss, as I watched the toy, my eyes drifted away to the most incredible sight I have ever seen. Three enormous white lights -- each about the size of a cup saucer -- silently hung in the sky. They were above the blanket of clouds, so they were diffused. Together, they formed an even more enormous equilateral triangle. If the lights were the endpoints of a single triangular object, each side would roughly equal the length of an American football field. I blinked, looked down and closed my eyes, then looked back up again. The lights remained directly overhead. The lights just hovered there, motionless, for about a minute. Then, in unison, they began to rotate in a slow counter-clockwise pattern. Simultaneously, they began moving north at about 30-40 mph. There was no engine or rotor noise of any kind. Beyond the extraordinary silence, the motion itself was bizarre: There seemed to be no acceleration. The motion was instantaneous and fluid. (Imagine having a VCR set on ""Pause,"" then pressing ""Play"" to watch something move.) Within a couple of minutes, the lights had moved over a nearby hill and out of view. In a mix of shock, fear, and excitement, I immediately ran back into the shopping mall to find my father and brother. I told them what I had seen and demanded that we get in the car and drive north, to see if we could find the lights. They humored me, but we saw nothing. I knew they probably thought I was crazy, but I didn't care. As far as I know, there were no other witnesses around the shopping mall. But I never bothered to check. Also, my father -- who happened to be a prominent city politician -- had friends at the local municipal airport, which also served as an Air National Guard base. At my request, he phoned the control tower to find out if there had been any unusual air traffic that night. There wasn't. I was completely perplexed, and remain so to this day.

It was hovering about 30 feet up in the air.It was large and fairly quiet. It stayed there maybe 10-20 seconds and then in an instant it lifted and disappeared in a flash of light. No doubt it was something not of this earth unless the U.S. has something we all don't know about. My husband and I were driving from Clinton, Iowa to Mt. Pulaski Illinois in August of 1987. Our children were staying at their grandparents and we were driving there to stay for the weekend and to pick them back up. On the way there on a 2-lane highway we were driving on, out in the country, (in between towns)I observed something hovering close to the road (approx. 20 yds. from the road away)in a field. It was very large and as I remember wasn't loud at all. It was probably about 30 feet off the ground.(if that)Very close and very large. I got my husband to slow down and to look while he was driving and he couldn't tell what it was. It was lit up with lights. I don't remember exactly where the lights were but it seems to me they were around the middle of the craft. It seems to me they were just white lights, not colored ones. It was like a dome in shape. I could see a top and a bottom to it. Metallic I would think. It hovered there for about 10 - 20 seconds and then all of a sudden it just lifted up and sat there for a second and then in a flash it was gone... so fast I couldn't even see where it went other than in the direction it started leaving in. It was like there was just a streak of light where it'd left from.I knew it wasn't a helicopter or anything else like that. It wasn't shaped anything like a helicopter. It scared the hell out of me and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I have told this story over the years to people and they tell me I need to report it but I never had because I'm not the type of person to call the police or anything about something I see. I was going to my in-laws and they are pretty much on the straight laced side and they would have thought I was crazy so I never said anything to them but I was really scared about what I saw. My husband says he didn't really get a real good look at it but he was driving but he said it didn't look like anything he had ever seen. I know what I saw as plain as the nose on my face. My GOD I was only 20 yards from where it was hovering. I ! had a very close encounter.I have always wondered if there was anyone else that night who DID report seeing something in that particular area. There were other cars on that road. Please let me know what I might have seen and how common this type of sighting is. I feel like most people see something in the sky and I happened to see something that was much closer than that. I could have reasoned this through, in my mind, that it was something else until it just vanished into thin air. You can just contact me through my e-mail if you'd like unless you would like to talk to me more about it. I just want to know how normal this type of sighting is and if I really saw a once in a lifetime thing. If I can help in any way though please let me know.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,40.1291,-89.3641

The only part of this event I am not certain of is the exact time, or even the year.  I was probably 8, 9, or 10 years old when it happened, unfortunately no adults were present for me to contact and ask the year, and the only other witness was even younger than I was.  But the rest of it I remember with exceptional clarity. I was standing in the parking lot of George's Majestic Lounge (a live music bar) with my cousin, who is a couple of years younger than me.  Our parents were inside listening to music that we had no interest in, and, as our town used to be more or less completely crime free, we were allowed to play outside, as long as we didn't wander off. It was afternoon, about 2 hours before sunset, and the moon was visible and nearly full in the day sky.  For whatever reason I looked up into the sky, probably at the moon.  However, while looking up I noticed in the north sky, and slightly west, was a wierd object.  It was following the same path that commuter prop planes used in that era to reach our local airport (though it was flying higher than they do at that point in their approach), at first I thought it might be some kind of wierd helicopter.  As I stared at it, it quickly became apparent that it didn't look like any kind of flying object I'd ever seen. The object is best described as beeing basically shaped like a dumbell.  Each end, front and back, was a cube, the cubes were connected by a rectangular arm.  Unlike a dumbbell, the arm did not extend passed the ends of the cubes.  The object had no visible lights (it was daytime though, so I wouldn't have seen any but the brightest lights).  The object was high enough in the sky that its total length appeared equal to half the diameter of the full moon.  The object was uniformly grey.  I have always had very good vision and was able to see a certain amount of detail; the cubes had smooth, featureless faces (at least the ones visible at my angle), but the arm appeared to be of a skeletal, framework construction.  The object also emitted no sounds or trails.  When I was watching it it moved considerably slower than an aircraft at a similar height. I watched, entranced, for several minutes, probably about 3 to 5.  My cousin must have noticed I was staring at something because when I finally became aware that maybe I should point it out to her, I saw she was already looking at it too.  I told her to get my mom, and she refused.  So I told her to watch it, and I went to get my mom and dad.  My parents were not eager to go outside to see ""the weird flying thing in the sky"", and so we didn't go out for what seemed an eternity to me, but was probably only about 5 to 10 minutes.  Of course the object was gone.  My counsin said it had continued along its north to south course, but had moved faster and faster until it was gone, she said it hadn't dissapeared over the horizon (all paraphrased of course), but had gone up into the sky until she couldn't see it any longer somewhere in the southwest quadrant of the sky. For years afterwards I drew pictures of the object, on school papers, on the phone notepad, in books, etc.  I've never seen it since, nor have I ever heard of any sightings even remotely similar.  I remember some years later, still before I was in my teens (I am now 27, in 1999), that I heard about skylab, and it's plumet to earth; at that point I just assumed that what I had seen was skylab.  But now I'm pretty sure I'll never have any idea of what the object really was.",1999-08-30T00:00:00,36.04787185185185,-94.04453777777778

I have made this report several times at a few websites and I decided to make it into a works file so I can paste it instead of rewriting it.  I am not sure of the year or month but I think it was either spring or fall in the mid 80s. Anyway  there was a small amount of snow on the ground and we were near Jefferson Colorado.  There is a road that runs from Jefferson past Tarryall reservoir and we were camping a few miles from the lake.  It was just before sundown and my wife saw a red ball down low to the north of our camp. It was to the north east at first and it was traveling east. It came across us to the north about 1\4 to 1\2 mile away. it took about 5 to 10 minutes to travel by and disappear behind a mountain that was to the north east of  us. It appeared to be pretty big (100 ft dia) but it was hard to tell because of the distance it was from us. I remember thinking that I wished it would come closer so we could see it. A little while later it came around the mountain it had disappeared behind. It was coming back towards the west on the south side of camp.  This time it was only about 75 yards away!!! It was 300 feet in dia (approx) and it stopped directly to the south of us and hovered with its bottom side only about 50 feet  off of the ground.  It was bright orange about the color of metal that is 1600 degrees or so.  I know what temperatures look like from working with tool steels and furnaces.  Anyway  I’m not saying that it was hot but that is what it looked like. It hovered there still and totally silent for what seemed to be a few minutes and then it went away from us so fast that it traveled about 35 miles in a split second and was bouncing erratically over the mountains to the south west of us.  I looked at a map and the distance is a estimate from what I saw that night. Since then I have remembered a little more about that night and I think that it was more than a few minutes that it was hovering and that we  just didn’t realize the time.  There were four of us and we all saw the same thing  through the whole experience.  Three of us had drank a few beers but one had not ever drank any alcohol in her life. we were all in our late twenties or early thirties.

The river is a couple of miles wide and on the other side of the river is Maryland. This location is about 10 miles from a militray bas, Fort A.P. Hill. We were fishing behind this seafood restaurant which has a couple of peirs to fish from. On the other peir there was a family of 3. Well, while we were fishing I noticed up in the sky probably 1000 ft. up was a white object flying slowy over the river. It was making no sound. The crazy thing about it was, as it was flying over the river it would just fade out and vanish when it was close to the other side of the river. And amazingly after this would occur, it would re-appear back where it started from. This went on for about 20 minutes. I even ran over to the other pier to show the people there what it was doing. We all saw it in broad daylight on a clear day. The other strange thing was, after it had stopped flying over, a few minutes later a fighter jet flew up through the area that this UFO craft had just been flying in.

We were on a boat in the center of the lake.  The lights were about 200 yard away. The lights got bright and started to change colors. Eventually the craft came over to our boat and followed us back to camp. It was April 2,1994. Daylight savings time.  A buddy and I from work decided to go for a fishing trip on the boat he just bought.  We picked Lake Sonoma , and you had to get to the campsites by boat.  We set up camp friday night just by dark, then decided to cast a few times off the shore and ;ended up staying up all night.  The next day we did alot of trolling around. caught and released a couple of small mouth bass.  Later we ate and went back out to the marina. (we are camping aprox. 4-5 miles north of the marina which was near the dam) It took about 20-25 mins at top speed-25 mph-.  We We saw this guy working on a houseboa and we all talked for a while.  Later we went to the boat ramp to catfish.  I was looking east from the boat ramp when I was A flash in the sky comming from just behind the mountains, then a second later two more quickley repeated flashs.  It seemed only slightly odd but I told my friend what I saw.  It was about 11:00 pm.  We ran out of worms.  My friend had alot more catfish bait back at camp.  It was a long ride back but we figured it was worth getting the bait since the fish were bitting.  We started heading back and noticed the fuel was almost empty, so we changed tanks.  We headed up, north from the dam.  All we had for light was my 5-cell mag light.  There were stumps protruding from the water so we sere going to have to be careful.  We rounded the corner up the north fork toward Cloverdale. The wind was so strong that water was coming over the front of the boat, we reduced our speed to 5 kph.  After we passed the public boat ramp, my friend noticed two lights up on the hill and said,""Hey, look at the four wheeler up on the hill.  He's really moving throuhg the trees.""  I said,""Are you sure, how could he be going sideways like that.""  All we could see were the lights. No object. It would sometimes come in front of the hillside and then be behind the treeline.  Then I shined my maglight up at it and it went behind the hillside.  It had followed at our pace for about 8 min.  W! e weren't sure what it have been and didn't really think much about it after it disappeared.  Then it came back and instead of dodging in and out of the trees it was above the ridged of the hill.  It was about 200 yards west.  This time instead of two bright lights it was two bright colored lights, each changing a different color randomly. The colors were beautiful almost hypnotic. It was as if each color had its own vibration. I could feel the light touching my body.  Then my flashlight went out.  It felt like some one put icey hot and electricity all over my arms.  Then we looked up and it started getting brighter.  It kept getting brighter and brighter.  Then a colorful rainbowy mist fanned out from underneth it.  It beacame a glowing ball of light.  So illuminesant that I thought the hill had caught on fire.  At that point we decided not to look at it any longer.  As if ignoring it, it would go away.  I still had to look at it every few minutes.  Then it finally left.  It had followed us longer that time about 15 minutes.  It still hadn't clicked in our heads what was going on.  I was afraid to talk about it, afraid if I did it would hear us and come back.  The after a few minutes my friend said he thought the lights looked like an angel.  I didn't think the lights looked like an angel but they were awesome. We talked about it for a couple of minutes then we stopped talking.  We wanted to concentrated on getting back to camp.  It was pitch black without my flashlight.  About 5 minutes later my friend tapped me on the back and said look at this.  I said no way I'm not looking at anything anymore.  He said, you have to see what I'm looking at.  I turned looked back up on my left facing southeast. I noticed an incredible looking craft slowly coming down the hillside, then after centering itself begind us it then closed in comming with in 100 ft.  At first sight my whole body just colapsed, I was paralized in disbelief.  It couldn't take my eyes off it.  Then I could just say, ""Oh my fucking God"" Then the ! only thing that came out was air. My friend told me not to look at it,to turn around.  So I did.  We both started praying aloud, I followed my friends lead.  We could still tell it was there by the reflection of it off the water.  The ship was blackend like tarnished silver and shaped like a jelly doughnut.  There was a dark band around it horizontally.  There were lights inside the band, rectangles with rounded corners.  We couldn't tell if the light was coming through a window or not but the light was pouring out like lumminescent fog.  We could see about seven lights around it.  It was about 30 ft. tall and about 200 feet wide?  The ship so close to the surface of the lake that we couldn't see under it.  After about 10 mins we saw the fork that lead to our campsite.  We started to head that way when we realized it was a dead end.  My friend turned without having to face the craft and we made it around the next corner when we saw two campfires.  Then the ship was gone.  In the sky over head a hugh comet seemed to take off from our direction.  It started from one color and went through all the colors of the rainbow.

My new husband & I were on our honeymoon aboard the Carnival cruise ship Destiny- at sea between Cozumel and Jamaica. At approx. 11 PM after dinner we decided to walk the deck and get some fresh air. Both my husband and I are non-drinkers are sound responsible people. I suggested we go as far to the prow of the ship as allowed as the night was clear and the sea was very calm and beautiful. The upper-level deck is as far as passengers are allowed and is immediately adjacent to the game room for teen passengers. We walked to the rail and just enjoyed the nights breeze. Far off in the distance, lightning flashed and I remember even mentioning to my husband that we may get a storm during the night, but he shouldn't worry as this was his first cruise. Before long, we both noticed what appeared to be a ship sailing directly toward us and at a slight angle. Being a scuba diver, I have been at sea many times prior to this and I just thought it was a freight ship passing us in the distance. However, this proved to be very different than any thing I had ever seen. This object moved toward us with a speed not of any ship I had ever seen. Within a matter of moments, it was right aside of our cruise ship. At this time a young man, perhaps around 15 yrs old also came to the rail and asked us if we knew what we were looking at. The object hovered just outside the lights of the ship, but through the clear night a definite triagular shape could be made out. It had 3 lights which were respectively green, amber and white. My husband and I carefully considered what we were seeing. How could any ship have overtaken us so quickly? Why would any ship plot a collision course with a cruise liner. And the most damning evidence. This object made no wake and hovered next to a MOVING ship for 10 minutes or more as we all watched. A Conventional ship would have had to come right at us, made a sharp turn in close proximity to our ship and then have thrown their engines into hard reverse in order to stay exactly along side us for the! 10 minu tes or so. Our conclusion, this was not a seafaring vessel, but rather something suspended in the air. The object casually lingered right next to our ship for at least 10 minutes and long enough for several other young men to come out to watch. The kids were afraid and kept asking my husband and I if we were safe. Shortly thereafter the craft began to move slowly down the length of our vessel. My husband in tow, we walked the entire length of our ship and watched the craft glide out past the stern and out to sea. The strange lightning I had observed just before we sighted it seemed to follow it as it went. We watched as it maintained a course off into the distance from where we had just come, the lightning only seen in the vicinity of the craft. Just a word as a follow up to this. Both my  husband and I are not crank cases. We are normal middle aged adults and most skeptical about these kind of phenomenon, UNTIL now. No ship could have done what this thing did or would have even wanted to get so close to a large moving cruise ship. I also noticed that the same shape craft was reported over Monterray Mexico only 2 days after we saw this. The sighting in Monterray involved police, air traffic controller and tv stations.

When we walked outside to see why the car had stopped, we observed that the occupants of the station wagon (4 adults) were looking up to the sky.  When we turned our attention to the sky, we observed 5-6 bright white circular objects flying in a formation in the night sky from North to South.  These objects, which travelled at a slow pace, made no noise and left no trails while they flew overhead.  These objects flew at about a distance of 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground.  As I remember, the objcts flew in a triangular formation but did not stay in this formation.  The objects criss-crossed each other, changing positions in the formation, in a way that I would not think to be possible from any type of aircraft that I know of.  We all stood there and watched these objects until they disappeared over the tree filled-horizon toward Route 17 and SUNY Binghamton.

This is actually a case of 2 separate incidents exactly one week apart.A family friend is a landowner in central MT near the town of Harlowton.As such, he invited my family up to his place (great fishing & hunting)any time our hearts desired.Over the years my brothers and I became intimately familiar with every canyon and creek on the ranch.We also began to realize that a lot more seemed to be going on there than at first met the eye and everything culminated in the event(s) I will describe. On this particular evening, my brother and I had just exited a thick patch of trees after a long day of deer hunting. It was nearly dark,the first stars were out and we had about a mile walk back to our truck. Being aware of anomalies in the area, we were always on the lookout for ANYTHING out of the ""ordinary"". Well, upon looking to the eastern sky , we both saw 3 ""stars"" that seemed to be brighter than the rest. These lights were stationary at this point and seemed to be regular stars out in space. I remember saying to my brother that maybe they were planets and we would check it out at home.We then continued on our hike to the truck and went home- nothing unusual.This is where it starts getting strange. One week later almost to the minute,my brother and I emerged from the same patch of trees after hunting all day.As we again surveyed our surroundings, we again noticed the 3 stars from the week previous in the exact same place they had been then.Only this time they were a different color(orange) and seemed to be moving slightly in conjunction with each other. Really interested now,we watched as the formation of lights gradually picked up speed coming in roughly our direction (west).We then realized that we were in a bad situation and started for the truck at a fast walk. Keeping an eye on the object, we observed it change direction to a more northerly heading and fly toward a low cloud formation, into which it flew. By this point we could tell that this was no ordinary aircraft(as a student pilot with 10 yrs in ! aviation ,I'm familiar with nearly all known a/c).The object was close enough for us to see a structured triangular fuselage dark in color. It made absolutely no sound. Upon the object entering the cloud, there was a flash of light similar to lightning but flourescent green in color. This was immediately followed by the object emerging from the cloud in roughly a 10 degree bank. As the object made it's way clear of the cloud, we observed the ""cloud"" literally change shape until it appeared like a tornado but horizontal to the earth not vertical, with the ""foot"" of the funnel pointing toward the object. At this point we broke into a sprint for the truck. As we ran, the object literally DRAGGED this ""tornado"" to the west. We could see that the whole eastern horizon was black now.Just as we reached the truck we were hit by huge gusts of wind  and debris from the east and visibilty was around 2 feet. Concerned now, we piled into the truck to find that this reliable vehicle was completely dead( it was just like in the movies). With the nearest help miles away, we readied our rifles( made us feel better) and waited. Total elapsed time so far approx. 6 min.The dust storm and confusion lasted for about 10 min then the wind stopped and the dust settled. As visibility improved and things became quiet again, we could see...We could see objects- lots of them. Besides the original triangle a/c which was now making a 40-50nm circular flight pattern, we could see discs trailing the triangle, all moving independently.(We were by now using our 10x50 Zeiss binocs) and could see that the discs were definitley metallic in nature. The most impressive object however was a gigantic cylinder that descended from nowhere then hovered approx 500ft agl around  a 1000 yds distant, over a field. Peter, I swear to you on my Father's grave that along each side of this thing were ""windows"" in which it seemed like there was movement! It was around 2 football fields in length, approx. 700-1000 ft in diameter,  and bright silver in color.The ""front! end"" gl owed blue, intensifying the farther one got from the center and the ""rear end"" glowed red in the same manner.What drew your eye though was the yellow and orange strobe exactly centered on the ""bottom"".We watched this object in pure horror for about an hour until it ascended straight up and out of sight .It did not disappear in a split second but rose rapidly taking less than a minute to completely vanish.Well, back to the other objects, which were by now in the company of several F-15's.It was VERY EASY to differentiate between the jets and the other objects. The F-15""s flew around for about a half hr.then headed NW in a tight formation and the triangle followed close behind, all disappearing over some hills to the NW-we never saw them again.The discs continued to maneuver throughout the area.We had pretty much resigned ourselves to our fate by this point and now felt the worst was over.It all became rather entertaining by midnight.We spent a cold night in the truck, falling asleep eventually watching these discs and their erratic flight. In the morning, our parents showed up to look for us and we gave them the whole story. They believed us but advised us to say nothing. I just cant live with this secret any longer and felt it may be important as I believe I was a witness to some kind of WX manipulation Technology. I moved away soon after and hav'nt been back. I understand from friends that ""things"" are still happening there.",1999-09-12T00:00:00,46.4355,-109.8344

Begining in the spring of 1994 I was made aware of three specific areas in Iron County Michigan that were intense UFO encounter sites. The first encounter was at Glidden Lake several miles south of Crystal falls.  While sitting in a truck by the lake at approximately 21:00, a green triangular object lifted over the tree line on the oposite side of the lake.  I would approximate this object to be 30-35 feet in length, and 15 feet at the widest point in the rear.  The object had a very luminecent property, but was not like any other light that I could identify. By the time the object was approximately 200 feet in the air, a second object was seen coming from the horizon.  This second object was of a very similar shape and size, but was red in color.  The first object began to race towards my general direction and in less than a second had gained several hundred feet in altitude and was now positioned over myself and the other person viewing the event.  I got out of the truck to watch the object.  The second object, the red one, was now pursuing the first.  There seemed to be a buzzing sound coming from the second object and the radio in the truck became very distorted sounding.  two flashes of light came from the front of the red object, and the green object then exploded.  The explosion was close enough where it should have been heard, but it made no sound.  Also, when it did explode, it did not look so much like fire works or a gas explosion as it simply became many small fragments of light then disappeared.  The red object then shot directly upward and faded into the night sky. My companion seemed to be unamazed by the events.  She then explained that this type of thing had been happening for approximately 3 months already.  I had been unaware of this due to the fact that I had been out of the country for 10 months. Several other minor sitings at this location were seen over the next few months.  Then, in late July of 1994, while at a local ski hill in Crystal falls at approximately 18:00, a friend whom I will reffer to as ""Jim"" accompanied me to watching the sunset.  While we talked and waited for the next few hours, we saw approximately 9 of these same triangular shaped objects.  They grouped themselves into several airial formations, and seemed to repeat an airial acrobatics routine.  Jim and I watched them as they came and went over the horizon for approximately 4 hours.  After dark the objects returned one by one.  Each one forming a point in a series of three triangles.  The triangles then merged to form a shape like this: * * * * * * * *   * There they stayed for approximately 10 minutes.  They then formed a straigh line and travelled at a very high speed to the south and disappeared over the horizon. Several months went by before there was another sighting.  It was approximately the end of September.  This time it was in a feild almost directly underneath where the objects had come from when Jim and I had seen the sighting at the ski hill.  Myself and several friends were approximately 50 to 75 feet away from a row of trees that seperated two feilds.  On the opposite side of these trees, a slight hum was heard.  Then, as the hum quieted, the outline of a large triangular object could be seen.  The lower side of the object began to glow green and it lifted off the ground.  The object then left the area at a high rate of speed again leaving in a southerly direction. A few minor sightings were seen at both locations over the next 6 months, but nothing extraordinary as far as movement or paterns.  As the end of March drew close, the flight paterns of pyramids and now circles became very common. Approximately one year after the first sighting, yet another event happened that took my by surprise.  While out driving just north of town, I saw a green glow over the trees.  I immediately recognized the glow to be one of these objects.  I began to try and follow it by driving down old side roads and loging trails.  I could not seem to catch up to the object, and soon gave up.  When I decided to turn around and go back to the main road, I noticed the glow directly behind me.  I drove a bit faster, and it continued to follow me.  I came to an old gravel pit that was approximately 1/2 mile off the main road.  I parked on one side of the pit and the object came to a halt on the opposite side.  It then moved directly upwards, and I then noticed that there were 4 more craft hovering several hundred feet over the gravel pit.  When the object joined the others, they formed a ""V"" and left the area heading once again south. I had no more encounters over the next 9-10 months.  Then, in the winter of 1995/96, I visited a gravel pit just outside of Iron Mountain Michigan, which is to the south of Crystal Falls.  The pit is approximately the same size and shape as the one where I had my last encounter.  Within minutes of arriving at the pit, I was witness to yet another sky duel of one red and one green craft.  The same radio distortions happened, but this time the flashes came from the green craft.  The red craft began glowing several different colors.  One of the back corners of it changed from yellow to orange and back to yellow several times before it spiraled upward in a very awkward motion.  The green craft then vanished.  It didn't seem to have gone anywhere, but simply shut off it's light and disappeared into the darkness of the sky. I have since moved to the Detroit area of Michigan, and have since had no encounters with the craft. The craft never frightened me, but always excited me and made me feel like a little child seeing something spectacular for the first time.",1999-09-12T00:00:00,46.1346,-88.3601

Car traffic in vicinity: zero (exclusion of probable mid-air-haze light reflection) Observer in dark area, no lights in field of vision. Event: After observing eastern night skies 20 minutes (Boo,UMa,Cas,Ceph) I went inside to get my binoculars in order to observe unclear stars between Leo and Ursa Major. After that I observed that area naked-eyed in MTI technique (Moving Target Indication - I use that radar-mode expression to explain a wide-angled background-fixed observation which enables to detect slight movements of faint objects in large field of vision). After a few tens of seconds I detected a movement of a very faint object above Coma Berenices, too faint to lock a naked eye on. Convinced it`s a satellite (because of its initial south-north polar movement) I checked it through binoculars (from now on observing through binoculars). In this second (from detection till the start of observation) the luminosity of object increased greatly. It grew in size from a dot to a dash-shaped object oriented perpendicular to its flight path. I know that angle of attack of a craft in orbit is of no importance, so in the next second I thought ""it`s a sattelite flying sideways"". But then the dash started to rotate around my line-of-sight changing its direction fast towards east. Instead of travelling through UMa towards Cas (initial flight path would send it through zenith), I followed it through Bootes, Hercules to Cepheus (it lowered to the eastern horizon and then away towards north). Object was changing its bearing around 60° to left and right of its general way (right-left-right turn duration approx. 3 seconds). After it passed through Hercules, size and brightness of object started decreasing, and in the vicinity of Cepheus disappeared quickly.

Light color: pale yellow (yellow-white), hat shaped with ratio width:depth = 5:1 Brightness (comparing to other stars): zero or less magnitude. Object was rotating and turning (R-L-R turn time approx 3 sec), flying perpendicular to its flight path. It did not have left-red and right-green lights, no blinking lights. At the end of observation brightness and size of object rapidly fell to zero. Even after 1 minute no sound could be heard from that direction (normally aircraft over eastern horizon are audible in night-time). Angular size of object (no binoculars):  approx. 0.1° Angular velocity: not known. My conclusions:  Object behaved like no to me known aircraft. Due to hat-shaped object (with narrower end of ""hat"" trailing, hat oriented perpendicular to FP) of pale yellow color, I conclude the light was propulsion. Besides ""propulsion"" nothing could be seen. Due to knot known size of object and not very accurate angular size, distance to object and its velocity could not be determined.

Event: After the event that occured the day before, I observed southern skies approx. half an hour, naked eyed. I just wanted to go inside when a dark object flew over the town of Ilirska Bistrica, paralel to the valley in which the town is located (ie vector 150° ). I observed object at elevation of 20°, angular size 3.5°. Picture at: <a href=""http://www.((website deleted)) Presumed craft shape: <a href=""http://www.((website deleted))> Duration:  Approx. 1.5 second Appearance:  Object flew in the direction of 150°, straight. I started to observe it when it appeared from behind the roof of our house and stopped when it disappeared in light-polluted air low over the horizon. The observed flight path was 20° angular size. The main part of the object was dark, you could not tell what shape it was, you just noticed that your view at the background stars was blocked by something moving and black. At the end of this black mass, there were 4 white lights (I`d say they were about at visual magnitude 4 or 5), at equal distances in a line. Between every two strong lights there was a weak light, not the half way in between, but a little up and right. Those weaker lights were also at equal distances and in a line, that was paralel to the line of the strong lights. From the direction of motion, paralel movement of all lights in that direction and the perspective changes, I can tell by feeling that the object was close and low over the town. I`d put its route over the local factory. And by the movement through the air, you could just tell that the two lines of lights are perpendicular to flight path. After it passed by, I heard a one second long weak buzzing noise. Like the sound of tyres rolling but buzzing and much more quiet than car tyres. The sound pitch was lowering as the object egressed, like the doppler effect. Angular size of object:  approx. 3.5° Angular velocity: approx. 7°/sec. My conclusions:  The four strong lights were at equal distances and always in the line, at their fixed positions. No smoke trails behind. If they were parts of a meteor broken by Earth`s tidal forces, they would go apart, they`d be much more close together, their light intensity would change and they would leave smoke trails (I`ve seen a few meteor break-ups, and I know how they look like). The weaker lights were also at equal distances and formed in a line that was paralel to the line of the stronger lights, but they were located a little to the right and up from the strong ones. I don`t know about the size of the object. If I assume it was about 20m wide, then the 3.5° angular width would give it the distance of 320m. That would go together with that feeling of mine plus the sound did not come to me immediately, but with approx. one second delay. So, that would put the object over the factory 300 meters away at about 150 meters above ground level. Assumptions.

Moving GIF scetch included. I`m a graduate at faculty of mechanical engineering. I underwnt fighter pilot med-exams and have confirmed excellent eye-vision. I`m also very familiar with all types of aircraft, helicopter, other airborne crafts and satellites, their in-flight behavior and day/night identification. I`m also familiar with stars and other astronomical objects that may be observed with naked-eye or binoculars on night-sky. I wrote complete data of every one of series of events right after they happend. Location:  (on the balcony of my house) Hotedrsica, Slovenia Air temperature: little above zero °C Clouds: 0/8 (clear) No sighted air traffic (towards E and SE commercial flights can be observed about 7° over horizon coming into Ljubljana/Brnik airport area) First 1/5 of moon over western horizon (hidden behind house), Hale-Bopp comet behind the nearby hill. Light pollution of sky zero (rural area). Car traffic in vicinity: zero Wind: none Observer in dark area, no lights in field of vision. Event: I was lying on a deck chair looking straight up, covering approx. 80° left and right, 30° down and 70° up from vertical line (legs facing west). After observing stars through binoculars for a while, I decided to proceede naked-eyed. After a while an object appeared from behind the top of the roof of house wherer I was. Size of objcet was approx. 20° times 6°, movement vector 120°, no sound, 15° per second. I tracked it over 90° of sky for 6 seconds. Object was composed of numerous lights (approx. 30 of them), at visual magnitude of +6. Flight path of object went through Coma Berenices and Leo. Object was transparent (stars behind it were visible). As said, object came in from the direction of my legs, proceeded through zenith after what I stood up, turned around and watched it egress behind the roof of neighboring house. After this event (after 10 minutes) I observed 4 satellites in 2 minutes time. Picture at: <a href=""http://www((URL deleted))"">My Page</a> Duration:  Approx. 6 seconds Appearance: Object transparent, composed of many lights, generally simetrical left/right with slight annomalies (light positions), arrow-headed with very small leading-edge sweep angle. Besides lights (star-sized) no other visible parts. Nor the object neither the lights left no smoke/fire trails. During movement the shape of object remains unchanged (position of lights), heading and speed also. Light color: white, (none of them is blinking, all the same intensity) No sound during the observation. In fact, no ambient sounds at all, 15 mins before till an hour later. Angular size of object:  approx. 20° x 6° Angular velocity: approx. 15°/sec. Conclusions: Due to slow movement, no sound, transparent appearance, formed of approx. 30 star-sized lights of equal intensity in roughy wedge formation (bird-like formation) simmetrically positioned in general, I assume I saw a very large formation of smaller crafts (indefinable shape) flying at very high altitudes or even in orbit. (It is out of the question that the event could be one craft at very low altitude) Later comments:  I read in a paper that there was a scramble alert in USAFB Aviano, Italy (which is located at 300° 80nm from sighting location) on the 11th of March 1997 due to a wave of UFO sightings over the base.

At about midnight on Saturday, 6/21/97, I was turning from Route 120 south onto O'Plaine Road.  It was a nice, warm summer night with just a few wispy clouds and the full moon in the eastern sky.  I was looking southwest and I saw a bright white light bouncing above the treetops. I turned south onto O'Plaine Road and as I drove I could just barely see the light through the trees. I turned west onto Route 137 to go to Old St. Mary's Road.

The disc made a ninety degree angle to the south and then to the center of the road.  Then it made another 90 degree angle and hovered over the left side of the road.  After a few seconds it made another 90 degree angle and returned to it's position over the house. By this time I was driving very slowly past the house and I looked up through my windshield at the disc.  I could now see that there was a vapor or haze emanating from the outermost edges of the disc.  I also noticed that there was no sound coming from the disc but I could hear nature sounds and the sound of my car.  I passed the house and drove around a curve.  At this point I couldn't see the disc or the light anymore.  I had some important things to do at home the next day or I would have stopped and looked at the disc more.

We were about 1 and 1/2 miles from his house when we saw a what seemed to be a strobe light directly over his car on Fairview Rd. in Medford, NJ.  Curious, we wanted to get a better view of the lights, if there was anything to see.  We pulled into a stone parking lot at a nearby baseball field that would allow an unobstructed view of the sky.  Upon stopping and getting out of his vehicle we turned around to see if anything remained in the sky.  At that point we observed an object hovering (it make no noise whatsoever) over the treeline across the road.  After about 10-20 seconds, the object threw on all of its lights and carme across the road toward us.  We jumped into his car, got back to the road, and took off. The object proceeded to follow us down the road at high speed.  It remained at a stable altitude just above the treeline on the right side ! of the road.  After following us for about 1/2 of a mile, it changed direction and cruised directly over his car.  We got a great view!  It was a dark, triangle-shaped object with several lights on the bottom of it.  We then had to make a left turn to get back to his house.  Upon arriving there (about 1/4 mile from where it passed over his car), it was hovering directly over his house.  We jumped out of the car and raced inside.  We scurried into the basement where I called my folks to tell them what had happened.  At that time, for reasons unknown, his car alarm went off.  We had put his car in the garage upon arriving there, so naturally we were frightened.  He turned it off by remote from his kitchen, and we did not investigate.  We locked the doors and retreated to the basement where we drew pictures of the object and talked about it.

Within one minute of this object vanishing, those of us on the beach were buzzed by a low flying military helicopter.

I did not speak to any of the other witnesses on the beach with me, because for some reason nearly everyone there immediately started packing up their belongings to leave right after the helicopter flew over, and for reasons that I cannot explain I too left, although my normal course of action, as it seems to me now would have been to stay and watch a little longer to see if this object reappeared, but I left with an uneasy feeling that I cannot explain.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

I am a Reverand, was an EMT, Combat Medic, CNA, and am currently working at an Assisted Living Facility, there is quite a bit more but.. let's get to it. I have had quite a few sightings well over 50, and of more than 5 types of craft. I saw my first while living in a heavily populated rural area, I lived in an apt. and spent a lot of time watching the skies at night (I smoked ciggs and have kids, ergo me go outside). Have you ever been fooled by your mind or senses? Like your in the dark and bump up against a rope but your mind and senses tell you it's a snake? Well that is basically what happened my first time. I was just about to go in, taking the last drag of my smoke I look up into the night sky, only to see six lights. Two were up front and the other four were behind these and to the side. My mind automatically jumps to the conclusion that it is a low flying passenger airliner, only that it is unusually low keeps my attention for the moment... it is moving very slow... and then I notice it has no tail... there is no noise... those aren't wings.. they're round...   This is when my earlier conclusion is blown away and I am able to clearly see three seperate disk shaped vehicles, they had a brassy looking metalic body with three round nubs at the extrimity of each disk with a much larger nub in the middle of the objects. I took this all in as I yelled for someone to come see this, then noticed I was the only person about, not even traffic was going by (I felt what I suppose some of the natives of SouthAmerica felt when first seeing planes, awe, happy, oh yeah and shock). They then performed (the only word that fits) a manuevor where the two in back cross over and under the first and take the lead making an X. At the same time they had started rotating so it made a wild effect while performing the move. They traveled on slowly for another moment and then accelerated at a mind blowing speed away, they glowed orange to yellow as they did this, which left a blurred lazy S in the sky, just for a moment but it was pretty kwel. Since then I have had very few close encounters with as much impact as that first, yet I have had one or two that are as interesting and that have left their impression, like seeing 3 triangular crafts that were very large with other objects flying about them (seen with wife and friend). Currently I am back to seeing at least one every two weeks or so, it falls off sometimes and other times it seems amazing that it isn't talked about all over the city.",1999-10-19T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

how can i be seeing smoke in  the night sky?"" the moon was due to rise shortly thereafter, so it may have  been illuminated by the not-yet-seen moon. it sort of looked like the smoke  coming out of old coal trains, only not nearly as thick or opaque. very  subtle. and then it was gone. over the mountains. i never saw a deviation in  directon, or any other lights etc coming to meet it or break away, other  than what i am pretty sure to be a faint shooting star that happened to  cross right through the heart of this thing/things, about 3/4 thru my time  of observation. there did seem to be one chunk that dropped quickly away  from the others at about the same time, but i wouldn't swear on that. there was no sound whatsoever. this WAS NOT a meteorite. and in my opinion, it was going too slow and  covered too much distance to really be some sort of booster rocket, the more  i think about it. it really had about the same relative speed, if not  slower, as a satellite seen in the sky right after sunset. to me it seemed  to be powered, given the length and distance of my observation. i would  think something such as a booster casing re-entering orbit would die out  much faster, and be coming in at a much sharper angle. this seemed to have a  constant altitude to me, although how high i couldn't even guess. it seemed  low enough and slow enough to not be really burned by atmospheric friction,  in which case it must have been powered in some way to maintain its  altitude, yet on the other hand, it seemed very high up and thus moving at a  greater speed, but i would think if that were the case, there would be one  of those atmospheric pressure waves or whatever they are called leading it,  like i have seen when the shuttles re-enter orbit. i just remembered one of the theories i head around BRC the next night... a  hacker was bringing down satellites, one by one. if it was man-made, my  guess would be a satellite, not a booster rocket, unless it was one that had  been caught in a semi-stable orbit for some time and was taking it's own  damn sweet time coming back down. maybe iridium investors doing some  insurance fraud? all in all, it was absolutely amazing. and what fuels my suspicions more  than anything is the fact that i haven't heard any ""official"" explanation  anywhere about it. i would think that something so spectacular and witnessed  by so many people would have quite a few news stories or talking heads or  scientists or nasa geeks or SOMEBODY talking about it. c'mon, at least give  us a good cover-up story! and that's all i have to say. bug - denver, colorado",1999-10-19T00:00:00,,

When the sheriff's officer responded to the call, he stayed and watched the object for approximately 10-15 minutes.  During this time he stated that he had never seen anything like this before.  He was so intrigued that he left to try and find the location of this object. The witness reported the first object to be 1/4 of the way up the horizon. The object was reported in the SE sky. The weather conditions of the evening were clear with no fog in the area.  The witness also reported that he has seen planets many times before and stated that this was unlike anything he had seen either.  The gentleman watched the object for nearly 40 minutes, until it seemed to just vanish. During this time it would change color form red to yellow to green at a very quick rate.  He also reported that the object would shoot up into the air and fall back down at rapid speeds.  The object also hovered over his farm area for several minutes at a time.  When this witness called the sheriff again to report the second triangle object, also seen in the SE sky. The sheriff's office said they look into it and never contacted the witness again.  The witness watched the second object ""hover"" over his farm are for nearly 10 minutes. This second object was yellow and triangle shaped. This object also just seemed to vanish. Neither object made any sound that could be heard by any of the witnesses. There was also no smell associated with the objects.

I believe it was summer 1965-1967, I don't remember having to attend school. We were leaving our house on FT Ord to drive to a store in Seaside, when we observed a large shiney metallic object hovering over MontereyBay. My brothers and I watched it out of the car window until we returned from the store and then sat in the yard watching as other neighbors watched also.  After hovering over the bay for awhile, it slowly moved over to the rifle range and I guess it hovered for approx 10 minutes, a row of colored lites appeared around the bottom of it (the sun had not quite set) and then it disappeared.

""April 8, 1968, Monday.  {....I am skipping the first four paragraphs.....}  After dinner I did the dishes and after that I went outside for a cigarette.  At about five to seven I looked up at the sky and saw a strange sight.  A huge, lighted object, quite noiseless, was hovering and swaying over the city to the SoutEast.  I watched it go slowly across the sky, stopping here, going up there, and it moved very slowly.  I was intrigued, thinking at first that it was  helicopter, but then I became aware that there was no nise.  I watched it and I went to the front of the house to have the folks come out.  I had that silly egoistical feeling that the thing was there just for me to see and that it was watching me and reacting to me.  Anyway, before I got too far, it had one large lighted sphere on the bottom and one small one on the top, aparently connected by some metal structure I could only get glimpses of (here I have an arrow pointing to a drawing I made of the object).  It was the shape that intrigued me at first.  As soon as the folks came out, it egan to pick up speed and travel up, and then after about five minutes, like a trajectory it went into ""orbit"" and disappeared.  But, mind you, the thing was very close to ttown and earth at first and later went up, up, 'till it vanished.  Here I want to inject the story Steve, my 12 year old brother, wrote about it.  It's not quite right, but it inspired him to write and that pleases me very much.  I copy even his spelling. 'Steven Smith and family  April 8, 6:45-7:20 spotted a UFO  At aprovamatly 6:45 Mr. Ken Smith (my brother) saw an oblong [here I edited with: not so, but he must not know it - K.L.S.] shaped object hovering over southern Walla Walla.  It was a lumonus object oblong with a smaller light, a foot above it, at first he thought it was a helicopter.  But as though someone in it saw him looking at it put on 'full speed'.  It was th! en he notified us, [myu mother, father and me] it was now southwest and moving rapidly.  My father then got his trancit and sighted it.  It was now west and going up!  It was passed the clouds and shining brightly.  They were very thick.  After changing poisition it looked like a 'cone'.  The light on top sent rays and shaped a cone.  But we soon lost it.  Now turning from the transit it was found, but going higher, soonit dissappeared but to reapere and then leave for good.  I hope .   Later my broter phoned the FAA and they said no sattilite was scheduled now.  Well, we know its UFO, funny.  it was noiseless, I was expecting at least a beep.""   Written by Steven Smith.

We observed them for approx. 1/2 hour.  I then went back inside and upstairs.  My friend then screamed out to me, ""Maureen!, Maureen! come here!  What is this?  I ran outside and looked up and saw a huge craft, with pulsating multi-colored lights underneath it.  It was beginning to slowly descend, and was circling the area.  About one block.  I ran inside and up the stairs to look out, then downstairs, outside in the front yard.  I could not understand why no one else was outside, and the streets were deserted.  I stayed out front by myself for about 15 min.  Then I ran inside to call the police.  The police said that they did not know what I was talking about, ""There isn't anything up there"".

We were totally disoriented and we were nonchalant about the happening, almost robotic, and we both checked our watches and went back to what we were previously doing.  Several days later, I commented to my friend how strangely we acted, why were we so calm, why didn't we speak about it?  At that time my friend glossed over my comments. She did not want to talk about it, because she could not logically explain it, and it perplexed her as she is a mathematician from Poland. Our experience did not make sense to her.  Also, her husband was very ill at the time. Her husband has since passed on.  In June of 1998 she watched by accident a show about UFO's and it reminded her of our incident.

It had a red, blinking light at the tale.  it flew down from the sky, at my eye level, but on the other side of the street.  It was flying fast and zoomed by window.  I screamed for my boyfriend to come look and he saw it too.  Then it seemed like the object new it was being watched becuause after it passed my window, about two block down the street, it made a slow u-turn to my side of the street, and was coming slowly toward my apt. building.  Now it was much quiter.Right before it reached my window the object turned into this huge, black pyramid/trapezoid shape, with a loan yellow light blinking a little above the middle.  It slowly passed my window, a few feet above my head. After it passed my building, it changed back into its original shape and flew up into the sky.  It went over my apartment building, high in the sky.  I ran out my front door and watched it fly over some trees in the distance.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,34.18714851694915,-118.46126228813559

I was out with my neighbor looking at the sky that night(it was perfectly clear with no clouds) and I was looking off to the east when my neighbor called to my attention an object flying silently over us heading east.  He said he saw it when it was at mid-sky and from then on we both saw it head west.  We could not make out any shape, but it had four distinct, orange lights that made a diamond shape.  The way the lights were positioned and the fact that none of them were blinking made me want to rule out the fact that it might be an airplane, because to my knowledge, I don’t know of any planes that don’t have blinking beacon lights on the tail, wing, or somewhere. 	The lights were of an orange color and didn’t move, blink, or change color the whole time the craft passed over(it took about 8 seconds for it to get from mid-sky to over the tree tops where we couldn’t see it).  The craft flew silently over us, and we could here no noise what so ever.  The object made no noise; so, if it would have been a small airplane, much less a jet, we would have surely heard it, because it was not very high up.(between 600 and 700 ft.) 	After we watched it pass over, I ran in the house to tell my brother(who, unfortunately had gonet in the house ten minutes earlier) what we had saw. He was disappointed and we both went outside again.  Once we were out, my neighbor told me he had seen another one, in the same position and place, and heading in the same direction.

At least 7 vehicles stopped on I-25 to look at an object estimated to be ""as long as a football field.  One teenager is reported to us to have been so upset by the event, that he was taken to a hospital emergency room for treatment.  A senior engineer at JPL in Pasadena, CA, was witness to this event, as well. The object was reported by the press to be a ""meteorite.""  We believe this to be a severely flawed conclusion.)) Thought it was a plane coming FROM the SE (moving NNW), it moved at a very regular plane-like speed.  Felt it might have been a military or civilian plane coming to a smooth CRASH.  But it was apparent it was a BIG plane and going too fast to make such a maneuveur without hitting I-25.  There is only a small airport in SFE and it was not headed there. Pulled over on I-25, fearing it was going to cross our path.  It was HUGE, rectangular, like a LADDER on it's side: two parallel rows of white lights connected by ""rungs"" of white lights. It then stopped and SHOT perpendicular to itself at an AMAZING SPEED. After a day of shopping, I was returning from Albuquerque to Santa Fe driving my vehicle at the time, a Toyota 4-Runner (with a moonroof, which I NEVER had to look through for any of these events), on I-25 north when at approximately 8p.m., we were approaching Cerrillos Rd. exit in Santa Fe.  It was already very dark outside.  The person I was with suddenly said, ""WOW, look at that star"". From the windshield, I saw a ""falling star"" shoot high in the sky falling in a SOUTHERNLY direction. I've seen MANY shooting stars and continued driving. A moment later, my passenger asked, ""Is there an airport around here?""  I said SFE Airport which we had already sort of passed. A few seconds later, the passenger said, ""Is that a plane?  Look at that plane...""  I ignored this for a moment because I was watching traffic (which was moderately heavy for 8 p.m.) and I wasn't going to look at everything flying in the sky (seeing airplanes in the clear NM sky is a usual event).  But again, the person said, ""WOW..look at that plane...is that an airplane?""  I looked to my right past the passenger and out that window.  I was completely amazed. I said, ""If that's a plane, it's a 747!!"".  Coming from the SE, from the Manzano/Ortiz/Sandia mountains (they layer atop each other from that perspective) at about a 30 degree (?) trajectory angle from the ground  (it was NEVER above the mountain range) was an incoming ""craft"" looking very plane-like, regulated, controlled, smooth.  It was ""landing"" at this very regular pace which looked like a perfect landing BUT there is no airport and it was coming in WAY too fast. It was coming right toward I-25. (Note: I-25 is a N/S interstate but as the road passes through Santa Fe, it ""hooks"" and at certain points one is moving more in an E/W direction). At no time did it occur to either of us that it was a meteor. This was NOT the shooting star we'd seen a moment earlier.  It was a unit, again looking like a plane coming in for a too-fast landing. It would have been a great landing if it had another 2000 ft to go (which it did not).  Personally, I thought we were seeing a military craft BUT the TWA 800 accident had recently occurred and I thought, ""Who's really ever expecting a plane crash?"" (Alb. Internat'l Airport is about 55 miles south and I thought, it could be crashing to/from there).  I looked to the traffic travelling SOUTH (opposing traffic). We were approaching the St. Francis Dr. exit/entrance now (divided by a wide grassy median)and cars were STOPPING in the opposing direction -- the direction looking toward this oncoming ""craft"". That's when I got this strange chill and pictured us getting slammed by this ""crashing"" plane.  Out of FEAR rather than voyeurism, I pulled off onto the shoulder, fully expecting this ""plane"" to cross I-25 or crash into it.  Several cars behind me also pulled off at this same moment.  As we sat there looking out the passenger side window, it came in CLOSE and was maybe a quarter mile (?) from the highway and looked to be just above treetops/houses!  It was ENORMOUS!  It was a very geometric object consisting of white lights laid out in a rectangular format looking like a LADDER laid upon one side.  Two long rows (one above the other) of white lights connected by ""rungs"" of white lights at regular intervals.  I was not aware of any other color light. The lights just sort of existed -- did NOT radiate or illuminate anything above/below/around themselves. If one stuck out their arm, this ""craft"" seemed the visual length of a twirling baton.  But it was a quarter mile off the road! There was utter SILENCE. It made absolutely no noise at any point during this entire sighting.  Then as we watched it in amazement, it just STOPPED and ""hovered"" for a MICRO-second and then SHOT 90 degrees, perpendicular to itself off to the EAST.  It was STARTLING. We were expecting it to crash but it instead did this!   And although I HATE to use the term, it SHOT at ""warp-speed"".  I have NEVER seen ANYTHING move so FAST,so silently or so strangely in all my life. We were speechless. We sat there for a moment and I looked at the dashboard clock.  It read exactly 8:05 p.m. Shaken, we resumed driving, having to wait for other cars that had pulled over to re-enter the lanes before us.  We could NOT believe it.  We wondered where it could have possible gone -- it did NOT seem to have crossed I-25 at all but had SHOT into/over? the short foothills of the Sangre De Cristos. We had another 15 miles to drive to my home and could NOT figure out WHERE such a thing COULD have even gone (other than INTO a foothill).  It was a VERY disturbing experience.  Not really thrilling or exhilirating. It was frightening.  As we got in at 8:25, I immediately called my sister in Chicago.  Then we watched the 10 pm local news and it was the lead story on all the stations. But they were ""wondering"" what it was ""What was in the sky tonight...was it a meteor...some say it WASN'T!"" So,  I called one of the stations simply to tell them what we'd experienced and got the ""Oh, interesting..."" routine. It was all over the papers over the following days -- some people describing what we'd seen; others saying it was a falling star. I wondered how one man in our neighborhoof saw this meteorite ""event"" which ALL global observatories had failed to detect!! Then in the days that followed, a physicist at Sandia Nat'l Labs was quoted in the papers as saying that what a person had described as it's movements (not my account but the same), it could not have been a meteorite but was perhaps a retrievable satellite or other ""craft"".  NO agency/observatory ANYWHERE tracked a meteor that evening.  So I called this physicist who is an ""expert"" in meteorite behavior.  We spoke for 30 minutes. He said NO meteorites were seen and wished he'd seen what we saw. We discussed how meteorites behave, how they break up and are like fire lights, etc...most, of course, disintegate before ever entering the atmosphere. They DO NOT stop, hover or switch directions! I asked, ""Why would no one be concerned even if it were 'only' a satellite -- what happened to the warnings ala SKYLAB in the 70's...what if it had been a MISSILE???"" In this part of the globe, with GREAT celestial visibility and a large military presence, it oddly seemed NOT to intrique any officials! In Los Angeles, CA, it was seen an HOUR later (even accounting for Daylight Savings)!!  UCLA offered a reward to anyone who could find a piece of it...because they felt it was NOT a meteorite. A month later (?), the  Sandia Lab physicist I had spoken with was quoted in the papers as saying it was a ricocheting metorite traveling at 186,000mph. For a guy who never saw or recorded it, he had a THEORY! (How it would take so long to get to L.A. is unexplained, of course).  It was said that the meteroite landed in Moriarity, NM!!  This is 50 miles SOUTH of Santa Fe (the ""craft moved NORTH, THEN last I saw, ENE.  No fragments were ever found in Moriarity. But then a physicist at Los Alamos Nat'l Labs immediately refuted the Sandia physicist's sudden theory saying that for 40 years, he was an expert in ricocheting meteorites and would NOT have missed one -- they come along every 10,000+ years and are IMPOSSIBLE to miss because they are so powerful and LARGE. They enter earth's atmosphere and then ""ricochet"" back into space to again immediately re-enter the atmosphere because they are powerhouse meteors!! The person who was with me during this sighting does NOT wish to be identified at this time but would likely answer questions off-the-record.",1999-05-24T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

Late in the evening on the 8th I saw 2 objects west slightly south west I saw 2 objects in the sky being chased by 2 jets. As I stated in the other block I saw the objects and wathced them for for about 5 min give or take, pulling my truck off the road. one object was alittle higher and to the left than the other and I thought at first passenger planes, since I'm decent at geography and I really couldn't tell the altitude and size but they seemed to be right next to McGee Tyson airport in knoxville. Next I saw the jets they seemed to be coming from the same direction actually my direction and  the one on the left was a little more to the left of me like they were split off and were merging on the same point (the objects).This is when I pulled over and started watching them, I could tell that, well at least from my vantage point they seemed to be a lower altitude and were going up. The objects were yellow orange color ,I don't think this was there true color , because from where I was at they they were high enough that since the sun had just set, that they were still high enough that the sun was still hitting them. I couldn't really tell , but I don't think the jets were reflecting any light. I still wasn't sure if the jets were going after the objects or just moretypical passenger craft until, the object on the right jumped rather quickly higher and way to the left and it was not possible by any jet I've ever heard of because the jet on the right veered hard up and to the left and thats when I could finally tell the shape of the craft and 2 tight contrails, the jets were giving off contrails the objects weren't by the way, and being an aircraft buff, the only thing I could thing of from the contrails they were giving off was that they were fighters, maybe a Leer jet could. but when this ting veered it had to be doing some major G's so that pretty much ruled out a leer jet. So clearly they were chasing it and gaining ground , but then within about 30seconds time they seemed to take off not really upward(not sure) but, definately away from me and finally out of sight, and the jets continued on in pursuit and it took the about a couple of minutes to get out of sight. The objects were spherical but at the distance I couldn't be sure because of the glow they were giving off. I also know cause I'm about 45 mile from the knoxville airport , and I can see planes all the time coming and going from there and know what passenger planes look like at that distance, and fighters look like and if I had to guess they of F-15 or F-18 shape, cause when the one veered off i could see more of the top of it.As far as the weather it was pretty clear, well there wasn't any clouds in the sky where this was happening, and the sky was a typical orangish color like after any sunset. I don't know how possible it is, but I kinda would like to know if anyone else saw it , cause no one I know saw it, and my daughter who was with me is only 5 and she just kept asking me what I was looking at. I hope you find this useful and hope it might help support someone else if they saw it also.

The sun was setting at this time which added extra light to the high objects contrail.  The craft itself could not be seen.  At first we thought it was a normal jet.  The contrail disappered after about the first 30seconds of viewing, then reappeared with the craft still in the same direction.  Within 1 min of viewing the object made a sudden turn and headed West, leaving a shrp U shape in the sky.  What was strnge about this was the abnormal speed. I have not seen Airliners fly this fast, so our initial thought was a fighter jet of sorts.   When the craft was heading West a small but noitcable puff of smoke or some turbulance affected the contrail leaving a bulge or bubble in its path.  The craft appeard to pick up speed and disappered into the horizon.  Again this might have been a normal airplane of types at supersonic speed.  The sunset though allowed for some spectaculer viewing. I am not a believer in so called ""extra terrestrisalas"" but I am sending this report as to see if any one else saw the object.

I remember because it was the first day of the St. Mary's University Oyster bake, which kicks off Fiesta Week in San Antonio. My (ex)girlfriend and I had been near my parent's office.  She was with me while I was surveilling a claimant at an apartment complex off of Loop 410.  At the time, I was working as an investigator for the family business.  I worked on insurance cases:  worker's comp and auto liability. We had left the complex and were at my parent's office, which was nearby:  ((address deleted)) Executive Center.  We'd planned for me to pickup a van there.  I'd drive it over to my parents' house and name deleted))(my girlfriend) would follow in my car.  While in the parking lot, we noticed a weird looking object in the sky west of us, in the direction of my parents' place.  The object was silver-gray and metallic.  It was shaped like a conical disc seen in profile.  It seemed very big. We got into the vehicles after wondering about it briefly.  Since we were going in the same direction as the house (the house is about 1.5 miles from the office, ""as the crow flies"", but about 2 miles away after all the twists in the road.) I decided to keep my eye on the ""thing.""  So did ((name deleted)), as it turned out.  All the way home, the thing didn't seem to move.  That is, it seemed stationary.  And as we got closer to the house, we could see more of it, as if we were getting closer and closer to being under it.  The thing looked to be as high in the air as it was far away from the office.  At arms length, I'd say it would be about the size of a silver dollar, maybe bigger. By the time we got to the house, we were underneath it.  Diane had parked behind me.  I got out of the car to look up at the ""thing"".  I could see the underside, and there were structures there, but the underside seemed ""hazy"".  Blurred.  And I had the odd feeling that I was forgetting what the underside looked like even while I was looking directly at it.  Weird. Now, the whole time I was driving home, I kept telling myself to stop, go to my car (which Diane was following me in) and grab my damn camera.  It's crazy, but for some reason I almost ""couldn't.""  Very strange.  So, when we arrived at the house, I parked and ran back to my car.  Diane was staring up through the windshield at it.  I tried to get her attention, then looked back up and the thing was gone!  I was a little pissed!  Diane was still staring, at nothing now.  When I snapped her out of it, she said that after we parked the thing flashed a light ""at"" her and was gone. I never heard any more about it.  The house is at an intersection on a major boulevard (Wurzbach) and is very near the medical center. There were lots of other cars around, tooling along Wurzbach.  I expected to hear that someone else had seen the thing, but I never heard anything about it. Oh, when I mention ""haze or aura"" below, it only applies to the underside of the ""thing"", which was otherwise clear and sharp. In my opinion, the thing was somewhat elegant in design.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,29.488865917141535,-98.4752404435546

I'm not sure how useful this information can be since I'm not certain as to the date on which it took place, but it may be useful to mention that the show Sightings was still a prime time program then, and that a few weeks after this sighting, the show featured and event which took place in Russia involving similar craft. Also, I was quite young at the time (I'm 21 now), and the accuracy of this report may seem questionable because of it, but in order to prevent any distortion of the facts the relevant information of this event was previously logged by me, and this record rather than my memory is the source of this account. It started at my friend's house, who's backyard connects to a back street adjacent to some train tracks, beyond which are mostly more train tracks, the Bethlehem Steel Plant, and then Lake Erie, so the view of the area above the lake was relatively unobstructed. I was in his yard with him and his two younger siblings, and just suggested that we go look for UFOs. This would seem more unusual if you didn't take my age into account, but it was the first time I'd ever made such a suggestion. I had a small pair of binoculars with me, and we began to search the skies. It was around 7 or 8 pm, and the sun was about to go down, so there was still some light. Almost immediately, I spotted something in the sky directly above. It appeared to be a satellite to me, with blinking lights that flashed in a triangular formation. This was evident as the second flash would blink next to the first, and the third would blink behind the other two. This was rather uninteresting to us, so we headed out into his back yard looking Westward over the lake. It was probably 20 minutes when I spotted something moving South. It looked like many of the other planes we had seen going back and forth, but a bit slower, and I watched it since there was nothing else in the sky to watch. After a minute or so, this got boring to me, and I began to search the other areas of the sky. When I looked back to where I would have expected the light to be, I couldn't find it. Instead, I saw a large (compared to the original light) colorful, seemingly swirling ball of light sitting motionless over the top of the steel plant. I wondered about it, but then decided that it was probably there all along, just some light in the steel plant parking lot that just looks weird. I searched the skies again, and looked back after a minute or so. The ball was gone, but the smaller light was back, moving along it's original course. As we watched it, for now we were more curious about it, it seemed to be slowing down. When it appeared to have stopped, it soon became obvious that in fact it had turned and was headed in our direction. Through the binoculars, it appeared to be saucer shaped, with a flat bottom, thin edges, and a bulge in the middle. As it drew nearer, it began slowly to turn towards the North. It gradually came almost directly overhead, at which point we could see that it was triangular in shape. In each corner was a round, flat light, each of a different color. What these colors were, I forget, but they were plain bright colors (I'm pretty sure one was red, the others may have been blue, green, or yellow). Also, the craft was being followed by 2 others just like it. They moved extremely slowly, and made no sound. This made it hard to determine it's size, but I was under the impression that they were approximately as long as a passenger jet. Through the binoculars, the back end of them seemed hazy as if intense heat was being discharged. They continued a smooth turn and headed back towards the lake. A group of helicopters appeared from around the mainland and chased the crafts out over the lake.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,,

My ex husband and I were up late one night. He was working on his bicycle and had to go out to the barn for a tool. He came back a couple minutes later and said I should come out and 'check out these lights'. I went out and was astonished by the brilliance of these blinking lights visible in the northern sky in a gap between a bunch of fir trees. (My house was about 7 miles north of town.) I went to get a pair of binoculars and my jaw truly dropped to the ground: I saw a disc-shaped object, like the lid of a sauce pan, metallic or silvery-grey in color. The lights (red and blueish-green) were not blinking after all, but were circling the edge of the disc. They seemed to blink when looking with the naked eye only because the lights disappeared behind the object - which was itself not bright enough to be visible to the naked eye - and reappeared as they circled again to the front. My ex and I took turns watching through the binoculars. He made the comment that it looked like ""a wheel within a wheel"". The object bobbed like a cork in a standing wave of water but stayed in roughly same spot the entire time we watched it (well over an hour)! Through the binoculars, it appeared to be about the size of a pencil eraser at arm's length; with the naked eye it was somewhat larger than the size of a bright star or planet. I guessed it was about 2 or 3 miles away. It looked like it was hovering over an area called Prater Mountain - or, possibly, Blue Lake at the foot of Prater. (Two weeks later we heard that a neighbor saw a ufo around the same time, also near Prater.) After a while, my ex went to bed but I watched it until it disappeared. It didn't zip away, like so many ufos are reported to do; it seemed to gradually get smaller until it resembled a star. (However, I was scanning the sky from time to time, so it might have vamoosed when I was looking elsewhere.) I saw it again (or something similar) the next night: I was keeping my eye on a ""bright star"" off in the North when suddenly it zoomed straight towards me.! I was ready to run back to the house and hide under the bed! It stopped farther away, however - I would guess a distance of 8 miles or so (through the binoculars it looked like blinking red and blue lights rotating in a tight circle, and the object itself was not discernable). My sister and brother-in-law had arrived on a visit from California earlier that day. I woke them up and when my sister saw it she remarked that ""it's definitely something, all right - I wonder if the government is experimenting with new aircraft."" This should have been the ultimate confirmation for me, as my sister is a die-hard skeptic! (though I don't think the government can make something that behaves as that thing did...) As the days went by, I began to convince myself that what we saw could have been some sort of atmospheric disturbance. But then, we heard of someone else in the neighborhood who saw it, and a few weeks later, mufon or some other organization posted flyers asking people to let them know if they had seen something during that period. And finally, around Feb or Mar of the following year, there was a video on some tv show supposedly showing a ufo down along the Spokane River between Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls. I didn't see it but heard the video was taken during the spring of '94, just a few weeks before our sighting. My conclusion: either the guv, mufon, and other nameless entities/individuals were conspiring together to inflame my latent paranoia(!), or... we really SAW something extraordinary! (I have not reported this sighting to any organization or agency until now.)",1999-08-10T00:00:00,48.3876,-116.8898

WE ALL RAN AWAY. Imagine the beach at night... How the water seems black. There was a thick fog rolling in and a few of the citys orange lights were barely visable through the fog. My cousin and I were camping at Dillion's beach with our family. When our parents had gone to sleep my cousin and I snuck out of our camp to meet up with these two girls we had meet eailer that day. I remember they were students of the Sacramento FFA. We meet up with these girls and decide a walk along the beach would be kinda fun. So we followed the trail through these large sand dunes that obscure the view of the beach. When we got out on the beach we began to flurt around and my cousin said he wanted to sit with girl he was talking with. I still wanted to walk the beach and so did the other girl (I don't know their names - only that the blonde had a good size scar on her left cheek) So we began to walk the beach and we were talking about somthing when she suddenly grabbed my arm and in a husshed tone said ""What is that?"" Ilooked up to where she was pointing. ""I saw something move over there."" I looked and saw nothing. Just fog, ocean and a few specks from the street lights about a mile and a half away. I told her she was seeing things and we continued to walk, but this time she grabbed my arm violently - nearly making me fall over. ""LOOK!"" I looked up to see a green aura slowly emerge from behind the dunes and it slowly floated towards the shore. It casted a lime green color but unlike an electric lightbulb beam, the light emmiting from this thing was spread out evenly, there seemed that there was no source, no origin to the unearthly green glow. I looked over at the girl and said ""Let's go get my cousin"". She agreed hastily as we ran down the beach to find him. He was were we left him with the other girl and I ran up to him from out of the darkness and in a tone I have never spoken before said ""GET UP AND COME WITH ME NOW!"" and for some reason he did not even ask why as I lead the other three back up the shore line. All the while I was thi! nking how stupid we would sound once we got there and nothing was to be seen. Much to my suprise the green aura was there! It was hovering silently above the wet part of the sand. All four of us stood in shaock. I remember someone asking what it was but no one answered because the aura began to move. And it was moving towards us! The two girls immediatly turned tail and fled as my cousin grabrd my shoulder and told me to run. I resisted and he let go and began to run as I looked back the aura was moving much faster than a seconed before and it was coming at me... I felt afraid for my life...I have never been afraid like that ever. I stood there just a moment longer to get a good look at it then I too ran away as fast as I could and I never looked back. When we got back the girls went to their camp and my cousin and I sat around the embers of our campfire. We began to talk about what we had seen when a horrible scream filled the night air. It was a girl's scream and it was coming from the girl's camp. The girl that my cousin was talking with on the beach begaing to scream out at the top of her lungs ""WHAT was IT? WHAT was it? WHAT was it?"" Untill the members of her camp came out to calm her down. She was having a breakdown mentally and it really set in my mind that what we saw out there is nothing we are ever taught about in school.",1999-08-10T00:00:00,,

You asked if anyone else has seen triangular flying vehicles.  Well, my wife and I both saw one together.  It was September 1994.  We were travelling North on the A1 (a major North-South highway in the UK) a few miles south of our home.  As we passed near to RAF Alconbury, a USAF air base (fully operational at the time) at 23.00, this huge, silent, black triangular craft, with a red/purple light at the front tip and white lights at the other two corners, flew quite low and to our right.  It then seemed to invert and flew back the way it had come.  My wife then said that it appeared to hover.  The craft was silent and pretty big. I've seen prop planes like Hercules transports, various fighters, U2s and helicopters take off from that base in daylight and at night and it WAS NOT one of these.  My guess is that it was a secret stealth recon plane, the replacement for the SR71 Blackbird, called Aurora or Firefly.  However, the technology is amazing.  It was low, slow, silent, and hovers.   A while later (a few months), my wife was driving her mother along country lanes near our village and she nearly drove off the road, because she was startled by this huge black triangular craft that rose silently from behind a hill, flew over the car and was gone.  This was in daylight.  I showed them pictures of the stealth fighter and stealth bomber and both said it looked more like the bomber but it was not the same.  The stealth bomber has not been deployed outside the USA, but it is rumoured that these secret triangular craft are deployed in the UK and Germany as well as the USA and crewed by NATO pilots.  I'll say one thing, it was a magnificent sight and I won't forget that brief encounter.  I expect that in 20 years or so it will be on the Discovery Channel!  The Blackbird was retired in 1990 but was built in the mid 60's and was very advanced.  So, I wonder what amazing prototypes are being built now to outperform these triangular craft?",1999-08-10T00:00:00,,

(Shape wise it looked like a basketball sitting ontop of a cassette box) Except the sphere was perfectly round and had sort of a mesmerizing presence to it,an aura . It sat directly on top of the rectangular shaped black object at the bottom, no straps or anything visible holding it down or attaching it. The black part was obscured by the tree tops. I was trying to make it out, although it was hard to see the black part, it seemed to have some part of it folded up under it at the bottom like legs or something. As I was traveling about 50 mph heading west it was moving north west out over the trees and slightly slower about 35mph. I was gaining on it. When I came to a stop light the car behind me pulled up along side me to turn right. The driver gave me a look like, you see that? And nodded towards it, just before he made his turn. The light turned green and then I was trying to get as close as I could trying to see it better. I kept saying ""what is that"". It continued out over the trees and it seemed to glide as if it were being controlled some how and like it was riding on a magnetic field. It did not float like a ballon or appear to be a balloon.

My friends and I were out in our backyard with a campfire (i was young at the time).  One of my friends and myself went to grab some more wood for the fire, so we walked about 50 yards or so to a road that runs behind our property.  as we turned toward the west, we noticed a large, spherical shaped object in the distance.  it looked as if it were the sun, very large and reddish-orange in color.  we sat and watched it for about 5-10 minutes then it vanished.  we didn't think much of it, until about 20-30 minutes later.  Out of the south we saw, some type of lights above the clouds.  it was reddish, moving at a fair rate of speed.  it continued moving north a few miles and seemed to stop about 2 miles from our property were a oil field had been carved out of the woods..  a few moments later,  we heard the loud thumping of helicopters, and soon after the sounds we saw them (they sounded much like hueys, loud dull rotor sounds).  we counted about five helicopters moving just over the tree tops, they went directly over us.  again, they were heading north in the same path as the light we saw.  over the tree tops we could see a few of them circling the oil field and we thought that they may have landed out there.  so my buddy and i proceed down a pipeline right-of-way that went directly to the oil field.  i guess we were about half way there when something caught my eye, i stopped walking.  my friend, slightly behind me, asked why i had stopped, and about that time, i told him to look down at his chest.   on his chest was what seemed to be a laser sight dot for a gun or something.  the same was on my chest.  we ran back the entire way to my house.  running into the house screaming,  my mom asked what had happened and we told her.   to this day i can remember the event ver! y vividly and my mom still remembers seeing us run into the house that night, looking like we had seen a ghost or something.",1999-08-30T00:00:00,30.2509,-95.19939999999998

I was deep asleep one night when something stirred me. In that dreamy consciousness you get I remember feeling like I was vibrating. I thought I heard a noise and remember thinking, ""What is a jumbo jet doing flying over Ocean Shores?"" The noise got louder over several minutes until I thought to myself ""this thing is going to crash right on the beach."" I sat up, fully awake. The noise was gone and I realized I hadn't actually heard it audibly, that it was more like a sub-sonic vibration. I ran outside and looked up into the sky and saw a formation of seven red lights overhead. At first I thought it was a very slow moving formation of helicopters. But then I back and got my glasses. When I returned I could see that it was instead a single, triangular shape. I could judge this because the it was a partially overcast night and I could see the orange glow of the town's streetlights (about half-mile away) everywhere except between the small red lights. I stood stunned as the craft passed overhead slowly, moving from south to north along the coastline. I estimate it was only a couple of hundred feet above and travelling about 10 mph.

My husband and I took abother day trip out to the mountains just 10 minutes from the Canadian border...this time we'd brought along a video camera, tho it was running low on juice. Leter that afternoon, we ended up crossing the beautiful and scenic Lake Sullivan to Pend Orielle motel,  ~ a two floor building with maybe 8 to 10 rooms per floor, possibly a couple more. It's a small place tho. He went and got a room for us and we went in to relax and chill out for the night. Our room had been on the upstairs end, facing the water. Other homes surrounded its banks around the left side. We ate, had showers, then relaxed zoning on tv. Somewhere around 10:30 (the news had just ended), I glanced outside thru the balcony doors and noticed a big bright light in the sky. I thought little of it and absently assumed it had been a jet heading our way and would soon fly over. I didn't consider Venus or anything because it was entirely too big and too low, and had definite cloud cover behind it. (After Moses Lake, that was something I learned to look for!) Awhile later, closer to midnight, I happened to glance out again and noticed the light was still there. It hadn't moved. Curious, I went outside onto the balcony to have a better look. It was low in the sky and hovered soundlessly over the water. It was a bright white light and round, did not move. It was too high to have been a shore light, which were all a yellowish color, and too big and low for a planet. It clearly wasn't a plane, jet, or chopper. It hadn't moved in several hours. Almost 6 in all that I'd watched it. It came to me to videotape it so I grabbed the camera and was able to capture it on film for maybe 60-70 seconds before the battery died. I kept an eye on it until nearly 4am before I finally slept. I didn't see it the next morning when we left. Later that evening when we were home and I checked the tape, it zipped thru pretty fast and it was hard to make out what  it might have been. Fortunately I was able to capture the shoreline and lights for reference as I panned upward to the light in the sky. On the tape the light is white...dark skies, cloudy, and faint star points vague in the background. Because it zipped thru too quickly, I decided to run it on slow mo and was pretty stunned at the discovery. I'm no expert on lights so can't say for certain if lights do this...however NONE of the house and shore lights did this at all; they remained steady. The light in the sky would completely disappear off the screen for several frames and return for several, disappear again...and return, for the duration of the segment. At regular speed it's steady and ""on"", as are the shore and house lights. At slow mo speed, only the light in the sky disappears for several frames, ""off"", and on again. Also, the stars vague in the background do not disappear either. I have no idea. I still have the tape. I've wanted to have it analized for awhile but was afraid to make a copy in case it didn't do it on a copy, but was also unwilling to let go of the original because I might never see it again. Anyone with suggestions please contact me. *** I have posted the other events here also. Look for: 1. MOSES LAKE  WASHINGTON  MARCH 23, 1995 2.

In July of 1996 my wife accompanied me to help check the doors, shortening my required walk.  Coming upon the last building my wife and I again met up at which time we noticed an unusual type of light reflecting on the pavement 50-100 yards in every direction.  The light closely resembled the light emitted from late model Lincoln headlights  (a new type of halogen bulb) and had sort of a purple tint.  In total amazement we both looked up to observe some sort of craft hovering in total silence  around 300 feet over our heads.  The craft had very bright white lights placed in a triangle and no other lighting.  The brightness did not seem to correspond to the level of light hitting the ground as if it were diffused on its way down.  The craft remained motionless until we could get to our apartment (approx. 1 block) in an attempt to get my binoculars.  We observed the craft the entire way to the apartment and actually began to feel uneasy about the ships presence. Unfortunately the ship was gone when we came out of the house with the binoculars and we were never able to observe the ship moving.

(This area is flat and the freeway lies in an almost straight line for miles.)

It was hovering about 1000 ft. above the freeway and as I drove almost directly under it, I could see it had a ""thimble"" shape (larger end up). I could view it clearly because of all the light that was coming from the large windows that surrounded it. I thought about stopping for a better look but didn't have a camera (naturally), and also thought to myself, ""Sure, get a real good look, like Travis Walton did,""  so I kept going.

I went for a drive one evening, down south on highway 71 and about 6 or 7 pm when I was returning, happened to glance off to my right, in the sky and noticed two light-blue colored lights, side by side, heading angle-wise toward the road ('8 oclock'). The distance between the lights, perspective-wise, was less than an inch apart, and didn't blink or flash. Also, what struck my attention had been the color...almost a neon blue. I kept an eye on the because I knew they'd soon pass across the road; however, when they got closer and I could see better what they were attached to, they began to arc south (back toward '6 oclock'). These were particularly curious because I've never seen that color blue before ~ this neon or flourescent blue is as close as I can describe it. I pulled onto the shoulder and stopped, got out and watched. THIS event scared me damn near as bad as the moon-looking orb. The object or craft was a thin rectangle, and the lights were inside either end. It looked like a big 2x4 on its widest side, and perspective-wise, about 3 feet in length if at arm's length.  The lights were inside the narrow-most side, like the eyes of a hammerhead shark, only in front, not the side. ___________________________ |_*_____________________*__| Initially I assumed it was a plane but it made no sound at all...literally soundless, and as it went by, there hadn't been any more to it ~ just a simple, black (or possibly dark gray, steel color) rectangle. If it would have been a plane (and this was a low as a low flying plane could fly without dropping out of the sky, and about twice as wide as the wing span of a little charter plane), I could have seen the rivits and seams and bolts, etc. This was solid and looked seamless. It cruised at plane speed. My rationale tried to convince me this was likely some new machine  that they're testing out...maybe a remote operated spy plane or something...military jets do a lot of low flying out there in that part of the city (outskirts of Bossier City)...but reality said it was doubtful...this IS Barksdale. I watched it head south at a languid speed until it was no longer visible, and gathered myself, and went home. Later, I mentioned this event to my mother, who related a similar account she'd had with the same sort of object being chased by two military jets, and it shot off out of sight. I also asked an Air Force buddy of mine if they were testing something out there and he said they weren't, it wasn't ours, and several pilots on base were all wired over it because no one knew what it was or where it came from.  I found this a little hard to choke down tho, because I would think that it would've been shot out of the sky had it breezed in over an air base. He also said, tho, that we have nothing at Barksdale that could fly that low without making deafening noise, much less crashing.

My view of it was obstructed by the buildings across the street after only a few seconds and never saw it again. It seemed to be void of any features.

I am not a good judge of size and distance so I'm sorry to say that I have no reliable reference. My guess would be that it was maybe a half mile away and maybe 20 feet across.

The air was relatively calm with a building of some very large dark clouds to the Northwest. I had just rolled my plane into the hanger when we heard other pilots talking about what they were seeing.  I immediatly went out and observed a craft that appeared to be dark or black in color.  It was first thought to be an ultra-light but appeared to be too large.  Darkness was rapidly closing in and no pilot without any lighting would continue to fly.  We kept listening for engine noise, but there was not so much as a whisper.  We watched it approach bearing about 080 degrees, at less than 3/4 of a mile it turned to about 360 degrees.  Our concensis was that it was about 1500 AGL, and moving at about 35-40 Kts.  As it banked North it was under the clouds but mostly obscured by a dark background.  Eventually it came back into clear sky, but had gained altitude, at least another 1000 feet or more. At this point with the darkness and distance we lost sight of it. I got a chance to see it with binoculars, it appeared to be chevron shaped.  In discussing the incident with the other pilots, we thought that the dimensions of this thing would have a cord of about 6-10 feet and a span of appx. 30-35 feet.

We were sitting outside at a small, private outdoor concert, but were seated in a dark area far from the stage where a woman was performing.  I was lying on my back, enjoying the view of the stars, and noticed an object passing directly overhead on a steady west to east trajectory. It was the most unusual thing I had ever seen, and I quickly pointed it out to my friend.  It appeared to be flying fairly low (maybe under 8,000 feet), possibly triangular in shape with be 3 to 5 light underneath/inside it.  This description is not meant to be vague; it's just that the object appeared to have an unusual but regular 'movement', that actually seemed to change it's shape, but in a consistent pattern.  The constant shape changing affected how many lights we could see on the underside or inside of the object.  Despite it's constant fluctuating movement, it's course seemed to be straight and steady.  It was moving faster than a balloon, dirigible or helicopter, but was not particularly fast.  It disappeared from sight sooner than it should have (probably 40 degrees above the eastern horizon).  We think it was only one object, and we heard no sound from it (but there was relatively loud music from the stage).  I got the sense that it may have only been 'obviously' visible to someone directly under it; primarily because it's lights were similar in size and color to the stars beyond.  Because we were directly under it, we were able to see the motions (shape fluctuations) when portions of it moved underneath (or changed shape) and obscured/revealed it's lights.  Because of this, we don't really think that it's disappearance was the result of it changing speed or direction; we think that once it was a certain distance from us, we would not be able to notice the movement/shape changing on it's underside; thus it's lights were difficult to discern against the backdrop of the stars in the night sky.  We agreed that it was NOT a plane, weather or other balloon, helicopter or animal.

I was walking home from work at around 9:40 pm EST Melbourne Australia time. I was walking up Swanston Street toward the train station and an unidentifed object streaked accross the sky. It was travelling easterly and was like a large yellow ball of flame with a bright blue centre and had a yellow streak of light behind it.  It was simply awsome and I have never seen anything like it. No sound was emitted. I have seen falling stars before, but nothing like this. This thing was comparatively huge and had a much lower trajectory.The object was visible for about 5 seconds, heading in an easterly direction. I just happend to mention it to a work college the next day, and amazingly he saw the same object but at a totally different location about 20 miles away.  He claimed he also saw its shape after it had burned out its flame and its light grey color. This is the most bizzare observation of a UFO type object I have ever seen.

I was taking the trash out at a dark end of the house and happened to notice a bright white light (like a landing light on an aircraft) about 5-10° over the southern horizon and I'd estimate it to have been 6 or 7 miles away over the Santa Cruz Mountains. I'd heard that a couple of planets were in alignment and were very bright appearing so I stopped and studied it thinking that it might've been those planets. It was a perfectly clear night sky, no clouds but this light had a perfectly round cloud around it. I'd estimate it was 3 times the diameter of the Moon. the light was close enough to nearby trees, chimneys, ets that I could tell it was stationary. In the course of 2 or 3 minutes the cloud reduced in size and visibility as did the bright light in the center of it until it vanished. It was very even how it got smaller and dimmer and staying absolutely round. No drifty breaking up like a cloud would do. I went inside and told my wife about it then got my binoculars and! several minutes later went back out to look around and saw the same exact thing all over again from the same direction except it was maybe twice a s far away and it was quite a bit smaller and dimmer by the time I saw it and it was very close to the horizon of the Mountains (but behind them) and I couldn't really get any more detail with the binoculars. I should mention that this part of the sky is a flight path for incoming aircraft I assume for SFO International. I've been around long enough to know that incoming aircraft with landing lights on move and get bigger, not smaller as they approach and don't have accompanying clouds. I was an aircrewman in the Navy and have some experience in looking for aircraft in the skies. I described this to a TWA pilot friend of mine and he didn't have a clue what I'd seen.

It only lasted seconds.  It scared me so badly that I called a friend to comfort me.   When I realized the world hadn't ended, I was okay, but very puzzled as to what had happened.  The next day around 2:30 I went outside to mow the lawn. (and prove to myself I wasn,t scared to go out side.)  I started at the left front of house, going towards the woods.  When I came close to the woods ,I noticed a burnt place in the yard. I turned off the mower to investigate more closely.  I was about 12 to 15 inches in diameter, perfectly round, not out of line anywhere and about 10 to 15 feet wide and all the grass in the middle was squished down flat, like a heavy wieght had been on it.  My dog went crazy when he came over to see what I was looking at.  Jumping back and forth at it and yipping high, shrill ,barks over and over.  So I tied him on the other side of the house.  The burnt grass was still in form.  I thot someone was playing a joke on me.  So I questioned my nieghbor on the hill across the road, to see if she had heard or seen anything.  She said no. But, you could see the burnt circle perfectly from her porch.  And it was perfect.  I showed the circle to my brother, my cousin and acouple of friends, and my husband at the time.  My husband and brother both knew of the incident the day before because I told them all about it at supper the night before, so we were all trying to put two and two together.   As summer progressed  the burnt area turned brown. Then these mushrooms, and only mushrooms started growing in the circle. They grew fast,and extremly large, until they just burst open.  Then they disentigrated and toward the end of summer the grass started growing back.  It grew darker, thicker, faster, and taller than the rest of the grass in the yard.  That winter it snowed, and that circle of grass still grew tall through the snow.  You could see that circle for a few years after a! lso, but has finally faded away. Same as above.

I was looking up in a WNW direction. I heard other reports of strange lights seen by others, not only on the Art Bell show but a radio station in Delaware on the East coast was taking reports on the air when I tuned in at 5:30 am. I was star gazing with my husband on Wednesday evening Sept 01 1999. We went outside at about 9:20pm with our night vision scope and binoculars-it was a clear night. I was facing WNW and observed with the unaided eye (except for my eyeglasses) a couple of shooting stars.  I thought it was strange to be seeing them, because the next meteor shower that I know of won't be untill Nov.17th. Then at around 9:30pm from the same direction, I then saw what I described to my husband as 'a white light that looked like it exploded'.  It was a quick burst of light and then it was gone...like a pinpoint of light that burst out and got bigger.  It did not light up the whole sky, just a small diameter about the size of my pinky. I thought it was strange, but it could have just been a meteorite that entered in at about a 45 degree angle and exploded--untill I tuned into Art Bell's show and heard about all these people calling in about the lights they were seeing at about 9:30 coming in from the west. I couldn't believe it! I wondered if this was just a coincidence, because no one was reporting anything happening on the east coast...Not yet. Since Art Bell goes off the air at 5am in my area, I decided to tune in via the internet and picked call letters WGMD which is in Delaware. Art was supposed to be on that station till 6, but for some reason he wasn't. But when the host returned after commercials it was someone else's voice saying that people are calling in to ask if anyone else was seeing strange lights in the sky. I continued to listen for about a half hour as they were airing phone calls from the ones who observed them in the Delaware area. Obviously something country-wide or even bi-coastal was happening that night into the morning...not just on the west coast.",1999-09-12T00:00:00,35.074,-81.2129

There was thin, whispy cirrus cloud apparently between the object and the ground.

After the quick duration of the flash the object instantly resumed its previous light intensity and continued its traverse across the night sky (heading NNW, app. 320-340 degrees). I lost site of the object in a minute or so later owing to the mountainous landscape. My wife did not see the flash.

At around 20:30 hrs we were travelling west bound on Highway 183 and had just taken the exit to highway 10 when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter hovering several miles away. The light pattern consisted of two soft crisp white lights (no glare, like white globes.)equally spaced in a horizontal plane centered on a triangular formation of three synchronized, pulsing (not flashing), red lights. there was a dark green patch in a whispy V just above the red lights. On initial observation the outside white lights were spaced as far apart as my pinky finger held up at arms length. We were startled when the object quickly came strait toward our position as we approache the first stop light after the bridge.  Duration of the transition was less than two seconds and the object stopped several hundred meters away approximately 100 meters AGL at our 1 o'clock position. Accelleration and decelleration appeared to be instantanious.  At this point the white lights were spaced as far apart as all four of my fingers held together at arms length. The object held its position for approximately twenty seconds then slowly moved less than half of its lenth to the left. As the traffic signal changed and we started forward. It was then that the object sped off in the same direction that it had come from becoming apulsing point of red light in the distance.  We lost sight of the object behind the local terrain.  At no point during this observation did the relative position of the lights change (ie rotate, tilt, lose relative spacing etc...). Total duration of the observation was approximately one minute.

Then three light balls appeared less then 30 feet from me appearing as multishaft lucite stars with rods emanating from center 15 feet in diameter floating one foot above ground. I am a retired air traffic controller and I have an airline transport pilot license. I've been trained specifically to see and interpret correctly what I see in the sky and on radar. Technically speaking, people like me are the most credible of witnesses. Not that that will convince the people with their heads in the sand but for what it's worth, I saw three UFOs and they were, at their closest approach, no more than 20 feet (not less than 15 and not more than 25 feet) from me. I was parked in a tourist attraction parking lot in Ponce, Puerto Rico at a place called ""El Vigia"". There were at least 30 other people there with their friends listening to music from their car radios or portable radios. Some were drinking. I was not. It was April 9, 1990. I got to the parking lot right after dark. I watched the moon rise. It was a lovely night and I was enjoying the full moon. At about 9:00 P.M. the moon became obscured by clouds. Then the clouds began to boil just like in the movie cucoon. This thunder cell of clouds or whatever it was (it made no sound) began moving from east to west towrds the city of Ponce. I was somewhat worried but just kept standing outside my car and watching it move. It was lighted from inside with a white glow. I could here the gasps and oos and ahhhs from the people around the parking lot. After about 15 minutes of this two lights shot out of this cloud formation I estimated to be at about 6,000 feet maximum altitude at 2000 plus miles an hour and moved south, made a hairpin turn and went north and disappeared. Then I heard this poof sound and three 15 foot diameter light balls appeared in front of me at about 20 feet away (one poof sound for each ball), floated across the parking lot about 2 feet above the gound  for about 3 minutes and disappeared with the same poof sound. These ""light balls"" as I call them looked like giant sea urchins with clear lucite rods  extending fom the center in a star burst design. Another similar item is a fiber optic lamp with straight fibers bristling ! out of it. The rods all came from a compact center. They were basically all glowing with a white light and rotating slight lightly and lazily as they floated along.I observed that the black asphalt beneath the light balls was lit as the balls passed over. A couple of 4 year old children practically walked into the leading light ball. The children turned away towards there parents with their arms above their heads and ducking their heads as if something was bothering them (similar to what a child woud do if a bee was buzzing around him). They quickly got away from the light balls. I clearly saw each ball disappear with a poof sound. To someone who didn't know that stars are huge infernos in the sky such as the sun, would assume that these were stars. The boiling cloud slowed to a normal cumulus formation. It all happened in about 20 minutes. I left about 30 minutes later but spoke to nobody else there about what we had all seen because I didn't know anybody there. No one approached me either. It was all very pretty but I saw no purpose in it. Has anybody seen anything like this ?",1998-11-01T00:00:00,,

A lower cloud bank towards the ground. About 1000 feet. It was just sitting there in between the cloud banks. The rest area sit about halfway up a mountain side. I could see fog in the valley below.

It hit a high point above the top cloud bank. It went north for about I would say 5 miles. It came back down in a southeastly direction. It just sat there pulsating.

I would say mid april. I was driving on route 241 from Randolph to Connawango. It's a small village just NW of Randolph. I proceded to go up route 62 from the village of Connawango. I had a small Dodge Ram pick-up truck. About a mile and a half from the village is the Town of Connawango barns. I pulled into the parking lot of the barns. Because of a slow leak in my tire. I checked out the tire and I got back into my truck. I was about to pull back onto the highway. When I saw this object coming from a North Westerly direction. It had lights on the front. It looked just like an airplane that was going to land. I thought, gee why would a airplane want to land here. Unless it was having trouble. The craft came right towards the town barns. Before coming over the town barns. The craft went in a southerly direction. I got quite close to the building across the road from the barns. I believe is a farm. there was ground fog. About 1/4 of a miles west of the farm was a cloud bank. Not a real thick one. It veered West South West into the cloud bank. I got a good view of the craft from its side. Have you ever seen a horseshoe crab. If you look at a side view of a horseshoe crab. That's what the object looked like. Nothing like I've ever seen before. There are street lights at the barns kind of shone on the side of the oject. Plus there was a full moon. The front of the oject where the lights were was elongated oval. The lights bobbed down to the ground like it was searching for something, before it went into the cloud bank. The craft or object made no sound what so ever. The color of the object or craft was tannish. I have never told anyone of my experience except here. When I found this on the internet. I felt it was time. Since then. I will at times go out on the back deck and look west. Like I sense theres more objects or crafts flying around over there at Connawango to Randoph. There is a mountain just in back of my house in the city of Salamanca. Also I was taking a shower one evening. This was just before my father died of cancer. A battle he fought for 8 years. He was in his bedroom doing something. He came out of his bedroom. He looked out the hall window. Which looks out the rear of the house. He got very excited, he pounded on the bahroom door. He wanted me to see what he thought was a UFO. He said there was an other craft persuing it. But I was in the shower. I came out of course after he encountered it. I don't know. But I sense to the west of my house is Ufo coradoor. I haven't driven over to the area sinse then. I have drive! n to Jamestown and back. But never went to check the area out.

I would periodically look out my window for no reason in particular.  At one point looking out the window I saw a bright white sphere definately in our atmosphere.  This white sphere was motionless and far larger than any star.  Not shocked at this point I told my friend to take a look. He acknowledged it.  A moment later the object began to move slowly for ten seconds then rapidly southwest-soon out of sight.  We kept looking in the sky after that and a few moments later it all happend again.  Seemingly the same craft. And upon recognizing it, it did exactly what I previously described.  But this time, possible coincidence, a jet flew toward the S.W. as did the UFO.  We talked to each other for a moment and looked back at the sky.  We saw what I would decribe as a ""simon says"" game in the sky(blue yellow red green lights) This was certainly a craft and much larger than the spheres.  I started opening my door for a good look, as I did my friend screamed ""Oh my god!""and pointed at door.  My door slammed shut on me and there were two Schnauzers(dogs) growling scratching on the door.as if preventing me to leave(it worked!)  I noticed three more of the SAME dogs over to the left.  Two sitting still, one running back and forth histarically in front of the ""sitters"". the sitting dogs were looking at our car! There were NO owners around we did not see the dogs before the crafts, and I've never seen so many dogs of same breed together unattended in my life! I believe I have had a ""screen memory"" as described in Whitley Striebers book Communion. Needless to say we started the car and got out of that park right away. The park was next to a highway and residentials, so it would be unbelievable if I had no second witness, but I did. I swear I saw all that I have written here.  All of this experience I will never forget, espescially the ""dogs"" The first two objects, possibly the same craft were bright white spheres.

We both assumed that it was the lights of the center comming on for the evening.  As I got out of the car I saw that the lights were not yet on and I assumed that it was a small plane.  The city airport is about two miles away.  As I was walking around the car and looking up a small plane came into view.  And I could clearly tell that it was not a plane.  When I got to the door the light started ascending and moving in a northward direction.  I ran back around to the drivers side and hopped inside, and said ""Well what do you think?  Let's go?""  My friend said ok.  We began to follow this light for about two miles on Petaluma Blvd.  (This road runs parrell with 101.) The light stopped moving, so I drove into a parking lot.  When I stopped the car we could clearly see the light above the tops of some trees.  The lights began to move and it looked triangular, and it appeared to sway in pendulum fashion.  It then began to descend.  We could then see it through the trees.  And it began to move north again.  All of the movements were very slow.

My partner and I were discussing our trip when he said holy... you know... and I looked out the windshield. Above the cross over an over pass some distance back was a bright light with a light green outer ring. We figured it might have been an aircraft or a light on a tower, till it dropped straight down with out an arc, with increasing speed so fast that it looked like someone had taken a picture at night and moved the camera while the film was being exposed, giving it a solid line of light because it fell that fast. Then it did a 90 degree turn like it was a giant log ride and shot out at the horizon. Disappearing from sight. I looked at the clock on the dash after seeing it and it read 11:38 pm. I don't completely believe in this stuff, but after seeing that object fall and speed off, I can't think of anything it could've been. Nothing, that I know of short of a TOW missle, can arc in a 90 degree turn at that rate of decent without tearing itself to pieces. A TOW missle would have had a fire trail, instead of a white light with green outer ring. Then there is the matter of losing our time. Abducted, I don't know and don't think such a thing can or normally occurs, but we lost almost 45 minutes of time. The driver had been checking the time to gauge the trip back throught the whole trip and to keep from getting tickets. So what was it??

Took out my binoculars(10x50 - 341ft.at 1000 yds.) to look at the sunset and saw silouettes of aircraft coming into DFW Airport -- approximately 10 miles to the southwest. All aircraft have very identifiable fuselage and lights. Suddenly, I spotted a light at about 3 degrees above the horizon between two long cloud banks in the west. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes as silouettes of small craft an large airliners past in front of it. I could not see it with the naked eyes. It slowly began to drift to the north then rose at a 45 degree angle for another 5 minutes. It would drift through the clouds only slightly dimming. There were three distinct thin cloud bands with clear sky in between. It appeared to be a luminous soft light that would suddenly brighten and get larger with a shimmering effect. This would last about 2-3 seconds and then it would get smaller and at times disappear for a second. Most of the time it was smaller and white having a redish or bluish luminescence sweep over it. When it was brighter and larger the colors would be more obvious. It appeared as if it were floating -- wobbling a bit and shifting to the north then back to the south faster than when it rose. After about ten minutes, it had risen to about 4 degrees above horizon. I then spotted another one just like it above it and to the north at about 5 degrees above the horizon. This one appeared to be brighter or closer. I looked back for first light and it had disappeared. The second light was stationary and ""luminescing"" in the same manner getting brighter and dimmer for 5 minutes and then it began to descend very slowly at at 45 degree angle toward the south. I spotted the second one at about 18:32 and watched it descend to the horizon until 18:49. My guess is that it was probably 15+ miles away which would put it around Argyle or further west? I frequently watch the sunset out at the lake and have seen similar light before in November of 1998. They! are in no way similar to airliner headlights or helicopter lights. I noted both Venus and Jupiter as they appeared (after the lights appeared) and they were not twinkling or glowing with colors due to atmosphere - bright and white.

My girlfriend and I were driving back north to Canada on Interstate 91, at about 11:40 PM halfway between Hartford CT and Springfield MA when we observed a cluster of lights thiking it was a plane or helicopter due to the fact that Bradley Airport was 4 miles west of us but as it got closer the weird configuration of lights mind boggled us but it was heading westward and lost sight of it, then another one appeared on the east heading right toward us, as it got closer we knew this was no conventional craft, it slowly flew over our heads at about 300 feet soundless with 7 big white lights in a V formation (the lights did not light the ground) and 3 small flickering lights on the tip of the triangle which would be the front end and a small pulsating red light dead center of the craft, the craft itself was very dark (could not make out the actual body) it was also heading westward following the first. We stopped and watched it disappear in the horizon. The question we have to ask our selves is what would we gain or loose if the government finally told the public about the now famous Roswell crash, the alien abductions and the ongoing ufo activity. Logically speaking, if this craft would be government made, wouldn't it be most top secret (area 51), and if it was, what was it doing flying between large cities, woudn't these test be dangerous for the general public, if they were safe wouldn't we profit from it by improving today's latest planes and if they were from another country, wouldn't the army have intercepted this illigal alien threatening our country. The most logical answer would be that somekind of being is flying far more technologically advanced craft of anything we have on earth. Obviously we can't catch one or catch up to it, they abduct people and we haven't the slight idea how to stop them, if they crash, we steal their technology. Isn't that evolution for which humans thrives? I think we are ready to know the truth, the real truth!!",1999-08-10T00:00:00,41.76654101876675,-72.67890154155495

I glanced out of the sliding glass door and saw what I believed to be a green flare shoot up out of vision above the window/door.  A few seconds later this same green ball fell down out of my line of vision.  I jumped up to see if the ball would hit the water, but could see nothing.  It had either not entered the water, or did so before I could stand to see over the back of the couch. This sighting was over the Green Bay of Lake Michigan. Thinking that what I had seen was a distress flare from a boat, I called the local Sheriff's department to advise the water rescue unit. I was told that there was no green marine flares used and that it was probably fireworks.  A few days later, I had seen a T.V. news story about many such sightnings from Chicago, IL to Green Bay, WI over Lake Michigan. The object was very bright green with a long tail of much lighter green-gold ""sparks"".  The fireball appeared to move straight up, but the tail had a slight cork screw type of undulation.  I could hear no sound, but I was inside of a cabin with a radio.  My wife was also with me, but did not turn soon enough to see the object.

First of all I have seen an upper atmosphere/space vehicle launch from Vandenberg AFB when I was in San Diego and noticed the perfect cone of the rocket exhaust. Now that was similar to what I saw on this day except they appeared to be reentering. In San Francisco driving south on Highway 101 before Silver Street, I saw in the upper atmosphere at about 11 o'clock and to the southeast two objects. One was circular, probably a sphere, and the other was an elongated rectangle, probably a cylinder, like a rocket body.  I got several glimpses between watching the traffic. I was surprised it was not on the news because it was so obvious. The objects were descending, not much at first but it was easy to tell that the descent was like a parabolic curve because the last I saw them the attitude was almost directly down and they had moved from 11 o'clock in the sky to about 9:30. The objects had cone-like vapor trails. The cylinder was at an oblique angle to the direction of travel and to the cone trail.  Their final direction was SE sort of towards Mt. Hamilton but much further away I think. The entire incident was less than 30 seconds probably about 10 to 15 seconds. By the time I got to the next offramp they were gone. The size of the cylinder and cone-trail was about a little bigger than a full moon, maybe larger as it descended. The sphere's cone trail was roughly about ¼ as big as the cylinder's cone trail. It was hard to see the sphere and cylinder, sort of like a very distant, high altitude jet. Together they occupied a section of sky about 4 to 8 moons across. They traveled pretty much together even though their relation to each may have changed some.  They were not attached, but probably were attached at one time. It looked like a reentering rocket and satellite that would crash somewhere.

I was extemely busy during the time the Hail Bob comet was visible. I didn't watch tv, listen the radio, or talk to anyone about anything except law and polotics. It had been visible for about a week or two when a friend had called me one evening. He asked what I thought about the awsome Hail Bob comet. I asked what he was referring to so he insisted that I walk outdoors and look. First, I went in the back of my apartment and looked into the feild. I told my friend that I couldn't see anything which looked like what he had discribed. Then, he said to go look on the other side of the building. I saw the Hail Bob and wondered How I could overlook it for so many days while I was coming and going from my home. I went back into my apartment and decided to step out my back door again and take one last look at the stars before shuting the door. When I looked up I saw a white saucer shaped object with a dome which had windows, and the ring around it was rotating. It was lit up like an extremely bright flourecent light. It was flying low in the feild and went up into the clouds. It blended right in with them. It moved swift as it went up and then forward. It was coming away from the direction of the Hail Bob comet. As this was happening, I asked my friend if he saw what I was seeing. He said yes, and we discussed it. It looked smaller to him because he was talking to me from Porter. After this event, I told my neighbor about seeing a U.F.O. and before I could discribe it she interupted. She said that she saw these all of the time from her apartment and they were white and lit up. It was a blinding light which made it look as though there was an aura around it. I was amazed because I hadn't seen one before and she lived in the same complex as I do. I hadn't discribed it to her and yet her discription matched mine.

I kept noticing a bright light in the south sky(my vantage was facing east with a 4 ft.porch overhang above me. Clear view to the EAST-SOUTH- AND NORTH. Out of the corner of my eye I kept noticing a bright light to the South, like it was moving.But when I would look directly at it,it seemed to be stationary. It also seemed to get brighter everytime I would notice it.(maybe that was just me?) After a few mins. a light drew my attention from directly overhead. This was obviously a plane as it had the flashing aviation lights. As I was looking up at the plane (probably within about 15 sec.) I was drawn back to the light in the South.Within  2 sec. the light got really bright and darted across the sky directly at the plane.(not sure of size of plane, but it was high up) I was looking directly at the event.My guess is this thing covered about 5 to 10 miles in an instant. (About the length of 1 1/2 Big Dippers). As it approached the plane, instead of hitting it,as it was on a collision course with the plane,it was like it just Sucked up and vanished right before contact.That is the best way I can describe it. My friend just happened to come back outside just as the light started to move across the sky and he saw it,too. I started jumping around saying to him, ''did you frickin see that''? Probably woke some people up.He saw this too and was quite freaked by it. We talked about it again the next day. Kind of checking ourselves as to, if we really saw what we thought we saw. WE DID!! WOULD SURE LIKE TO FIND THE PILOT OF THIS PLANE. There is no way that the pilot didn't see this thing coming at him! Can you search some way to maybe find this plane and pilot?",1999-08-30T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

If visitors to this site have any questions I'll be glad to answer if I can. If anyone has any further information or explanation on them I'd appreciate a reply. I've copied these experiences from a past journal.)) My then 14 year old son and I moved to the gloriously beautiful Page ~ Lake Powell in the extreme north-central Arizona, and camped a few days on the awesome beached of the Colorado River...in a place called Lone Rock ~ technically in Utah. While our trip was filled with wonderful events, and a fabulous experience being 'stranded' in Roswell during the 50 year festival, and meeting Derrel Simms, David Adair,  Dr. Lier, (I'd been their waitress at the restaurant where they dined on the last Saturday of the festival), as well as Whitley Streiber, Stan Friedman, Robert  Ghostwolf,  and many others, we had still had money struggles and I was upset and nervous we'd be REALLY stranded. Once we reached Lake Powell, however, things changed for the better. We set up 'camp', ate, and later when we turned in, I'd said a little prayer and apologized for having an earlier tantrum (ie: lack of a little faith in the ""Bigger Picture"") and just after the prayer, I'd seen a shooting star. It filled me with hope and I asked for some sign that all would be okay. I gazed out thru the mesh window of my tent at all the zillion sparkling stars and the glorious canyon backdrop for another 5 minutes when I saw one of the ""stars"" begin to move quite erratically across the sky. It had a steady, straight path but every ""inch"" perspective-wise, it would light up to a bright white, then fade back to a dim star (almost going out) and jag across the sky another inch or so, on and on until it had crossed the sky and disappeared from my range of vision. Its motion was like a zig zag, and at each alternating 'point' it would stop, light up, zig, stop, fade dim, zag...etc. It had been high enough to be similar to a satellite, but too erratic. It was too high for a plane or jet. The same thing happened again the next night, but both events were about 8:30pm. On the first night, as I watched it zig zag across the sky (over a period of maybe 15 minutes), I became aware, in a sort of ""singular"" fashion, (as in, this had been my only thought and seemed to take over my bouncing thoughts and steady them to this one) that they were our neighbors; but more, that they are the Watchers, and had done this (appeared this time)  to let me know all is as it should be. It's real and there's no reason to wig out about it...(this trek to AZ had been part of a higher calling that suddenly seemed to go awry) and they are always there. They show themselves when requested to do so to those who need to or have recognized the ""Path"", and will either assist in the Awakening, or lead the Waking into knowledge and experiences they need for individual purpose, as well as a collective one. The second night I seemed to ""understand"" (about them) as tho they were telling me that  now that they've proven themselves as I asked,  I won't see them much in the near future, but will eventually begin to encounter them more often ~ things (for me) would now change. And they did. For the record, from August end 1997  until this date of posting (Dec. 20, 1998), I have gotten pregnant, moved from Arizona to an island off the Virginia coast, been flooded off the island, returned to Arizona over a 'vacation' journey thru New Mexico and Arizona, situated in west central Arizona,  had a beautiful baby boy, bought another computer, been introduced to Art Bell (the program), become a  webpage designer (actually getting business, that is!), lost one car, got a new car,  and returned to Louisiana...having wonderful holidays and feeling like this is the calm before something extraordianry takes place; I have no idea as to what. Since August of '97, and this event, I have seen no further ""lights"" in the sky, on the ground, or anywhere else, nor  had anymore of these experiences.

Duncan Lake, about 15 miles south of Grand Rapids, MI. I was attending a party that we put on annually for the OR personnel of Butterworth Hospital/Spectrum Health Downtown. I had not partaken of any of the alcoholic beverages available that evening since I had been involved in the setup and firing of a rather extensive fireworks show for the party. Duncan Lake is on the southern approach flight path to the Kent County International Airport. Several of us were standing around in an open field discussing the fireworks. A northbound jet flew over on its way to the airport and I glanced up to look at it. As the jet passed, I noticed a typical meteor streak that flew from the north to the south. As it faded, I saw an additional streak that originated from the exact point where the first streak ended and flew perpendicular (from my perspective) to the path of the first streak, heading generall y west. The impression that I got was that the original object changed direction, executing a 90-degree turn without slowing down. This occurred within seconds of the jet passing by, but my feeling was that the jet had nothing to do with the incident other than drawing my attention to the sky. We had seen many meteors that evening, but this one was remarkable enough to cause me to ask my companions if they had noticed it. Unfortunately they had not. Logic tells me that this was probably a coincidental sighting of two separate meteors travelling on perpendicular paths.

We were looking at the night sky. One person asked if they were seeing a satellite.  I said it looked just like a satellite, one point of light, travelling in a smooth arc across the sky, from the east to the west.  We saw it directly overhead looking to the north, so it was moving to the left.  All of a sudden, the object became very bright, and seemed to increase in size, to about the size and white color of Venus (or whichever planet is now visible to the east)and it continued to travel smoothly to the west.  The object dimmed and the size seemed to shrink to ""satellite"" size, then became very bright again.  Then the object appeared to change course slightly, then faded in brightness and size, very dimmly until it disappeared, roughly at the same zenith.  It seemed odd in that I had never seem a satellite change brightness, or fade from sight.  I can usually track satellites until it is obstructed by trees, or mountains, etc.  I don't think the apparent change in course was caused by the object passing near other stars as the eye looses track for a moment.  This time, the object seemed to change direction when it was not passing other stars.  Just after it faded, I looked back to the east and noticed another satellite, at about the same zenith, but it was travelling west to east.  I had not seen this satellite as I was looking at the one going to the west.  I would have thought I would have seen the two ""cross paths"".  This satellite seemed normal, size, speed, color, brightness, direction etc. as other satellites I have seen before.  The night sky was very clear, no clouds, no wind, about 50 degrees.  We could clearly see the ""Milky Way"".  We were just far enough from Portland that you could only make out a glow on the horizon to the north.   It was travelling at ""satellite speed"" and there were no streaks, sparks, or trails like I have seen with ""shooting stars"", plus it was travelling much slower.

My boyfriend who was there and saw it too, has seen Aroura Borealis in Northern Canada several times and that was the only thing that he could liken it to.  The patch itself didn't move in the horizon, it remained stationary for at least an hour- an hour and 1/2.  At times there were NO clouds near and we could see stars all around it and immediately next to it so it wasn't any upper atmospheric moisture that was illuminated by a ground light source, as I said, we were in the middle of the national forest.

I would like to state for the record that I was not the person who witnessed the UFO, however it was brought to my attention by people who knew about my interest in such matters. The object was sighted very close to the setting sun, initially it was thought to be an aircraft off in the distance, as it wqas thought that it was reflecting the sunlight off the surface of the craft.  On later discussion we decided that this could not be the case because the sun was behind it and therefore could not be reflecting off it. The object which was oval in shape was seen to decend to below ground level, we were on top of a hill overlooking China Lake, and we later determined that it must have been many miles in the distance as the object was so small.  It didn't move at speed or stop and start it's descent, it just gradually descended to below the hight we were observing from. There were potentially 100+ obserevers, however many of these were in medatation at the time.  And I myself who is normally engaged in the persuit of scanning the skies for things which are out of place, had my head burried in a book.

Formation of stationary lights - most turning on and off and VERY similar to the infamous March 13 Phoenix sightings,Surprise,AZ,1998-11-19T21:30:00,formation,0:45,"Occurred : 11/19/1998 21:30  (Entered as : 11/19/98 21:30) Reported: 11/19/1998 23:29 Posted: 1/28/1999 Location: Surprise, AZ Shape: Formation Duration:0:45",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05034.html,"Formation of stationary lights - most turning on and off and VERY similar to the infamous March 13 Phoenix sightings At approximately 9:45 my father, who lives about a half mile from me, called and said he had been watching these lights go on and off for about 10 minutes and that I should meet him outside to check them out. I arrived to see a stationary yellow light (which i'll call the ""main"" light through the rest of this description) which was at least twice the magnitude of the brightest star in the southern sky.  The light was flickering somewhat like a distant light on the horizon would.  This light was located pretty much due south from our vantage point (Bell Rd. and Reems Rd.).  We watched the light for about 2 minutes and noted some lights on the ground directly below it for reference to see if the light moved east/west and it did not.  Soon another identical light appeared slightly below and to the west of the first light.  The distance between the 2 was about that of 4 fingers held at arms length.  From our location we could also see the lights from Luke AF Base which is about 2 miles east and 6 miles south of us.  So this seemed to put the lights about 2 miles west of the base. At this point we jumped in the car and began heading south to the end of Reems Rd. (1 mile south of Luke AFB).  During these 7 miles heading south, the main light was straight ahead, just barely west of the center of the road.  It went out a few times but came right back on.  The second light however now had a few companions right next to it that continued to come on and off in about 1 second intervals - VERY reminiscent of the famous sighting of March 13, which I have seen on video clips many times. The distance between each light in the ""set"" of lights to the west of the main light was about 1/4 fingers width apart held at arms length. They would turn on and off in random sequence, usually side by side with a slight arc if they had been connected with a line, and at one point came on and off in a sequence which, had they all been on simutaneously, was in the pattern of a greater than symbol.  At any one time, there were up to 3 lights on at the same time in the ""set"". Had they all been on simultaneously there were about 7 or 8 lights total, assuming they were all stationary. As we got to the end of Reems Rd., we headed west about 2-3 miles to Highway (""Loop"") 303 and turned back south.  At this point, the main light was now slightly to the east of the road.  This told us that the light was a lot closer than a star, for example. And by using triangulation, the light main light would be located south and somewhere between these 2 roads. We traveled another 6-8 miles south to Broadway Rd. and stopped and got out of the car. From the time we left the house, it was approximately 30 minutes and the main light had NOT moved, while the others inconsistently but continually came on and off in the same area of the sky.  We had travelled a total of about 15 miles south and were still seemingly quite north of them.  Finally, the main light disappeared only to reappear about 15 seconds later with another light of the same magnitude RIGHT next to it.  Both of these lights then went out.  I was low on gas and my dad hadn't even told my mom he was leaving the house so we just left perplexed.  We looked back quite a few times but saw nothing. I just want to make it clear that NONE of these lights ever moved.  The ""set"" came on and off way too rapidly and continuosly in the same spot to be flares.  As for the main light, I don't know of any flare or plane that could stay in the exact same spot in the sky for 45 minutes. There was no audible sound, no smoke, no activity from the Air Force Base (i.e. no incoming/outgoing aircraft) or anything other than the glowing yellow lights - and the altitude was about that of those in the videos of the March 13 sightings.  This whole incident was just remarkably similar to what I saw on those videos.  If you would like additional information, please feel free to contact me.

Ablation cone of approximately 20 degrees was observed with occasional bursts of sparks.  Object was in a very shallow angle because it was observed in a South to North trajectory from near horizon to approximately 80 degrees (near overhead).  Object ablation cone appeared to flare out near termination of the event at which point it extinguished with a glow that rapidly dissipated.  Total transit time for the object from first observation to termination was a on the order of 20 seconds.  I and my two sons were traveling southbound on Tracy Boulevard approaching the intersection with Schulte Road.  During the object's transit there were at least 4 times in which sparks burst from the object, lighting up the ablation cone. My son first called attention to the object.  I continued driving and found a place to stop.  As we got out of the truck it extinguished at near overhead.  the trajectory of the object was very nearly South to North.  Estimating the altitude, I would place the path to be directly overhead at Dublin California, approximately 30 Miles to the West.  This is of course the weakest of the estiamtes because I really could not tell how high it was for sure. If I had to guess, I would probbaly attribute this to the decaying orbit of a satelite in a polar orbit.  It was too slow for a falling star and too fast for an airplane.  What most impressed me was how long the object remained in view and the extremely shallow angle of the trajectory.  It would be impossible for me to say that the path was not indeed horizontal ((NUFORC Note:  Observer seemed exceptionally qualified.

We left the store and headed east a few miles out of town into Deerfield township. We where out in the sticks on some back road when I asked him to pull over so I could go to the bathroom. I was standing outside the car taking a pee and looking up into to sky. (It was a clear night, I could see the stars in the sky), Then I saw this dark object above the trees (it didn't have any lights, I thought it was a Blimp or something of that nature) it was quiet and just glided over our heads. It was only 100' above my head and blocked out the stars as it flew by. I closed my eyes hoping it was just a cloud, but then, as it flew west, I noticed a small light at the rear. My friend and I were totally amazed at what we saw and got back in the car and headed west back to my house (the same direction this object was heading). At times we could still see that small light on it's tail as it flew parallel to the road we were driving on. We lost sight of it about 2 miles from my house (trees along the side of the road made it hard at times to keep track). When we pulled in my driveway (here come the goosebumps again)we stood in my front yard talking about what we saw, when all of a sudden, across the road over a 30 acre hay field this huge set of lights turned on! it was approx 100' above the ground. no sound at all (totally took as by surprise). It had round lights, about 8 they were in a circle. They lit up the whole hay field, and I could see the tree line beyond, it was amazing (it reminded me of what you see when lighting flashes at night and briefly you can see things far away)I could see the details of everything around. I ran to my front door to get my Dad,when I looked back at my friend, he was standing there with his mouth dropped wide open, just frozen, he was lit up like a car was in front of him with its head light on. I was screaming for my dad, as he came running from bed and turned the corner to come outside , the lights turned off, we pointed out to him the little light floating away from us. (note: The lights were on for 30 seconds or so). Two things I have to point out. First, there was no sound. We lived in a farming area,you could hear car comming a mile down the road. There was no noise at all! Second, another friend of mine saw the same thing about five years later in the same location. They built a home back in the woods about a 1/2 mile from that site. His wife was washing dishes and it was late in the evening when she saw a huge set of lights come on behind their house. It was the same thing I just described. She could see all the trees and stuff as it hovered just above them, then, the lights turned off and it was gone.",,,

Then about a quarter mile towards the Northeast, I saw a round light skimming in and out of view in the low clouds heading South at about 50(?) mph.  Because of the subdued lighting, identification was impossible.  However, when the craft passed directly in front of us at its closest distance (1/8th mile), my focus zeroed in.  Its light then went out as it went into the clouds.  I was able to determine that its light was recessed somewhat into the nose of the craft, and about a foot in diameter.  I saw only the first 10 feet or so of the craft.  Moving back from the recessed headlight, the shape was ""delta/triangular"".

There was no noise and they were moving slowly in an easterly direction. I could barely make out the outline of a V shaped vehicle which looked like a carpenters square ruler. It was the night before the phoenix lights sighting occured. This sighting happened after I went through a most incredible series of events. I went to the Justice Department anti-trust division in San Francisco and provided a letter detailing my discovery of a non-detectable computer virus which was extremely destructive. I characterized this virus a Planned Osbolescence/Monopolization virus. I provided the Justice Department with a list of symptoms and a technique I discovered to resolve this problem.I got no assistance from them nor the FBI nor the police, as I was experiencing coersion in the harassment of my computer repair company by affluent people in the East Bay of California, Phone tapping and other manipulation, price fixing, and threats which made me fear for my life. My harassers were connected to the computer industry and large financial institutions. I was never formally interviewed by anyone and told my brother on the phone that ""They're only hope is to turn me into a Jesus freak or something, cause otherwise I'm going to the supreme court about this."" The next day I started hearing out of place voices on my TV and Radio which were of a religious nature. It was very convincing and I had started reading the bible because I was all alone as my family couldn't help and my friends didn't understand. I started having visions of things I read in the bible. These voices and visions went on for four months. I had to move as my business went from $5000 per month to about $100 per month once I announced this virus to lawyer customers who were trying to prove that I wrote it to increase my business when in actuality, I had no idea what was behind the harassment I was experiencing. I am including this information because I feel that my business problem is connected with this ufo sighting and thus shows an agenda for the phoenix lights vehicle sighting and a connection between ufo's and the system.

This sighting occurred on the night of my senior prom. After the prom my date and i decided to go back to my house so i could get my tux off, and prepare for the rest of the night. The road back into town is wooded, comming up the road i noticed a light up in the sky, I knew something was odd about this light but it didnt click until my date said something to me, she was not from the area and asked me what the light in the sky was. I first of all would have misplaced it as a plain right off the bat, but it was idle and had no lights that indicated it could be a plain, so i said "" you know what i dont know what it is"" so at that point we just watched it until we got closer and closer. I was really in sort of an amazement when we finally got to my highschool parking lot and this object was still hovering up in the sky pretty much over my school. Of course we were the only two people there. My date and i got out, neither one of us saying anything, I looked up as intently as i could and observered this; A white glowing ovalish ball, with other off white colors on towards the bottom of the ufo. After about 20 seconds of starring in disbelief the object shrunk right before our eyes to a pinPoint and was gone...just like that. I felt something at that moment, I can say it was almost like it knew we were there observing it, almost like it could feel our presence and didnt want to be starred at any longer like we got a long enough look. Just writing this and thinking back gives me shivers.But let me keep you interested not more than 2 nights later My aunt was smoking outside on the porch and a ufo flew above the sky over the house i was there but not nearly quick enough to respond to a yell of astonishment. I have other relatives who have also seen ufos here in Maine. Does life exist outside our world ? I feel ignorant just typing that (  8 >",1999-05-24T00:00:00,43.71417391304348,-70.3457652173913

McClellan) NO WAY!!!! I am not sure of exact year about 1971 or 72 maybe even 73. This event happened in the spring of the year when my family was cleaning off the garden spot.It was our tradition to have a weiner roast and burn just prior to planting.  We had already finished the roast and our large bonfire had burned down pretty low . My sister had gone inside, mom was getting the stuff to take in. Dad and I were raking more onto the fire to finish burning.  There is a cow pasture on the northern side of the garden spot with a sloping hillside. At the eastern end of the pasture is a small stand of trees (mostly longleaf pines).Almost simultaneously mom, dad, and I saw the craft right at the edge of these trees and below treetop level. Dad's comment ""what'n th hell?"" was instantly followed by "" ya'll get to the house"". I responded ""no, I want to see it ""  but don't think I could have moved if I tried.  Mom just kept saying ""oh Lord, what is it?""  The disc spun  silently for several minutes. There appeared to be a strip of light in the center of the disc  all the way around. As it was spinning it seemed to constantly change colors like those of a prism .  It seemed as though the craft was reflecting the lights from within.The craft itself was a silvery color. Our coonhounds were in the pen right beside us but paid no attention . I do remember that the rooster crowed but whether or not it was his normal evening crow is debatable because it was right at dark.  After a few minutes the craft took off going straight up. It was completely out of sight in a matter of 2 - 3 seconds.  Although the craft itself made no sound there was a sound like when you inhale deeply just as it started up ( like moving air) but we felt no wind.  I said earlier that I don't think I could have moved and I substantiate this by the fact that as soon as the craft took off my mom  started toward the house saying she was going to call the police. Until it was gone none of us had moved even one step, just stood there dumbfounded.  Daddy stopped mama telling! her she would not call the police or anybody else. He told us not to tell anybody about it. Said he didn't want people thinking we were crazy. The next day there was an article in the local paper ""The Daily Home"" in which officials from Ft. McClellan Army Base about 40 miles away claimed this was a weather balloon. There had been numerous reports of a strange light made the evening before.  Apparently all the reports were made by persons who saw the craft airborn and from a distance because what we saw from less than 100 yards, stationary and as big as a small house would have taken a far stretch of the imigination to conclude to be a weather balloon. I made no mention of the event for several years.  While engaged to my husband I told him about it and was promply laughed at. For several years his skepticism continued.  Then on January 31, 1996 he too witnessed some unusual craft from a lookout point at Oak Level in Cleberne Co. AL  We reported the incident to the UFO hotline that morning but I have been unable to find documentation of the report on this website.

I asked my husband to describe the size in terms of ""hold your arm out straight, pretend you're sighting down your arm and tell me approximate size in inches"".  He held his hands apart about 2 feet.

He said only if the satellite visited middle Tennessee first. I relayed this story to a friend who at the time was in the astronomical society in Shreveport, Louisiana.  She said on that same night, two men at the boservatory had spotted the same thing, only smaller.  One of these men had a call from his mother in Michigan, who reported the same sighting.

The object moved very slowly, to slow for an airplane. Had 4 bright ""headlights"" on the front, but insted of pointing ahead, they pointed down in a 45 degree angle. One red light ""not flashing"" set centered between the two inner most lights. On Feb. 18 at about 11:30 pm, I was traveling west on I-76 in N.E. Ohio, While crossing over Lake Milton in the portage county area, I noticed 4 bright lights slowly moving across the sky at a low altitude for this area. At first I thought it was a plane, but this did not more at a speed that a plane would fly. It was about 100+ feet off the ground, I thought it was going to crash into the lake. I watched this craft for about 2 minutes, as it hung over the highway. It WAS moving but much to slow.  I got on the cb and asked if anyone else could make out what it was, everyone else said either they did not know, or that it was a plane. But no one could actually see the shape of the craft. It was to dark outside and the lights were to bright to make out any shape. One of the truckdrivers said that there was a military airport just north of us, but I live in this area. The base IS north of us, but it is not close enough for aircraft to fly this low. The 4 lights on the front of this craft were pointing down in a 45 degree angle to the flight path of the craft. I looked for other lights that would prove it was an airplane. I saw 1 red light directly center of the 4 ""headlights"" But it was not flashing, just glowing. Unfortunatly I could not stop to watch the craft or see where it would have went. No one else could tell where it had went to either. One driver made the comment that ""he thought it was going to land on his truck"" this craft made no noticable noise (what I could here from inside my truck) and did not seem to displace any air at the low altitude it was flying. Mr. Davenport, I dismissed this as an airplane, possibly military. However after listening to you on Art Bells show on Feb. 19th. I found myself second guessing what I saw. One of the ladies, that you had interviewed and replayed on the show, described what I had seen almost to a tee!  Now I am wondering just what I really saw. I know my experiance only lasted but a few short minutes, but it felt like many minutes longer. This is not far from Trumble county or from the Pennsilvania State line.

Observers are long time friends of the reporter.  Their home is situated approximately 10 miles NE of the location of the sighting.  Weather was good, partly cloudy, no moon.  Venus and Jupiter, now situated in the western sky, had already set.  Observers have seen UFOs in the past.  The area where they live is remote, near the Ca-Nv. border.

We observed the objects facing SW from Sedona to the right of a crescent moon that evening. We watched incredulously for approx. 45 min. while the two objects would alternately brighten and dim- one at a time! The lower of the two objects would dim-out and become a small cloud- only to return a few minutes later. We joked that perhaps they were UFO's who were ""playing star"". We took 3 photos and at the exact moment the camera flashed we each saw thousands of little beams or particles (like the old Asteriods screen-savers). The photos DID NOT develop when we returned home to Sacramento. These three exposures were in the middle of a known good roll of film (everything else obviously developed) and we're attempting to have the film company try again developing. We were quite surprised 2 nights later when we sighted these 2 objects again after leaving Boynton Canyon at about the same time in the evening. Once again we observed the objects for about 45 minutes before leaving the area to return to Sacramento. A few hours later we were too tired to continue and spent the night in Laughlin, NV. While there we seemed to be drawn to what was the UFO Congress event by sheer synchronicity so we spent another day there. We didn't think our experience unusual as we had both experienced strange energies the past 4 days and had spiritual experiences while at the Sedona vortexes.

It was moving so rapidly that it quickly was disappearing over the house, so I ran around to the front yard and could still see it continuing directly south out of sight. I doubt that I would have even seen the object if I had not been looking directly at it when it went by. The whole event lasted only about 15 to 20 seconds.

The wind was blowing lightly toward the SW.  It was a beautiful day with occasional large fluffy clouds drifting by. As I watched the object, it seemed to be creeping up and away at one time, so I thought that it may be very far away at that point. Even though it appeared to be rather close.  Then it moved towards the towards the East. About 3 minutes after I noticed the object, two employees came out to have a smoke break.  I asked them what they thought. They were both retired from the military.  They said they didn't know what it was either.  After they finished their cigarettes, they went back inside but I stayed and watched because I had some cigar left anyway. As the object moved East, I tried to guage the speed by a fence at the end of the parking lot.  It took about a minute to go the distance between each of the fence posts (it is a high chain link fence with poles 10' apart). After moving between 5 or 6 fence posts, a large cloud came drifting towards my location. At this point I lost sight of the object.  I waited to see if I could see it after the cloud moved.  I gave up after a few minutes and thought to myself, if it was something important, the local air force base would send a jet to check it out.  As I started to go inside, two jets, I'm guessing F-16's, came flying by side by side heading in the direction of the object.

Initially the object appeared to be a brighter than normal star and was noticed to shift colors, thought to be due to atmospheric distortion; however, it was determined to be otherwise.  It was noticed that the object was strobing or changing from red to blue to white in a random order, but was clearly not a star or a planet.  It was observed through binoculars by myself and several other police officers, which verified the color changes, but no definitive shape of the object could be determined, because of the distance.  I made telephone contact with the tower at Jacksonville International Airport (JIA) and a controller visually confirmed the object west of his position (240 to 270 degrees), but informed me that he had no radar returns in that area, indicating that it was not an aircraft. (The airport was about 8 miles north of my location.)  The controller even joked that it could be a ""UFO"".  Because the object remain completely motionless at altitude for an extended period, we ruled out a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft.  The tower also assisted in ruling out a antenna, tower, or balloon.

It was a cold, clear morning sometime in December of 1998. I had been out hunting from a tree stand on my in-law's private land, which is several hundred acres within the Holly Ridge swamplands, off of highway 210. My tree stand was about 75 to 100 feet high with a clear view in all directions. The entire time I observed numerous commerical or military aircraft flying at high altitudes (out of hearing range), leaving the usual contrails over the entire sky (there is a military base about an hour from my position). I thought nothing of it at the time, other than I had never seen so many contrails in that area before. At approximately 11:00 am, I descended from my tree stand and started walking back to my truck, which is about a 20 minute walk. At one point I heard a jet flying high above me, and I looked up to see a small, white jet moving north-west and leaving a contrail. A bright metallic object then caught my eye, which was close to where the jet had just passed, except it seemed a much lower altitude than the jet itself. The chrome object was stationary, was directly above me, and made no noise and left no contrail, which is probably why it had caught my attention considering everything else I was seeing left a trail of some sort. It seemed like the shape of an egg or sphere. I stood there staring at it for about a minute, when it then proceeded to move slowly in the opposite direction from where the jet was heading. I had to back up a bit to continue watching as it was disappearing behind some trees. After another minute or two of observation, the object simply vanished. I watched for several more minutes and did not see it again. I then proceeded to my truck and drove home. The following may or may not be related to my sighting, but it is certainly worth mentioning. As my hunt was unsuccessful, the next day I returned to the same location. This time it was a cloudy, wet day. At approximately 9:00am, I heard several jet engines approaching from behind my position in the tree stand. Keep in mind that my stand is very high, as I am sitting above the tops of most of the other trees in my vision. I looked to my left and observed two military F16 or F15 (?) class fighter jets flying at a low altitude. As they passed, I picked up my binoculars and viewed them for a closer look. They were moving at a very rapid speed and quite low to the ground, and I think they were using their afterburners, as I could see the flame emitting from the engines. As they passed my position, they seemed to slow down and the afterburners were shut off. A short moment later they began maneuvering back into my direction, this time seemingly heading right for me, at a much slower speed. I was awestruck when they headed right for me at an incredibly low altitude. As they approached my position, the noise from the jet engines was almost painfully loud. One of the jets broke left and the other right from where I was sitting. They literally buzzed my tree stand from both sides, so close that I could easily see the pilots in the aircraft. They must have been no more than 75 yards on either side of me and just a little bit above the tree tops. The one on my right banked as it passed me, showing me a clear view of the plane's underbelly. When I first described this incident to me family, I remember mentioning that they were so close that I could see the bolts holding the jet together. After they buzzed me they turned around again and proceeded in the direction they were originally heading before they decided to freak the hell out of me. Shortly thereafter I got back to my truck and went home. I believe that was the last time I hunted on that land since it was the end of the season, and have since moved out of the a! rea.
