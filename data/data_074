UFO Sighting Report  On Thursday, March 1, 2012, at about 8:30 PM, I was in Sedona, Arizona, and looking west from the town toward the city of Cottonwood about 17 miles away, and more distant mountains behind that.  I heard a vague sound which gradually increased in intensity over a few minutes.  It sounded something like a propeller-driven aircraft, but increased in intensity to become much louder and lower pitch than any aircraft sound I had heard before. I looked up to try to locate the source of the sound, and noticed three red lights, like the typical wing lights on the left wings of aircraft, moving from my right to my left, toward the south.  They appeared to be about 2000 feet above ground level, and moving very slowly.  Then I noticed they were all in exact linear alignment, equally spaced, and moving as one unit.  Then I noticed there were no other lights, green, white, etc., visible, and that the stars were blacked out in the entire area between the lights and slightly above the line they created.  Immediately below the line of the lights, stars were visible, but not immediately above, so that is apparently where the body of the craft was, but it was completely invisible, appearing non-descript opaque black. The craft continued moving from north to south, moving very slowly, what would normally be too slow to maintain altitude, and eventually disappeared into the south, toward the city of Phoenix. I would be very interested to know if anyone has any idea what this was.  The length of the craft appeared to be about 1 to 2 miles.  Not the typical size of normal aircraft, and no blinking wing lights.  The three red lights were constant.  And it was certainly not silent, and I thought UFO’s were usually silent.  So I have no idea what it was.  But there is no doubt it was there, this was not a vague or distant sighting.  I have been a private researcher for the last 40 years in the health field, and am qualified as an observer to be as objective as possible. Any input would be appreciated.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,34.904693548387094,-111.89417096774194

((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) As suggested - I wrote to the local newspaper to inquire about a UFO siting by my husband and myself. This is as it appeared in the paper yesterday. A bird, a plane ... what was flying in the sky?  Dear Write to Know:  On Saturday, July 30, at 9:45 p.m., my husband and I were driving down Center Street in Yarmouthport, heading home, when we saw a glowing orange triangular-shaped object moving slowly across the sky.  It made no sound and was coming from the north, where Grey's Beach (Bass Hole) is located. We pulled over to watch it and, as it was disappearing from our view, a second identical object appeared from the same direction as the first had come.  It was definitely not a plane, but we don't know what it was.  If anyone knows what these orange glowing objects were, we'd like to see the answer in your column.

I asked what are those lights, and my buddy said its the water tower.  I said water towers don't move. I was at the top of the hill in our town, and sped up to get a better look. We went under the town bridge an stopped the car. We rolled down windows and turned flashers on. We turned car off and continued to look out window. It was so big it looked like a a passenger plane but was only 50ft above the tree tops. There was no noise at all, only a large light in the front and some red lights in back an we could barley see the middle. There was something that was in middle that looked like circles but cant say to be for sure. It was moving at a high speed, and by the time we had a phones out, it wouldn't pick up.  We watched it keep going and it kinda turned and then it was gone. We sat in car freaking out. I dropped off frien! ds and went home and told my father. I looked on computer to try to find the FAA number but it wasn't there, due to prank calls and probably they wouldn't give out info like that to a normal person.  I have school so after school kept trying to find a number. One of my buddy's believe in them and told me about the sight. I called number and found out about this report.  I was told I should have reported to news, police, or anything but I wanted this to be official and not have the paper hang up on me or police about prank calls. We know Moorland, Indiana test fighter planes around our area, but there is no planes around this area that are that big or that low around here.

I am a 56-year-old metalsmith, mother and grandmother.  I have some college education, but no degees.  I have lived in all over the USA but am currently residing in the area I was born in. On October 4Th, 2011, around 8:00 pm, I was driving home from a day of running errands.  As I drove down the street I live on, I glanced down another street that angles off at a Y intersection.  Above our neighborhood clubhouse, I saw a mass of lights that were appeared to be stationary and about 200 to 500 feet above the building. I  stopped my car, backed up a few feet and turned down that street to see what it was.  Of course I was thinking, 'It's a UFO!' 'No, it can't be.' 'Oh my gosh, it's a space ship!'  I drove slowly as I looked at the mass of lights until I got almost directly under it.  I could see the whole underside of the craft and it was enormous! I could see that it was a triangle-shaped craft with lights running parallel to the edges but about a foot away from them.  The underside was slightly rounded and completely smooth.  I couldn't see any openings or interruptions in it's smooth, Grey-black metallic surface.  The lights were white, orange, red, green and blue and very bright. They weren't inset nor did they protrude.  They seemed to be a part of the underneath, which appeared to be almost fluid, like mercury.   As I slowed down to a stop in the middle of the street, it suddenly rotated and then moved up and across the street at an angle.  It was moving slowly enough that I could almost keep up with it, but I lost sight of it as I turned the corner.  Just past the corner there was a small group of people running toward the next corner.  One of the men yelled to me,  ""Did you see it?""   I answered, ""Yes!""   He replied, ""That was a freakin' spaceship!""   After slowing down at the stop sign, I followed the streets around toward my house and, as I turned back onto my street, I saw that it was moving right in front of me. It was then that I realized that my heart was pounding so hard that I could actually hear it.  Then I noticed that the craft was going straight toward my house, but, for some reason, I wasn't afraid. I was in awe of it's enormous size and the fact that I was witnessing something so spectacular!   As I approached my house, I realized that it had stopped again, this time just past my house, as if it was waiting for me. I pulled into the driveway and started honking the horn for my daughter to come outside and see it. I jumped out of the car and just as I was turning to run inside, it rotated and then darted over the trees, up and away so fast that it disappeared completely within a second. I was almost to the front door when I realized that I forgot to turn the car off or even shut the door. My purse was still inside it so I ran back, gathered my things, turned the engine off and ran inside to tell my daughter. I'm still not sure if she believed me, even though my heart was still pounding really fast and hard and I was talking so fast she could barely understand me. I went back outside to see if the other people who saw it were still heading down toward my house, but they were gone. I couldn't find them and I don't know which house they lived in or if they were even ne! ighbors or visitors. I couldn't imagine going door to door asking if anyone had seen the UFO. I did ask my immediate neighbors but they were either gone or not looking outside at the time it appeared. I later watched the local news but there was no mention of it.  It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life! It was not any kind of aircraft I have ever seen. I have been online reading about new aircraft designs all day and can't find anything that looks in any way like what I saw. I also can't find any articles about aircraft that have been developed to move the way this space craft did; nothing that rotates before it moves away or hovers, even though it was as big as three large houses. It was totally silent and very fluid in it's movements. It really doesn't matter to me if anyone else believes that I saw a UFO because I know what I saw and it wasn't of this earth.  As I think back about the incident, I realize that I was drawn to it in a strange way. The fear I expected to have was non-existent and was replaced by excitement and awe. I almost didn't have a choice of whether I drove away from it or straight toward it and, when it was gone, I somehow knew it wasn't coming back anytime soon. I didn't even think about driving around looking for it to appear somewhere else because I just knew it was gone. I had seen what I was supposed to see. It had fulfilled it's mission. Those were the feelings it left me with. But why did I need to see it? What happened to the other people I spoke to? They ran about a half mile from where I first saw them and yet, when I went back outside less than a minute later, they were gone. Where did they go? Isn't it human nature to stand around talking about something so unusual? Yet none of this seemed strange to me two nights ago when it happened. This has changed me forever. Even though I've always believed t! here is life on other planets, this made it much more real than I could have imagined!",2011-10-10T00:00:00,39.07880845410628,-94.38608574879227

Last night, Tulsa County was under a thunderstorm watch and warning for a few hours.  I went outside to take photos of the incoming storm clouds right before dusk.   At approximately 20:00 (I'm guessing) I took a photo facing North that turned out really nice.  I wasn't noticing any small details in the sky at the time.  I was just looking at the overall ""picture"" as I shot the photo.  A bit later I uploaded the pic onto my computer and noticed something unusual in the photo.  It does not look like an orb, a bug, or a plane, or something on my camera lens, to me.  I don't know what it is, so I will be emailing the photo to you and maybe you can decide?

I was in our house on the 2nd floor looking out the windows. My husband and I had been hearing these really loud jets in the sky for about a half an hour or so, so I went upstairs to see how close they were. I noticed the trails of the jets were all around the sky above our house. I went outside to get a look at these trails. The trails did loops directly above our house on all sides. There were a few jets with blinking lights, around 7 doing maneuvers all around the sky in view.. The trails were heavy and hanging for a long time so I stayed outside and looked for awhile. My husband had gone outside to the shed. I went back upstairs to check on the kids and looked out the window again, this time on the other side of the house (to the southwest). I saw 2 large orange-red orbs above the tree line. They were larger than the moon’s diameter . They were lined up at a 35% angle off the tree line. The craft made no sound. They looked as if they were going to fly right at our house, so I gathered the kids and took them downstairs. I actually thought at first it must be a really large plane that was going to crash into the house, I was assuming it was traveling at great speed. When nothing happened I went back upstairs to look and they were still the same distance away but parallel with the tree line, they hovered there for a minute before turning off for less than a second then reappearing. When they reappeared one was in between the spots they had been and the other was to the left of it, the same distance apart. After a minute or so the lights just disappeared. My husband was in the shed the whole time and saw the orange glow shining on the back wall, but was too low below the tree line to see the actual lights. Since then nothing until last night. We had been hearing the jets again and as I was putting our son to bed at around 9:00 I checked the sky (to the west) and saw an orange-red glow above the tree line. It was further away this time. I called my husband up to look and we watched it glow bright, change color, fade to a speck and glow again. This happened for a few minutes and then it lowered into the trees out of our view.

The center of the object was a series of red lights, arranged horizontally.  Above and below the red lights were blue lights that almost looked halo-like. It was the sandwiching of these lights that initially made the object appear purple. As we watched, the object stopped moving towards us and began moving in circular motions.  The lights continually faded in and out while this was happening.  Its movement was not confined to simple circles, and was fairly erratic.  It would circle around in one direction, then stop, then rise up again and then seem to appear in another spot when its lights faded back in.  At one point, the entire object tilted on its side and seemed to dive towards the ground, only to reappear higher up again. We observed the object for around 6 minutes before it began moving away from us, towards the beach.  We decided to try to follow it, but we couldn't find it again after we left the parking lot.

I was facing east across an expanse that included the Carrizo Badlands, the Carrizo ""Impact Zone"",  The now so-called ""National Parachute Test Range"" (Abandoned), the Coyote Mtns which include Carrizo Peak and farther, Superstition Mountain. I spent the early evening in my motor home when I stepped out at 10 pm to view the stars.  It was impossible to miss the bright hovering ball of flame located to the east.  I estimated it at about seven miles distant as I could plainly see from the light provided by this object that had lit up the entire area beneath it, maybe ten sqr miles, making this estimate possible.  A vehicle trail beneath it was clearly visible and I had been to that location (As most others in the park) prior.  I further estimated the fiery object as being approximately 1000 ft in altitude.  The object was just as I have stated, a ball of fire.  I observed it through 10x52 binoculars and it was clearly a round ball of burning gas with flames licking out exactly as videos of the sun show.  The overall color of this ball of flame was red-orange, mostly red like the sun itself. Though astonished I still tried to explain away the phenomenon but there is no explanation.  Skeptics would say that it was a flare but this siting lasted over four hours and the object never moved.  Others might say that it was something attached to the parachute tower but that locale is farther south and also only one or two-hundred feet high. While I was observing this oddity, I saw two USMC F4 phantom jets approach silently from the north below the level of the Laguna Mtns to my rear.  They had no lights of any kind and when they reached my relative position, they made a 90 degree turn and headed straight for the siting.  Strangely and whether this relates or not, I note that these two aircraft, noisy under any conditions that I knew of, made no sound whatever and they were so close to me (Estimate 500-600 feet lateral and about 300 ft in relative altitude.)  I could actually see the pilots silhouetted in their craft.  After closing the gap of several miles in just a few seconds the two aircraft returned to a heading that would take them to either the El Centro Naval Air Station or its sister base in Yuma, Arizona. I continued to observe this object until bored and returned to the camper only to check periodically to see if it was still there.  It was.  I checked perhaps five times until sometime after 2 AM it was gone. After checking a map I determined that this aerial phenomena was above perhaps the southern border of the Impact Zone and the park boundary itself. I am from a family of pilots, air controllers and air crews and myself have a small number of flight hours.  I have flown over the region several times and camped in all the areas of this park many more times between 1964 and the present.  I have lived for years in the area and other locales that have military aviation and have never seen such an item.  I did not report this to any group or agency at the time and was unaware of the UFO Reporting Center until years later. After consulting with Peter Davenport I agreed to make this report, however late.  Strangely, after a 12 year absence I returned to the same site on Dec 10 of this year and had another sighting (s) which I will follow-up  with.

This is a very old sighting. But it is more or less exactly what happened.  I was 16 years old and cyckling  to my familys home.The weather was about -10C,no wind and about a half meter snow beside the road.  A clear and dark evening.When I started to pass our neighbours house I noticed a ""lamp"" one house behind our house,at the other side of the street.  The light was about 1.5-2m above the roof.  I just thaught it was an odd and strange position for a light.It is when I go up in front of our garage I realize that the light is moving,around 0.5m each seconds.It is mowing parallel to the street in my direction.Description:never pulsating or changing in strength what you could see,25-30cm high,10cm breadth,the core is bright white a little less clear white out from the core and just at the end around weak yeallow.It could almost go for a street light except I didn´t see any glas,reflektor or anything else material,it´s just the light.It doesn´t seem to shine so long o! ut in the air.My eyes go from the light to the front door and back.It´s just when I decide to go and tell other about it,I can see in the glimse of my eye that more is lightened up 50m away.First I think that some smaller lights has been turned on.But when I focus at the object I realize that it somehow, even if I can´t see it,must have been brighter.Because another object is shown around 1m behind the ""lamp"" to the right.What I see is a surface about 1.5 m in diameter.  The color is very pale yellow but I think it´s the light doing that.Actually I think it is white in normal light.  Seems like solid metal like an old oiltank not like aluminium.It´s not a shiny metallic object.It´s also possible that the surface is not completly smooth.I can´t see anything like bults welded parts or markings. It´s just the surface in one peace and it looks brand new.  However I can see one thing.If I should describe it by it´s shape,I should say I say the under part of a saucer or more like a not ! so steep sour milk plate.I did see almost down to the bottom p! art(arou nd 1 m),but I belive that a lot of the upper part didn´t show.From front to back around I should say minimum 3 up to 5 m if it had this round shape like it seemed all around.It went at the same speed as the light so at that moment I thaught they were connected.After about 5 seconds I suddenly just see the light.I then got in and showed my parents and sisters boyfriend the light.It now pass the roof at the neighbour in front of us.Because it´s higher I think that the other object almost must touch the roof.It is so fascinating to see the light pass just like at an invisible road.It seems to go at the exact same hight(course) and doesn´t wobble at any time.When it goes from the next neighbour it suddenly change course 50 degrees from us(it was at collisioncourse with 2 trees 20m away) at the exact same time it starts to climb at the same speed or a little quicker.The light disappear from the eye at the next block 150 m up.2 evenings later I could see trees 30 m behind or neigh! bour house in front of us.I think that someone new that this was a very dark evening to ""hide"" the second object. I never heard any sound from the objects.I clearly think that the light was very intelligent controlled. Today I belive that the light and ""saucer"" was 2 separate objects.It seems so since I could see the light all the time when the ""saucer"" should have blocked it at the end of the sighting and that it would have gone to close to the roof. I don´t think anyone can tell me what I saw and for me this was the proof that UFO do exist.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,,

At approximately 10 AM I was standing in the redevelopment zone now known as Mission Bay, adjacent to the old Bethlehem Steel Yard just 60 yds north of the restaurant/lounge called Mission Rock Resort.  I was drinking coffee and watching the view across the Bay to the east when I saw two white ""balls"" just feet off of the deck of SF Bay coming towards me from the direction of the Oakland Airport.  I took these to be two Sikorsky S61 helicopters of the USCG and thought that I was about to witness a test exercise.  However as they came closer into view I realized that these objects had no wings or rotors.   They were soon in good view and the day being near perfectly clear, warm and quiet in my location I could see that they would pass me at near ground level.  As they approached at an estimated 30 mph I could plainly see that they were two separate objects of equal size in the shape of soccer balls, that is they were generally round but had a series of flat sides precisely like that of a soccer ball.  As they neared the edge of the shore they, in perfect close formation, began to climb slightly to an altitude that I estimate as 250-300 ft and passed me only about the same distance laterally.  I was simply awestruck.  I witnessed two fisherman on a nearby dock who apparently saw nothing.   As the two objects passed my location (They made no sound, had no aura, lights or haze around them) they increased their altitude dramatically and climbed to an estimated 1000-1500 feet above the skyline of San Francisco.  It was a weekend day, I believe Sunday and when I followed their progress to the north of me I noticed LARGE numbers of similar objects!   I am familiar with the San Francisco skyline and habits of its citizens and could not identify all of these objects.  A few could have been Mylar party balloons that had gotten away from people and some others were definitely real hot-air balloons in the distance up in Sonoma.  I always kept one eye on these two items while making these other observations.   Upon reaching their maximum altitude the two ""craft"" then did a maneuver about each other that I can only describe as a dance, similar to a deux-se-deux of a square dancer.  This was only momentary and then they began, still in formation, to return along the same flight path that they had just traversed.   Since my first sighting of these two vessels perhaps only three minutes had passed.  I knew that they would return my way yet I found it impossible to yell out to the only two others nearby, the fishermen, as I was so transfixed.  I did notice a police squad car approaching at slow speed and briefly thought to hail them down but my astonishment was such that I could not speak a word!  As expected these two objects returned at the same speed, passed me again at the same distance and again dropped down to the deck as they headed back towards the East Bay.  I had no reference to judge their size and can only surmise that they were each about the size of two small autos.  They were Flat (Mat) Hospital White in color and their surface, clearly solid, could have been metal or even fine wood.  There were no windows, lights or protuberances of any kind.  There were no flames, emissions, contrails or noise. As for the great many other objects that I saw over the City skyline that day, some of which I identified as hot air balloons farther away in the distance and others possible Mylar balloons, there were perhaps 100 more objects, most of them shiny metallic.  Most were stationary or nearly so, some actually moved in the opposite direction of the prevailing wind (Which was negligible that day).  I could clearly see that these shiny metallic ones were rotating on their axis in a clockwise direction.  Most made little lateral movement or altitude adjustments.  As I was focused on the two ""soccer balls"" I dismissed these others, though I found them quite dramatic. I spent the rest of the weekend awed by this experience and upon returning to work at the SF Public Library on Monday I immediately discovered a flier in the lobby alerting people to the ""continuing"" UFO sightings on, around and about the Oakland Bay Bridge in the vicinity of it's Eastern terminus, an area now called South Beach. The flier stated that a CHP unit had observed it one night ( I think I have since read that somewhere else.) and that crowds were continuing to gather. The flier was an open invitation to join the crowd, however I did not. The flier further stated that the local media were aware of the ongoing phenomena but would not cover the story. As I have become so deadened to the UFO issue I did not think to report this to anyone. I promised Peter D. that I would write up this report regardless of it's age.  I lived in San Francisco for over twenty years and spent a great deal of time outside. Indeed I drove a taxi full time for about ten years, 50-60 hours per week.  I am quite aware of the comings and goings of aircraft, flying debris, the relative wind, human activity and so forth in the City.  Nothing that I can imagine can explain away the vast number of odd-acting objects that I observed that day other than the two or three that I noted above.

This is a personal account of a time when my home, which I am still a current resident, was broken into and I was implanted by a being who I can only describe as a grey reptilian, with something like a small blue marble shaped object. I am going to be as descriptive as I can be, but I do not remember everything and I only have a crude drawing to depict some of what had happened. I was laying down in bed, on a mattress on the carpeted floor. In my room there was a home gym, an entertainment center with a television and a DVD player. I witnessed very bright lights outside of my bedroom window, and when I got up to see what was going on, they were unlocking the back door, the sliding glass door, when I retreated to my bedroom and locked the door. I then heard voices speaking to my in English telling me to make it not be so much of a struggle and give up peacefully.  Also, the object knocked out the electricity to my house. A being that was tall, and slim, and had what appeared to be grey skin entered into my room accompanied by at least one who is very short, something like up to my thighs (I am six feet tall), I immediately felt as though I was tranquilized and fell back onto the bed. I awoke again when a being calling himself a doctor of sorts, although he said that he didn’t go to Harvard or anything like that, was preparing a device which looked like a pistol, but bare bones, just a frame, a long slender metallic object used for inserting and a blue object, which was a small sphere. It proceeded to insert the blue sphere into my left nostril and what seemed like up into my brain through my nasal cavity until I heard a drilling noise and a crunch.  I was sedated, but I felt compelled to get up, walk to my bathroom and to look at myself in the mirror.  I then noticed profuse bleeding from my nose, I then fell unconscious, backward, into some other being who said that he would catch me, although I must have been very heavy for him, as he struggled to catch my falling body.  I still am not clear on whether or not I fell on the rim of the bath tub, although I seem to recollect the noise of that happening. I was numb. When I woke up, it seemed to me to be very late the next day, but admittedly I do not remember what day it was when I was implanted. I actually went later to get a MRI image of my brain, because I had remembered it shortly after, and the doctor said that something was wrong, and people in suits proceeded to confiscate the images, I was told to leave the premises, and I was not charged for the MRI scans, but was not allowed to see them. But I would like to give it another go, I would gladly submit to MRI images or X-Ray scans, or polygraph tests to verify to you that I am honest about this, I believe that this object is still inside. The one who put this object into my head, he said that they wouldn’t be able to remove it, because that would kill me, but that there would be scar tissue around where it will heal.

Everyone in the crowd was looking at this thing including the band, when suddenly two more appear from a different direction.  They also hovered for 1-2 minutes then winked out.  Then one more appeared from where the first one was seen, hovered for 1-2 minutes, then winked out. That was the last we saw of the orbs that night, the whole time was about 5 minutes total.

The thing that drew my attention to it was a long shaft of light beaming downwards towards the earth from it. It was a long shaft, not uniform in brightness but an increased intensity of brightness along it’s middle, extending downwards towards the earth at about a 25 to 30 degree angle from vertical.  The shaft thinned and feathered as it approached earth, not reaching the ground.  The object at the top of the shaft was no more than a light with no recognizable shape, about the size an aircraft would be at that distance.  I pulled over to look at it, and called my husband to see if he was able to see anything.  As we were talking I must have looked away for a second and when I looked up the light was gone.  I was shocked, and looked all around in the sky to see if there was any trace of it.

It did appear to slowly ascend. Yet we were sure it was flashing colors of white,blue and red repeatedly. I got out an old cheap telescope and we still could not clearly perceive the exact shape of the object but we could certainly tell the lights were moving in circular motion.

I am 61 and work in retail sales and he is in his 50's and is a professional therapist.  Due north of us is the Catalina Mtn. Range.  I estimated the range to be approx. 5 miles away and upon looking at a map that distance is confirmed. At approx. 9:10 AM I looked to the north towards the Catalinas and saw a pure white object below the skyline thus framed against the mountain itself.  It appeared to be the size of a small plane or good sized helicopter at first notice and was traveling due east skirting the mountain range at a speed that would not be inconsistent with such vehicles.  Since I wasn't paying attention to sound in the environment due to my friend and I having a conversation I then stopped hiking, called the attention of my friend to the object and then listened for engine or rotor sounds. I initially heard motor sounds but we soon both agreed that it was coming from northwest of us and was clearly machinery being used in roadwork or something similar.  I then watched the pure white semi-round object begin to have a ripple effect similar to a bed sheet fluttering in a breeze.  This effect was contained in the confines of the object itself and was not a phenomenon that the object was projecting in any way. It then proceeded to travel on its unwavering horizontal course and became pure white again.  it should be noted that my optometrist told me that with my glasses on (which I was wearing) I have better than 20/20 vision.  My friend told me he has 20/15.  He said he didn't see the initial couple of seconds of the incident due to a cactus being in the way but we both saw the next phase where the object either appeared to be glinting light or creating light.  At this point the object itself could not be seen other than a complete ball of light similar to when a silver plane catches the sunlight and reflects with a strong glow or glare except in this case it was evenly distributed and all encompassing. At this point my friend got a call on his cell phone and he looked down to press the keys to answer the call and that was the end of him seeing the object.  What I saw at that moment was this ball of light that then subsided back into being a pure white object that then made a arced turn towards the north at the same altitude and disappeared heading north and within a second or two was obscured by some mountain peaks. This object was close to being round but seemed more to be slightly elongated from the front to back rather than top to bottom.  There were no noticeable wings or other structures or markings visible on the object and definitely no helicopter propellers.  If I were to guess the size in relation to stars even though it was daytime I would say it was 4 times the size of Venus.  The entire event for me was approx. 10 seconds.  For my friend it was about 5 seconds.  From the beginning to the end of the event it travelled approx.  20 degrees of a 360 degree radius of the sky. Initially due to the height of the peak it was framed against it was below the skyline and framed against the mountainside that was behind it.  Due to the contours of the mountain even though it was traveling on the horizontal, in a couple of seconds it was then seen with the sky as its backdrop.  What really struck me at first was the fact that this object was below the skyline which made it impossible for it to be no more than a few miles away and thus I automatically assumed it had to be a helicopter since many of them pass through that area.  Again, no sound and sound travels far in the desert and definitely no propellers or wings seen on the object.  When I saw it turn north it's speed and movement was not at all consistent with a helicopter since the turn and speed were too fast for a helicopter or even small plane.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

This sighting took place in about 2 and 1/2 minutes.  The movement of the two lights towards each other took about 1 and 1/2 minutes and the retreat took about 30 seconds. I heard no sound that I could attribute to these lights.  I have never seen anything even slightly similar to these lights.  I have no explanation as to what these lights might be.

We were generally just appreciating the beautiful evening, and looking at all the bright stars we could see overhead.  Both of us commented on how unusually clear the night sky was. Kenosha underlies takeoff and arrival routes from both Chicago and Milwaukee airports, plus the smaller airports of Waukegan, Kenosha, and Racine.  I personally am an Airline Transport Rated pilot with more than forty years of flying experience in many different types of aircraft, with over 20,000 flight hours, flying corporate jets the past 32 years.  I spend a lot of time watching the sky for aircraft and take pride in how many types I can identify as they pass overhead. Shortly before 11:00 p.m. my wife commented, ""You should look at this airplane.""   I said, ""I really don’t feel like twisting around to look at another airplane.""  She said, ""You really ought to look at this."" I turned around in my chair and looked to the south.  What I saw was a bright red ‘light/ball’ low in the sky moving south to north toward us at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude at a high rate of speed.   I jumped up from my chair to get a better view.   In a matter of just maybe 15 seconds, the red ‘light/ball’ grew rapidly larger. This ‘light/ball’ had none of the normal aircraft navigation, strobe, or recognition lights normally found on aircraft. Suddenly, the ‘light/ball’ made a sharp right turn to the east over Lake Michigan and  accelerated at an astonishing rate as it climbed out of sight in to the distance.   The entire time of observation was approximately 45 seconds.   My wife said, ""What was that?""  I said, "" have absolutely no idea. I’ve never seen anything like it."" Stunned, we both returned to our chairs and sat down.   Shortly, she said, ""Here comes another one."" I jumped up out of the chair, turned around and observed what appeared to be the same type and color object repeat the same maneuver.  I grabbed my cell phone and took two pictures.  One in ""normal""; the object appears to be a small bright dot between the sailboat masts.  I then zoomed in max, and as expected it was very shaky/blurry, but the red color of the object is obvious. Because I do not know the size of the objects it is difficult to estimate the distance they were from us.  They appeared to be several miles away.  It was a quiet night, but we heard absolutely no sound from the objects.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,42.58091583333333,-87.85322791666667

I work second shift as an Aerospace Engineer.  I had been commuting on my motorcycle, and as I pulled alongside the driveway at around 12:30 AM I noticed what appeared to be the navigation lighting of a helicopter in the low horizon (approx. Latitude 47.97, Longitude -122.37). My home in Clinton, WA on the remote south end of Whidbey Island is located in a cul-de-sac and there was no other vehicular traffic at that time. The aircraft did not seem to move, hovering as a helicopter would and not wavering. I shut my motorcycle off to listen for the sound of an engine from the craft but heard nothing. In my estimation the craft was about 100-200 yards away from where I stood and 30 degrees in the sky, 50-80 feet above the trees surrounding the neighborhood which are around 120 feet tall.  It had two pure white lights which shone solidly and a third light to form a triangular pattern which was red, blinking on and off regularly about every second, and about one-and-a-half times the intensity of the two white lights.  By my calculation I gauged the total length to be 35-50 feet and the width about 25-30 feet, assuming the lights were positioned toward the extremities of the structure since it was too dark to make out any silhouette. The craft remained in the same position for approximately twenty seconds, then moved in a smooth South-to-West arc keeping a constant speed which I would guess to be about 40 miles per hour, maintaining a constant altitude and remaining completely level when making the turn.  It was at this time, when the craft was moving away from me that I noticed the sound of some type of engine.  It was a regular, single pitch drone and not very loud, somewhat like an ultralight engine but not fluctuating at all. The air vehicle continued out of sight as it disappeared behind the trees and continued West.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,47.9559,-122.4178

Last night, August 1, 2011 at about quarter of 1 AM, as I was pointing out the constellations to a friend's younger brothers, I noticed a very strange object appear in the sky to the left of Mars in the west.  It was a fiery orange/yellow globe hovering in the sky. At first I had thought that perhaps it was a plane, because it had just suddenly appeared.  Then I thought it could not be a plane, because the object was stationary for a minute or so and it was huge.  Big enough that when I pointed it out to the boys they thought it was the moon!  We watched it and I noticed it did not change size or shape, as I would have seen or expected from other planes in the sky. Typically the lights grow smaller or larger as it comes closer or further away.  This was very different. It stayed hovering in the sky fixed in that one spot.  The boys were looking for an explanation as to what it could be, I had none. Then after a few moments of staring at the object it suddenly vanished, then reappeared further away in the same area.  It was smaller and still glowing in the distance.  Seconds later it vanished again and instantly reappeared moving to the right. I was stunned and the boys were frightened.  It then appeared as two lights in what seemed like a strange bar like object with curved edges still moving to the right.  It vanished from sight as it passed behind the trees in the distance.  I kept looking to the other side of the trees expecting to see it appear on the other side again trying to reason that it was a plane.  We watched for what seemed like forever.  It never returned.  I have yet to figure out what it could have been.  It was scary to say the least. The object was so bright and so large I expected to see it in the news this morning.  I have yet to find anything on the matter.  I found it so strange I was compelled to report to some one and found this sight.  I hope perhaps this can provide me with an explanation as to what that object could have been.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,42.701713718411554,-71.15182888086643

It looked to be heading in a strong North/West direction on a steady path.  I have lived on this same block for 40 years and I am in the path of arriving and departing planes from Metro airport.  I can tell you that there have been only a couple of times when I’ve seen a plane that low flying in an East or West direction. We continued to stand in awe and must have asked each other five times “what is that?”   I want to say it looked like something large was on fire. Its diameter was approx. two to three times the size of our brightest stars. It was not an airplane I know that for sure.  The s! ky was clear and beautiful and there was no wind. I ran inside to get my binoculars and when I came back out it was still in sight.  There are a lot of trees so my field of view was becoming limited.  I have a powerful pair of binoculars and it is often hard to find objects right away because of this (plus I was nervous).  I had to keep taking them down to estimate the position because it was still traveling on its path.   At one of these times, my husband gasped and said “It stopped glowing; now it’s black.”   I had only maybe 30 seconds left of viewing and I still couldn’t bring it into view with the binoculars so I just stood there staring at the black object until it left our view.  After the fire faded, the object appeared to be a lot higher than I had originally thought. It was so far up there that I could not discern the size or shape of it. It did seem like I was seeing a flat object though. It was still dusk so it was light enough to know what it was not.  It was not a lantern, hot air balloon, or airplane.  Aircraft lights are not huge, orange, or glowing.  Even at this time of day aircraft lights are not even visible yet.   Wind does not usually carry things westerly as far as I know.   I am more than curious as to what this was.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,42.3252,-83.3453

In fact, a north-south satellite came a few minutes later and it was moving comparatively much slower than the ""oval cloud"" that preceded it.)

The first night I was leaving work and noticed a large glowing fireball low in the sky directly down from my work. I sat and watched it slowly hover and brightly glow for about two minutes.  It then separated into two pieces and flashing red and white like a normal plane.  They then began to loosely circle my location moving very slowly.  I looked around and noticed 4 or 5 similar plane like crafts hovering at the perimeter.  These events all took place near Corparate Drive in CT.   I began my trip back to Norwalk a little shaken and realized while traveling route 8 that they were everywhere in the night sky flying low and making moves atypical of a plane. I noticed 4 distinctive types so theses may have been different crafts or the same craft changing forms. The first craft is a glowing or burning ball usually rising up or sinkin into the horizon. The second ! craft appears as alternating red or white strobe lights. They would flash in a line across the sky extremely quickly but occasionally they would jump backwards. I noticed as many as 10-15 of these flashing probe crafts in a grouping. At times it appered they were going to crash into the highway due to the deep dives they woul take. The third craft resembled a small black plane but it was octagon or triangle shape. These could pass as military planes if they weren't so low to the ground and making such dangerous moves low to the highway and trees. These are what I think the glowing balls turn into. I did notice that some of the black triangles were often shadowed by a small re or white light craft that would stick by it's side for a while or dart away. I also noticed black craft that might resemble a helicopter but clearly were smaller almost like they were seated bodies encased in metal flying around. These types of events replayed themselves over the evenings of Oct 5th-7t! h from Trumbull to rt 8 to 95 south to Norwalk heaviest betwee! n 7 and 9 but sporadically all night. I caught some of the sightings from the second floor of my building which has twin 8 foot windows that look out over a few miles. Most of these indoor sightings were glowing balls that morphed into triangle crafts with rows of red, white and green lights. The important thing to note is I rarely heard any type of noise from any of these crafts except for a couple times that the glowing balls morphed to crafts and made a faint helicopter sound. Many sightings took place in my condos parking lot with three other witnesses. The date was Oct. 6th, 2011 at 8:30 PM and we saw the strobe lights countless times all over the sky,  approximately 6-8 glowing balls morph into planes, 8-10 low flying black triangle craft with red and white rows of light, and finally 2 apparent military craft long and skinny very high in the sky leaving behind a long smoke plume. One followed behind the other in a perfect line. Myself and the other three witnesses realized tha! t despite how high these were and how incredibly fast they were moving in the direction the black craft went, they were the only crafts we saw that made any sound whatsoever. I was unable to film or take pictures of any of this but I am purchasing a high quality video camera to film because I have a nagging sense that this may start to be a frequent occurrence.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,41.11917184035477,-73.425133481153

After watching it for about 5mins it started moving straight up in the air and then just stopped.  It was pulsating lights red, green and primarily white.  It seemed as though the lights were moving around in a triangle.  At one time the white lights seemed to arrange themselves in a row of three at the bottom. My brother-in-law kept saying it was a star, but the stars did not move (except for the rotation of the earth).  I was watching the star movement in relation to a tree as a marker.  The movement was not even close to the movement of the object.  My mother, sister, brouther-in-law watched the object for about an hour.  It seemed to stay in one position although at one point it seemed to come closer as we were using a high! power flashlight to signal it.  After an hour it seems to just fade away.  We went out the next night about the same time, but we had collected a group of people because we set up telescopes.  Nothing appeared, but when the people left the object appeared almost immediately!  We watched in again for about 45mins.  My sister says that a disk like oject formed but when I looked it had reverted to the light formation.  This night it was only my sister, mother and myself.

I first thought is was a chinese lantern because of the color (kind of reminded me of the color of fire). It did not flicker or blink (it seemed to glow or flow) but seemed to kind of slightly change shape but was mostly spherical.  It appeared to be about the size of a small car (the distance makes it hard to tell how big it actually was).  I got out of my car and listened, thinking it may be something from the military.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object that I could discern.  It was directly in front of us over our heads about 1 or 2 football fields.   It kept moving forward in a straight line at the same speed along side Chubb Rd so I go! t back into my car and turned the engine back on and turned the car around to follow it.  Being that it was moving slowly at first, I was going to stop at a friend's house on that road and have them come out and look at it but it started to speed up about 2 football fields down the road and before I realized it it was speeding away, it arched up into the sky and as quick as I can snap my fingers it looked like a distant star and just disappeared into space.  It seemed effortless.  I worked for the state in a law enforcement capacity.  I have lived in the area for over 10 years and there are many military helicopters and osprey that fly over our area.

Trajectory was from South to North. Time and Date: 7:40 pm approximately on 1/13/2012. Duration:  Approximately 5 to 8 minutes   Conditions:  Night, clear sky, no clouds. Setting:  My companion and I were sitting in our vehicle ready to back-up on to street.  Companion checking traffic to his right and noticed orange/red dot lights in the sky to the distance (coming North from South).   He looked again and said, ""What is that?""    I looked and was also surprised to see orange / red dot lights that were moving towards North.   We exited the vehicle and walked South on sidewalk to better see coming lights (past our front neighbor’s trees).  What we saw:   As the lights moved North, in what appeared to be two rows of lights, we were able to distinguish that there was a large ""mass"" craft at the front of the ""fleet.""    This craft appeared to be very large and looked diamond-like.  It had red/orange circular lights at the perimeter;  about three or four appeared to be turned on and these looked like dots of light at the perimeter.   The fleet, including the larger craft, moved smoothly without sound (appeared to be moving fairly slowly and smoothly, but unsure of how fast.  It took about 5 to 8 minutes from when we noticed the lights, to when we saw the final light disappear). While it seemed as if the fleet was traveling below the height that a plane would fly, we are unsure of the actual size of the larger craft so we are unable to assess height of travel.  With an extended arm, and measuring with your thumb and index finger, the larger craft would be about 5 inches wide and about 1 inch high.   As the fleet proceeded on its trajectory, the larger mass object was now “in-front” of us.  We were facing west and the fleet’s trajectory was South to North.  The larger craft appeared to be metal, dark and had textured surface (as if the surface was comprised of different levels).   The larger craft lights began to dim until they completely turned off.  When the lights turned off, we were still able to see the dark mass and that is when it was clearer that the surface was not smooth, but ""textured.""  The larger craft was still very much silent and still moving toward North, when lights were all off and it continued behind my front neighbor’s trees and then disappeared (or was less visible as if it either went higher, or simply further, I don’t know). Behind the larger craft followed, what appeared to be, smaller crafts following in the same trajectory.   We do not know how many smaller objects were following, but we believe there were more than 5 (from 5 to 10 possibly).  The following crafts had a number of lights that dimed and then reappeared, so it was difficult to assess quantity.  The lights continued to pass in front of our vantage point until one by one, they began to slowly dim until they disappeared completely (similarly as with the larger craft).  The smaller crafts appeared to be smaller in size and so the surface was not clear as with the larger craft.

UFO sighting July 7, 2011. I did not think anything unusual as I was taking pictures of the moon with a camera that I have, a Kodak M1063, when, I noticed in one of the pictures that there was the face of what appeared to be a grey alien, as if it were a large projection.  This all seemed very strange, so I looked at the picture closer in a Photoshop program where I was able to enlarge and clarify the picture.  What I found were several objects, most notably a very distinct large alien looking face just to the right of the moon.  I also noticed what looked like a train of cylinder ships flying about the upper right crest of the forehead of the face, forming a semi circle in formation. I know a little about hologram projections and I know that in order to create a projected image, one needs an atmosphere with most likely water particles, and a multi angular projection technique, which indicates that the cylinder ships in the photograph could have been projecting the image of this face into the atmosphere. You can also see a Burr tree shaped craft, a Saturn shaped craft, (my camera, sadly, is not suited to astronomical photography) I will of course send the pictures, clean, and enlarged for detail. I want to note that I did not see aircraft chasing the objects in the picture, but that night there were several silent aircraft criss crossing the sky with lights, what seemed to me to be military planes, as the local airport is closed at night, it is not a twenty four hour airport, and Macdill AFB is about a hundred miles or so to the north.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,27.189599999999995,-82.4802

At about half past midnight, I stepped outside of my front door to smoke a cigarette, when I noticed what I at first thought was a meteorite.  This, in fact, was not a meteorite but the light emitted from a UFO flying triangle.  I want to note that just before the sighting and during the brief sighting of the lights, which from what I already know about the craft which is a terrestrial reconnaissance craft, the sight of the lights would have indicated a necessary quick acceleration maneuver from a stationary position, and the lights themselves would be rocket engines. I noted that the lights came from about the same space above where, during the previous day, had been a double ambulance emergency dispatch for reasons unknown by myself at this time. The triangle accelerated to the speed of making a fast rotating blade through air sound"" I also heard a shriek of what seemed to be a female voice saying, ""Oh, no, why GOD!?,"" and a male voice shouting incoherently in a panic from where I just noticed just now the same area where an ambulance was dispatched to. I immediately went inside to get my digital camera, a Kodak digital point and shoot (non-SLR) camera, model number M1063 10.3 mega pixels with 32mm-96mm (equivalent) and Kodak AF 3x Optical Aspheric Lens. When I arbitrarily took a lot of digital stills of the airspace hoping to obtain some evidence of the activity going on overhead, I analyzed the digital photographs in Adobe photo shop CS5, and I was able to identify most of the craft which I saw. See attached photographs presented. From what I was able to gather, I observed the TR-3B craft interacting with a Nazi Bell craft. I also noted that due to the presence of the Bell craft, that the saucer shaped craft was also possibly a Nazi craft, although due to the quality of the photograph, I was unable to clearly identify the exact model of the craft, as there are more than a dozen different saucer shaped craft and I can only speculate on the exact model. I also noted another variation of the Aurora program craft there, counting a total of at least two of them. I also noticed that when I took my check from the U.S. treasury from my 2009 tax refund to cash it at the Wal-Mart customer service desk, a woman was there with what seemed to be a mild radiation exposure or sickness, with radiation burns on her face, and a hacking cough, she seemed ill, possibly had been in close contact with the craft, not sure of that story beyond that. Also, I want to note the timing, and this should be double checked, of the ambulance dispatches to the house which required two separate ambulances yesterday afternoon, and the ambulance dispatch to the area of the neighborhood directly adjacent to the church in the neighborhood, the reasoning for the calls for help, and the situational awareness of those emergency calls. I wanted to note that although I do not have a Geiger counter, I am curious about the Geiger count in this area as there was apparently profuse activity in the airspace last night, as this could indicate the residuals from their presence. When I went inside to analyze the digital photographs, I noticed flashes of light through the blinds which may have indicated either evasive maneuvering between the TR-3B and the Bell craft.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,27.189599999999995,-82.4802

The glowing orange red craft were flying in linear formation, appeared to be like loose embers from a fire caught in a draught of the wind. Later on I found out that they would have been flying directly above a local police operation, a DUI checkpoint, and it seemed that they were openly trying to communicate with the police by flying directly above them and signaling in a very similar way to how the police cars were using their light array to flag down civilians who were suspected of drinking alcohol and driving or were driving faster than was the speed limit of that street, which is 45 mph.

Location is farmland without localized ambient lighting.  6:10pm, clear skies.  From the 9 o’clock position (which would be from the east) a round bright white flaming firelight the size of 1/32 of the moon, coming down at a less than 30 degree angle and traveling with the arc of the earth.   My 13 year old daughter says “Wow Mom a shooting star”.  I pull car over as it passes at the 12 o clock position in front of the car.  At the 2 o clock position white sparkle rocks start breaking off from the main round body until the 2:30 position where the entire object blows into lots of small white pieces and fizzles out.   Entire sequence takes 10 to 12 seconds.  My first and second impression was that it was a hospital or news helicopter like a Jet Ranger, traveling low, fast and with landing/search light on coming at us.  As ! it passed us I then believed it to be a rotorcraft with trouble as evidenced by the ending “explosion” and destruction of the object.

I am a 39 year old white male, military veteran, platoon leader, fantastic eyesight.  College degree.  I am a business development executive in the technology industry for many years now.  Have never filed a report like this before. Tonight, a little over an hour ago, I was standing in my driveway with my neighbor and my 6 year old son.  We had a small fire going in a fire ring at the end of my driveway, and were standing around it.  It was chilly tonight, but the sky was crystal clear, not a cloud in sight, a thousand stars, and a half moon somewhat low in the sky.  A nice night to hang out with a neighbor. I looked up at the stars from my vantage point.  I was facing southeast, the moon was to my right slightly, my eye caught movement and was not immediately identified, but after a few seconds of trying to triangulate at what had caught my attention, I noticed an occlusion of stars in a somewhat broad chevron v shaped pattern, moving forward as you would naturally envision a chevron flying.  Soon after, I also discerned a slight, very dim light blue glue surrounding the chevron, and the chevron was an ever so subtle different shade of black than the surrounding night sky.  It was close, it had no lights or strobes or anything. It was very hard to see. But it was unquestionably there. It made no noise.  It appeared to be at a height of at least 10,000 feet, and possibly as high as 50,000 feet, it appeared to be moving at about 500 mph, directly south.  It could have been a little bigger than a 747, or an aircraft carrier, depending on how high it was. The glow was what really freake! d me out. I tracked it for a short time, but it faded with light from the moon as it neared that body in the night sky. I commented to my neighbor and my son that I had just seen a UFO, and laughed. I described it to them, they both looked up, but it was long gone. I told my wife when I came in. I have no evidence, no proof, but I don't make up stories on this stuff, nor am I a UFO nut. I am open minded. Perhaps it was an air force secret plane. All I know is that it was very weird. Additional information.  We live under a major air traffic lane of aircraft flying southeast from Philly, New York, Boston, Europe.  We see aircraft flying all the time, in a very predictable pattern, with aircraft I easily identify. The sighting was not in this pattern, nor was it a commercial or military aircraft.

The object slowly rose straight up into the air, making barley any noise at all. We turned left at the stop sign, parked, and got out of the truck. We watched the Craft hovering high in the sky above our pasture. About 30 minutes later we returned to my house and could still see the object. We could now see different colors, lime green, yellow, white, and bright blue. There was a thin band of l! ight at the bottom, with a very bright circle light orbiting around the thin strip. I could tell it was a circle because the bright light would travel around the small band of light, disappear, and reappear on the other side of the object. As of now, the object is still hovering high in the sky above my pasture. We attempted to take a picture, and video, once we all stopped freaking out.

We witnessed an aircraft Friday evening that I could not identify. It was flying west at approximately 3-400 feet, around 60 knots. My first impression was that it was probably one of the several Piper Cubs or Cessna 150s that frequently travel ""low and slow"" in the area, but this was unique given its appearance, the time of day and (most notably) its lack of sound; the craft was completely silent. Due to its lack of noise, I then suspected it was a hot air balloon, but I can say with 100% certainty there was no inflatable apparatus of any sort.  The craft was rectangular (oriented vertically) in profile, with the lower rim or base of the craft containing 8-10 orange/amber lights evenly spaced. The body of the craft had a soft glow that internally illuminated.  It was traveling at a level altitude, ruling out the theory that it was a stray inflatable/balloon. We noticed it through our front window has it passed over our neighborhood (Milford Historic District).  It was moving so slow that by the time we ran outside, it was almost 1 street over and extremely easy to see.  As it continued, I moved to our attic which allows me an unobstructed view of downtown Milford.  The craft appeared to hover briefly over the downtown, then proceeded to make a gradual northern assent until I lost visual contact. I've been an avid aviation enthusiast for 30+ years and usually have no trouble identifying aircraft.  I can say with 100% certainty that this is like nothing I have ever seen before.

My brother and I were on a train platform at Omiya station, in Saitama prefecture, Japan, approximately 23 kilometers (14 miles) northwest of Tokyo.  It was an exceptionally clear day.  The temperature was 8 degrees Celsius, and the wind was from the North at 5 m / s (according to the Yahoo Japan weather service website). We were looking toward the East, at an 8 X 17 meter advertising structure on top of a 6-floor building across the street from the station (approximately 65 meters from where we were at on the platform, according to Google Earth).  The structure was empty except for a banner calling for would-be advertisers, detailing its dimensions. We were discussing the size of the structure when from behind it there appeared several small, spherical objects traveling in a southeasterly direction. It is difficult to say from how far behind the structure the objects appeared, but if I were to hazard a guess, I would say between 50 and 100 meters.  The objects “appeared” to be about the size of basketballs.  If this would be the case, then we were seeing the objects from about 100 meters to 165 meters away. The objects were silver, were of a uniform size, and were easy to see against the bright blue sky.  They were not in any discernible formation.  We watched at least ten to fifteen appear randomly from behind the advertising structure traveling in the same direction and at the same speed. There was no sound associated with the objects. The objects did not “gyrate” or move about as one sees when watching balloons carried on the wind.  They did not rise or fall, but stayed in the same position relative to each other and all traveled at the same, continuous altitude (some above the others, but at the same relative altitude), and in the same direction. We watched the objects for approximately one minute, until they got too far away to see. There were few people on the platform at the time, and no one other than my brother and I seemed to notice them.

Circled several times. This evening, about 2:00am CDT, I was sitting on the couch watching TV when I heard what sounded like a helicopter circling the building really low.  I figured it was a helicopter going to the local hospital and dismissed it as not a big deal.  Then, I was still sitting there and heard it come back around again.  I turned off the window unit air conditioner to see if I could hear it better.  It was close.  I got up, opened the balcony door and looked outside and there was a dark cylindar-outline object with 2 lights on the rear, a red and a green one.  The red one was blinking, I think.  One of them was blinking.  There was also a spotlight on the front of the object.  The object also looked to have dark circles on the cylinder part that were just part of the craft itself, they were not lit up and hardly visible.  I screamed bloody murder to my girlfriend to wake up and to see what I was seeing.  She started to brush it off and was sleeping.  About that time! , I heard the sound of it fading back in towards me again.  Here it came again!  She got up this time and witnessed what I described above.  It was NOT a helicopter.  I thought it was when I heard it and even thought it still could have been after seeing it the first time because everything was so dark that I wanted to be really sure, but no, it was not a helicopter.  It was flying just as low as one though and when I first saw it, the cylinder dark part of it was facing slighting downwards, like it was looking for someone or something.  My girlfriend went back to bed, upset that she had to get up in a few hours, otherwise, I know she would not have wanted to miss the rest of this.  I stood there for a few seconds after it flew over that time and here it came again.  This time I knew it would.  I was excited and also kind of scared.  I had no idea what it was really doing, but it was astonishing to be so close to something that I could tell was not man-made.  When it came a! round this time, it started heading directly West, right towar! ds me, r ight towards my balcony door.  That's when I saw it shift it's light and knew that it did, in fact, have control over it's headlight/spotlight.  It never pointed the light directly into my apartment, but it pointed it right over me and I know that whatever was inside of the object definitely, without a doubt, saw me.  I was freaked out at this point because I have heard stories and read things about abductions and I was just not ready at this time, if this is what was planned.  So, I freaked out a little bit.  The object was flying directly over the 3-story leasing house next door that is only about 15 feet away from my balcony.  There is only a small space in between my building and the leasing office (it's a 3-story brick house).  The house has a chimney about 10 feet tall with an old antenna coming off of it that's about another 3 feet.  The object flew RIGHT ABOVE the antenna.  I'm telling you this object was no more than 15 feet above my head.  At this angle, it appeare! d ""wider"" or ""fatter"" more like a soda can, than it had from seeing it from the side.  I had grabbed a notebook and pen during all this and had began making sketches of it and I can see it in my mind, but was finding it hard to draw it on paper.  I have the sketches and am about to try to draw them in Paint or something.  We have been seeing objects for weeks and have been making reports here and have contacted MUFON on a local level here to investigate.  They are usually silver cigar/cylinder shaped and make no sound and appear to glide across the sky, seeming to appear out of nowhere.  We have witnessed them traveling slightly faster and higher than airplanes with a contrail of 2 lines that runs very close together and parallel and we have seen them fly slower than airplanes, at the same higher altitude with no contrails or sound whatsoever.  Recently, we have seen them appear, flying faster than airplanes with the ""double contrail"" then slow down, and have ZERO contrail and still no sound.  All of these are cigar-shaped and I have emailed you guys a picture I drew this last week or so of one of these objects and what I have seen on them that sometimes looks like a ""fin"" or a ""straw"" type of object stemming from the cylinder itself.  They are usually so high it's hard to make out what's on ! the object.  We have also noticed when it starts to get dark around 8:25pm, these same objects have a visible blinking red light on the top of them, sometimes in the middle of the cylinder and we have also seen them towards the tail end.  Tonight, we wanted to see if we could see them after dark, so we went out around 10pm and observed several of these objects in the sky at the same time... 2 or 3 sharing the sky at the same time within our field of view (which is limited from our balcony because of the house next door and trees across the street and we absolutely cannot see West or North at all).  These objects blinked erracticly like red/red/white/red/red/red/white/white/red/white/red/red/red, flashing brightly.  I also want to add after the close encounter highlight event of this evening/morning, I did actually see a REAL helicopter through the window, with the door closed, and was actually unable to hear it at all whatsoever.  To me, this is proof that this other object was even louder than a normal helicopter and certainly much lower.  Last, but not least, this may be the weirdest part in all of this, but hopefully you guys know how often we see this things now.  Well, sometimes when we are out watching them, I kind of say to them (the objects) that I wish they would come closer or lower so that we can view them.  I know this is going to sound really, really crazy, but it almost like this object wanted us to see it.  I did not witness anyone outside during this commotion of this craft, nor did I hear or see anybody afterwards.  It is like a desert town outside.  It is eerily calm and quiet.  I also want to add, although I do not fully know its significance, that last week sometime (not sure of the day) around 1 AM, I was sitting up by myself watching TV while my girlfriend was asleep.  I heard a very loud and very close BANG! right outside my window.  I then saw a flash of light right after it happened.  It was so sudden, so unexpected, so immediately unexplainable as anything natural at all, that my heart sank to my stomach and it began pounding.  I was so scared, I was literally frozen and did not know what to do.  Once I calmed down, I looked outside and decided that maybe somebody had busted a lightbulb out or something like that, but that doesn't even make sense either.  It was much louder than that and certainly on my level (the 2nd floor) and close enough that my neighbor lady on my level would have heard it and the guy that lives below her.  It was still after that.  No sound, nothing.  I told my girlfriend about it the next day and there was nothing out! side at all to remotely explain the sound.  Nothing was broken.  There were no large holes in anything.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Until last night, around the same time I heard the noise before, around 1:20am, there was a loud BANG! boom, boom. then a rumble that lasted for a couple seconds.  This was NOT lightning.  It was not thunder.  It was not storming.  There were no rain clouds.  There was nobody outside.  Everything was still.  This scared the crap out of my girlfriend and it was almost like I didn't even flinch this time, even though it sounded like a shotgun went off outside my window and not even both of our windows, only one window.  That's how localized this sound was.  So, this evening before I heard the helicopter sound, I had looked at the clock at around 1:50am and decided that I guess we weren't going to hear that noise again tonight.  We had agreed to pay attention to the time in case it happens again (not that you wouldn't hear it), but she went to ! bed and I was still up and didn't hear anything.  It wasn't ev! en 10 mi nutes later when the helicopter noise began.  I hope you guys can make some sense of all of this.  I'm just along for the ride here, apparently.

I decided to stay outside for a bit longer, looking around to see if I could see anything suspicious in the sky. There is a radio tower on top of a hill about 3 or 4 miles away from my home, and it has a light on top of it. I saw this flashing light beside it.. Just hovering there along side it. It was flashing colors of red, blue and white. Mostly white though. When the object would flash a different color, the light on the radio tower seemed to dim in and out. It was very strange. I watched it flash and hover for a long time. It started to slowly creep above the tower and over it. I ran inside and got my brothers as witnesses. As we were outside, we all saw anoth! er flash of light where I saw the ""street light"" fall earlier, except this time the light was a little bit smaller. I then proceed to call the UFO Hotline and explain what I had witnessed myself. We all sat outside and watched the object by the radio tower for about 30 minutes and decided to go inside.

I have a 20 min commute I from the center of town to the north end of the outer-belt (I-270) where I stay at.  The night was fairly clear, but I can't see too many stars due to light pollution.  I am in the city (obviously) but my street has no lighting what so ever.  Its kinda isolated which is why we chose to live here.  I was coming East down my street (approx. a 1/4 mi of no lights / straight shot to a T intersection) and saw an orange glow in the sky.  I would guess that from the horizon it was up approx. 30-40 degrees in the air, and was an orange ball.  I think it was between 2-7 mi away in distance from me.    I saw it traveling from at least north to south, if not NW to SE (which is my better guess but not 100% sure).  I THOUGHT I might have see 1 flashing light happen as if it were an airplane, but this thing was going at a pretty decent pace.   The only thing I can think of that would go at its speed from that low would be a helicopter, but there was no sound, and I don't get much air traffic over my house from Port Columbus Int'l.  Too fast for a smaller aircraft, and definitely not an airliner.  I saw it travel, then I drove up by a tree and lost sight of it because of the tree, and then it was gone.  I looked outside for 10 min not find it.   The orange color was about the same tint as the orange in highway lights that make everything gray. I don't think it was jupiter (or any other planet) due to the movement and that I lost sight of it.  But I'm not ruling out the thought.  Maybe someone knows where certain planets are at this time of year and specifically for that date.   I don't know of any aircraft that have that orange tint to their headlights.  I've seen the normal white, and recently saw an airplane w/ LED (like the obnoxious head lights that pure white).

When I looked in the sky to what appeared to look like a star but it was shimmering orange. I t stayed stationary for at least a minute.  I took my eyes off it and just figured it was a star.  Then I decided to check and see if it was still there.  When I looked it accelerated and started breaking apart. It looked like it had a spot light in the front as it was breaking apart.  It flew right above my head in the night sky.  As it flew above my head it formed a triangle shape and had 3 red lights and a black mass in the middle.  It continued threw the sky until I could no longer see it. I strongly believe what I saw was not from this planet.  I do not know the exact trajectory or elevation. If I had to guess I saw it rise in the West and then fly above me and disappear in the East.  Elevation I would say when it was at its highest point maybe a couple thousand feet but it was not flying extremely high at all. It did accelerate quickly and then stop on a dime and break out into the triangle with red lights then it cruised slowly away.

Friday, January 6th, 2012 Charlotte, NC 28209  	 A group of friends and I were playing a game of night Frisbee at the local middle school.  At approximately 9:15 pm someone shouted, ""Look up at the sky!""  We all shifted out attention to the clear dark sky, where 3 balls of white light were swiftly gliding in perfect unison.  Even more bizarre, was how these foreign balls of light moved.  Not only did they glide with a solid white glow, (didn't flash like an airplane), they moved in a perfectly symmetrical equilateral triangle shape.  One light guided the other two across the sky, all of which appeared to be the exact same distance from one another, forming three perfect 45 degree angles. We were all dumbstruck by the phenomenon and attempted to make sense of it while continuing to admire its beauty.  Each of us announced our individual ideas in hopes of deriving a logical explanation for the triangles existence, whilst smothering the immediate idea that lingered in all of our hearts - could it be a UFO? 	Perhaps it just seemed too unlikely for us to be blessed enough to actually witness, first-hand, a true UFO sighting.  I remember watching the lights glide across the sky and debating whether or not to take a picture from my phone, not wanting to appear juvenile, I decided against it. After watching the lights glide for approximately one minute, the rear two lights began to reduce their distance apart from each other making the guiding light's angle (Far Right) more acute and the other two light's angles more obtuse (Left & Center).  The possibility that their paths were not predetermined by the front light (Far Right) began to cross our minds.  However, surely enough the rear lights settled into their new position and the three glowing lights maintained there new triangular shape and continued to travel across the night sky, once again, in perfect unison.  This proceeded for approximately 30 seconds.  Then, the far left light suddenly vanished from sight. The group burst into uproar, attempting to decipher the cause of the disappearance.  The consensus from the other witnesses was that it must have disappeared behind some clouds.  However, I was not convinced for two reasons. First, the sky appeared completely absent of clouds, no reflection from the moons glow indicated any cloudy haze whatsoever.  Secondly, even if it did disappear behind the clouds, eventually it would have reappeared - it never did. Approximately 15-20 seconds after the far left glow disappeared from sight, the front guiding light also disappeared (Far Right).  Leaving the last light to dwindle for approximately 20 seconds until it, too, disappeared.   The lights never revealed themselves to us again. One day later, a friend of ours who was at a neighboring mall the night of the occurrence, approximately 3-4 miles a way from our sighting, also saw the glowing orbs in the sky that night.  He took a picture of his findings and sent it to us; it is the image that I have sent you. I researched the phenomenon somewhat and have found other sightings of these glowing orbs in the North Carolina area.  I hope that my story proved interesting, feel free to contact me about any questions you might have.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

At 5:13 pm 5 miles south of Buffalo, MO,  I was outside with my gps and heard a very loud noise that made me think a military jet was passing within site of my location.  After stepping into a location where I could see a larger section of sky, I finally located a sillhouette of what would appear to be a passenger 747 at standard crusing altitude for commercial traffice in the area.  This had no visible contrail and compared to a typical passenger jet appeared to be flying at around 3 times a normal jet.   Based on the altitude the jet could be heard as well, very loud as well as clearly which was unusual in this area, much less at that volume. Based on my normal views of airplanes this should not have been heard, again it was the sound that caught my attention to begin with thinking a military jet was approaching as I had seen f-14's in the area a few days prior.   My cell phone has a compass on it and after tracking the object for approximately 10 seconds by sight it dissapeared much quicker than any 747 at that altitude I had ever observed.  I had aproximately 20 seconds of hearing something approach and 10 seconds of visual on the jet.  Using my compass, it was headed at aproximately 225 degrees sw of my location. I know this doesn't fit into a typical report, but the whole scene did not fit the general feel of a typical 747 commercial jet , altitude, sound and speed of what you would normally think.

After a while my dog looked really tired so I decided to go inside. I left the field that we were in to walk down the hill to get to my house (the whole neighborhood is on a giant hill) and as I turned the corner I went to take a picture that would show the Rule of Thirds (you could see a couple miles out down by the Golden Mile) and I noticed a weird sphere to the left of the water tower right before I took the picture.  I zoomed in and saw that it was a yellow, almost golden sphere.  I snapped 10 good photos of the object before I had to hurry in because my sister was cooking dinner and had gotten in over her head and needed my help A.S.A.P. After I got in and helped her, I sat down and uploaded the pictures onto my computer.  I was amazed because there were some lines to the bottom left of the sphere that I hadn't seen when I was looking at it in person. They appear to maybe even be a series of small spheres floating a little ways from the craft.  So close they look like a line. The entire time I made my way down the hill I could see it. Sitting in the exact same spot. I would really like to know if anyone else in the area saw it. I can't really think of what it could have been. Some may say it was a planet, but if you could see a planet that well with the naked eye, then I would be scared that it was that close. It was approximately North/North East.

We watched it for a bit then noticed different colors being displayed.  We recorded red, blue, orange, green and white. It would dim down then get extremely bright.  As it got brighter it would shoot down about two or three inches then proceed to do what I can only describe as loop-de-loops.  We watched this object for a good 4 hours before we left. We also noticed that there were moments when the object would become red, extremley bright, and then turn into three in the shape of a triangle.  The two extra lights would then be sucked into the one, then proceed to dim down again.  The object acts as if it were a star when any aircraft passed in its direction by dimming down, not blinking and being stationary.

At ~1750 hours on 01/14/12, I was looking due south out toward the ocean and saw a bright light / orb out over the horizon at approximately ten degrees elevation.  It was roughly similar in brightness and size as the planet Venus appeared at that time.  Visibility was good as I could see San Clemente island and the sun had recently set. The object was moving at significant speed from left to right and with a motion like a gentle sine wave for what I'd estimate was several hundred miles.  It abruptly corkscrewed downward toward the point at which the water met the horizon and appeared to skate across the top of the water still out near the horizon.  It then began to move toward my location/the coast ""skating"" across the top of the water with the same gentle sine wave motion only back and forth laterally now rather than vertically as before. The orb appeared to get very close to the beach and then turned around and headed back out toward the horizon and began to gain altitude.  It returned to something near its original altitude and near where I first observed it out over the horizon.  It again executed a helical / corkscrew turn down to the water and approached the coast again where it appeared to vanish into the ocean approximately one mile or less offshore.

I stepped out of the garage at about 4:15 or maybe 4:30 am, into my three acre heavily wooded lot surrounding my house. The morning was crisp, low humidity and temperature probably around upper 60's.  The night sky was brilliant with no deterioration from humidity -- a great viewing opportunity if I could have set up my telescope. I then observed a bright white light on a slow moving trajectory heading on the flight path I assumed to be to the Kansas City airport (MCI) as their are many commercial planes that use that or nearly that landing / takoff path. I then looked for the blinking red indicator lights that are normally visible on commercial planes about 70 miles out from MCI.  I spotted no red blinking lights on the bright white (round) light moving east - east - south east (EESE).  I next listened for the jet engine noise. Nothing - the early morning was dead silent.  I then moved quickly down to my pond about 90 foot north of my garage door to get a better, unobstructed view and confirm this was a commercial aircraft (it was moving at what I considered a commercial jet landing speed but two to three times brighter than what I normally note as jets on their way to and from MCI). As I ran to my small pond I became convinced this was not a commercial aircraft and started shouting ""Hey - Hey -- Hi - Hello"" and with my arms above my head began waving my arms toward the moving bright light overhead.  I was very excited and almost pleased I was seeing this light disk in the sky. As the round light passed overhead I changed my opinion to the probability that this was a satellite circling the earth and catching the early morning sun from below the horizon.  There were no lights blinking from wing marker lights and absolutely no sound emanating from an internal combustion source and the path of the light was on a straight and constant velocity path to the EESE.  I had tracked enough satellites to be convinced this was another satellite and I turned around and headed back to the garage - a little disappointed - but satisfied by the brief, no harm, diversion from cleaning an autofill combo supply - check valve for my hotwater heating system. As I reached the paved parking area next to my house and in front of my garage I decided to scan for the satellite on its trajectory again (and enjoy the refreshing cool, dry morning air again) before entering the garage to continue work. To my surprise the light was moving very slowly to the SW -- as it had moved past me about 30 to 40 seconds (on same initial EESE trajectory) after I had shouted and raised my arms and waved them in the pitch black that is rural Topeka, KS.  As I popped into the open of my concrete parking area in front of the garage the light came to an instant stop also. The light had also moved back to the north in those last few seconds but was not quite overhead - but about 15 degrees south of straight overhead.  I listened for a propeller blade wash noise from a parked helicopter (the local city poilce have a helicopter that is very noisy and easily identified by its very loud engine and prop noise).  Again - absolute quiet reigned - with no normal or unusual noise being heard from this now stopped light in the sky. I continued to observe the light and did not think of yelling and waving my arms as I noticed I was now very nervous. The now still round light - if it had not sensed my presence - at least gave the highly coincidental indication that it was now going to track me.  I stared at the light in the sky (much brighter than a bright star) for about 10 seconds and the emotion grew to get away into the garage as  soon as possible -- I logically did not expect the light was anything to fear -- but the fear and seek cover emotion ruled and I could no longer control it and could not continue to observe the light in the sky. All of this happened in a three to five minute period.  Looking back on this incident both the emotional states I experienced seem highly unusual for me -- overly happy /pleased as it passed overhead the first time and then overly distraught a few minutes later with the creepy felling it was going to observe me and / or do something I would not like.  Neither emotion seems like a normal response for me. I am a engineer, naturally curious, and open to observation without emotion as I seek to analyze situations and events and not let my emotions rule. Previous events / sightings -- I have now observed this style of light flying in the sky three times that I can remember.  One as youth, one at age 41, and now this morning as a 56 year old man.  When I observed a similar style light as a 41 year old there.............dssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss were also 10 or so witnesses observing the light with me on a wilderness river boating and camping trip, one of them was my best friend.  My best friend and I discussed (for about 5 minutes or so)  the ""wierdness"" of the unusual light (flying craft) that night and then he as well as the other 10 campers went to sleep almost immediately.  I stayed awake for about 10 to 15 more minutes wondering why someone was not continuing to discuss what we had just seen -- I will just say it was repeated for us and was very, very remarkable what the light (a flying craft of some type) performed with its near infinite acceleration and agility relative to a fighter aircraft i! n the area.  When I brought the matter up with  my best friend in the morning to continue the discussion he told me that he knew of no such event had happened the night before (and I believe that is now his memory) - in fact I was the only one in the group who had any recollection of the event - everyone I approached (including my best friend) said they did not know what I was talking about.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,39.03386902439024,-95.75722975609757

The cluster had probably 8-12 lights and was in an ellipse type random formation and they all appeared at once. The first set of lights didn’t surprise me that much but when I saw this second group I was very puzzled, it was like nothing I had ever seen before.  I called my neighbor who lives +/- 600’ south of me and told her to go outside.  She said she could see the 3 up high but I think my house was in the way of the large cluster.  As I was talking to her the larger cluster was fading in and out, always visible and very bright at times, they were visible for a couple minutes and they didn’t move up or down, they seemed to stay in one place.  Then they all just faded away and disappeared. The color of these lights were nothing like I’ve ever witnessed before orange-red, almost rust color.  Not blinking but they kind of twinkled.  As I watched them, stars were visible but I believe there was also some thin cloud cover because the stars were not bright like they would be here on a clear night. I live in a fairly remote area with minimal light pollution and I didn’t hear any noise associated with what I saw. A friend checked the notice to airman and temporary flight restrictions for our area and there were none.",2012-01-24T00:00:00,44.5471,-72.8877

Anyway, my mother-in-law was telling about how her and my father-in-law have seen things outside their house before around 8pm or 9pm so at about 8pm she went to lock the door and let the dogs out for the night and she was like ""Hey, come here!!""   I went to the front of the house with some binoculars to check it out and sure enough there really were lights outside that were really bright orange and red and they were too low to be stars. When I first looked at it, it looked like a ""T"" and it had 4 lights coming down off of it and 2 on each side on the top. The two on the top on each side were white and the ones coming down off of it were red and orange! The top ones on each side went away as I watched and they never did come back. From then on, I was just looking at a vertical strip of lights. I handed the binoculars to my mother-in-law and she seen it too then handed it to my father-in-law and he seen it as well.   All of commotion woke up my son who is 8 years old and he seen it happen too.  It started changing colors from red and orange to blue and even green and white.  It looked like the red one in the middle was rotation around it somehow. It would get closer for a minute and then it would get farther away.   Most of the time it just hovered and when it did move it moved really quickly, must faster then a jet.   The only way we could tell it was moving away is because the lights on it would get smaller.  The only other lights out were the street lights which are huge and right in front of the house but across the street is just the lake and there are n! o other houses in that area or lights that you could confuse this for. It also never made any noise so it couldn't have been a helicopter.  You could be looking right at it for a minute and then it would just disappear but then come back and finally about 25mins. later it was gone completely.  I was in total shock but my in-laws were not quite as surprised because they had seen things in that area before.

I observed the same extremely bright object in the southern sky for the past 14 nights in a row. The first time my wife and I noticed it, it appeared to be landed on a deserted mountain range. We saw it move slightly to the left, right, up, and down. Ever since 1/20/12, I have seen it in the same region of the sky, or if cloudy or raining, it appears upon this same mountain range, sometimes motionless until after dawn. I have ruled out the typical planet theory. This object moves in such a way to blend in with the stars. But if you watch it for any length of time, you can tell it is indeed moving in an unnatural way. Because it varies slightly in location, I have determined that it has to be within the atmosphere and fairly close.

"Red/orange orb interacts with jets, chased by more jets, re-appears 4 days later.",Silver City,NM,2012-01-20T22:20:00,changing,20 minutes,"Occurred : 1/20/2012 22:20  (Entered as : 01/20/12 10:20) Reported: 1/24/2012 10:18:38 PM 22:18 Posted: 2/3/2012 Location: Silver City, NM Shape: Changing Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86818.html,"Red/orange orb interacts with jets, chased by more jets, re-appears 4 days later. This is a descriptive account of two incidents of personal eyewitness accounts of a reddish orange orb.  The first indecent occurred on January 20th at approximately 10:20 pm in SW New Mexico, just outside of Silver City. At first there were three of us outside, me, m and c.  We were about to leave m's house when I saw what appeared to be a plane and some distance behind it and approaching it quickly was a reddish/orange orb.  There was a distinct difference in the speed of the orb and the speed of the plane.  The orb was obviously traveling faster than the plane. Then a second plane was visible behind the orb, and all were traveling together (plane, orb, plane) with the orb somewhat lower than the two planes.  It was peculiar that there was no sound from these planes or orb.  We were out in the outskirts of town where it was very quite and we could hear very well, that there were no jet engines.  Then, as all three objects are flying due west, the orb shakes up and down violently a  very small distance, shaking the planes up and down as well. Next was beyond belief.  The orb very obviously sped up to the first plane and went into or behind it, disappearing from view.  It almost immediately came out as 2 orbs of identical color.  It is vital to note that the orb was not only much smaller than the outline of the lights on the planes, but that it did not flash like the planes did.  These planes also did not flash like the regular commercial flashing plane light.  The planes seemed to be communicating with each other using their lights, it did look like Morse code, now that I replay it in my mind.  (My current hypothesis is that the orb had already taken control of the planes by the time I had seen them, and all the pilots had to communicate with one another was their lights!) Immediately after the 2 orbs came out of the plane in front, all of the objects lights' turned out, the orb was dim like a star, as were the planes, most strange, at the same time this happened, they all turned towards the south and merged to form an equilateral triangle with the point directed upwards, facing us.  This triangle appeared to have a mass connecting the lights. There were no clouds in the sky, the stars were very bright, and the light of the city was blocked by a ridge.  The triangle slowed down its movement to a crawl yet still covered a massive distance very quickly, circling from West, to South, to East, and finally North East while it disappeared into what appeared to be space. Not five or ten minutes later c and I were preparing to depart from m's, we were amazed to see the reddish/orange orb floating straight up from the north.  I thought to myself what would I do to communicate with this orb, and I thought maybe I would whistle.  Before I could even whistle and directly after the thought, the orb light went out.  The star sized light that remained floated upward and southwest until it realized two more jets were coming in from the north east.  I heard the roar of the jets  as they flew the trail of the orb all the way over us towards the North and West, south into Mexico. Tonight, January 24th , 2012, I was witness again to this phenomenon, yet it was slightly different.  I was sitting on my front porch facing South West when I saw the red light again, this time smaller and what appeared to be 2 orbs very close to one another and fainter.  It was also earlier in the evening, approximately 8:20 pm, and the city lights reduce visibility.  Still the stars are highly visible in Silver City, NM.  I watched as the pair of orbs moved in a similar flight path as the Friday night before.  The lights pulsated or flashed irregularly, almost more of a pulsation.  It went from West, to South, to East, and disappeared behind the trees.  I watched it circle around 3 times before it disappeared the final time. But before it dipped behind the trees for the last time, it glowed a brilliant orange/red much brighter and larger than the orbs we had seen the previous Friday.  It quickly faded and went away behind the trees.  It was interesting to see how the flight path of these pair of orbs was directly compared to that of observable commercial flights at the time and to note the irregular flight path of the paired orbs, and the straight path of the commercial flights. The paired orbs traveled at a much higher speed than that of the observable commercial flights.  They also had no noise.  This where it is puzzling.  Very soon after the orb glowed that burst of orange/red light, it went away, and minutes later 2 fighter jets zoomed by, completely audible and loud, just like the 2 jets that went after the one orb on Friday.  But unlike those two that pursued the orb into Mexico, these two jets did not appear to know where they were going, just going really fast in the same flight path as where the paired orbs were 5 minutes prior, and pretty much where the first occurrence turned into an equilateral triangle. Yet when we first witnessed this on Friday, there was no noise when the planes were incorporated into this triangle, and there was no noise tonight with the paired orbs, we could hear the commercial flights when they passed by, we could hear the Air Force jets zooming by, but no, we could not hear the orbs at all.  The whole time the orbs flew with remarkable speed and smoothness, and made irregular and seemingly impossible movements, like moving a large distance while appearing to move slowly.  This was particularly present in the triangle form.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,32.685832500000004,-108.4894425

I would have missed them as well except at the exact moment that we were in the spot where they were visible my son asked me, ""Is it a new moon tonight?""  So at that moment I looked up and made the initial sighting. On our last pass I had an image of seeing myself from their perspective in my mind and I blurted out, ""It’s a father with his two kids.""

Around 3 am, GreyBeatle (known here only by his username) saw what he first thought was a town of some sorts on top of a mountain.  He usually travels through there with his truck so immediately he knew that it couldn't be that, since there was never anything there before.  Then, as he pondered what those lights could be, they began to move in unison as if belonging to a single body, a craft, the size of which he guesses was at least half of the mountain.  It was hovering as it moved, but very slowly.  He could tell it was hovering since it was at the very top of the mountain and he could see the terrain below it. The sighting lasted 5 to 7 minutes and the witness claims he heard no sound coming from the craft as he drove off.  No shape was given to the massive craft since it was a dark and! rainy and the sky was not very clear. Here is the transcript of the entire conversion:  GreyBeatle: saw a flying saucer in WV GreyBeatle: last sunday GreyBeatle: I'm sure it was.. for about 5 minutes..... GreyBeatle: But then i realized there were like 5 military bases there.. so it was likely some kinda secret air craft GreyBeatle: The thing i don't understand.. is why if you want to keep it secret do you put 10 million lights on it? Interviewer: Was it disc-shaped, diamond, spherical?  What kind of shape was it? GreyBeatle: naw.. it was more like a big floating upside down mountain GreyBeatle:  I drove past it flying in the mountains at about 3AM.. GreyBeatle: in the middle of a rain storm GreyBeatle: nobody on the roads or out.. but a stupid truck driver to see it GreyBeatle: it was actually Monday Morning GreyBeatle: Sunday night.. whatever Interviewer: Did it have any lights? If so, what color were they? Plain white or multi-color lights? GreyBeatle: white.. all white GreyBeatle: maybe yellowish GreyBeatle: hard to tell GreyBeatle: Had millions of them GreyBeatle: like all close together.. was wild Interviewer: you said it was big? like an upside down mountain? GreyBeatle: yah.. huge GreyBeatle: I thought it was a town on a mountain at first.. until i realized there was nothing under it. GreyBeatle: didn't hear a sound except my truck.. was listening for engine's or anything to make it fly.. heard nothing GreyBeatle: funny thing tonight tho.. my radio antenna is glowing red.

Vermont pm sighting of a VERY bright, solid, slow moving, silent. light, that appeared 2 stop and changed direction. I am located in Southern Vt, 30 north from the Mass boarder, and 15 minutes east of the New York boarder. While resting on our bed this evening, a light in a West facing window caught my attention as ""out of the ordinary"".  I got out of bed, as did my VERY level headed, boyfriend to watch it. Within a moment or two, perplexed, we both headed down stairs, and outside to try and see ""it"" more clearly and get a better understanding of what we were viewing.  The light appeared to remain consistent for the duration of our observation of it. It was a Strong, Bright, Solid (not blinking, pulsating or flashing), Orange light that cast 8-10 brigth rays.  It is a relatively dark evening, and there is a color in the pm sky (a steel dark dark grey black) that, along with the lack of any other objects, (ie stars, planets, satelittes, other flying objects) makes me think that there must be some cloud cover.  If there is cloud cover, this light appeared to be below the clou! ds. It moved from west to east, steadily at first, and...well not quickly.  For most of the viewing there was nothing but silence.  Silence to the point of having mentioned it at the time to the person I was with. While we watched it, the silent moving light traveled from the east side of our house, to above our fields. While this occured it was completely silent. It then seemed to stop moving.  Our eyes no longer needed to track it.  After what I would guess was maybe 10 seconds, it appeared to start moving again, but instead of moving in a consistently straight path (as it had looked to be doing), it appeared as thought it was going to return back from the direction in which it came. It then, appeared to stop again.   And when the movement resumed it was once again heading in the direction of New Hampshire..  The light remained BRIGHT orange with no fluctuation in its solidity, or cast rays,  throughout the sighting, and only appeared to change size as it disappeared over the! mountains. We sit on 30 acres of fields, and have a funamenal! view of the sky. LOTS of sky...big, wide, open, sky.  As our sighting began to reach its conclusion, this light, for the first time, went from being consistently one size, to steadily reducing in appearence. Its departure seemed to happen more quickly than any movement prior.  Keep in mind it is dark, and therefor any specifics about its appearence are non existent. It was well toward our east when, as the light ""shrunk"" we heard a distant sound that reminded us of what a jet again would sound like. THAT one factor left the gentleman with whom I was with, to say (slowly, and as if he was trying to convince himself) ""um , well, must be a plane...that noise...."" and with a befuddled look, he slowly turned and headed back inside and upstairs.  I dont NOT know what we saw. But I do know it was not an airplane. It was NOT anything I have seen prior to this evening.  It was NOT anything I will expect to see again. Lights on planes blink. One can hear planes traveling overhead, and not ju! st when they appear to be at their furthest distance from you of the entire sighting. Planes (especially planes with no airports around) are not seen with one solid Bright orange light, void of any other lights.  And planes do not stop, and with very little appearence of turning, change direction. This was very personal. If I am the only person to call THIS light a complete, and utterly unexplainable annomily, so be it.  This was a DEFINING event for me. One that I suspect I will remember every detail of, while renting this body.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,43.268,-72.9916

I live in Poinciana, FL and I believe that the direction would be to my SW, but I'm not sure. What I do know is that there were 3 orb things with a glowing look to them.  They almost formed a triangular pattern, with the top one standing still in the air, the bottom left one was moving at a fast pace to the left, and the bottom right one was moving super slow to the right. First I thought it was a shooting start, but it freaked me out because my neighbors dogs were going crazy barking and going nuts.  We have woods across the street from me, so the one on the left zoomed out of view rather quickly, but I kept following the one moving to the right. It was going in a straight line slowly but it had a smoketail kind of like a jet would have.  That wasn't my concern, it was the one that wasn't moving at all. It was just hanging in the sky.  Then I went and got my phone and started to record it and @ 6:04 pm I shot a 35 second video of the hovering orbish thing taking off and going straight up into the sky and then it shot up over my house and head at a phenomenal rate. Again, I'm not sure of the direction but it was headed towards Orlando way, which I think is NE of me.  I literally had to record with my body in an almost backbend stance because of how fast it went and I was trying to keep up with it by following the jetstream clouds it was leaving. It ended up looking like a rainbow shaped curve before it just went horizontal off in the distance. I showed the video to my husband who thought I was crazy, but he is convinced now too.  He says there is no way a pilot could withstand the G-force or even fly that fast.  These objects were small in comparison to the occasional plane or jet we have flying around here, which makes me believe they were at a very high elevation. My video is not very clear but you can see the quickness and hear the dogs barking.  I can send it to anyone who is interested in looking at it or dissecting it.  It wasn't shot on a fantastic phone and it was zoomed in as much as I could but it's available for review. I found this website looking for similar activities just to validate that I'm not losing my mind because I've been noticing a lot of strange things going on in the sky and I've kind of been paranoid about the whole 2012 thing.  When I saw the Orlando pilot reporting similar activity within minutes of my video, I had to post this because it is no coincidence for me. Also, there are no Army, Navy, AF bases that I know of around here; only the Orlando airport on one side of me and a very very small airport in Winter Haven on the other side of me and there was no sound.  Also, it was still daylight during this time, the sun was setting but sky was visible.  My sister was also on the couch looking out the front door and saw the shooting star looking one too.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,,

After doing some rounds I parked my patrol vehicle on a small street facing South-East at 11:10pm.  I was looking down at my I-pod when I heard rain drops hitting the roof of the car.  I look up and see it, doing a double take thinking in that first split second it was a jumbo jet or something because of the immense size of this thing.  Then as I looked more it become clear it was not a plane. The object was U-shaped like a horse-shoe with 6 or 7 gold lights along the bottom edge.  It was, or at least it appeared to be, about a quarter mile away and only a few hundred feet off the ground.  Making no sound at all, moving at a steady slow pace, it flew from SSE to NNW.  It seemed to be following the cloud cover from the rain storm.  I saw it for only about 10 seconds until it just vanished before my eyes.   The last few seconds I saw it I was outside of the car so I know it wasn’t light reflections of something on the wind-shield of the car.  I immediately got back in the car and drove NNW trying to follow its path to see it again.  I got as far as I could without crash into the damn Gulf-of-Mexico, having never seen it again.  I’m hating myself for not even thinking about taking a picture the entire time I observed it, I didn’t want to take my eyes off it. I went back to see if I could find anyone else that may have seen it but could not see anyone out and about.  The rain was a huge factor considering how many people would stand outside in the rain looking up at the sky, not many.  I thought for a minute about calling the sheriffs office but didn’t even know what the hell I would say to them.  Not to mention I could lose my job over this, but at this point I don’t care.

Two of us were pilots with around 100 hours, and one other person who was not a pilot.  As we took off and turned towards the proper heading we notice three bright lights off the left wing south of the airport.  At first glance we thought it was a large jet then we noticed there were not any position lights, beacon, etc., and the craft was entirely too low to be a craft of that size. As we paid more attention we noticed there appeared to be three different craft in a tight formation.   This gave us the last clue that these craft were probably not anything we’ve ever seen before.  Flying in a tight formation at night is dangerous, and keeping it that consistent would be nearly impossible. We were climbing out of three thousand feet and I would estimate the three UFOs were at one thousand feet above the ground.    As we looked down on the three craft they seemed to cycle positions in the formation, cut hard to the left, and took off over the city.

I travel north toward home, on this stretch of Highway 3 here in League City. In the distance about 2 miles head on, a pair of bright white lights positioned side-by-side in the sky catch my eye. The spacing between led me to believe they are mounted on each wing of an aircraft. My first thought was, knowing there aren’t any airports near, that someone hijacked a commercial airplane. The lights looked like something you would expect from such aircraft, and it’s altitude was low enough as to land within moments on the stretch of highway. As I head its direction, it doesn’t seem to get closer, or farther from me. However the lights shift west, left of me from now not over the road. Myself, trying to make sense of this, I am thinking these lights were merely lighted beacons to signal airplanes; for what seemed to be twenty seconds they remained stationary. Having realized, I did not notice the pair of lights during the last four days I traveled this bit of road, they shifted back over the highway; then seem to be consumed by cloud cover. By this time myself and three other vehicles reduced speed to about fifteen miles per hour to more closely investigate what it is we are seeing. The strange pair of lights emerge but now on the right side off the road. What seemed to take 5 seconds, they maneuver into a top and bottom position then side-by-side once again before disappearing for good. If you can imagine a plane performing a slow barrel roll and remain upside down, puzzling as it may, I am certain this was not normal aircraft; but that of out of this world.

My first reaction was that it was a commercial plane flying low about 2 miles directly infront of me. It slowly shifted to.  My left hand side, so I then thought that it was the angle I was driving and it was really a light pole for airplanes because it was stationary for about 20 seconds. It then started shifting back cross the road way and disappeared behind some clouds. By then me and other cars we slowing down to see what it was. When it reappeared it was on the right hand side. Then lights then started to move slowly, one above the other then side by side light the craft flipped upside down then the lights disappeared and it was gone.

Shasta, CA in an area not accessible to humans or animals in symmetrical lines. My boyfriend and I were driving back to our house in Mt. Shasta, CA 96067 from Weed, CA at about 9:00PM on 08/03/11 when we got to Truck Village Drive (our exit south bound on I5) and noticed bright lights on the mountain Black Butte (a pilot cone that is almost straight up and down).  We stopped the car and got out to look and realized that the lights were not coming from anything we could explain, and it was nowhere near the trail that goes up the mountain.  It was about 300 yards up from the base of the mountain in a rock valley (lava rock) that is not accessible to humans, or animals.   The lights were in a symmetrical line and very bright, and white, and not moving or flickering.  We raced home (about a 5min drive from the Truck Village Drive exit) and grabbed our binoculars.  We returned to the same spot and the lights were still there.   When viewing through our binoculars we could see that there was a perfectly horizontal line of about 4 lights and directly in the middle going diagonal (the line falling from left to right) were three more lights very clear.  It kind of looked like a cross of some sort.  We stayed there for a long time looking at it through the binoculars and it did not move.  We got home at about 9:45PM and called the local police and sheriff’s department to see if maybe they heard anything about those lights, if there was a lost hiker by chance, etc. but they didn’t know anything about it and acted like we were wasting their time. My boyfriend and I have lived here for 12 years, have hiked that mountain before many times and have never seen anything like it before.  We can’t explain how it got there or what it was, except that it most likely is a UFO. The lights were exactly the same size, brightness and just too symmetrical to be done by anyone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the other witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  He has hiked the area in question, on many occasions, and he is certain that there could not have been any kind of vehicle in the area where the lights were, given that it is a very steep, scree-covered area.

I was driving down the road and I was facing east. I saw 4 strange lights in a weird pattern I decided that something was not right so I knew the road I was on went out into the desert so I went about 5 miles out of town and now there was 8 lights in the sky in different patterns from horizontal lines to rectangles to circles. As soon as I got to the desert there was another car already out there and one soon showed up and then a few minutes later there was 4-5 cars including mine.  Having a truck and it being the desert I went out as far as I could and I go to I would say about 2 miles away.  I was standing lights of and I knew they were not airplanes because they were just sitting there but being so close I also didn’t hear any helicopter noises  I took a bunch of pictures and the last one was when they were in a rectangle and then they started to circle the city it seemed! and then they all started going towards the ground and where most of them flew I knew there was departments so I decided to head out that way and I think I saw one on the ground but as soon as I parked my car a cop seemed to appear out of nowhere and he asked me if I had a problem I responded if I was trespassing and he said I wasn’t and so I started to tell him about the lights and showed him the pictures. He then proceeded to tell me that there are new aircraft that hover and don’t make noise but I haven’t heard of anything like that. I said I should go and he goes good Idea and as I was turning my car around he turned left to go where the lights had seemed to land.  The whole cop thing seemed rather suspicious and it just didn’t feel right I was out in the middle of nowhere and I didn’t even see him coming but take that for what it is worth.  I then went home and looked up the number to call and report I tried calling a couple of times and it was busy and then I started t! o see the lights again this time they were heading south and t! hey were in a horizontal formation I went had gotten gas and that’s when I tried take more pictures and only one came out and it seems really weird. When I was looking at the lights I was able to get through and the person told me to try and get as many people to look and report. I got in my car and started to head south but they just seemed to disappear rather quickly I saw them and then I didn’t see them I tried waiting around but then I had to be somewhere at midnight that is why I am writing the report so late. I will include pics in the email and try and describe them. The lights every time I saw them where just white and they did blink but only sometimes and I didn’t see any other color.,2011-08-07T00:00:00,35.220108796296294,-113.90181018518517

It was not fully dark yet but their light was very strong. They were in the western sky at this point, one above the other, the higher one a bit to the left of the lower one. We concluded they must be planets or something because it was unusual to see such bright stars or lights of any sort in that part of the sky that we'd noticed before. Two hours later we were back outside and they were both still in the exact same location. We invited a third friend with us to look and tell us if he knew anything about planets that were supposed to be in view (turns out that night there were, however, in the south/southeastern sky and near where the moon rose, which we found very quickly later, while the other two lights remained). Anyhow, while watching them, suddenly one of them got extremely bright and then suddenly disappeared. It reappeared once again very strongly about 10 seconds later and then the other one did the same.  We decided that was really odd and decided to keep watching from an upstairs room when we got in. This time the lights continued to take turns suddenly blinking out but we notice they starting doing each for longer and varied periods of time. They also shifted south quite quickly within a 20 minute period @ 21:45 but remained in the same position in relation to each other. Then they stayed in the same part of the sky for possibly 3 more hours (that we know of, but took at least an hour off from watching as it wasn't too spectacular and we were sure there was a rational and common explanation likely). We went back outside later to check on them when a friend was leaving, and the bottom one had grown brighter than ever and the top one was more faint but dimming and lighting up alternately every 3-5 seconds now. Quite rapidly. The other was staying lit solidly. Just when we decided it was sort of creepy and yet sort of availing nothing to keep staring at these lights, trying to figure them out, a third new one, quite bright, appeared high above both, where we had noticed no star or light of any sort before. No other star in the sky was as bright as these either. It did the same thing... Disappearing and reappearing suddenly, each spell lasting 15-30 seconds. It never moved like a plane or any sort of flying vehicle I know of, it hovered there for as long as we watched. We began to feel a little creeped out and went back inside. I checked before going to sleep and by then only the bottom light of the original two remained at first and then finally disappeared completely. I've been trying to figure out what these could be since, and can't seem to come up with anything that fully works. I don't like the idea of unknown objects hovering around my city for hours on end blinking at us lol... I looked for them last night and tonight as well but there was a lot of cloud cover or else they weren't there, seeing as I think they would be bright enough to shine thru some of the thin clouds that moved by at times. ((ADDENDUM FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCE)) Followup to the blinking stars report.... they are planets. Hi. I sent a report in the other day about two 'stars' that were blinking on and off. I did a bit more research and it turns out they do fit the description for Venus and Jupiter right now, as far as where they should be and position in relation to one another, etc. I still don't understand why they were disappearing and reappearing the way they were, and as for the shift to the south....we could have been confused, we were walking outside on a few different occasions during the course of the night. I don't know what the third blinking object was. But if two planets can do it, than probably another shiny thing in the sky can do it for a simple reason as well. But the first/main two that we noticed at sundown had the right timing and position, and everything. It is unlikely they were anything else but the two planets that are showing off this month :)  I would prefer my report was not posted or made available, if possible. I just feel silly.  If you have any idea why these planets could ""blink"" on and off the way they were, I would love to know. I'm not having much luck with google...haha Maybe tiny clouds are enough to cause the effect. Maybe atmospheric phenomena...of some sort... However, whatever the case, I'm about 99.9% sure they were Venus and Jupiter. If you have the time to write, and any ideas why they could blink out like that, I'd be interested to hear just out of curiosity, but if you guys are busy don't worry about it. I will leave my email this time just in case. :)  I have had two sightings of very strange flying objects in the past,  while living further north-west, but haven't seen anything for a long time. Now I'm around different people, some who have heard my stories, but aren't particularly interested in considering them possible lol.... maybe I got overexcited and was hoping I could say ""see, there IS weird stuff going on up there! and YOU saw it this time"" lol.... Needless to say, it was my idea to report, not my friends'. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))",2012-03-13T00:00:00,44.571045454545455,-80.94812727272728

If you consider straight up as 90 degrees, then the light was traveling at about 70 degrees south to north.  I was standing near the corner of Washington Street and Front Street here in San Diego.  Front Street runs north and south, so I knew the direction the light traveled. I did not have my watch with me to get the exact time, but the sighting was between 10:05 and 10:10 pm, Thursday October 6. It had rained earlier in the day; so there were patches of clear sky and low patches of rain clouds.   The light was not seen further north because the clouds blocked the view further north. This area has a lot of jet traffic for the San Diego airport.  This light was traveling at least 5 times faster than any jets in this area.

I was on the telephone (connected to my car speakers) with my friend. While I was sitting in my driveway for an elapsed time of about 20 minutes talking to my friend, I noticed a dark large object very low in the sky that had caught my attention from my peripheral vision. I could not believe my eyes. I was staring at this bronze flying object gliding extremely low in the sky with colorful flashing lights.  It was an oval shape, a dark bronze color with very large square windows that had red, yellow, and blue (and/or green) lights that flashed in a circular motion throughout the craft (at very fast speeds the lights were flashing around). I was shocked and while still connected to my friend on the telephone, I explained what I was witnessing and said ""I cannot believe what I see! I am witnessing a UFO fly over me right now"".  Of course, mos! t people's responses are ""Yea, right"" and that's exactly what my friend said. I opened up my car window and stuck practically my entire body out the window while I followed this object and did not take my eyes off of it.  It was gliding effortlessly throughout the sky, as it floated on by me with no noise coming from it. While it increased in height, there was an airplane within within what I presume as 150-300 feet moving in the opposite direction.  I watched as this airplane came so close to this object that I was fearful the airplane was going to collide with this object. Comparing the airplane to the craft, the craft appeared to be much larger to scale than the plane. This flying object had no wings, was a deep bronze color, and had brilliant colorful lights radiating from the 360 degree windows on the craft. As the plane flew past this craft, I continued to watch the craft get smaller and smaller as it flew further, and higher into the sky. I tried photographing what I w! as witnessing with my BlackBerry, but unfortunately could not ! get the camera to focus on what I was witnessing. As I watched, still with my head out my car window, the craft continued to float further and further away, and simply vanished into thin air. There was no clouds from what I saw in the sky, so unless it went into a fog, this thing literally vanished from my eyesight. I am 100% certain what I witnessed was a UFO.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,40.57773258278146,-74.14641801324503

There was regular commuter air traffic at high altitude from west to east, just south of our position.  Lower in the sky to our south, but slightly west of our position, we observed a ball of orange light moving in the sky that was peculiar in several respects: first, unlike an aircraft, it exhibited no strobe or other marker lights.  Second, in its undeviating travel, it was moving due north; as it passed us, it made absolutely no sound--we had been able to hear the faint whine of jet engines at an apparently much higher altitude, but this object made no sound at all.  I was hoping to hear something-the buzz of a propeller that would explain what we were observing-any sound at all, but there was none.  Finally, the apparent size, shape and luminous output of the obje! ct remained constant as it crossed the sky from horizon to horizon. The object appeared to be traveling at approximately the same altitude as many small aircraft we've observed over the years at our location: approximately 4,000 to 5,000 feet MSL.  This object appeared to be moving more quickly than most aircraft in our area, completely transiting the sky in about a minute. The object appeared to be an orange sphere (deep orange-red at the perimeter, a similar color to an NBA basketball at the center, where the glow was brightest).  Its luminosity was similar to an aircraft landing headlight, but this glow did not change during the entirety of its transit, neither to diminish nor to increase as it passed.  This indicates one of two things: a luminous sphere (which is what it appeared to be); or an orange-colored landing light aimed directly at us during the due-north travel of the object (obviously improbable). The object appeared to be similar in size to the cabin of a small aircraft, such as a Cessna 182, though the transit appeared to be faster than a typical propeller-driven aircraft; .  The object appeared to pass within a half mile or so to our west at the indicated altitude, at about 30 degrees declination from zenith.  Again, per GPS it was moving due north (not magnetic).",2011-10-10T00:00:00,42.5747,-88.3946

It looked to me like an electrical discharge of some kind. I then looked around the sky to see if there where any other stars or lights from aircraft. Looking directly up, I saw what appeared to me as the twin of the object to my west. The object had radiating spikes of light like a corona, but the “spikes of light” did not move. I called my friend and ask her if see could see anything in the night sky that seemed strange. She saw the same thing I was witnessing, so I went to get an old SLR with a telephoto lens and a doubler to see if we could make out any more detail. With magnification, the object seemed to have a rectangle in the center of a circle with smaller rectangles on each side of the larger rectangle in the middle. I didn’t get any pictures as the old camera with the long lenses had no film in it. After watching these objects for about 15 minutes, I went next door to see if my neighbor had seen them,or take him outside to see if he saw what we saw. He said he saw the same objects the night sky the night before in the same spots in the sky. From my best guess these objects must have been very large. The time right now is 1915 hours, 12-15-2012,and the object that was in the west is gone, and the object directly overhead has moved a few degrees closer toward to west and very visible even through an overcast sky.

This object appeared as I have seen what may be meteors, ""falling stars"" or other objects appear to fall and strike the earth's atmosphere and ""glance"" into an arc thru the atmosphere and disappear.  The difference here is the size of the object appeared to be large, or perhaps closer. Something that had stood out to me was the ultra bright green fiery color of the object.

Then a flash of light occurred between the two objects and the one on the right coming from the southwest disappeared! and the one from the northeast continued it's southwestern flight until it disappeared some time later.  We were shocked and amazed and to this day this has remained an unforgettable experience. I found this on your web page and was very happy to find out that some one besides me had seen this happen.  I was playing out side one night with the kids next door when their Father called us all over to him to show us something going on in the Eastern Sky. Two Star looking objects very high in the night sky moving slowly.   There was three adults and maybe eight kids. The adults was out side on blankets to get out of the hot house. My Parents was out side on the porch but was not ready to watch UFO’s in the Sky, but I was and I laid down and watched for maybe 30minutes before I had to go to bed. I was Nine years old and been to all the shows about monsters and space ships. As we watched  these two objects we saw something smaller than the other two move from below one and go to the other, as this was happing one of the Grand Parents that was out side with us said that this was the second time they saw this smaller obect move from one to the other. I have no Idea what we saw but we did see it happen. Its good to know someone else saw it to.   THANKS ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Diamond shaped UFO blocks USAF runway,Helena,MT,,diamond,1 hour,"Occurred : 1/1/1963 22:00  (Entered as : 01/01/1963 22:00) Reported: 2/9/2012 4:08:47 PM 16:08 Posted: 2/10/2012 Location: Helena (near), MT Shape: Diamond Duration:1 hour",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87117.html,"Diamond Shaped UFO Blocks USAF Runway  This is a second hand story. My brother, who still wishes to remain anonymous, was a USAF sergeant and air traffic controller of the Strategic Air Command from approximately 1958-1963 when this event occurred. I do not know what time of the year it was but suspect December 1962-February 1963. He worked in the tower at night at a very busy SAC Air Base during the height of the Cold War.  I believe that the base may have been Maelstrom as he lived with his family in Helena, Montana, and may have been home to a fighter wing, MATS wing and perhaps a refueling wing.  I think that their primary SAC aircraft were B52's. In a moment when we were alone in 1986, upon my questioning about UFO's and his time in the USAF, he related this story:   He said that at night while awaiting the return of a flight of nuclear-armed (They always were then) SAC bombers a diamond-shaped group of flashing colored lights, semi-solid, settled into a hover just some feet off of the threshold of the primary landing runway as a squadron of returning bombers approached making landings impossible.   While the bombers were rerouted, the security force ""surrounded"" the object with their armored vehicles and men, training their weapons on it but maintaining hold-fire discipline.  He described the object as ""big as a house"".  I do not recall the length of the event but believe it was an hour or more.  Apparently the Air Police could not stop spectators from appearing from all corners of the base.  The base was completely off-line and all work halted except of course by the Security Force.   My brother was privy to all internal radio communication from his position in the tower.   After the object departed (I do not recall his description of that if he gave it.), their aircraft were called back from their havens and the base made an attempt to achieve normalcy.  Evidently they had difficulty in this, as within a few days my brother, a sergeant with a good record,  was dismissed from the highly regarded Strategic Air Command and given only days to pack up his family and leave for his new assignment with Training Command (He taught an entire generation of USAF and Army air controllers.), where his career languished for ten years.   His only ""crime"" seems to have been being a witness to this event.  He said that many others received the same treatment and that he never saw anyone from that base again and believed that was the USAF's intention.   He further stated that his marriage broke up as a result of this transfer and some further USAF harassment that he did not specify.  He felt that to some degree, perhaps intentionally, the Air Force intentionally encouraged the dissolution of his marriage. He returned to the active Air Force ten years later, still a controller this time in the Tactical Air Command and finished his 30 year career as a Master Sergeant.  He then worked perhaps fifteen years as a contract controller at the NASA base (Elington Field or Elington AFB) in Houston.  He is clearly a quality witness to this event and is highly regarded in his field as demonstrated by both his USAF career and length of time employed at Elington Field (NASA) and though now fully retired he will not discuss this matter further.

At first I thought it may be a helicopter, as it appeared to be “hovering”.  I then saw a second, similar light to the left (SW) of it at a lower altitude.  Having no point of reference, I could not estimate the distance, but guess at least several hundred yards up to a mile.  They each then began to display an “on-off” flashing yellow-white light in addition to the pulsating, changing color lights and they began very quick, erratic, “hummingbird-like”, “dancing” movements, up, down, left, right over great distance.  I was once a high speed  morse code operator and could not distinguish any intelligible “code” from the flashing lights, although they did appear to be in deliberate! pattern/sequence, not random. The flashing light of the second object appeared to respond to the first. A few minutes after first observing the lights/objects, a small, single engine propeller aircraft approached from west to east  (common route to/from Chesapeake Municipal & Norfolk International airports).  The plane was at about 1500 feet altitude. As the plane approached, the two lights/objects quickly dropped from view below the treeline several hundred yards to my west. After the plane had passed overhead and to the east, the two lights/objects quickly reappeared and continued their “dance” for a few more minutes before disappearing. It was a clear evening, shortly after sunset with only several high altitude jet aircraft vapor trails visible in the night sky. A partial moon was in view to the northwest. Other than the bright lights, where the yellow-white flashing lights were to the immediate left of the multi-colored, pulsating “halogen-like” ones, I could not discern any form or shape of the objects from which they emanated. There was absolutely no sound coming from them that I could hear. They were like nothing I’d ever seen.  Surely they were not from conventional aircraft, fixed wing or rotary, and they were definitely not weather balloons or “natural phenomena”.  I thought possibly kids with REALLY sophisticated radio-controlled devices? Maybe, but I really don’t think so. In any case, I’ve never reported anything like this before, and seeing them is what caused me to search the internet for similar sightings, which brought me to this web site.

I initially thought it could have been a balloon tied to the ground bobbing in the wind with a light attached, but as it started moving far from the original spot, towards the horizon and back, far out of the range of a balloon string, I ruled that out. I captured about 5 minutes of footage with my phone.  It conveys the silence and the movement, but falls short on conveying the intense color of the light.  I started filming about a minute or 2 after i spotted it and the video ends about 8 minutes before I lost visual. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpyArOlPiw&list=UU-ViVnRJYEqpn9TCGjTNIA&index=1&feature=plcp",2012-02-03T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I rolled down the window and slowed to nearly a stop to look and listen. It/they were completely silent, triangular shaped, and 40 feet in length from lights at the points. Lights were orange in color. What is strange is the fact that just moments before on the North side of 265, just past 65 in Clark County I had seen an extremely bright, white light near the trailer park approximately the size of an Olympic swimming pool (but round in shape) that came from nowhere, lasted maybe three seconds and went out like a switch was flipped. I pulled over at the Charlestown Road exit to get a look and the hovering object(s) had vanished. I know at least four other cars in front of me saw it too, they slowed down and I could even see a passenger in one car point at it as if to ask, ""Do you see that too?""

Date: December, 4, 2011  Location: Seaton, Devon, England, United Kingdom  Summary: Strange light, orange - red in colour. Mainly just above Orion's belt but moving constantly with erratic movements. Somewhat similar to a Chinese lantern however I've set lanterns off. I watched this light for a length of time, any Chinese lantern would of burnt out long before. Nothing like a satellite or meteorite I've ever seen before. Sighting Time: 02.10am Day/Night: Night time No. of Witnesses: 2 Duration: 30 minutes minimum  Appearance / Description of Object(s):  Definitely orangey-red in colour. Size I couldn't even guess nor the shape except it definitely didn't look spherical. Sorry I can't be more precise. The brightness varied. It kept fading and brightening up again. At one point it became quite bright before fading again, that's when I saw some kind of non spherical shape. Size of Object(s):  Afraid I couldn't even hazard a guess. Estimating sizes I just can't do. Description of Area / Surroundings:  I live right on the South coast of England. A little town called Seaton. Very small town, very very little light pollution and to my knowledge no military bases in the surrounding area nor power plants. No weather or research stations. Just a quiet little seaside fishing areas. Full Description & Details:  So I was having a smoke from my balcony and saw this. As I said. It was most definitely an Orange-Red colour, very bright and clear. I first noticed it just above Orion's belt and to the left. At first I thought it was simply something you could see at this time of year, a planet maybe or a bright star of note. I thought I was seeing things at first, but after watching for some time it was definitely moving. It's movement was erratic, there seemed to be no pattern as such except a vague circular motion as it travelled right towards Orion's belt. It stayed there for sometime, flitting up, down, left and right in no particular order. The whole time it was getting brighter as if moving closer or becoming more intense and then fading again until it disappeared. This is when I thought it was a Chinese lantern. Just as I was about to head back in after finishing my smoke, it suddenly appeared again, this time lower down and back left of Orion's belt. It made the same vague circula! r movement before fading and appearing back above Orion's belt. I ran to get my phone, but, unfortunately the video cam on it wasn't good enough to get any footage. I ran in, checked the internet. Several things are visible in our skies around this time of year but none of them correlate to what I was seeing and definitely nothing matching the movement. So I went back to the balcony to watch. It was still above Orion's belt, flitting about in all directions still. It didn't seem to stay in one place statically. It wasn't moving particular fast, but definitely enough to notice it was never static. While I was watching this second time it almost looked as if it was coming closer. For a brief couple of second whatever it was looked like it turned and I could clearly see some kind of shape. It wasn't just a spherical item, it definitely had shape. What shape exactly I can't be sure of. I went back in to contact a couple of friends to see if they could see it as well. Unfortunately just as I'd sent the message our skies became overcast and clouds prevented me from seeing anything. This has happened literally within the hour. I was watching it for a good 20 minutes - half an hour before trying to see if anyone else could see it. Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object?  I can't be 100% sure obviously. But I have checked charts online and various websites. I can't find anything that could explain something of this colour, distance or location for this time of the year. It didn't resemble a meteorite or satellite in any way I've seen before and a Chinese lantern would of burnt out within the time I was watching.

It was just after sundown and my brother and I were smoking by the poolhouse in our backyard which we have a very clear and brief veiw of the sky from.Just for plot and setting of this sighting I live right next to the only airport in portland and i know planes and military and helicopters, jets etc. I noticed my stepfather staring in the sky and i had a very weird feeling in my gut that just hit me when i saw my stepfater. I asked him what he was doing and he stated that he heard on the radio that a man has spotted several strange lights and activity goin on and that he saw something strange a night before and that he has a weird feeling which was similiar to mine. First we saw a strange and solid, small but fast object with no light and it circled the region of the sky and disappeared. Two more objects just like the first object came from the same direction and in my own perspective they (floated) but flew the same direction and vanished as well. As my stepfather and brother were trying to make out what they were or are which in their words were (drone) like objects, I spotted a flash in the corner of my left eye and a star like object with a bright light not blinking came from the direction the (drones) were last seen and the star object was moving rapidly in a curve like direction going south and cleared the sky from were it was spotted to the southside in a matter of seconds and then and i pointed it out to my stepfather saying""hey what is that look it is moving so fast what is it"". The light made the object look like a star but no star can move so fast and out of place.It was so far but so close that we should have heard a sound like planes make or jets but it was dead silent. A flash of light came from the star like object and it vanished in the opposite direction from the (drones). As we were baffled at what we just saw and somewhat speechless, the (drone) objects came back from the direction they left and were moving not as fast but rapidly towards the direction of the star like object but the star was nowhere to be seen again. I waited for 30 mins to try and see something again but nomore activity came besides the normal of living next to the airport. I believe in ufos and aliens or beings or what have you but i would never think of seeing something as strange as i saw and having the feeling that my stepfather and i felt when it happened. I watch alot of history and tv and am a huge fan of ancient aliens and shows of that sort but really just the theory of existence in our galaxy but i think the hoaxes and fake reports are stupid because i thought i would never live to see something unusual but i have and i know for a fact that it was real and was getting away from whatever was chasing it and succeeded substentaly. It was the fastest thing i have ever seen in the sky and i know planes and military jets planes etc. The star object was not from this world and i have strange feeling something is happening or is goin to happen soon i don""t know what or when but i hope someone listens to me because there is too much activity going on in my city. I have lived in the same city for twenty two years and have never seen anything like what i say and i am trying to peice together what was going on or happened and what i saw but i know 100% that it was a ufo sighting. I may not have photo or video evidence but i know what i saw was real and i would never lie about these things because it is very important to me im a fan not a player. THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BE WITH US.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,45.49032888888889,-122.40389111111111

I just happened to be looking for the Moon which I observed south (nearly 180 true) when I observed two objects approximately 3 degrees east of the Moon and the same south.  They were moving at about a course of (nearly 15 true).  The first seemed to be moving ahead a little faster and opening the distance between them that I adjudged to be several degrees at first. They appeared to have some color in the setting sun.  I watched them as they continued to separate a little and then slowly veer to the east to a heading between 15 true and maybe 45 true.  As they now moved away from me the appeared closer together, that is less separation. Shortly another object appeared from the same location, so I went to get binoculars.  With the binoculars I could not resolve anything but a ball like object.  That is no wings.  The third object had bright red markings and some black. The fourth object appeared out of the same location and followed the same path except these seemed not to veer off to the east as much.  The forth object was a brilliant green, and could only be resolved to be round.  The fifth object seemed to be as the first three bright red with some markings. Since I had only a 45 degree field of view, blocked by a tree, my estimates of speed and altitudes are just that, estimates.  Speed I adjudge to be greater that mach 1.  I first thought greater that 500 nm.  Altitude I adjudge to have been greater than 50,000 ft. There was no sonic boom.  There was no sound of propulsion system.

Wednesday March 7th.  My 3 year old couldn’t sleep, I was showing him what the Statue of Liberty was.  We were looking at Presidential Dollars and he asked if the picture on the reverse was god, I said no, and tried to explain what it was.  Then it hit me I could show him a picture. After a couple links I stumbled on http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_torch I found it amazing that you can view NY through a live feed from Liberty’s Torch. After I started panning around at aprox 11:15 pm I noticed a floating light above the city.  I had caught it while it was on the left hand side of the panoramic view.  The light was white, solid & rectangular the length of the light iliminated any possibility of an air craft.  I’ve never seen anything in that shape so clear and uniform. I had to capture what I was seeing and remembered that I downloaded a plugin where you can capture screen shots.  I’d yet to use it but thought this would be the perfect time. My first attempt at taking the screen capture got screwed up from lack of use.  And bye the time I made it back to the web site and back to the live feed looking out the torch into NY.  The light had moved a considerable distance, and now was three ¼’s across the panoramic screen and much further away.  Now its 11:20pm but this time I was able to capture the light with a screen capture.   You can still make out the odd shape of the light and still have a pretty good view ! when zooming in. But the next thing I saw is really amazing! When looking directly at the Statue of Liberty in full frontal view.  A long object can easily be seen with multiple color lights just off the right side of Lady Liberty and extending all the way out of the shot.  The placement of the object can’t be horizon lights or anything like that.  And I just checked the live cameras during the day to double check, and nothing is visible.  And the great thing is I was able to take two pictures of the object. If I was to guess what I was looking at I’d say it was a large oval but flattened shaped fly saucer and I was seeing the side that  was closest to me, and when you zoom in on the picture it does appear to confirm these thoughts.  I’ve got multiple pictures that allow you to zoom in and can send them to whom ever, I hope they come out right when I post this.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I was there for a marching band competition, and I was facing east, and the object was heading to my left. My friend which was standing next to me also saw the object.  I saw the object for maybe 2-4 minutes, and the time was between 8pm-8:30pm.   The craft seemed large, and it was maybe a mile or so from where i was. I only saw the lights of the craft, I never saw any body to it.  The lights on the craft, which were white and there was two lights which did not change color.  The lights were close to each other, and appeared to be just a straight line. It was about maybe at a 40-45 degree angle from where I was standing. The reason I was watching this was because it was moving pretty slow, slower than a man made aircraft, and the lights were not blinking like planes, helicopters, etc usually have.  The lights also seemed like they were flickering a little ! at times but neither light was ever turned off.  It traveled east and it stopped after slowing down slightly, then stayed in the same spot maybe 3-5 seconds, then the lights became a little brighter.   After that without turning around it went the way from which it came, and now i could see a third white non-blinking light which was the same size and color as the other two. These three lights made a triangular shape. After starting back from the way it came, the craft was going maybe two to three times it's original speed. My view was blocked by a tree in the distance, about a minute after it starting going back from the way it came.  Then after that my view was blocked because of buildings and trees etc in the distance. I do not know if there were any noises or anything because there were bands practicing around us, and lots of people talking. I did not see it again after that for the rest of the night. P.S.

It was hovering but appeared to drift a bit to the south.  No sound was heard, too bright to be an airplane or helicopter, 3 bright white lights in irregular triangle formation.   A vehicle approached from my rear and I had to proceed as it is fairly narrow road and there was nowhere to pull over.  My first thought was ""ISS"" and then ""blimp"" but no structure could be discerned.  Sky was still mostly dark - I cannot begin to say what it was.   As I pulled onto the entrance ramp for Langford Frwy (166), I glanced back and saw 3 dim white lights moving at speed overhead to the east - I can only assume it was the same object as I had not noticed any other air traffic in the area.    Object  initially was approx. 35 degrees above horizon, maybe half mile away, maybe 1500 feet altitude or more.  Lights werre not spaced uniformly.  Diddn't appear to be any more than 10 feet across, if that much.

The resolution and viewing size of the images is small, so didn't really notice all of the details untill later when I enlarged the photos.  Then I began to notice that in two of the photos that there was a disc that was coming out from the cloud.  The photos were taken moments apart and you can see that there was some motion, but not much and that the craft was hovering. The other thing that I thought was strange was that there were faces in the clouds and that there were in some of them a bright spot (possibly another craft) where the eyes are. The images were taken directly off of my phone, and were not retouched or manipulated in any way.  Thought they were worth sending along to you.  Found it really amazing that in some of the shoots it looks like the head of a grey and the craft is poking out of the clouds.

My children and I like to star gaze often.  We star gaze mostly on Friday's because they are in elementary school.  We were star gazing from 8:00 to 11:55 pm at my husband's employers parking lot.   At 9:03 pm eastern central time over Prentis and Collins, Mississippi USA we were looking at what appeared to be a star enter the atmosphere at high speed. As it entered the atmosphere it left no signs that a flying plane would (the trail left behind by a jet) or flashing lights on it like a plane would at night and not like a meteor or meteoriod. I noticed it first and told my children to look. Then it changed directions and started flying in our direction slowly. It took about 20 minutes to reach us, stopped less than 20 feet away from the car and about 150 feet in the air.  It just hovered there for about three minutes and we stood there in shock looking at it.  Then I told my children to get in the car right now and lock the doors. Thank God they both did as I said. I stayed outside the car to watch it because it was amazing looking. I had never seen anything like it and I wanted to see where it was going to go.  After about three to four more minutes it continues to hover in the North North-East direction slowly.  The UFO went right over me and my children that were still watching from inside the car.  The UFO flew for about 4! 0 miles away headed East and than took off at high speed again.  I couldn't keep up with where it was and lost it.  I looked for it and didn't see it anywhere.  Than got back in the car and locked us in. At 12:16 am Eastern Central Time I was driving my husband to take a night deposit to the bank. I had this feeling like I was being watch again so I looked over in the direction the UFO went.  The UFO was there but the shape was different.  It was twice the size of a distant star and brighter than one (like the blinding light above a operating table).  It was the same color as before ( I am not sure if it was the same UFO because the shape changed.  I don't even know if UFO's can change there shape?). It scared me more when it followed us all the way to the bank than home at about 150 feet away and 300 feet in the air.  At 12:49 am we got home.  As we got out of the car I looked up to see were the UFO was and if it was still following us. It was still there traveling west in the direction we are (the UFO was following us North on the right hand side of the car on the way home).  I grabbed my children out of the car, went inside, locked the doors and all the windows when we were all in (i don't know if that will help if something tries to get in but it eases my mind a little so does my 9mm.  I keep it with me at all times, makes me feel safe).  At 12:56 am (the last time I looked at it) I opened the door to see if the UFO was still there it was heading this way (west) slowly.  The UFO was about 100 miles in the air and 15 miles from us. Description -UFO 1st sighting Aug.12, 2011  The UFO appeared to be only made up of white light the kind thats almost to painful to look at but it wasnt painful to look at( just a comparison). It was a long fat cigar shape.  As it got closer and hovered less than 20 feet away from us, it formed some rays ( like you would see if a child drew the sun) of light coming from what appeared to be the left and right sides that looked like wings for (lack of a better word) but they didn't move at all though. The color of the wings were blueish white. As it started to fly again the wings of light faded. Than it looked cigar shaped again and took off. Description-UFO sighting 2ND & 3RD Aug. 13, 2011  When I seen the UFO while I was driving to the bank than home, it looked bigger than it did when it was closer to us. It appeared to be a  round white light same as before but it was father away and moving fast than slowed down almost to a stop. I couldn't tell if it had wings like the last time because it was to far away. The color was a very bright white (lighting up part of the sky around it). As the UFO was following us home it looked the same as the second time but was farther away than it was to us when we left the bank. It moved slower than the other times. It did at one point disaper when I seen the UFO again it was moving faster tordes us (so I went back inside and locked the door) and got bigger as it came closer to us (about the size of two school bus's  I really hope you don't think this is some kind of a prank and not report it. It's bad enough my husband think that me and our kids are crazy and seeing **** (his exact words). We don't have any mental illness that runs on either side of our family's. The only reason I am reporting this sighting is one: because it scared the **** out of me and my children so bad that they wanted to sleep in my husband's and my room. (they never ask to sleep with us not even when they get sick!) Two: My children fell asleep 40 minutes ago (at 2:39am) and woke up twice already. Three: I am not going to be able to sleep at all now that I am worried about us. It's been almost over two hours ago since the last time I seen it (and I hope I never see it again). This is not a joke and I really hope you report it. I promised my children I would tell someone ( my kids wanted me to shot the thing. Maybe I should have but I don't know if I would have done any  good anyway. It might have just pissed it o! ff and I can't fire a fire arm in city limits near a neighborhood).

I called my kids outside to see the light and they witnessed it too.  They ran and got the binoculars and we could clearly see it was an orangish colored light.  It then moved North and disappeared. I called the coastguard to see if they were crazy enough to have any rescue helicopters out and they confirmed the winds were too strong and did not have any flying in the area.

I was staying at a cabin, far from any towns, on the northwest side of a quiet lake, near the far end, with several other people.  It’s a very quiet, private location near in upstate, NY, almost to Canada, near Alexandria Bay and the Thousand Islands.   It was a clear night, and I had my telescope out to view the moon. Jupiter rose and it was beautiful through the telescope with 3 moons clearly visible.  It rose higher and I left off looking for a while. Later, around 1AM, I went outside alone and noticed what appeared to be a large reddish-orange fireball just past the opposite shore of the lake, barely above the treeline.  It was about the size of a fingernail at arm's length.   I watched for a few minutes, then ran inside to get my boyfriend, his kids, and my son, but the fireball was gone. Later around 2 AM, it appeared again, this time I got everyone right away and everyone saw them.  The first moved slightly and then there were 3 fireballs.  One slightly higher than the tree line. The fireballs stayed there for about 15 min. this time.  They looked to be actual fire, like burning spheres.  At first I thought there must be a factory there or something others locally knew about.  But it was odd because the night was silent and clear and the fireballs were completely silent.  The lake amplifies every sound so much that if a person were to talk on the other side of the lake, you could hear him or her clearly.   We occasionally hear coyotes howl in packs up there.  It’s very wild and out in “the middle of nowhere.”    My son, who was 20 years old at the time, would like me to report that what he saw appeared ""light and dark orange"" and  ""pearlescent"" in color.  He said it appeared to be swirling in itself, and he saw it as “above the mountains on the horizon.”   That is all that happened, and when I saw the person whose family owns the cabin, I asked about the fireballs, and he had no idea what I was talking about.  Further inquiry revealed no one else who knew anything about the fireballs or had seen them.  Also, I discovered that there is nothing but rocks, woods, and hills in that direction on the other side of the lake. Also, it is notable that I experienced this sighting and called these objects “fireballs” before I knew there were any other similar sightings around the country and the world.",2012-02-10T00:00:00,,

We were out on a private beach in Kittery point waiting for another friend of ours to get home.  It was getting kind of boring, and I was just watching the sky.  At one point I noticed a really slow-moving plane type thing flying away in the distance.  I said something to my friends and pointed up at the craft, and as soon as I raised my hand in it's direction the object turned on a dime.  It made a very tight turn and flew directly over us.   As it was getting closer, I could see that it was not very high up from the ground.  The other strange thing about it was that the craft was sort of triangular with a big green light in the front.

My wife was driving and said ""Look at That"". I looked up and saw what appeared to be a Triangular shaped craft near by and flying lower than usual. The shape was clearly defined and easy to see. It was triangular in shape, an isosceles triangle the size of a large airliner. It was a grey/blue colour. It was moving very slowly and close enough that I should of heard its engines, but did not hear anything. I doubt it was more than a mile away and less than a thousand feet up. The craft was making a starboard turn and when I saw the rear of the craft there were lights across the rear except near the corners. Each corner had a white light as did the Centre of the triangle. The lights on the bottom of the craft flickered and it changed the appearance quite a bit, although you could definitely see the triangular outline of the craft. The arrangement of the ligh! ts made it appear like an air liner. A few seconds later, the lights flickered again and this time it looked like the lights of several small planes. looking back on thinks, I really should have pulled over and taken things in better.

While driving west on our way home, we noticed 6 very distincitive blinking lights hovering in the sky approx 15 miles away. These lights were blinking from orange to white to green and yellow. One of the lights dropped quite a ways down and then just stopped.  All 6 lights then proceeded to make two large perfectly shaped triangles next to each other and the distance between the lights forming each triangle was approximately 1 mile.  The way these lights moved was very fluid, not moving in the air like any normal aircraft.  The tri angle formed for approx. 30 to 45 seconds and then broke up. The top two lights just disappearing and two others moved to the north.   We drove to our home about 2 minutes away and brough our son and mother in law out to see what we had seen.  We then all got inot our car and drove west about a mile and parked on the side of the road and got out.  Two of the craft were still there and hovering low in the horizon.  Both were blinking the ! same colors as mentioned above.  One of the lights then turned a brilliant white color and appeared to grow slightly in size.  The light the dimmed and started blinking again and both lights headed north.  My wife and I had our cell phones out and tried to photograph and record these lights.  On my video, only two of the lights would show up, although they were all equal in brightness.  My wife took numerous photos with her phone and all turned out black with the exception of one photo.

I went outside to discuss something things with my girlfriend we have a porch that is tall and able to get a clear open view of the skyline over our town as I was talking I noticed a distraction of bright lite to the side of me as turned to look I noticed 25 you glowing orbs that were kind of in unison but also in groups it looked like a fireball at times but then I didn't.  My girlfriend and I were astonished at what we we're seeing and my heart dropped because I felt something serious was happening my first that was asteroids but they were movie to oddly then I realized there were human aircraft all over converging to thees figures within 10 minutes of seeing this I counted 15 human aircraft as the human aircraft moved in thees figures increased in speed and manuverd away almost got higher into the ski they one bye one disappeared in the groups they were in human aircraft has in creased since then I have counted 30 as of now very high to very low in the sky I asked a some! one else to look in the sky and tell me what they noticed and they agreed that there were a were a abnormal amount of aircraft.

They were all flying from The direction of Edewood and were flying towards the direction of Forest Hill.  Flying directly over the center of Bel Air.  It was definately pretty scary!! Not sure what it was but it looked wierd as crap.  It was flying from the direction of the military base here so it could have been from that.

It was very strange.  It was also a very clear night so the light couldn't have been reflecting off the clouds to give the orbed look.  Four days earlier at the same time (9pm) my roomie and husband (I was as! leep) saw the exact same orb and l didn't believe them. Now I do.

About 2 minutes later I look back up and two of those stars are missing and then they reappeared but were floating in the air disappearing and reappearing. five minutes from when I first noticed them I arrived at home and looked back at them and then two disappeared and seconds later I heard two very loud booms and a gust of wind on a non windy day.

I kept watching it and thought maybe it was a satellite or something because it seemed to be on a pretty steady path.   But then it started angling downward....it continued on a downward path for about 20 seconds.  I became really confused about what it could be when it appeared to move sideways and then flickered once and I couldn't see it anymore.  So I just stood there for a while, and I saw another one. I ran inside and woke up my wife and said there was a UFO outside.  She got up quicly and we both ran outside to see it.  I spotted it right away when we got back outside and this is what happened......it continued moving across the sky much like the other one did and it also decended....but not like the other one....it decended at a rate that I don't think could be possible for anything.  On the human body..! .the negative G's would be intense at best.  I have never seen anything drop that fast and neither has my wife. It then literally disappeared before both of our eyes and we actually looked at each other at the sime time and said...""It just disappeared!""   My wife stayed outside with me for about 5 minutes while we continued to scan the sky....she went back inside to have a shower to get ready for work and I stayed out in the driveway.  That's when I saw another one. I ran back inside to get her but she said she couldn't come because she was in the shower.   I ran back outside and couldn't find it again.  After this happened...I did some UFO footage research.  What my wife and I saw is an exact match to what some people are posting.

The temperature was in the low 60’s, the sky was relatively clear, with a patchy, thin layer of haze forming over the beach & town.  The wind was calm.  I had been looking at the sky because I was aware of the possibility of seeing the Northern Lights.   The sun had set & I was walking back towards my house.

He was looking up at the sky & when I looked up I saw an object directly above us in the sky.  It was quite high.  There was a patchy thin layer of haze at approximately 3,000 feet & the object appeared to be much higher than that.  He asked me if I had seen the others & I said no.  I immediately thought it was something other than an aircraft, as I am a pilot & am familiar with the movement of various aircraft.  The object was quite bright with an orange glow.  It reminded me of a fireball.  It moved around almost like it was hovering & then the light began to fade.  It seemed as if it went straight up into the atmosphere.  There was no noise at all coming from the object that could be heard from the ground.  We were both in awe. As we were standing there talking about it, a couple & their son walked up from the beach.  We were still looking up at the sky & they asked us if we had seen anything.  When we said yes, they mentioned they had seen 2 other objects that had been flying in close proximity together.  The man I had been talking with had also seen the other 2.  I did not see them.  They had noticed them approximately 10-15 minutes prior while they were still on the beach watching the sunset.  The woman said she had seen them come up from the north over the Gearhart area at a rather high altitude & they emitted an orange glow.  They watched them head south & up to the same area as the 3rd one, which was directly overhead.  We joked around that they went to the mothership. I have always believed that other life forms existed.  Now I am even more confident in my belief.  It was truly an amazing opportunity.

I first noticed it from the upper left of my front windshield.  It was very bright and white like that of a L.E.D. light but a lot stronger it was about 50-100 feet above us it lit up the road and the car in front of us, then all of a sudden the light was gone and it flew into the canyon, as it was flying off I followed it with my eyes it was the shape of a plate round and for the most part flat. I could only see the shadow of it.  At the same time it had flown off into the canyon the car in front of me sped off really quickly.  My girlfriend at the time saw the light she did not see the object as she states, ""I was too afraid to look at it"" she at first thought it was a bird or a helicopter, I do not believe ! it was a bird or helicopter as it made no noise whatsoever. My stomach dropped and my heart raced as soon as I saw it.  I know it was a UFO I have seen videos and pictures online since I was young and this is what it was.

I have been taking pictures of ‘flashes’ in our night sky for several years, and while at first they were thought to be airplanes, the activity was strange.  The would be eight to ten flashes all over the area and would travel  in every direction in the same area of time. (and each night it was the same time)The rest of the night (anyway when I’d check) there is nothing. There might not be  anything for weeks or months and then maybe once or twice during a month it would be there again .However since last Oct. it has been almost every night (recently the amount may dwindle to a couple a night rather than what has been ). It was the same for Oct. through Dec. the year before, almost every night. The images I get after having to enlarge the tiny image that comes out on the back of the camera are amazing. They sure are NOT airplanes!!! I have hundreds upon hundreds of different things. I have also gained much knowledge from watching them over the months. I’d heard that the atmosphere can cause ‘images’ to be colors but they are really white. NOT true. I have two in the same picture and one is totally colorful while the other is white. On March 9th I captured on ‘still shot’ a whole series of pictures of a moving UFO. What it turned out being  is the same image as I’ve have in many pictures over the months. THIS time I have it ‘moving’ so I now know it has propulsion. I have a Nikon D 300 VR camera with a VR 70-300  Nikkor lens. I have the camera placed on a heavy vibration controlled tripod and use a shutter release cord. I was caught off guard when instead of flashing lights I saw an object careening downward from the East going South and it isn’t ’way up’ in the sky (as the others also haven’t been).  I could see the trail of fast moving ‘air’ behind it and the air rolled around within the trail.  It did not look or stay like a contrail. I could see the image but it was moving so fast I couldn’t make out what it was until I looked back on the camera.  There facing me was an image I recognized from the many pictures I already have like it. It ended up going to another area of another image in the sky.  The pictures were taken anywhere between 2-12 seconds apart, as in some I had to swivel the tripod head to find it again. The lights within it change position but that too is like other images of that same type I have., Sometimes the line formations are red…green…white…orange..and even blue. Sometimes double ,often single.

This was not the Space Station, even though it went across the sky at the Speed of the Space Station. Nor was it at the altitude of the Space Station.  This was much closer, half the height of the highest commercial plane.

The object  was around 3 times the size of the Space Station at it’s closest point right after it came out from behind the house and diminished as  moved away toward the north.. Don’t’ think it was a space craft, it never changed direction or speed.  Don’t’ think it was a comet or shooting star, it had no tail, yet it looked hot, glowing as if still burning hot from entering from outer space. I don’t know what this was but after passing Peoria Illinois, someone, Some Where between Rockford, Il. and Chicago, Il. Had to of seen this also.

There was also a airplane in the sky which was noticeably moving a lot faster with blinking red and white lights.  We watched the orange light for about 10 mins and the light just seemed to start faiding when all of the sudden it dimed right out and dissapeared but seemed to be traveling from east to west.    20 mins later we saw a blue light slowly go from what seemed to be going west to east and was about 200 feet and then just vanished like it dissapeared it faided out just like the orange light.

Lee, VA Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84526.html,"USAF detection and intercept attempt of UFO detected by radar at 70,000' altitude. Mr. Davenport,   I was a participant in an air force attempt to intercept a UFO in 1962. This happened at the headquarters of Washington air defense sector, (Washington DC not state), on a swing shift in October. Three height finders reported a stationary object at 70,000 feet altitude.  I was working in the height section of the WAADS direction center when the first radar operator called in a report.  I thought it to be a balloon, but he said no because it was completely stationary and a balloon would be drifting with the wind. I called the other two sites and told them the reported location, and they promptly saw the object on their scopes as well, same altitude and stationary. I notified the commanding officer in the weapons section and they decided to scramble two interceptors to go take a look at it. The object remained stationary until the two interceptors got close to it, (maybe two miles for the lead aircraft).  The lead pilot said it was a bright round object. It then took off straight up and fast until it went above the altitude capabilities of the radars and was lost.  Of course the interceptors were unable to follow.  About forty people were aware of this incident on that crew at WAADS. The surprise to me was that we notified no one of this incident and were told to ignore it. The commanding officer said ""who would we report it to since we are it.""  This attitude was and still is most illogical unless the CIA, or somebody, already knew what it was. I am sure it was not any aircraft manufactured by humans because it exceeded the capabilities of anything we have ever made.  Surely our government would want to know what that was so why ignore it.  This attitude frightens me now and did then because I can only come up with bad reasons why the government would show no interest in something that was obviously real like that.  That was a group of reliable witnesses including the pilots and the radar operators as well as everyone on that crew. Have you any idea why our government would pretend that no verifiable evidence has ever existed for a UFO other than they already know what they are or why they ridicule any report anyone is foolish enough to make?  By the way, I do not wish to report that event but it did happen. ((name deleted))   ((END E-MAILED REPORT))  ((BEGIN ADDENDUM FROM SAME SOURCE))   Mr. Davenport,   Thank you for responding to my message. No, I do not wish to file a report.  No, I do not remember the name of the commanding officer.  I do remember the names of some of the crew but I have had no contact in forty years or more.  It would be difficult and costly to verify my story and I am not trying to prove anything.  You are free to believe whatever.  But here are a few easily verifiable facts. The object involved was first spotted by a height finder radar operator.  It was his job to insert altitude data into a remote computer terminal as requested by a computer located at a central site or by me verbally over the voice line.  He could only see an area about ten miles wide but from the surface to about 110,000 feet and from his site to a distance of about 200 miles away on his scope.  He noticed the object while getting an altitude on a commercial airliner as requested by the central computer. I was an enlisted man in the 26th air defense command stationed in the only air force squadron at Fort Lee, Virginia.  Fort Lee was an army post but the direction center for the Washington air defense sector was located there. The field I was in was called SAGE for semi-automatic ground environment.  It was an air defense system which consolidated radar data from sites located all around our sector into a central computer where a composite refined display was presented on CRT’s ((cathode ray tubes; screens)).  A crew was necessary to handle the non-automatic part of the job.  Each crew member sat at a console where buttons and a light gun were used to perform actions assisting the computer.  The hardware was a very large IBM computer and the software came from System Development Corporation.  There were 20 odd such direction centers, if I remember correctly, and they were connected to each other and to NORAD.  Our responsibility was for an area which ran from north of Washington, D.C., to South Carolina, west to nearly Ohio, and out over the Atlantic.  Each direction center had responsibility for a similar sized area. At that time, I worked in the height section, where I occasionally obtained altitudes on aircraft for the weapons sections practice.  The computer automatically obtained altitudes, but only at five minute intervals.  I talked to height finder radar operators at the radar sites when a manual altitude was needed. There was also a weapons section, a tracking section, an identification section, a manual inputs section, and a Nike missile control section manned by the army.  I know that the direction center no longer exists, and probably all of the rest of them are gone as well.  I suspect that it was all consolidated to NORAD, when better computers and systems were created. No, I am not a liar or a hoaxer.  I just would like to know what that object was and what the government is hiding.  I have no other agenda.  Specifically, since some say the world is ending on 12-21-2012, I wonder if the government has been informed by aliens that the Mayans were correct.  That would certainly explain why they act the way they do.  Of course I do not believe that Mayan story.  But it is an example of possible reasons for their actions.  I can't come up with a noble reason.  I just suspect that the government is hiding something. Why bring this up now?  Well, I saw your site on the internet and thought you may know the truth. Thanks again for your response. ((name deleted))",,37.2357,-77.3366

We were somewhat like gypsy's and mom and dad would get work with Carnivals.  Tv was almost NONE EXISTENT since we had no home most of the time.  Now, I mentioned this because I was NOT influenced by any tv program that might have made me ""DREAM"" what happened to me.  I am entirely SERIOUS about what happened to me!!!  Make no mistake about it.It has perplexed me for years, and only recently I found out that there are places like this to report things of this nature.  I think this might intriuge you as what was said to me by my Mother only about three years ago, SHE TOLD ME that at the age of nine or ten she was ABDUCTED and taken up into a ship that had NO CORNER'S in it!  This is important since mom had NO WAY of knowing that reports given by OTHER abductee's reported the SAME THING! I almost fell out of my chair when she related her experience to me. I NEVER knew about it till three years ago!!!!!  I was telling her of my experience, and that is when it came into the conversation about mom.  Now, my EXPERIENCE as I call it. My Grandmother and Grandfather had to come to Ky to retreive me since my mom anmd dad were about to go away to prison for an extended period of time.  They brought a travel trailer with them for us to stay in till the end of mom and dad's trial.  This, is where the CONTACT came to me. Grandma had made a palete on the floor beside there bed in the back of the trailer.  I was sleeping and awoke abruptly and had the distinct feeling before opening my eyes something was LOOKING at me, and, IT WAS! Standing over me was an odd looking creature THIN in nature with an oval looking head with large dark eyes.When it saw that I was aware of it b! eing there, it raised up straight, turned to the right and in ! a Jerky strobe light looking way, turned to the hallway, and about half the way down the hall simply VANISHED into what I call ""THIN AIR"", or disapeared or whatever you want to call it. I remember this event as if it was yesterday, and can remember every aspect of it. I have had other instances in my life and in one instanse even had a wittness to it that scared the crap out of him so much so he ran into the house because tyhings outside during this event was ""NOT RIGHT"". That would be another story another time. I am a Nam Vet and also had experiences with that too. As if I was being informed of danger ahead of time. I was a Pointman with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. This is important to me to know there are other's out here that KNOW of there existence, and KNOW what I have gone through all these years. This is NO JOKE! And, I do not take lightly, ANYONE taking what I relate to them LIGHTLY either! I want answers and I will do whatever it take s to find out the ""WHY"".   I thank you for your time.

Black Tetrahedron Pyramid UFO   This sighting occurred back in August 7, 1999. On that particular Saturday mid-afternoon day.  A friend and I decided to take a walk down to Riverbank State Park on 145th Manhattan, NY.  We've been there a few times before since he lived and worked at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital a few blocks north from there.  It was our favorite place to hang out and just enjoy the scenery.  From that park you could see over to New Jersey,  The George Washington Bridge, and Downtown and basically up the Hudson River valley as well on a clear day.  My friend and I got to the park and walked all the way down to the south corner of the park next to the basketball courts act... We sat down on the benches right next to the rail facing the Hudson River.  We spoke about work, family, daily normal everyday things, act.... At one point during our conversation I stood up and walked next to the rail and leaned against the rail with my back towards the Hudson River.  My friend lay down on the bench and we kept talking until I for some strange reason looked up and noticed 3 or 4 ""star-liked"" objects just hovering motionless to the east of where i was standing.  I asked my friend to stand up and see something strange up in the sky and so he did.  He told me something around, ""Oh what those stars there,"" but then he told me ""it's weird we're not supposed to see stars that bright during the day"". Then I told him that they’re probably satellites or even balloons and we just basically brush it off and kept talking about other stuff. We stood there for a few more hours.  Then around 5:00pm or so we decided to go get something to eat at a nearby McDonalds and basically started walking back north to exit the park.  As we were walking north right beside the river I noticed again for some strange reason what looked like a ""Black"" dot in the sky. It stood out to me because the sky was completely blue no clouds, haze nothing. This object was hovering motionless near the Manhattan side of the G.W.Bridge precisely on top or near 3 tall buildings used by Columbia Presbyterian Hospital as dorms for medical students or something my friend told me.  He knew since like I said he worked at the hospital in the Administration Dept.  I found it very odd so I ask my friend to walk fast to nearby sight-seeing binoculars that they have in that park to see over to New Jersey, G. W. Bridge act…  At the same time that I was walking I was looking in my jeans pocket for 50 cents to paid in order to use the binoculars and happens to be that I had precisely that 2 quarters so I got to the machine put the money and first located the G.W. Bridge since it was the biggest thing, then located the 3 buildings nearby and then moved the binoculars a little up from the buildings and lord behold there was the “Black! Dot” which wasn’t really a “Black Dot” but a Black Tetrahedro! n Pyramid Object sitting motionless on an angle right on top of one of the buildings. This object was completely black. It had not markings what so ever, no symbols, letters, windows, and doors I mean nothing. It was just black sort of ""gun metal black."" The only thing that had in each bottom corners was plasma-like circular lights. These lights emanated some sort of heat. Sort of like the sun, yes they reminded me of the sun. It was like it had 3 suns in each corner.  The object also didn’t rotate or nothing it was just there motionless.   At that point I was just ecstatic in a euphoric state debating whether I was seeing this or if it was all in my mind.  I quickly turn to my friend which was standing right next to me asking me what was what I was seeing.  Why I was reacting the way I was reacting. I told him you have to see this come so I let him used the binoculars and told him where to look so he did but he couldn’t see find it. I looked with my eyes to see if I saw the black dot but it just vanish as quickly as it appeared.  The rest of the day we just spoke about what had happened.

When i approached the escarpment I actually lost sight of it in the trees, but the road was heading up and about to make a left turn directly under it.   And thats exactly what happened.   As i made the bend i witnessed the craft make a turn on a dime without tipping the wings.  It was hovering.   I drove slowly until i stopped directly under it.  I opened the door and just watched as this thing slowly went over my head.   I assume it was dead silent because all I could hear was really just the music from mu car stereo.

These creatures were within 20 feet from the bed of my truck about to take the corner of the fence.  I reacted by throwing my truck into drive, drove to the nearest gas station and started crying.

We were roughly an hour from landing in Vegas (I don’t know what that puts our location or altitude at).  I looked out the window (left) and saw a non-reflective, black rod hovering in the sky.   While I can’t tell you exactly how far away it was, it was definitely close enough to easily determine that it was a 3-dimensional shape (rod) that was completely stationary (at an angle) and at a slightly lower altitude than our plane.   I looked down at the ground in the area and saw absolutely nothing but bare, unoccupied land. I immediately began pointing it out to others around me who had no problem seeing it.  After observing it for roughly 2 minutes, our plane maneuvered sharply to the right (away from the object) without warning.  It was not our final approach, and none of the airline staff said anything. ((COPIES OF CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOURCE OF REPORT)) Dear Ms. Evenson, Thank you very much for the excellent report, and for the nice illustration Do you happen to know any of the other witnesses?  If so, we would very much like to have them prepare reports of what they recall about the incident. Also, did the object happen to travel along with the aircraft, or did it seem to be stationary? What type of aircraft were you in, please?  Was it a jet, e.g. a 737, or was it a turboprop? Were you a member of the crew of the aircraft you were on, by any chance, or just a paying passenger, as you suggest in your report?  I ask because your report seems to me to have been written by someone who is familiar with aviation. ((Paragraph deleted.)) Again, thank you very much for having shared the information with our Center, and for having taken the time to compose such a nice report!! Cordially, Peter Davenport, Director National UFO Reporting Center ((END MESSAGE)) ((BEGIN RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I'm glad that my crude illustration was at least somewhat helpful, haha! I was just a passenger on the plane (ex.: 737), but I'm familiar with some aviation terminology/procedures because of my brother (12+ yrs of Flight Simulator, and now aviation school).  My plane ticket for that trip was sent to me via e-mail, so I was able to go back and get the precise details of the flight.  I thought this could be useful in case there were other reports of the incident that I didn't know about. Unfortunately, I didn't get contact information from the other witnesses.  As odd as it sounds, I think I was too preoccupied(?) with trying to piece together what I/we had just seen to consider needing to reach them in the future. As for the object itself, it did remain stationary from what I could tell.  That's what led me to look at the ground because I figured this thing had to be attached to something.  It was not. Important Note!!!!: (I feel like SUCH an idiot for not including this crucial detail before) There was so much turbulence throughout the entire flight that all of the passengers and crew had to remain seated/buckled in (I remember that vividly because I was really regretting not using the bathroom prior to boarding).  Even though the turbulence was more or less constant, the pilot(s) would still announce whenever we were moving into an area where it would be more intense.  So, given that  every occupant of the plane was seated, they were able to safely maneuver in the way I described (this was not a gentle, gradual turn).  The fact that they didn't alert us prior to doing so (like they had been the whole flight) is what leads me to believe that it was in direct response to the UFO. Again, I apologize for not reporting it sooner.  It wasn't until something jarred my memory yesterday that I realized this was something you guys might want to know about! ((Line deleted)), and do not hesitate to ask me any questions. Thank you, ((END CORRESPONDENCE))",2011-10-19T00:00:00,,

From where we were standing the lights appeared to be approx. the size of a grapefruit-maybe a little bigger. At first they were close together but not in any type of formation.  Then one by one, they started to flicker and fade away.  Then within a matter of 4-5 seconds we noticed them on the horizon appearing like they were rising up from the top of the water.  Three of them then formed a triangular shape and the other two just faded out. The triangle formation just hovered for a little while.

I know that there was a meteor shower that was supposed to occur. But these lights did not ""shoot"" across the sky.  As I said before they just hovered then slowly faded away.

I was so overwhelmed from what I witnessed that I screamed out, almost uncontrollably, ""Oh my God, what was that!"".  I also suddenly had a strong urge to cry. Sounds corny, I just want to give you an accurate description of what I saw and how I felt.  I will never forget the experience.

W Walking south on Neptune Ave in Encinitas, Ca we observed two bright lights and one or three tiny lights in the sky at about 15 to 20 degrees up from the horizon.  I later discerned with a compass we were looking 310 degrees south east.  The two main lights were very close to each other and not moving or making any sound. The small lighst were moving up toward the other two. Eventually the small lights vanished one at a time, then the left light of the pair of stationery lights began to grow dim and eventually dimish but this time I noticed it seemed to be traveling in a straight line away from my line of sight so there was no perception of it moving in any other direction but just getting tiny going straight away from me and finally disappearing. As we were observing the behavior of these five ufos two more very bright ones were approaching from the south paired togerher as if hugging the coast line.  The spacing of them and intensity was the same as the first bright pair.  As they approached  a position in a line under the first pair but they the lower slowly ascended toward the position of the first two. Then the top two  began to flicker dim and then move straight away from my eye line like the others.  First it was the left one then the right. Then the two new lights rose up and took the same positions as the earlier two.  At his time another pair just like the last pair appeared coming up the coast from the south.  And repeated the behavior of the last two.  Within the span of ten to fifteen minutes they were all gone. I shot video of the event with my phone and you can see the pair of lights and hear the commentary of myself and 5 or 6 other witnesses on the street. My impression of the event was that I was observing an airport runway with planes queing up for take off. The lights looked very similar to videos of the very well documented sightings in Arizona. Orangish yellow. 08/13/2011 9:10pm. We went to the same sight as the night before at 9:00 to see if the ufos appeared there again. It was more overcast then the night before. Nothing. But as we were leaving about 9:10 a single light appeared moving up from the south again, took the same position as the others did the night before, hung there for the same amount of time and then diminished and disappeared the same as the others had the night before. I shot video again of this ufo. There was no sound at all",2011-08-21T00:00:00,33.0468724137931,-117.25621206896552

My first thought was it was a police helicopter conducting a search, however the light emanating from it was really bright.  There was no light trail leading to the ground so I do not believe it was a spotlight. The object was parallel to the road so it was in my direct vision.  I cannot accurately estimate how high up it was but it was maybe a few dozen feet above the tree line and it was moving very slowly. As I drove closer, I noticed what I thought was one bright light several hundred yards back was actually 3 bright lights, in triangular-like form, all facing downward. It was difficult to make the shape of the object because the lights were so bright (and it was dark) but by the orientation of the lights I would say it had more of a boomerang like shape.  There was no discernible sound coming from the object - a helicopter at that height would be very loud.  I am a smoker so my window was down.

First my friend sitting nest to me outside in a car had seen a strange ""shooting star"" in remained in the sky visible for about 10 seconds.  I tried to look, but my vision was blocked by trees.  about 10 minutes later A set of flashing blue and red lights appeared. They were strange but I assumed it was a normal airplane and paid it no attention. This passed by and then about 3 minutes later another ""plane"" appears in the same general area. This time I paid more attention to the detail of the ""plane."" I could not tell exactly what the flashing lights were. There was no plane shape near, I could also see a strange Ora or force around the flashing lights as it gradually and steadily moved forward from the lower left middle ! of the horizon at about a 45 degree angle up and across horizontally  towards the  upper right. at first I thought this was a trick of the eye, but as I continued to look, I could clearly see a surrounding area of the sky that was moving with the light, and had a very very slight difference in appearance than the rest of the sky. It was almost like a perfect camouflage with the night sky, it only could be detected with keen attention being paid to a seemingly average airplane in the sky. I observed about 20-30, maybe even 40 objects in the sky within the next 2 hours. I saw multiple shapes. Some were very small and had a similar shape to a blimp, except more rounded and less ovular. I saw large roundish saucer shapes. I saw one that has abrupt square edges. All of there are the shapes of the outer ""force"" or Ora around the flashing light. These obects were following each other in the sky. One would be far away and appear as a single light in the lower left distance.

Also I heard a low humming noise, similar to the sound of a car in neutral except more quiet and muffled. This appearance of one after the other lasted for about 30 minutes. I probably had seen about 20 objects during that time. After 2 hours of watching, I went inside. I peeked out the window several times and have spotted flashing lights at least once every time.

I also noticed movements similar to ""figure 8s"" It would sometimes just sit up in the sky and not move for a while.

It was around 4:10 in the afternoon when myself, my friends father, my friend, and his girlfriend went outside of the house in the backyard to shoot rifle.  The front of the house faces a road with a cornfield on the opposite side, the rear of the house is also surrounded by corn fields.  The area we were in has a clear view of the north, east, south, and south western horizons. We began to shoot rifle for about 45-50 minutes outside.  My friends father was focused on attempting a long shot on his rifle, so he was looking through the scope of the rifle and not paying much attention to the surroundings. I was sitting there with my friend and his girlfriend when all of the sudden my friend stands up and yells ""Oh, my God!"" in a very surprised and shocked tone.  I looked over to where he was looking and instantly saw to what he was referring to.  His girlfriend did as well.  My friends father was focused on his shooting and didn't notice what we were fussing about to look in time at what we saw. What we saw was a large looking teardrop shaped craft.  It has an eerie light neon green color to it.  At the time we saw it the sun was just about to set with plenty of clear daylight still present.  The craft moved at astounding speeds.  It started on the south-western horizon and moved along that horizon at roughly 1.5 miles away from us.  We saw it for about 10 seconds and it was the fastest moving flying object I have seen.  The UFO made no sound. I got a good perspective of its speed because after we saw it fly then dissapear from view, we saw an aircraft passanger plane flying and it was move substantially slower than the UFO, I would say 1/100th of the speed that the UFO was. The weirdest thing out of the whole situation was that after the spacecraft disappeared, we saw a huge line of various types of birds flying in the same flight path.  I identified the birds, being an avid waterfowl hunter and outdoorsmen, as seagulls, Canadian geese, snow geese, and black birds.",2012-02-10T00:00:00,39.9261,-76.3384

Maybe a week or so later I had a scoop mark in my right top hip, about a inch and a half was the circumference. I had seen activity in the sky prior to that night, perhaps a few weeks prior.  There were many star like crafts moving around in the sky.  I had somehow gotten crazy enough to get a flashlight and shine it up at the sky to see if any would respond.  Well, one started coming closer to the house from where I was shining the light.  Well, I was so freaked out by that and had run into the house and turned off all the lights and was frightened. I sort of had a connection since I was around 8 years old.  There was missing time when I was 8 or 9 years old.  I remember going to bed and my bed was centered in front of a window on the second floor.  I shared a room with my two other sisters.

I was heading up Highway 273 north up what is called North Market Street or to locals Miracle Mile, in Redding, California. As I got approximately 2/3 of the way up the hill, I caught sight of a large white object to my left, or the western side of the road.  It appeared to be of an oval shape, well above the tree lines and had rotating blue lights around it, resembling a carnival ride.  It was heading in the same direction I was, north, and as it got above the buildings at the top of the hill, it seemed to make an immediate sharp right turn.  I was almost at the top of the street when this occurred, and as it made the right turn it seemed at accelerate, then suddenly it was gone. I have served in many countries while in the military, and ridden in many types of military helicopters and airplanes, but nothing  I have ever seen resembled this.  The way it disappeared as it accelerated was what caught my eye, as the night was clear and I had an un-obstructed view of the dark where I had seen the whatever it was. I have been inside burning aircraft to remove dead bodies, have seen many things in my life which were amazing and extremely curious, but I have to say that this was without a doubt one of the scariest things I have every witnessed.  I felt more fear on the rest of my drive home than I can ever recall feeling, and even tonight while driving home the same route at the same time I felt a chill as I drove up Miracle Mile. I cannot for sure state how big the object was, but if I had to make a guess, I would say it was maybe 20-30 feet, basing this on roughly how high it was in the sky and in relation to the traffic lights at the top of Miracle Mile.

On 4/25/07, I was at a meeting being held near the local airport and Kirtland AFB. I went outside during a lunch break and was just standing on the sidewalk, relaxing with a cigarette (sorry!), looking around. Several people were walking to their cars, etc. However, I was apparently the only person who looked up and saw what appeared to be a very stiff piece of white paper or cardboard in the air, seemingly close by and floating down toward the ground in a back and forth motion. (I feel like wincing since it seems so trite, but it was making that classic ""falling leaf"" motion that so many people report.)   It did not bend as a I expect a piece of paper would, but remained stiff the entire way down.  It had about the same relative dimensions of 8.5 X 11 paper, which is what I first assumed it was, and was coming down with the longest side on the vertical axis. The shorter, top side was tilted toward me at about 20 degrees, which became progressively more acute until the ""flat"" side was almost horizontal to the ground.  However, I could continue to see almost the entire rectanglular shape. I thought this was odd as I shouldn't have been able to see that much of the rectangle if the object were as small and as close to me as I thought it was (I wasn't directly under the object so, if it was a piece of paper at that angle and assumed distance, I should have seen no more than a sliver of the rectangle from the new angle).  I did not have any sense of there being any substantial ""depth"" to the object. Also, believing this was an 8.5 X 11 piece of stiff paper, I thought to myself that it would surely hit me in the face very shortly.  However, as time went on, this ""piece of paper"" did not appear to get any closer to me as it was falling, which also convinced me that it was much larger and much higher than I originally estimated.  This made me more curious so I continued to watch it. After at least 2 minutes of slowly falling back and forth, and slowly tilting from vertical to horizontal, the object seemed to catch an updraft and went spiraling back up very quickly.  It started with wide circles that got progressively tighter and tighter until it suddenly stopped moving after about 10 seconds. At its greatest height, it once again started falling toward the ground in the ""falling leaf"" motion, only was now oriented horizontally to the ground.  This time it fell for only about 15 seconds before it again spiraled upward for about 5 seconds. I was then astounded to see two garish, neon-like orange ""cones"" of light/flame suddenly spew out of the northernmost face of the rectangle and the entire object quickly and silently left the area very steadily and heading southeast in a straight line. It no longer looked like a piece of paper, but looked like a rectangular vehicle that was being confidently driven. It's trajectory should have taken the object directly over the airport, if not also the air force base. It was out of sight in less than 5 seconds and never deviated from it's beeline course. When I returned to the meeting, I did tell my coworkers what I had seen. I had never seen a UFO and had never heard of a rectangular one. I thought at first it may have been a giant piece of cardboard that had presented some ""flip"" side to me that had orange cone shapes painted onto it, creating an optical illusion. However, the white rectangle did not change its height/width ratio as one would expect if one side were completely white and the flip side was only 2/3 white. (The orange flame-like cones were about 1/2 the size of the rectangle. If they were painted on there, the rectangle on the painted side should have looked more like a square). At any rate, I do not know what it was. About two weeks later, one of my coworkers excitedly told me she had heard there had been sightings of a similar object in Alaska around the same time, but I was never able to find any such reports. I called MUFON to see if they had reports like mine, but they said they hadn't heard of any. NOTE TO EDITOR: I have two more odd occurrences to report which I will be doing under separate cover.  They are each unique and would be just a mishmash of sightings over the years if I were to combine them here.  I was diagnosed as terminally ill recently and wanted to document my UFO-ish experiences before I am no longer able.  This is most certainly not exaggerated, embellished, or fabricated (it's not that great or dramatic of a sighting anyway); but I freely admit it may have been nothing more than an optical illusion.  Nevertheless, this experience has always puzzled me, especially since finding out that there are, indeed, rectangular UFOs. Were it not for the cones of orange light/flame popping out just before the object took off on its steady southeast course (after acting like nothing more than debris in the air for several minutes), I probably would have forgotten about it, but now I just don't know what I saw that day.",2012-03-16T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

If I had to guess speed I’d say 75mph. I watched them until they disappeared into the western horizon.

This lasted maybe between 25 to 45 seconds but after it moved everything disappeared.  But while I was looking at the object, I made sure there were no reflections from the car hood, windshield, or any nearby objects such as traffic lights causing a reflect! ion on my windshield.  Approximate distance the object traveled was maybe 10-15 miles.  Sorry but I didn't have time to get my camera out since I was driving and it was only for a very short time.  I do not drink,smoke,or do drugs and my IQ is 155\ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-03-16T00:00:00,,

I was also moving very slowly and at times not at all. It would be very bright and a few minutes later it would be very dim, and fade to nothing at all only to brighten back up or be somewhere else. We were on the Carl Perkins bridge waiting for the 4th of July fireworks to start. We first saw it at twilight in the northeast at 50 to 75 feet up. We managed to catch a picture of it as well. We watched it for maybe 10 minutes as it brightened and dimmed and wondered up and down, side to side. The color of the light was orangeish. As the show started, the light wandered to the east and parked above the grant bridge (but much farther out). Again it would wander about dim, brighten, ascend and descend. We also caught it on camera a few more times during the show as my Girlfriend was taking photos of the show. The photos was shot on a Sanyo s1070 with iso speed 200, exposure time 4 sec, focal length 7mm, max ap 2.97  After the show, we dumped the pics onto our computer and quickly forgot about the whole thing. We wew on this site looking at a report i had made several years back about spinning stars when i saw the report entitled: 7/6/08 22:00 	Portsmouth 	OH 	Light 	20 min 	More Info on Portsmouth Bright-Dim Lights. 	10/31/08 7/6/08 02:00 	Portsmouth 	OH 	Light 	45 mins 	Bright yellow light would dim and brighten itself. Hovered quickly across the sky back and forth. We know the photos are not great, but we were lucky to have caught them in the first place.  When trying to photo it, we couldn't see it in the lcd view screen and assumed we would be able to capture it.  So she set her camera to a longer exposure and sure enough we caught it several times.  We would ask that anyone viewing the photos understand that it wasnt the easy to photograph due to the nature of the light.

I'd like to report a strange light I witnessed over Townsville, Australia in mid-August (approx. the 14th). I was standing in my backyard in Oonoonba, having a cigarette at aprox. 11.00pm. I glanced up into the sky and noticed an orange fireball about quarter the size of a full moon, which seemed to be stationary. I speculated that it must have been a military jet with afterburners lit, travelling directly away from me, however it seemed to stay in the one place far too long. It was hard to gauge at what altitude this ""fireball"" was, other than to say it was below the upper-level cloud. It remained stationary for approximately 30 seconds then suddenly seemed to gain height at an extraordinary rate. The ""fireball"" grew dimmer the higher it travelled until it was a faint glow on the upper level cloud. It then headed in an easterly direction out over the ocean. I have no idea what this ""fireball"" was. The weather was cool for Townsville and the sky was partially cloudy, with some mid-level and high-level cloud. The ""fireball"" made no sound that I could hear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-03-16T00:00:00,,

It was around 8:30ish.  There were hardly any stars in the sky, it was dark.  There were no cars in front of me or behind me, but cars coming from my opposite direction.  As I was driving up North towards Nees Ave on Chestnut, I saw a light coming somewhat straight at me.  At first, the thought came to my mind that it is an airplane crashing down, I felt somewhat scared.  I did not want to witness anything extreme at that moment.  The flying object as it descended from the sky, started slowing down and got bigger.  As it was getting bigger and getting close to me (feelings: very scared), I began praying for it to stop or just be close enough that I could see it, but not close to me as to like being in front of me.  I really did not want to get abducted, that was the next thought in my mind.  The UFO aircraft stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  As I was staring at it, my thoughts were “Am I really seeing this?” the feelings of being shocked was trembling in my body.  My eyes were stuck at this unidentified aircraft, trying to figure out what this thing could look like, but all I seen was 3 circular lights, somewhat close together, shaped like a triangle, the lights looked as if it was spinning at a rapid rate, from red and blue, with traces of yellow light as it was glittering and spinning at a rapid rate.  The bottom of the craft looked like it had some rigid form structure around the lights. The UFO aircraft did not look large; it seemed somewhat medium/small size.  That was all that I seen from that... After a couple of seconds, maybe 15-20 seconds, it gradually started to move, to the right of my view, and curved up towards the sky.  It was lighting speed, it made traces of white light (like a tail of a star falling from the ! sky, except it was going up) as it ascended to the heavens.  I! never s een anything like it, or have I seen an aircraft as fast as that UFO craft traveled.  I’m still in shocked.  Today is December 8, 2011, 10:31AM.

From the home of my sister, in a northwesterly direction, I observed some lighted object.  I saw red, blue and green lights as well as a constant white glow coming from the object.  The flickering which I observed could be a atmospheric distortion, though the colors did seem to alternate or flash. The object appeared to be hovering above the mountain range which is near Monarch Mountain.  It did appear to make some lateral and vertical changes of position but primarily remained fixed in it's position.  Near the end of the 30 minutes which I spent watching, an aircraft overflew the house and traveled seemingly near to but above the object.

I yelled for my roommates to come look.  The lights blinked at each other almost like they were communicating something.  The intervals of blinking were not consistent at all and the lights were not normal color, or brightness for any aircraft. after about 10 seconds of me watching, the lights disappeared immediately.

I'm positive these white li! ghts were traveling high speeds due to the amount of distance it covered in a small amount of time, compared to how high, and far they were.  It looked as if there were vague silhouettes I could see around each object as they blinked.  They darted across the sky heading south then abruptly turned back north  as if they were being chased and continued until all the lights vanished. They did not fade away, and there were no clouds.  They just stopped.

The oval object had orange circular lights going around the whole of the ship and I stood there crossing out everything that it could be in my mind. It was most definetly NOT a balloon or a cloud or a plane or a helicopter. It was moving so slow that a plane has to be crossed out and if it was some stealth kind of military plane the shape was all wrong. It was NOT sleek or strong looking. Actually it looked sort of huge and clunky. It looked like something out of like a 50’s sci fi movie and not some newfound classic CGI spaceship that adorn our movie screens today. I knew that the ship was soon going to descend out of my sight beyond the treeline so I yelled at one of my coworkers who was approximat! ely 50 feet away. As I ran over to her the object just reached a point where it could not be seen anymore. I asked her, “Did you see that UFO?” and she said, “Is that what it was? I saw it and I don’t know WHAT that was…” The object if I had to estimate was very large I would say half a football field in length (150 feet) and I was appox. 150 feet away when I saw it. I witnessed the craft for about 15 seconds. It was dusk and I think that actually helped in assuring me it was a UFO and not something else. If it had been completely dark I would have probably chalked it up to something natural because then I could have ONLY seen the lights.

After a while (5 mins) it seemed to get smaller but denser, more vibrant, as it was doing this it rolled over the roof and down to the park that divided my scheme with the one where it appeared.   A ball of light about 20ft in circumference bouncing about.  The more it bounced, thrumbed, vibrated, the more light,energetic and animated it became.  It seemed like it took about twenty minutes to gain its peak. Its colours were a fire-red flickering like as in a fire, within a peachy coloured sphere.  Every now and then you would hear a pop-like something.  I noticed smaller (about 2 ft) dimmer spheres drop down through the big spheres circumferance, like tail-less sperm entering an egg, the colour would change slightly, looking less strong in colour, then some of the flame-like streaks changed to a fire-yellow, and as more yellow than red were visiable, coloured sparks began resounding, they sounded like distant fire-crackers within the sphere.  It was like they were being sparked off in the colour-sequence of the rainbow, there was method to this sequence. I just remember it looked like an invisible gyroscope with coloured halogen light strapped to it being spun in all manner of directions but with a pattern and going that fast that the tracers start to look like solid lines, creating patterns that resemble spirograph or many a crop circle, each colour individually forming its own pattern and after completion it looked like they dropped into a vortex just lower of centre, as it went through the rainbow sequence, I feared I would not stay awake long enough to see the purple, my favourite colour, it started of as the palest lilac and ended its sequence purple neon,the green sequence seemed very urgent,as if it was in a hurry to get it over with, still the yellow-flamed streaks of colour within the sphere were getting whiter, as the green sequence finished the whiteness level got to what could be described as, as bright as a halogen bulb, as you are staring right into it. At this point it lifted about six feet from the ground and ! then disappeared vertically along the side of a hill and up into the air, it was cloaking itself as it moved, by the time it got over the Bonnybridge Road, high enough for me to see it again.   I followed it skyward, where I saw were three stationary black bat-shaped ships waiting for it,by this time my UFO looked like a cresent moon.  They were there and gone in the blink of an eye.  IN a blink of Halogen light!.I fell asleep immediately afterwards and woke up to a rollicking for moving the linen-box over to the window I was moved back into the front room because I wouldn't stay away from the window.

Craft was about the length of a three football fields long and was black with small windows around the mid-section of the craft.  You could not hear any birds or any animal noises that you would normally hear in the country. My parents took me and my sister home so they could go and see if they could see the craft any better from another area of the country.  My Parents told me to call the Airport to see if they had any missing blimps or aircraft in the area, which the conversation was recorded by the McGhee Tyson Airport Tower.  They gave me a number to call, but when I called it, it was a number to an institution for the crazy/insane.  I called them back to tell them this was no joke and it was very real.  I also know of others that lived in the same area, that also witnessed hearing a hovering sound over their residence and that their TV started making static sounds and they lost their picture but then a few seconds later, went back to normal. I have seen other UFO activity since then, up in the skies where they were flying irractically in the night sky back in 1988, in Maryville, Tennessee, while watching the stars at night.  My husband is not a believer of UFO's, but he could not explain the fast moving lights or what it could have been, since he is a Geographer and knows that stars can't move around like what he was seeing. I believe in UFO's and no one can convince me they do not exist.   I believe they are here to see how we react to unknown visitors and believe we are part of them in some way or another, but until we can be a peaceful nation, they will not present themselves because of our cruelty to others. If we show a more peaceful approach to unknown visitors, I beleive we can learn what we need to, to see why we are here and what our real purpose is for survival.  We can learn a lot from them, if given the chance to do so, and I hope that in my lifetime, we can have the opportunity to be friends with all the other unknowns in our Universe, because I believe they are others out there on Planets just like ours, that we haven't gotten to explore yet, but because of our limited education, many find it hard to accept that there is a higher being out there besides us, and they are out there, waiting for the right time to present themselves when we can accept that there is a more advance race than we will ever become for thousands of years down the road.

We had a car called an AMC Pacer, which had a very large moon roof.  I was fully reclined in the passenger seat looking at the stars.  Suddenly I noticed the stars were blocked by an object and replaced by a series of illuminated dark gray tubes and small white lights.  Having no idea what this was I rolled my window all the way down and popped my head outside the window to get a better look. To my complete shock, an enormous gunmetal gray object hovered overhead, no more than 150 feet up.  It looked like it was rectangular or at least angular in some way, it had sharp edges and corners, at least on the side I could see, since it was so large, at least the size of a football field.  Its underside was gunmetal gray with a touch of green, it had a utilitarian, military feel to it.  The snake-like tubes running along its underside were illuminated by a series of small white lights, like clear Christmas lights, and the object was surrounded by a subtle glow, like an aura. It was almost completely silent, but I did detect a tiny hum, and it glided very smoothly overhead, at approximately the speed of our car, which was probably about 35 - 40 miles per hour. We were on a heavily populated highway in a dense residential area, with a lot of businesses and street lights.  I looked around me and no one seemed to be looking up but me, there was no shouting, no blinking of horns one might think would accompany such an anomaly. I stammered to my husband to look up, he did, muttered ""Uh huh"" and kept driving as if I had pointed out a full moon.  ""Is everyone asleep?"" I wondered, and I kept up a steady patter about the object as we turned onto the Cross Island and I could no longer track it.  When we arrived home at our Manhattan apartment (I worked as a copywriter in those days, my husband was an advertising art director) I turned on the TV fully expecting to see breaking news about the giant object, but there was nothing.   The next day my husband pointed out an article in the New York Times (an inside page)about UFO sightings in the Hudson Valley that same evening.  ""Ah hah!"" I said, feeling vindicated, but there was nothing further about it.  It did spark my interest in the subject though, and after this experience I read a great deal about UFOs and hoped maybe one day I would experience another sighting. I did have the distinct impression during this sighting that we were being surveyed and watched by this object, it felt ponderous and powerful, and 25 years later I remember it as if it happened yesterday.

We were walking it was dark, and we noticed that there were small rocks being thrown into the creek.  Nobody really took and notice of this we all thought that some of the other boys where behind the rocks, but soon one of the boys got hit by a rather large rock.   We then realized the rock were bigger and coming form over the tree line to our left and into the creek to the right, and none of the boy were responsible for the activity. At this point we decided to line up in one large line and we were going to walk through the tree line to find the person or persons who were responsible for these rocks.  About I would say 50 yards or so we came to a large field, and there was NO ONE there.  I know of at least one boy who broke his leg going through the trees,  why we stayed that I do not know. The scout leaders decided that we would go ahead and sleep one the creek bed that night they instructed us to dig in to the rocks to get to the sand and put our bags over our heads to protect ourselves from the rocks, (which at this time were still flying over these one hundred foot trees) and we went to sleep.

The craft easily covered the entire golf course which it hovered over.  There were greenish/bluish tinted lines in intricate patterns and designs on the bottom of the craft.  It was not only very long and wide; it was also quite thick from what I could tell.  The golf course was right by the road, so we were near directly underneath the craft.

((NUFORC Note:  We usually do not post predictions, given that they rarely, if ever, have proven to be accurate.  However, we will post this one, principally because of our liberal policy toward posting reports that are sent to us.  PD)) Hello. I am an active psychic and tarot card reader on a popular psychic site. Several of our psychics have been witnessing a strange event with our clients.  At first we believed to this to be nothing more than the common troll you run across online.  After reading into it and pulling the cards, numerously those of us using the Americanzed decks were pulling nines of gags, suggesting a trickster spirit was at hand.  When those of us in orient switched to our tibetan decks we were pulling the fours of chan, a popular folklore hero who was known to worship trickster spirits.  We decided to do a remote reading session which revealed some troubling things.  After a field trip on the astral plane we did discover that something is going on and someone is messing with the minds of citizens of our planet.  What I am about to reveal is not only troubling but is a cause for alarm. On March 23 of 2012.  There will be a massive sighting of 4 red lights in the sky, they will blink for a few seconds, following will be a bright flash of light.  The light will be so intense people will be forced to protect their eyes.  From the point in the sky where this flash occurs there will be a long trail in the sky. It will resemble an airplanes chemtrail but much bigger and glowing as if it is more than condensed water. Gary, Fae, Angel, Linden, Isiah, Warlock, and myself do not believe these are aliens as will be suggested by many.  It is to our understanding that this is infact a government cover up.  These lights are a signal to the people who have had their minds tampered with.  A sorta light switch will be turned on that will cause people to react differently than they normally would.  What it's entire intent is, we do not know.  We do know not everyone will be affected nor will everyone see the lights. We wish to warn people and make them aware of this event.  We're not sure what will occur if anything at all. Nor do we legitly believe this is a doom and gloom situtation.  The basis of the entire thing seems to be linked to the mental tamperings done by our Government.  We suggest everyone prepare themselves just encase. God speed and love for all.

The white lights blinked back and forth quickly and the the blinked once every few times the white ones alternated.  A green light that bursted three blinks at a time was located between the white lights along that side of the triangle. Upon first seeing the craft it was stationary.  It moved the first time real quickly from its sitting position like it had no need to build thrust with the air like a hovering helicopter would have to do.  It only moved a short distance and stopped again.  I had meanwhile called my cousin to see if he could see it but his house was too far away to view the object probably due to the object not being high enough in the air and clouds.  I also had pulled over into a parking lot so I could remain seeing it as long as possible. When I pulled over it moved slowly but at a decent rate southward.  My wife and eye watched it for another minute or so as it moved behind trees in the distance.  We didn't want to actually believe we saw that but the fact is we did and I felt it needed reported.  Others had to have seen the object for sure because many people were out and about but I figured not that many people care enough to report these things.,2012-03-13T00:00:00,27.310734441087614,-82.49044025679758

What came into view was a bright bluish orb, like a star floating through the sky and immediately following it was a second craft, so close it looked like it was chasing the orb. the second craft had three solid lights, one blue one red one green.

If it were not for the tiny blue orb at it's tip it would not have been easily detectable.  It seemed as though this craft was indeed trying to go unnoticed.  The second craft followed so closely it looked like it might catch the first object and I thought to myself how is it avoiding flying directly into the rear of the first object it was hard to tell but I seemed as though the second craft was the one that sounded like a highly advanced and maybe military heli - but I could see in the silhouette it was cigar shaped and not anything like a heli I have ever seen flying at night.  This craft had only three solid lights, nothing flashing as I have seen all other heli's do in my area and it seemed to be chasing the first object. The crafts were so low they looked like they were about to land in a field on the other side of the street but they didn't.  I just kept thinking what is that first craft doing flying so low with no lights on?! And why is this other craft chasing it?!  I know in my gut these were not airplanes nor helicopters. The craft disappeared over the trees. I came into the house to tell my boyfriend and he beat me to saying that he also heard the low flying craft, yet knew from the sound it didn't sound like any plane or helicopter.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,41.67601576576577,-72.78116171171172

Weird jelly fish like spacecrafts As I was on the way to pick up my mother from the Memphis international airport, I witnessed a strange object in the southwestern sky. At first I thought it might of been a weird drift of a cloud that drifted away from the cloud mass. As I was observing it closer I could tell it was definately not a cloud. It was a long and slim. It seemed to have a rounded front and what seemed to be long tentacle like rods coming out the backside. My 5 year old witnessed it and said it was a jellyfish, and no doubt it looked like a metal machine jellyfish. But it seemed like it was south of the airport but within 50 miles of it. It did not move it seemed as though it was hovering. I know what an airplane looks like becuase there were many airplanes in the sky at this time and it was not an airplane! As we observed this strange object we found two more that were very close to this one. They created a line that  seemed to lead to the Mississippi river. By this time we were f! reaking out and as we approached a tree line, we couldn't see them for less than 10 seconds, when the trees cleared they were gone, nowhere to be seen, as if they vanished into thin air.

Last night at approximately 1930 I was driving home from work, going east, and noticed a formation of what I originally thought as stars in the sky to my right.  As I approached the formation, I realized each individual object was much too large to be a star. I then pulled my vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway where there were three other cars parked. The drivers of the cars and myself stood on the side of the road and looked into the sky.  One of the drivers counted 30 objects.  The formation was in the sky approximately at the height of what an airplane would fly and was moving very slowly as a unit from south to north.  There was no noise and the unit appeared to be “floating”.  Gradually, each bright light would fade out as it moved to a certain point.  Finally, the last bright light faded out but came back to partial light again, showing the formation of what appeared to be a disc with lights encompassing it.  Gradually, this object once again faded out, with the duration of visibility being approximately 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be exceptionally sober-minded and objective, in her description of the sighting.

These lights appeared to be located a couple miles south of our location at an altitude of approx. 2000 ft., probably slightly to the west of  Rt 16. We saw two (2) orange lights (somewhat brighter than stars)  moving very slowly in a southbound direction, then spotted a third light traveling from a west to east direction (also traveling slowly).  There was some distance between the two original lights; about the width of your thumb if holding it up toward the sky.  After a couple minutes, the southern-most light was no longer visible, then the other one also disappeared.  This left the third light still in sight.  This light now turned and headed north toward us. We were hoping that it would pass over us so we could get a better look, but it turned south again and disappeared after a few minutes. I have no idea what these lights were, but I did wonder if they were flames suspended below small balloons.  The only problem with this theory is that they changed direction. How would two move north to south, and a third move west to east, then head north before turning 180 degrees and heading south?

So a couple weeks ago I was at a friend’s house and we were sitting in his car smoking a cigarette on the driveway facing north.  This was around 10:30 PM, and the location is at Shelby Township, 21 and Van Dyke to be exact.  I look in the sky and all I see is 2 glowing orbs flashing two distinct colors, orange and blue. These had to be at least 30,000 feet in the air, and they were moving so abnormal that’s when I realized they cannot be of human origin.  There was no way, one was moving vertically up and down continuously, the other was moving horizontally very rapidly, that’s the best I can describe it, bottom line is they were moving in a way no modern aircraft can. I regret not pulling out my phone and recording, but I was honestly in shock, I did not know what the hell I was looking at, it was something I had never seen before in my life.  They kept doing these abnormal maneuvers for about 15 seconds, then suddenly they started elevating to a higher elevation. All of the sudden they zipped across the sky going north is such indescribable speed, literally zoomed out of our view so fast that it only took about 3 seconds.  This is what really got me thinking, I am not a person who has been neither interested nor cared about UFO’s but those aircrafts or whatever did I see where not of mankind.  Man-made aircraft cannot conduct such maneuvers in such a closed area, or travel at such velocity that’s why I decided to report this, hopefully someone else saw this in the area to show that I’m not losing my mind.

The sky was clear so i could see around the object, it seemed narrow from front to rear.

If memory serves me correct, I was past the midway point from exit 80 to exit 49. I am the only witness that I know of. That morning, I drove past electric banners displaying messages for me to slow down.   At some point, I noticed a blinking white light off in the distance.  I thought it might have been a light pole or one of those radio towers.  However, radio tower lights are usually red in color and light poles usual don't blink on and off. Next I assumed it was some kind of special speed sensor.   Anyone who's been on i-75 knows there are banners posted along the entire interstate cautioning drivers to slow down.  As it was still dark out, I couldn't see the banners until right before I passed them, naturally I drove the speed limit. Lost in thought and what seemed like forever, I realize that I didn't seem to gain any sort of distance on the blinking light.  I became slightly curious as to why and what kind of light this was, as there is none on the highway and certainly none I have seen behaving like that. I sped up to 90mph out of curiosity so I could slow down when I approached the light.   As I gained distance, I leaned forward to look up and what I saw was a ""triangular shaped object"" with lots of light patterns that looked like they were from the movie Tron.  There were lines of light and half circle patterned lights connecting the lines.  The object in question was VERY detailed from my perspective and it could not be too far off the ground.  Perhaps 50-100 feet?  The sight of the object covered one quarter of my sight from the driver's point of view.  I slowed down dramatically and looked at my dog in disbelief.  I looked up again to confirm what I was seeing.  Then I looked behind me to see if there were any cars behind me... which there wasn't.  Instead, I quickly scanned in front of me for cars... and there were none either.  I looked up again and it was gone. I slowed down to 45 mph while keeping my eyes peeled and waited for the blinking to happen.  There were no signs; it simply vanished.  There were no such audible noises either. I find it hard to believe how the object projected a blinking light because the lights I saw were underneath the craft (which seemed flat) and while I had my eyes on them, they did not blink.  I'm not sure if there were lights on the side or on top that caused the blinking.  From a distance, the blinking appeared to be bright, steady, and fading in and out at 3-5 second intervals. Also note, my car did not experience any interference and my dog did not behave strangely.  I do not believe the craft to be malicious?   I googled my experience and have not seen a report of lights simular to what I saw that morning. I am positive what I saw is not an aircraft.  I am in the military and have worked on an aircraft carrier for 5 years and I still work at an air station.  I know what aircrafts look like at night, how they take off and how they land.  I know how helos look like, how they look in the air at night, how they take off and land.  I've seen hundreds of aircrafts and their associated behaviors.  I don't know what this object is though.  I hope someone can shed some light on this report.  I'm interested to find out more.  Before I forget, I'm also hesitant to drive i-75 at night anymore, but next time I'm out there, I'll bring a camera.",2011-10-19T00:00:00,,

First off I would like to thank this website for giving me the opportunity to share this bazaar story-thank you. This event took place in my home in Orange County California, between 4:00 and 4:30 am.  I was aloneisa in my room trying to fall asleep but was having a bit of trouble due to the fact that I work a night job, and its difficult for me to fall asleep before the sun comes up (this was my night off by the way) so I'm just laying on my bed, just staring at the ceiling.  Now, my room is totally pitch dark because of these huge curtains that block out the sun during the day. As I'm staring at the ceiling, I have this sudden ""urge"" to look to my left were my television is up against the wall.  As I looked for about two maybe three seconds, I saw and heard two separate flashes of light along with two almost silent beeps simultaneously directly above my t.v. maybe about an inch or two above. the light was just pure light that's the only way I can explain it, no color, just white light. The first thing I say to myself is ""what's my cell phone doing over by my t.v?  "" When I got up to investigate I found nothing there.  No cell phone, nothing electronic in that area at all. My television wasn't even plugged in at the time.  I don't have much more to say about this other then I've thought out all possibilities and I just can't explain it.  It wasn't frightening at all, I was more in awe, just fascinated by the event. I then took a walk around my neighborhood just to think things out but then returned home and fell asleep.in the living room.  That is all   Thank you very much for reading, and showing intrest. This is my first experience like this by the way. I'm just an average 22 year old who works and goes to school like most young men my age.  I grew up here in Orange County California my whole life and I've never seen anything like this.  Thank you!",2011-10-19T00:00:00,33.87742158730159,-117.92497841269841

I asked my neighbor and husband who were also outside talking if they could see it, and my neighbor said he could, but it was hard to tell, because he was getting a migraine.

On Tuesday, October 4th I was walking east to our car as I had just left my cousin’s football practice on the campus of Handong Global University in Pohang, South Korea. As I was walking, I observed many of the students (over 30 of them) stopped in the middle of the street staring, pointing, and taking pictures of the sky. This was just around 8:30pm and the sun had set a while ago. I stopped to see what they were looking at when I noticed about 10 soft floating light suspended in the sky. I took a few pictures from that spot [location 1] and then tried to get a better look by moving to the other side of the building (since I could barely see them, as they were blocked by trees and a dormitory). I walked to the other side of the dormitory [location 2] and took a few more pictures. Still I could not get a good enough view. I then walked east a bit more and walked down a path through the trees that led me to a field where I had an unobstructed view of the lights [location 3]. As time progressed the amount of lights grew from around 10 to a final count of over 70. The lights were soft and in the shape of a sliver. They did not move up or down, nor side to side. They just hovered in the sky. Some were white while most were yellow/amber with a handful of them almost chartreuse in hue. They looked like a distant street lamp seen through the fog. I didn’t see any certain point of light, just a glow. I could not tell if the “sliver” shape were light flares or if it was the actual shape of the object (all of the lights kept the exact same shape). I took a few more images of these lights from the field before my cousin called me to tell me that we had to go. My cousin tried to tell me that these were military flares, but I have seen military flares before and they looked nothing like these lights.  These lights did not move!   At this point, we drove back to his house in Pohang, which was about 10 minutes away from the campus.  He dropped me off two blocks away from his house at my hotel.  When I got back to my room, I told my friend who has been traveling in Korea with me about the lights and showed him my pictures.  He was as dumbfounded as I was. After an hour we left the hotel and walked over to my cousins house.  As we were walking we noticed the same lights now hovering above us. At this point, my friend took some pictures with his camera, but recently lost that camera in a taxi here in Seoul. I have attached some of my photos in a separate email.",2011-10-19T00:00:00,,

They seemed to be light red paper with some sort of wire framework which gave the object shape and held an open fire propulsion source at the bottom (sort of like on that episode of Macgyver).  2 of the objects were released a minute or so apart and followed almost the exact same path in line with the wind.  They kind of caught me by surprise and I neglected to watch the entire trajectory of the lanterns and didn't see what happened once they burnt out or how high they were at their apex.  I didn't want to miss meteors by watching the fireworks!  I witnessed a line of 4 or 5 objects/fireballs of what I assume to be the same sort of firework while I was at a local park in Cincinnati(no firework display in the park itself that evening) on July 4th though they were more distant.  Those were lights/fireballs that just kind of burnt out after a few minutes after a slow ascension in the air on roughly the same path.  While I haven't read all the reports, I think a lot of people could be seeing these things on part of their trajectory and just don't realize they're new fireworks.  I made a report on July 3rd  last year, and while I still think that report could be something else, it also could have been something similar to these lanterns seen at an odd angle.  I think the whole point of the firework is just to launch something glowing into the air and see how far it goes before it burns out.

This light caught our attention because it was so bright and it did not have any of the light characteristics of the other stars that were out.   It did not have any flashing lights like an airplane and it wasn't moving across the sky so it wasn't a commercial or private airplane (imo).  The light wasn't even that high up in the atmosphere like the other airplanes were when I saw a couple that night. What happened next is what really caused our jaws to drop.  The light came speeding down toward earth like it was going to crash (I really expected a loud crash sound) but then it swooped up and it disappeared!!

It soon became apparent that it was neither because it didn't have flashing lights like a plane or helicopter.  It sort of pulsed a red orange color.  I thought it was getting closer but I noticed soon after what I thought was a direction of flight was actually just the craft gaining altitude and it went higher and higher and then disappeared.  This object was in our atmosphere and it was close I would say within 10 miles when I first saw it and it went strait out and disappeared.  The strange thing was when I went outside after telling my girlfriend what I saw I saw another one and I called her out and we both witnessed another craft traveling in the exact path as the one before it.  I have been a skeptic my whole life but after what I witnessed tonight I am sure I saw something of an alien nature flying through the sky. It kind of just weaved back and forth as it flew.  It is probably the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed because I thought it was all untrue.  I know this was not a satellite you can track them passing over the earth in a direct line and altitude.  And what I thought was a aircraft traveling through our atmosphere was actually a craft gaining altitude at several thousand feet per second.

My experience with a UFO happened in early spring of 2009. It was a cold day around 1200, I don't smoke in my home so I do it outside.  On this particular day as I was sitting on my steps on my front porch, I noticed that everything got very quiet, maybe muffled is a better description, it was like all the sounds of the town, like traffic, wind, dogs barking etc. sounded    distant and softer, like things sound when there is a heavy fog or heavy snow, but it was quite clear. As I was contemplating this very eery feeling, from the corner of my eye I saw a glint of light, I turned my gaze in the direction of this flash and saw what at first I thought was a constellation of large silver party balloons that had gotten free and were floating away, but as I watched them more closely,  I realized that they were not drifting in any direction and were a uniform shape. It was 4 hockey puck shaped silver lobes connected to each other by some kind of cross member and very large, I would estimate that each lobe was roughly 15' in diameter and the distance of one lobe across to another was an additional 15' making it about 45' across.  The lobes were oriented to each other like four people sitting at a square table with an x connecting one person to the person sitting directly across from them. It was hovering perfectly still and noiseless about 200 yards to the northeast of my position and about 150 feet off the ground, right in the middle of town in the middle of a week day. It took 20 or 30 seconds for my mind to catch up with my eyes, after all I was not expecting to ever see anything like this so I think my comprehension of it was a bit delayed.  But as soon as I collected my wits, I realized I needed to get a picture of it, so I hurried  into my house to get my camera, a Kodak easy share 3.2 megapixel,  I don't recall what setting it was on.   Once I retrieved the camera I ran back outside, turned it on and snapped a picture, I tried to take more pictures but to my dismay the SD memory was full after the picture I took, I had to go through and delete some other pictures so I could have more space to take a few more pictures and maybe a movie of it, but as I scrambled to do this, I glanced up just in time to witness it zip away. This thing moved away to the north so fast it was completely out of sight in 2 or 3 seconds,  I won't even speculate about the speed, but it was very, very fast, also, it did this from a dead stop and absolutely noiselessly. Immediately after I lost sight of it, the muffled dull feeling lifted away and everything became very crisp and clear again and I noticed my heart was pounding so hard and so fast that I could literally feel and hear it through my heavy winter coat, I was very excited. At first I wanted to show everyone the great picture I took, so I uploaded it to my Facebook page, but that is all I did because, oddly, I received no comments about it, so I figured no-one thought it was real,   I shared the photo and the story only with my immediate family, until now, since then I have moved to a different, larger city where the chance of ridicule is lessened. Sadly, I put the SD card with the original photo in a safe place so I would not lose it, but there was a fire and it was destroyed, that is actually why I moved.  I think I’m more annoyed  that I lost that than the fact my house burned down.  At least I have the copy on Facebook witch I will save to my computer and send it along with this report. Everything that I have written down here is true and ac accurate as my memory allows,  I remember it like it happened today. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

She then pointed it out to her sister who looked up and saw it too.  They said the objects were a little higher than the power lines and the just vanished right before their eyes.   Later I came over and I had them tell me the story because they know I’m interested in UFO’s and they both had drew pictures of what they saw.

Later that day around 4:30, I had them ride with me to go do some work at my storage space and one of them screams ""what is that?”""  So I pull over and we all look out the window and see what appears to be a big orange light in the sky.  It appeared to be hovering at first but then we noticed that it was moving steadily but very slowly.  Then we noticed some ways away three jets were heading towards it.  I decided to drive up the road to see if I could get a better look at what we were seeing and we lost sight of it.   So I turned around and went back to same spot as before and the object was still there but there was no sign of the jets.  We didn’t see what happened but they were gone.

We had just seen the new Woody Allen movie and were talking about what a fun movie it was, when I saw something strange in the sky at 12 o’clock in front of us which would have been to the east.  It was this strange glowing light in the middle of a noticeably dark night sky.  This bright yellow and orange light had a wave-like shape, curving upward in the center and hazily fading out at its sides. At first, my mind tried to search for possible explanations.  I first looked behind me to see if it could be a reflection of something off the clouds, like the moon perhaps.  But I could not find anything that would make sense to give it that color or shape.  Then I thought it might be a radio tower or street lamp (It seemed, at first, to be close enough to the ground for these options to be feasible), but the light was too bright and big to be either.   So I pointed the object out to my mom to see what she could come up with.  And that’s when the strangest thing happened;   Out from the bottom right of the object appeared a small, highly-defined white orb that just seemed to hover beneath the larger, foggy light.  The contrast between the haziness of the yellow and orange light and the sharpness of the defined white orb was incredible, and perplexing.  The orb hovered very slowly, and free-flowingly from the bottom right side of the larger light fixture to the bottom left of it, treaded there a moment, then freely moved to the center, bellow the ""crest"" of the wave-like object.  After staying there a bit it, it then moved to the bottom left again and seemed to go behind the larger light- only to reappear a few moments later at the top right of the ""wave"" light. At this point, my mother and I had concluded that it could not have been a plane.  The object did not make any noise and the movement was to free and loose- almost as though it were swimming.  And all of a sudden, as if I just knew (and I did, I just felt like I knew), I told my mother, ""Watch, it’s gonna disappear.  Watch it disappear."" Sure enough, a few beats later, the object began to disappear very slowly, from the outside in.  And, poof, gone.  There was nothing more.   My mother and I tried all night to figure out some sort of explanation to stray away of the conclusion of a UFO, but after talking about all sorts of possibilities, we concluded that there was nothing on earth that either of us had seen in our lifetimes that looked or even resembled what we saw that night in the sky that night.  And even the way that orb was moving- there’s nothing in our technology that could allow us to control a craft in that way. I couldn't believe I wasn't the only one to see this.  There were two of us. And after separately (in different rooms) drawing out what we had seen, we confirmed that what we saw that night was exactly the same thing, and it was unlike anything else our eyes had ever witnessed.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,40.8597,-74.4026

At 8:16 PM on Friday, January 27, 2012, a friend called me from Jackson, Tennessee and described some strange lights that he and his son were watching in the sky. I live about 8 miles from him in Medina, Tennessee.  After about 6 or 8 minutes I was able to find the lights he was describing.  They were oval shaped lights (about 6) that were moving in a general counter-clockwise circular pattern and were in the southwest sky close to the moon's position.  There were some clouds in the area of the moon that obscured it.  The lights were reflecting off of these clouds.  I soon identified these as lights from a spotlight since I had seen similar lights rotating in this pattern several years ago (I even drove and found the spotlight in the parking lot of a local club in Jackson). I had called my son, daughter, and wife out to the back porch to check out the lights.  Since I could identify them, I didn't grab a camera.  As we were watching these lights a bright light appeared out of nowhere at approximately 8:30 PM. The light was due south of our location at about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was very bright, mostly steady, solid white but with a reddish/orange pulsating glow around it.  It was traveling directly towards our position. At first I thought it might be a helicopter with its search light on coming straight at us.  However, as it got closer, the light never changed even after it got directly above us. Also, it became apparent that it was actually very high (several miles) and was moving at an extremely high rate of speed.  There was also no sound. It moved in a steady straight path eventually getting to 90 degrees directly above us.  At first I thought that this object was the International Space Station since I have seen it pass over m! any times over the years.  The white part of the light was solid and steady, not blinking, but the outer edges were glowing red and orange with a pulsating action.  The size of the object was also very similar to the size of the station and had a very similar brightness.  However, I have never seen edges like this on the station.  After I came in, I checked the position of the station and it was over Australia. The object continued over our heads and as it got to about 100 or 115 degrees it became reddish/orange only, began to get smaller and smaller until it just blinked out.  My son got my wife's iPhone and did manage to take video of the object after it passed 90 degrees and until it blinked out.  We viewed the object for about 60 seconds from the time we first saw it until it vanished. I am confused about this because of the color and characteristics of the object.  My instinct was that it was a satellite, however, I know of nothing that bright other than the space station and as I said, it was not in our area.  Also, the color was very strange with the pulsating red and orange edges compared to what I have seen of satellites in the past.  I will send the video.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,35.7861,-88.7486

I looked up into the clear night sky and saw a bright blue object with flashing red lights floating up off in the distance.  I stared in disbelief and motioned for my friend to look.  Immediately in my mind I cycled through possible things it could be.  It was not a plane or anything else I could think of.  I could not explain it and stood dumbfounded and questioning if what I was seeing was really happening. I had never seen a UFO before. It stared drifting towards us heading east and it became more visible.  I could see the craft was circular though I could not tell if it was orb or disk shaped. It had bright neon blue lights around the edges and going through the middle.  I couldn’t discern the craft, only the lights surrounding it.  The craft itself was either a dark color or transparent because it blended in with the night sky.  There were flashing red lights positioned around the craft, each light flashing at the same speed but not in unison.  There were probably about five lights, each positioned around the edges of the craft evenly with one in the middle.  The object made no noise and seemed to be a few hundred feet in the air, although it was hard to judge both the size and distance. As I glanced down from the craft which was moving slowly through the sky I saw in the parking lot that there were others looking up and pointing at the sky.  My friend and I ran across the parking lot over to two others who were standing out of there car with there phones pointed at the sky.  We did not know them but talked briefly with them, asking if they were seeing what we were seeing and remarking how weird and incredible it was.  I noticed others on the opposite end of the lot, probably three or four people, who upon seeing us in the middle of the lot with our cell phones, fingers, and eyes cast to the sky turned to look themselves and also saw and stopped to look at the craft.  I did not bother to pull out my phone because I knew the object was to far away to show up on my cheap cell phone camera.  My friend took out his phone but did not get a picture, remarking that the UFO only showed up as a small blue speck. At one point a plane few by in the sky, visually appearing to pass by the object but obviously being much higher and much farther off in the distance. The craft came close to being directly over us before it shifted direction and drifted away heading south.  It was then that we decided to get in our car and head home as it was cold outside, being a January night. That was the last we saw of the object as my friend and I drove away.

All of a sudden my son said, ""What is that in the sky?"" Then he really got scared when it finally moved.  When I first viewed it, it was a HUGE ball of white and appeared totally round in the sky and it was really low.  It didn't appear to be moving but hovering.  Then it slowly moved upward and then stopped. It proceeded to move to the right in the sky (our left) above the trees.  As it moved to the left of us we could see there was a small steady red light that was on the end of this object.  As large as this object was there was absolutely no sound.  It proceeded behind the trees at a very quick speed behind the neighbors yard across the road until it was no longer visible.  What could th! is have been?

With my brother in-law who witnessed the whole event.It is about a mile walk back to my house so I have plenty of time to look at the sky. No city lights for miles makes for great viewing.  This night I could clearly see a large orange light slowly moving to the west.  There was no flashing lights just a steady orange light.  Bigger than the rest of the stars in the sky.  Moving at a steady pace. It moved behind the tree tops, then much to my surprise it stopped dead in its tracks.  The light set steady in one spot for close to 10-15 minutes. Hard to be exact on how long I stood there staring. Through the trees I could see it start to head to the north for maybe 30 seconds then made an immediate upward motion.  The object never left the area it was in and continued to move around the sky in odd movements.  The light never dimmed like a plane or a light that is turning away from you.  Roughly 45 minutes after noticing the object it was suddenly gone. On 3/13/12 I stepped out onto my porch and was simply looking around at how clear the sky was and all the stars.  I looked to my east and noticed the same orange light up in  the sky.  This time it was already doing its funny moving around flying one direction for a few seconds then heading in another.  I yelled for my wife to come outside and see the object I had told her about. We stood out and watched it for a few minutes before I drove down the road to see if it could be a r/c heli or something similar. I drove 3 miles down the road in search of this object.  The object was just like all the rest of the stars in the sky, never got any closer to it.  I turned around realizing it was much farther away than I had thought. It was seen for about an hour total that night.  Again around 8 or 9 pm. On 3/14/12 I was out fishing again til just after dark with my brother in-law again.  This time I was looking for it.  The light was in the same general direction moving around behind the tree tops.  Makes it easier to see its movements.  This night myself and 3 others wife, brother in-law, and his wife all seen the light. There wasn't ever any sound associated with this light or any other flashing with the light.

Saw it for about 1 second before it ""cloaked"". I was walking my dog on the evening of March 13, 2012 at 8:30pm. I walk her around the school, which is located behind my house.  There is a large field with baseball diamonds etc. I was checking out the Venus/Jupiter view constantly as I walked because I thought it was really cool to see them so bright and close.  There were also absolutely no clouds in the sky.  Towards the end of our walk, I was in an area where there was no light so it was pretty dark area.  I looked up to check out the planets again and immediately saw what my brain told me was an airplane.  Then after about 1 second it disappeared.  The way it disappeared was a little alarming because it didn’t “zoom off” as the way most people describe. The best way I could describe is that it looked like it had “cloaked” it self.  It was there and the seemed to quickly dissolve from the front to the back.  The object was moving forward, the same speed a plane would move and there was no sound and no other mo! ving objects in the sky where I was looking.  We have a lot of airplane traffic above my house that are sometimes pretty low and that’s what I thought I was seeing.  Once I saw what looked like it had cloaked,  I immediately stopped walking and stood still to really observe what I saw.  There was nothing in the sky. I kept searching for what I saw but nothing.  I then started to try to debunk what I saw.  There are large lights in the field to light up the baseball diamonds but I cannot see any light from them from the vantage point due to being on the opposite side of the school and blocked by the building.  The object I saw would have been positioned as if they were above these lights.  So I was seeing this object above the school building and lights.  I then stepped back from where I spotted the object about 3 or 4 steps and I could see the tops of the lights.  I thought maybe there is a beam of light that is shooting upwards, but all of the lights point down to the baseball fields.  The only thing I could think of is that something flown above the lights and was illuminated for a second by a light beam, but the sky was so clear I would have been able to see the object beyond the beam.  It was also up to high for any beam of light to illuminate it.  There was no sound and it looked like a plane, and it had a few lights on it.  I thought maybe it was a crane since this is near the water and I have seen cranes nesting up on the lights before, but again it was up higher than that for it to be a crane, it was too large to be a bird like a crane also.  And again I would have been able to see it beyond any lights since the sky was so clear.  The object was like a small plane with no wings and lights. The best way I can recall the shape is the shape of the ship in the video game r-type (http://www.gamechronicles.com/reviews/ps2/rtype/ship2.gif).  The ship would have been facing the opposite direction and moving away but at the same angle.  I did stand there for a good 2 or 3 minutes without moving just so I could really see if anything else happened.  I did not see anything else after that.",2012-03-16T00:00:00,39.2575,-76.4951

It was around 22:10 when me and a friend walked outside of his house to go on a car ride with a friend when we saw two white lights in the sky in the eastern direction that appeared to be standing still. we were amazed and we automatically thought it was a ufo. we then got in the car and we were going to drive southwest up to a nearby hill to get a better look. as we were driving we noticed that the lights started moving very fast in towards our direction and appeared to be weaving around eachother and flashing different colors such as red and purple. for a second they looked like two saucers then as we were driving further up the hill the lights slowed down and began to move north. as they slowed down they into just two red blinking lights. we noticed that at this point that the lights looked connected   as if they were possibly one craft. every time the lights would blink it looked like thin beams of light would hit the ground from the blinking lights. the object or objects was moving very slowly north with what appeared to look like a gray haze around it and looked like it was getting lower to the ground then higher away from the ground and looked as if it were tilting. the lights continued to move north slowly until it was too far for us to see it.   What makes me believe this was a ufo was the fact that at first these lights were very still and weren't moving at all then started too move faster then any craft ive seen then slowed way down all of a sudden.  I don't think i've ever seen a normal flying object meneuver the way i say this one meneuver. hopefully more people witnessed  and reported this because this was a very unusual event.

This is an area of the road which is not well lit and has a lot of trees.   It was just at sunset.  There was a slight bit of sunlight left behind the craft, as this was west.  At this point, I could not see the object very well because the angle from being in the driver’s seat, could not see what shape it had and could only the edge.   At first I doubted I was seeing anything due to the lack of lighting visible on or under it and the low sunlight.  It appeared very dark, and I did not notice any sunlight reflecting off the body of it.   As it continued to stay even with my car, I realized there truly was something there and marveled that a plane would fly so low without lights.  I couldn’t be sure how high it was, but could tell it seemed fairly close to the tree tops.  I assumed it was a plane, as an airport is close by. As I moved closer to the intersection, the craft veered off to the right away from the road at a 45 degree angle.  I remember thinking how odd that a plane could turn so fast and assumed that whatever it was had left and I wouldn’t see it again.  This whole event lasted maybe a minute or two. After I turned onto Hwy 82, I realized I could see the object flying along the highway.  Interested, I sped up and moved closer to it.  I stayed a little behind it so as to try and get a better look at it.   At this time I noticed that instead of defined wings, it was a solid triangular shape, simular to a stealth fighter plane.  But unlike the stealth, this craft was longer and less acute of an angle.  The edges and corners were rounded, not pointed.  I couldn't see a bump for a pilot's seat. it had a slight increase in depth from front to back.  There were no jet engines that I could see or hear.  At this point I had rolled down the window to listen.  The only lights I could see were two blue round lights, or something like lights, located on the bottom.  At this point I realized that it was odd to be able to pace something flying.  I don’t know a lot about planes, but I would think they need to fly faster than the 60 mph.

It wasnt a shooting star because it didnt curve, it kept a steady streaming pace.

I couldn't tell how high in the sky it was, but it was brighter than the north star and larger, so it was probably lower.  It was moving at a good rate of speed, but much slower than a satellite, faster than a passenger jet.  I thought it may have been a satellite, but if it was it was enormous.

(And they probably shouldn't be flying into Canadian airspace, but they do.)  This was quite different. While the first orange sphere proceeded across the sky in a straight path, two more appeared behind it, one on either side, then another two, and finally one at the tail end.  So kind of a formation, maybe a pentangle shape.  This kind of freaked us both out. All of them appeared to be travelling together, same rate of speed. They continued east to west until we could no longer see them. There was absolutely no sound at all. They were very round, but at the rear end (facing east) they looked blurry.  Strangest thing we have ever seen! Too bad nobody can actually say what they are.",2011-10-19T00:00:00,44.3333,-76.1667

When we arrived at a clearing, we saw orange lights hovering in the sky, moving in very slow formation.  By the time I was able to get my cell phone to record the event, we counted 7 objects in the sky.  They seemed round and bright orange and seemed to dim out and disappear.  Duration was about 2 minutes. Two minutes later, at 00:00 10-9-11, we saw a single UFO moving toward us slowly. It was closer this time. The best description I can give is that it looked like a rectangular orange lantern floating in the sky even though we knew definitely that it wasn't a lantern. It was longer vertically and at the center was a brighter spherical light, perhaps the craft itself. The rectangular shape was more like a light surrounding the craft and not the craft itself. It soon dimmed out and with the naked eye we could still see, faintly, the spherical center moving across the sky. Almost like it turned the light off that gave it a rectangular aura. Then it disappeared. At 00:05 10-9-11, another single UFO appeared and seemed to float across the sky before dimming out again. Again orange and like a rectangular lantern with a brighter spherical core. There was never any sound. There was no wind, the night was relatively clear with low cloud in certain parts. When the singular craft moved toward us at 00:00, we could also make out a kind of reflection of white light behind it on the bottom of the cloud. Almost like if one would shine a headlight up toward the cloud. I have posted the videos I took from my Droid3 phone onto Youtube. The cell phone videos don't do justice to what we saw with our own eyes. But at least it was recorded! Here are the links for your review. I couldn't figure out a way to send it via email because the file sizes are too big. I work in sales/promotions at the Los Angeles Times and the security guard was an MP in the army during his tour in Iraq.

This one went in a westerly direction.  Then the large one did a dip toward ground, brought itself up vertical and started spinning in a 360 degree motion and had a blue shield around it.

It was one of 3 UFO's.  As my girlfriend and I sat outside tending to our garage sale waiting for people, I glanced into the sky.  A shiny object flickering in the clouds caught my eye and so I told her to look at it. We both looked at the object for about 5 minutes while it seemed to shimmer or flickering the sun light while staying perfectly still in one spot.  I told her to go get her Camera as my iphone wouldn’t be adequate to actually get any discernable video out of. The one we took video of was Stationary for 20 minutes  in the sky around the same height or a little bit higher than the Chemtrails that were being sprayed at the time of filming.  Looking at it intently we made out two films before the fully charged camera stated running low on battery then the cam died, but we kept watching.  The Object then started drifting northwest very slowly becoming obscured by trees. I walked down the sidewalk heading east and found the object to be still visible from a couple houses away. We started wrapping up our garage sale and I went around the neighbor hood in my car to go fetch the signs. When I arrived back, I went to go check if I could see if I could see the object again.  I had found it again this time further away than I had last seen it.  I walk back to our original viewing spot of the first on and now in the sky was a 2nd object that looked identical to the first appearing around where the first one had appeared.  I put up a piece of wood and aligned it with the power line as a reference point to see if the object was moving in any direction so I could determine its movement pattern to rule out if it was a balloon or something caught in the upper winds.  While looking at the 2nd object after a minute or two it started drifting southwest at a slow steady pace in a completely different direction from the original object.  As it started drifting I noticed a very faint 3rd object to the right of it that slowly dimmed out after 4 minutes.  Then the 2nd ob! ject that was traveling southwest slowed coming to a stop.  It was at this time while I was observing the 2nd Shiny Silent shimmering object being stationary once again, that a 4th object seemed to appear right where the 2nd object was.  This 4th object seemed a bit closer and started moving at a much faster rate.   I moved off fast in a more westerly direction through the clouds off into the distance.  The 2nd UFO stayed in it's respective spot indefinitely. Since we had got the original footage and looked at all this action for about 45 minutes or more, we felt we had gotten our fill of these objects.  We cleaned up the rest of the garage sale stuff and went on about our day. I’m post a video of the first object.  The camera ran out of battery after taking 8 minutes of footage. This is around 2 minutes of it. Funny thing about this day was, that we had gotten into a conversation with some one whom stopped by at the sale, about 2012 and the new age that is beginning.  Although I believe the action we saw was more related to the Super heavy tandem planes spraying the skies this day. http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=3208984744436",2012-02-10T00:00:00,33.68843322932917,-118.00499422776912

It was not completely dark yet, but more on the dusk side so I walked over to the door and peeked out the window to take another look as it did not appear to be an airplane.  What I saw were these incredible bright, huge lights, bright and deep blue, and a bright almost pink red, the lights appeared almost bigger than the craft.  The craft seemed to be very large and a disc shape.  I would say it looked about half the size of the moon if I were to try and compare it to something.  I think what startled me were the huge beautiful lights, then I realize no planes ever fly in this path, nor helicopters, the object also sat still without moving and then it moved to the left and back very ! quickly.  I ran out the door onto our street and started to scream for my daughter to come outside (although she is young I wanted her to see this as well) as I turned the object was so bright barely moving and then it shot down toward earth, and when this thing came down it was if it were going thru a tunnel at the speed of light.  I have no idea what happened but it did not look like it was in the midst of a crash, and I have no idea if it even landed, all I know is it shot down toward earth and that was the last I saw of it.   It was absolutely unbelievable. From where I was standing and where our house is located I can guess that this object was over the mountains and or close to if not over the ocean. It was really the most unbelievable sight I have ever seen!!  I am not one to go around talking about aliens or ufo’s but I can say without a shadow of a doubt that what I witnessed tonight was not a plane, not a helicopter, and not a balloon.  The way this thing moved, how fast it moved, and the fact that it would move side to side and then sit still in the sky tells me it was without a doubt a ufo/unidentified flying object.  Not to mention the size of this thing and the colorful huge lights that were surrounding this object. I would love to know if anyone else out in Marin looked up in the sky tonight and witnessed something strange as I did?

There were several airplanes headed toward the airport which is only 10 miles from us) and these lights appeared much lower and slower in speed, and the lights were moving independently of each other at first, but continuously circling around each other yet maintaining a straight consistent travel pattern.  As they passed over our house, the lights moved even closer together and were in such synch with each other in movement.  For some reason the movement reminded me of a boomerang pattern.

I still cannot believe what we saw and it was most definitely not a plane, helicopter, balloon or shooting star.  Also, they made no noise that we cold hear even being as low as they were.

Looking on google at that  date, I was able to find many articles and pictures from other people all over the country, but so far none locally....   Another site I contacted later emailed me and said he had been called by someone that night about 10 miles from us and they reported seeing it as well  Someone else HAD to see it.  There were several planes coming in and it was a relatively clear night… It was just so odd.   It is hard to put into words because it truly was something I have never seen.  Also the lights appeared white or soft yellow and not blue or red like I have seen some people mention.   As it went over us my husband and I both could only stand there in the middle of our yard pointing with our mouths wide open is disbelief...  I honestly STILL can’t wrap my mind around it...   I’ve never been a disbeliever (actually I’ve never had an opinion either way), but I NEVER thought WE would be those people who saw one...whatever it was.   My friends keep joking telling me its swamp gas or a weather balloon...  It was by NO means any type of balloon.  It was flying, albeit gracefully, but not floating... We both keep saying we can’t believe how low it actually was...  I can only guess it/they (cause it appeared 2 be 2 at some point) was only traveling about 35 -50 mph at the point we saw it.  We watched until the trees hid it from our view.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,35.23324977973568,-81.17918458149781

For the last few months, me and my father have been watching the night sky over Vacaville, CA, looking for the ""orange lights/Fireballs"" that have been largely reported over the last year or so.  I've still never witnessed them myself (my father did while on business in Charleston, SC, last month), but I did see something interesting this night.  On June 21st I began looking up at the sky at roughly 10 pm. A few minutes before 11 PM, (I know it was slightly before 11 because of the TV program on in My garage) as I was looking towards the East above my house, I noticed what appeared to be a quite bright star or satellite, moving from South to North, at a slightly faster speed than the satellites I see often. Naturally, I assumed this was a satellite because it appeared to be so far away and had just one solid light (Looked just like a star), but I just kept watching it anyways, as I wasn't even seeing airplanes this night (Which is pretty odd because I live minutes from the Vacaville private Airport, and only 12 miles from Travis AFB.)   After about 20 seconds, the light began to slowly fade and was about to be blocked from my view by trees in my front yard.  So I moved to the side of my house (which faces South) and continued to watch it move North until it completely faded away.  It took roughly 15 seconds for it to go from fading to completely invisible. I didn’t think much of it at first because I know satellites and debris can reflect the sun and create this ""fading light"" effect, but after about 10 seconds the light reappeared almost in the exact same spot it became invisible, this time moving in the complete opposite direction (North to South).  It moved completely the same, in a straight line and at the same slightly faster than a satellite speed.  The fade-in to visibility was much quicker than the fade-out, maybe 5 seconds till it appeared as bright as it was the first time.   I moved to the center of my driveway at this time, still facing East looking over my house.  Then it faded away completely again, only being visible this time for roughly 20 seconds, including the fade time, which was much quicker than the first time (it took only about 6-8 seconds). I kept looking in the same area where it disappeared this time (which was directly above my house, about half the distance from where it originated), still facing East, when it reappeared yet a third Time, this time moving either up or West/slightly north (It was hard to tell because of how high it was in My view).  It continued moving the same as previously, and was visible for about the same amount of Time as the second time before fading away completely.  This all happened under 2 minutes.  I figured it would continue to do this (or hoped I should say), so I ran into my house from the drive way through the Garage to get my Father. We ran out into the center of the driveway and looked East at the area where I had just seen it 2 minutes earlier, but did not see anything.  Then about 12 minutes later, my dad spotted it directly above our heads, moving from East to West in the same manner as before, short fade in to a longer fade out. It was longer visible after about 20 seconds.  I looked at my phone for time, and it was 11:14 PM.  We continued to search for about an hour, then we gave up. The whole thing has really got me interested in finding out what me and my father saw.  If there is a good explanation, I would really like to hear it, or if anyone else saw this or has seen this in the Solano County Area, I would also really like to know.

The noise quickly faded and there were about 12 glowing lights and 3 or so black disc shaped craft flying with them all silently.   The lights started to fade out revealing they were all black disc like craft.  The lights would either fade out or dim down to one point on the disc, they all flew in the same direction with no noise.

As we viewed the night sky my brother whispered, ""Do you see that?""   And as I followed his finger I saw what he was asking about.   At first it looked like a star but it flashed orange, red, yellow and a lime green color.  I've seen stars that flash colors but have always known them to be satellites or far off aircraft; this particular star moved in zig-zagging motions.  It zipped in a "" Z""-like pattern, very quickly, then vanished below the tree line and out of sight. We continued watching the night sky and then saw two more ""stars"" flying in the same pattern and flashing the same colors.  We were not under the influence of alcohol, or any other substance, but seeing those strange objects made us feel like we were because it just felt so strange. My brother is a college student and I'm a recent college graduate.  We both heavily enjoy outdoor activities and have never seen anything remotely UFO-ish until just a few days ago.

I was lying down on my chaise star gazing, as I do every clear night, looking northeast.   Something large and low suddenly caught my eye to the southwest.  As I was turning my head I thought I was going to see a bird, until my eyes locked onto the object. Three gray/translucent perfectly equidistant disks connected by lines/bars flew slowly and silently overhead, then completely disappeared before a tree positioned to my left (northeast).  The size of each disk was apparent 1 degree in diameter.   My mind was quickly running through all of the things it could have been; tethered balloons?  No, flying perfectly aligned together, never breaking formation.  Remote-controlled toy?  No, it was translucent with a dull luminescence and the way it was flying was just too odd and absolutely disappeared in flight.  The only way I can explain its appearance and flight path is as if I was looking at the back end of a vehicle in flight, but couldn't see the front body of it.   It only was visible for about 5-6 seconds then completely disappeared BEFORE it would've gone behind a tree.  I'm really not sure of the height, but it looked about 200-500 feet in the air; hard to tell because of its translucency.  Unfortunately, by the time my son looked up it was already gone. I've been an avid star watcher for a few years, so I know what is normally in the sky.  I know which are satellites, iridium flares, space station, stars, planets, planes, helicopters, etc.  This really was nothing I've ever seen before. My other grown son and couple of his friends have also seen transparent low flying crafts at the height of 200 ft (explains the craft as cigar shaped, transparent as if looking through a heat wave & having 3 gill shaped lights on the underbelly) late at night at our house; 1 last year and 1 about 2 years ago.   Three yrs ago, my grown daughter and her friend were lying on the roof.  They saw an enormous triangular black craft with a white light at each corner (she explains it as about the size of her hand at arm's length) fly directly, silently over them at approx. 600-1000 ft high.  It scared them so much they were crying hysterically and ran inside.   My kids and I are truly objective, grounded people who I believe have just seen very unusual things.  I work as an analyst, so it's my job to be observant, analytical and objective. I would very much like to know if anyone else saw it or have ever seen anything like what I've described.  I've attached a drawing of what I saw at my perspective lying down on my back; porch overhang to my right/southwest (where I first spotted it), tree to my left/northeast (where it disappeared PRIOR to the tree).  Hope the visual helps.   Thanks for your time.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,38.693050422535215,-121.29238225352114

It was approximately 9:45 PM in the evening.  My brother-in-law and niece were with me.  We had just finished extinguishing a campfire down his hill on Bear Lake and just brought our supplies into the house.  We needed to pick up a few things outside so all three of us proceeded out to the front of the house. This is when I noticed a orange light in the night sky.  (It was a dark orange color but bight in appearance)  From our position it was west/southwest of us somewhere just north of the Muskegon channel that connects Muskegon Lake to Lake Michigan.  It was moving in an easterly direction at a slow but steady pace.  There were no blinking lights on it.  I watched it closely and only noticed a slight variation in the overall luminosity of the object.  I wouldn’t call it a steady pulse, but there was a constant change (ever so slightly) in it’s brightness. I called out to my brother-in -law and niece who were only 10 feet away.  I asked them what that light was.  They both watched it with me for a good 30 seconds.  We all agreed that there were no blinking lights (as you would see on an airplane), there was no sound from the object and it was like nothing any of us had ever seen. After the initial 30 seconds the orange object changed directions heading in a south/southeasterly direction and even appeared to rise up slightly.  After about 10 seconds it disappeared.  There were a few clouds in the night sky and it was hard to tell if this first light vanished or went behind a cloud.  It was too dark to see the clouds. The three of us continued to look for the object for a few seconds and then immediately began talking about what we had just seen.  After about 30 - 60 seconds... to our surprise a second bright orange light appeared very close to where the first orange light had originally appeared in the night sky.  My niece ran inside and told other family members to come outside and see the object.  My wife, sister-in-law and 2 other children came out.  They all watched the object with us. This second orange object/light followed a similar path but did extend its easterly path a bit further than the first light.  It held this course for about 50 - 60 seconds also.   It then turned to a south/southeast coarse for roughly 10-15 seconds and then disappeared.  None of the family members had ever seen any lights like these in the area or their lives.   My wife is a true skeptic of UFO’s and aliens and was willing to acknowledge to me that it was some sort of a unidentified flying object.  That admission is about as good as I’m going to get out of her. Points discussed after the sighting:  Did we see 2 objects or 1 object that circled around and reappeared in the same location.  The group decided that (if the first object maintained the same speed) that it was to far for it to return to the original location and reappear in the amount of time that had transpired. The Muskegon County Airport runways, located to the south of the sighting, do not line up with the objects coarse/direction.  The objects never appeared to be coming down to land or taking off from the ground.  Although it is hard to determine the 2 objects exact elevation, I would estimate them to have been between 5,000 feet - 10,000 feet in the air.  All of us see planes in the air (at lower elevations) around Muskegon every day and night.  We also see planes way up in the sky traveling at 25,000 feet to 30,000 feet traveling across the country.  All of us agreed... these 2 objects weren’t planes.  They were like nothing we had ever seen.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,,

I was heading east on my way to work that nite.  I had been scanning the skies for the past few nites looking for sattelites.  As I approached a stop light I looked to my left, (south), when I noticed  an unusually bright light fairly low in the sky.  It really caught my attention beacuse it was so bright.   At first I thought it to be a passenger jet due to the fact that we are within miles of an intrenantional air port..  But the color of the light was quite different from other air craft that were traveling through the skies at that time...   My second thought was that it must have been a hellicopter with its search light on.   As I watched it for a few seconds, I noticed that it was moving rather quickly across the sky heading in a north eastern direction.  I began to think, ""What is that?????""   As i continued to watch it, I noticed that there were no other blinking lights around the main light.  Not only that, the color of the light was bright soft white and the center had a bluish tint to it.  It resembled the hue of a halogen head light on a car, but much more intense. Then I noticed hat there were 2 lights on the object, one apparently in the front, and one in the back.  Both had the same type of glow, but the 1 in the back seemed less intense.   I took notice that there were still a lack of any other blinking lights to show me that it was a typical air craft.   As I watched it traveling across the sky, it appeared to be traveling closer to where I was on the road.  The 2 lights were not even in thier alighnment but they seemed to be part of the same craft, due to the flow of the flight pattern.  The rear light (the dimmer of thye 2) was a bit higher than the front (brighter) light.  Looking at the way the lights were slightly off set, I thought it to be sort of a horse shoe- offset squarish shape.  The lights being on the bottom front and rear feet. Now, the way it was fluently and very quickly cutting through the sky was what really caught my attention.  It cut across the sky traveling both easten and northern simultaneously.  It was like it didn't need to turn or change any direction in order to travel in in a direction.  It was like it was able to cut across the sky and not have to steer.  It flew faster than any other craft that I have ever seen. It was almost like it wasn't propelled by a fuel type of means.  It was too perfect and fast.  It seemed silent, almost as if it were skimming across. As it continued to cut across from the south western sky into the south east, I really took notice of the lights.  The intensity and the brightness.  I could see a very thin and vague trace of a beam that came from the rear light and pointed at an angle to the rear and slightly downward.  It quickly made its way across my view heading northerly with a hint of an easterly direction.  As if it could go both directions at once. I began to notice that it seemed to be losing altitude as it glided tword the mountains.  I quickly decided to try and track it as the light changed. I quickly decided to make a right and head north to attempt to track it.   As I approached the next signal light I could tell that it actually semmed to be descending tword the base of the mountain range.  I saw it come down to wher the mountains actually shallow out. That is when I lost sight of it.  I continued to search  it out, but by the time I got out of the buildings that covered its decent, It was gone.  I went to a gas station where I could get  good view of the exact area where I saw it descend.  But there was nothing. I figured someone else had to have seen the same thing.  There were quite a few cars out on the road for that time of nite.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,34.121670833333326,-117.45998511904762
