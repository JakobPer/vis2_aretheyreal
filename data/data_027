I have listened to Peter Davinport on the air several times with both Art Bell and George Noory. After hearing him again with Art over the last weekend, Peter said that only 10% of sightings get reported, so I have decided to report a sighting from 1969 to add to your data base. This sighting has never before been reported by me, but there were other witnesses to the event. I will give details as I remember them.  I was 14 yrs. Old and lived in a small town called Lamont just southeast of Bakersfield, CA. I don’t remember the exact date, but it was a warm August evening, around 10:00pm, and the skies were very clear. I was with my best friend and we were in his back yard. He was talking to his girl friend, which lived next door to him, through her bedroom window as she was not able to come out and visit with us. Not wanting to eves drop on his conversation, I was walking around his back yard staring up at all the brilliant stars in the sky. I was looking northeast when all of a sudden I saw approximately 9 to 13 objects that looked like falling stars enter the earth’s atmosphere or ionosphere. These objects were flying in a perfect ""V"" formation (I'd be happy to send you a crude drawing). I actually saw them enter the ionosphere at what I guess was approximately just west of Las Vegas, fly true north to south and then watched them exit the ionosphere at what I guess was approximately over San Diego. This took about 4 to 5 seconds to travel that distance (approx 400mi). The objects made absolutely no sound, not even a sonic boom, and remained in perfect formation the entire time we viewed them. I say we, because as soon as I saw them, I hollered at my friend to look, and he caught them about mid way through the sighting. If you hold your arm out at length, the “>” encompassed about the length of your thumb from one end of the wing to the other. They were individual objects because I could see stars in between them as they crossed the sky. I couldn't see any lights on them, as they were too high up, but they glowed red hot and had long fiery tails with short smoke trails following the fire, very similar to meteors entering the atmosphere. They just entered the ionosphere, flew across the sky never breaking or veering at all from formation, and left the ionosphere just as easily as they entered. This sighting scared me because I couldn’t explain what I had just seen, so I ran in the house covered in goose bumps. My f! riend stayed out a while longer talking to his girl friend. He came in and told me another set of them flew by after I went in. 10 years later, while talking with a fellow musician up in Lake Arrowhead, the subject of UFO’s came up. I asked him to explain what he had seen, and he described the same thing I saw, the same month of the same year. We assumed it had to be the same objects because his description matched mine perfectly. He was in Whittier, CA when he saw them. Whittier is about 100 miles south of Bakersfield. We both remarked that we just happened to be looking up at the sky during those few seconds, and anyone else who may have been looking up at that particular time could not have missed them. It’s also sort of interesting at how this event affected both my friend and me. I got so excited, I started reading all about UFO’s and talked to everyone I could about them. My friend clammed up and wouldn’t talk to anyone about it, I think for fear of being called a kook. I have never had another personal sighting, although I look up at the skies whenever I can in hopes of seeing something again. Thank you for being an outlet for all of us who have had sightings. It’s a validation for us. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked out the front door wich faced west and could see a number of comunications towers (WTHI tv and radio, what was then WIIL tv,as well as three other radio antena,s).There was a craft hovering next to the top of boath the tv towers. As I watched them the one farthest away (at the WIIL tower) moved (didnt realy see it move but it did) to the next tower in the line-up I think it was thr WPFR tower. where it hovered. a moment later the one that was closest to me(at the WTHI tower) moved to the tower that the other object had just left. They proceded in this fassion untill they had paused at eash tower in my view and i would guess went to other towers in their path. I reported this to my parents who said that they had been listening to the local,sheriff,and state police depts. talking about them on the ""scanner"".Even tho Hulman Field did not send any responding aircraft.

I do not recall that it made any sound, but at moments it appeared to be elliptical and the intensity of the light it emitted would rise and fall as it changed shape.

As dusk was almost complete I got out and walked toward it and watched for some 10-15 minutes. Suddenly I had the feeling it was gone but the object simply faded slowly as if it left behind a mist. Within the haze red green and bluish lights could be seen moving but did not seem to be spot lights, more like flood lights. It was strange that it stayed with us for so long staying the same distance and height above the trees from us except when we turned off it crossed eaterly to the opposite side of the road. Although the timeframe was long neither my (now ex-)wife noticed any missing time. it was truly remarkable to us from when first seen it was so bright and moved rather rapidly but as it slowed and paralleled us through this little ""speed-trap"" town it got dimmer and changed from the bright full moon shape to the definite football shape. It seemed to us we were seeing it edge-on as it paralleled us. Numerous other cars behind us should have seen it also but noone stopped and watched but us. I had a camera with me but had used up the film. On a recent get together in Ga when my mother died, my ex-wife and I discussed this event and she seemed to remember it the same as I remember it.

This was on October 31, 1973 or 74', Halloween night. Younger kids were Trick-Or Treating that night. When we turned down a street that headed West, I had the feeling that if I looked left, to the South, that I would see something interesting. I have the definite feeling that I somehow anticipated what we would see. I then saw a very bright light moving in the sky from East to West. It appeared to be disk or spherically shaped. I knew something of astronomy at that time and about the appearance of the planets. It was brighter than Jupiter and probably as bright and as large as the planet Venus. It was a bright white light which had the appearance of a planet, not a star. It did not ""twinkle"" like a star. It moved very fast from East to West but not at all as fast as a meteor but much faster than any aircraft could possibly move. There was no sound or sonic boom. As a very fast (approx. 30 mph) wind was blowing from East to West that night (this could be used to pinpoint the exact year of this sighting) I wondered, for an instant, if it could be an aircraft in the jetstream. The speed it was travelling made it appear that it could go from horizon to horizon in perhaps just 10 seconds or so. After watching it cross at least 25% of the sky, we were amazed to see it start making 90 degree turns as if it were tracing the outline of a series of steps. it made about 3 of these imaginary ""steps"" and just blinked out. At that moment I was sure that whatever we had just seen, it was not an aircraft, meteor, bolide or any known object. Upon thinking about it later, I decided that the high wind conditions would also rule out any kind of optical illusion caused by a ""temperature inversion layer"". The memory of this has stayed with me for the past 30 or so years. This object left no trail in the sky of any kind. It was a circular light with clear ""edges"". approx. planet sized (in appearance). It appear! ed to be a considerable distance away like a distant aircraft would be.

It was a week of my life that kinda haunts me to this day. I havent discussed this to anyone before..because..it does sound kinda crazy..but the older i have become and the more ive learned about alien life forms..the more creepier i felt about what happened to me back then. Ill start off first by stating what i believe...I believe through my learning and hearing about how aliens basically make their own humans..by impregnating women....in lack of better terminology..using humans..human Dna whatever..they have the technology..like we almost do..to make their own humans. Who knows....that couldhave been the way Mary got impregnated with Jesus....CRAZY? Yeah some people think so..but ???  Anyways...i was ten or eleven years old and i signed up for this soccer camp one summer. The soccer camp was more than a soccer camp..cause it bused all the kids who joined way up into the mountains to camp and play soccer and fish etc...It was alot of fun. West Valley Soccer camp was the name of the ""oganization"".A couple of really weird things happened to me that week...and at the time i just shrugged them off, and didnt pay to much thought to any of it....but the events are still with me today more than ever..and im 37 years old now. Now this could be just innocent weird things that happened that have nothing at all to do with other life forms..but who knows maybe someone else might have had something like this happen to them too.   Well..all the kids in the camp slept in bunk beds in lil cabins.  One morning,,all the kids awoke..and wheni woke up..from the top bunk..immedaitely the kids that in the cabin strting asking me what happened to me that night. Did i fall out of the bunk?? Why did they see a couple of the older counselers carrying me and putting me back in bunk in the middle of the night???  Now i had no recollection or memory of any of this happening to me.  That in itself is really bizarrre because..if i would have fallen out of bed i would have remembered.  Well..one more event took place...they had a big 7 mile hike they called it..where the counselours and kids would all hike somewhere for 7 miles and camp out for the night and the next day hike back. Well yeah..it waqs at least 7 miles..and when we came to the place where everyone was going to camp for the night...it was a public lil campground or something  but the oddest thing that didnt trip me out then but does now..was that all over this lil camp ground..posted on the trees...and taped to the port a pottys..was these papers stating that campers should be aware of some kind of bubonic plague or something that was out of control in the wild animal population in the area.  Were these signs there..to scare away people and make this area ideal for the ""Soccer camp counselors""?. I dont know...but i do know one thing.,..i woke up in the middle of the night..a hundred yards away from the other campers who were asleep...just .. i guess""walking in my sleep""???? In that week two things happened to me that never before or after happened to me ...it was just all too weird.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,37.011256646216765,-122.04450858895706

My father, brother, step mother, and myself were on a camping trip. We had taken a boat to the far side of the island that the city of Ketchikan is on. It is very remote out there except for a few forest service cabins, most of which are unocupied. In the evening around 5:30PM my father, step mother and I went to go collect the crab pots we had set earlier in the day. One of the crab pots was in a small bay, the beach went up from the water for about 30 yards and then turned into dense forest. We did not notice anything when we first entered the bay and stopped at the crab pot. After we started pulling up the crab pot me and my father both looked up at the same time, I am not sure why we did as we did not hear anything unusual and we were occupied with the crab pot at that time. What we saw when we looked up was very odd but did not scare us. We saw a large rectangular shaped thing sitting about 10 yards up on the beach. It was about 20ft high 20ft wide and 30 ft long. It had perfectly square corners. It was also more brightly white then anything I have ever seen. And as this was South East Alaska during the summer there was no chance it was snow, not that we ever get that much snow even in winter and never that close to the water. Im not sure why but we both went back to pulling up the crab pot. It took us about 45 seconds to finish pulling it up. When we looked back to the beach the object had gone, but we had not heard a take off or splach, and the object was much to large to have made its way in to the dense forest. My step mother claims to not have seen anything, but she also addmitted that she had not looked at the beach in the first place.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

We had just got to her place and instead of swallowing my pride and haveing her take me back home, I decided to walk. My home was about 12 miles away, it was a dark over-cast night with the moon breaking out now and again. I knew the gravel road very well from my childhood days of walking to town to go to a friends house, so it wasn't a big deal. Anyways, about 3 miles out I came to this, not sure how to describe it, Double 90-degree corner in the road. As soon as I came around the first 90 I herd a rummble, turned to look and saw a soft white light. At first I thought nothing of it. I just assumed it was my girl friend giveing in and searching for me along the county road. I didnt feel like being found so I hopped over the Barb wired fence and into the Cattle pasture. I knew there to be cattle in the field but, being around cattle all my life, had'nt gave it any thought. I stayed focused on the oncomeing light so I could try and tell what sort of head lights they were and so know if it was her. But the light dimmed. The rummble grew louder. I followed the sound and as it crossed a small stream in the pasture and saw a flash of light, as if the moon light had struck a smooth metalic surface of something flying not over 5 feet above the ground and only 30 yrds from me. It could'nt have been doing over 10 mph which ruled out an Air plane. So I'm thinking a Wisper, a common sight that the people of the area has seen often enough to give it a name. I get into the reason for the name in a second. Anyways, I watch the triangular object slowly fly away down the pasture when I notice the rummble still grows louder. So I turn just in time to see 50 head of cattle stampeding directly for me. Now if you have grown up around cattle you have seen cows run. I have chased cattle on a Four wheeler. They will run but it isnt like there in a big hurry to get anywhere. These cattle were running for their life. They ran strait for me, ! stoped, ran away from me, stoped turned and ran right through the fence. So naturally, I jumped the fence and got as far away from them as I could. Not a quarter of a mile on down the road I caught sight of the object again. This time it turned, gained some altitude and flew over me several times. The whole time fading in and out as the moon broke and the low cloud cover. The wind would pick up right as it would pass overhead and die as it went. It made a sound, not sure how to describe it other than radar....as if you could hear the sound a Bat emmitts to capture a bug. Another way would be to say it sounded like squeaky breaks on a car at the level of a whisper. It wasnt a plane...was flying to slow. Unless they have recently created a helicopter that could just barely seat one person but other wise incapable of lifting him off the ground due to its size and is almost totaly silent...it could'nt have been a Helicopter. Could you maybe give me some info on what this could have been? I have played it over and again in my mind for a year now and I am stumped. Please feel free to contact me by email.

All of a sudden the dog started crying put its tail under her legs and hid, and then as if on cue this blinding red light came through the blinds and felt a humming in my body but could not hear anything, my girlfriend who was right next to me at the time felt exactly the same thing, we were both scared to death i have read a lot of books and seen a lot of documenterys on ufo's and aliens and this has convinced me and definately convinced my girlfriend who was not a beleiver in this.  we both tried to peer through the blinds but the light was just too blinding it was just hovering above our house and where we lived in redmond was on the top of a hill over a valley so there was absolutely no doubt that this is indeed genuine.  i now live in london and have done since early 1996 and i hope the zip code i gave you is correct because i do not have my u.s. license anymore and the zip im pretty sure is correct. this craft if i may call it that was incredibly bright and huge and would  be amazed if nobody else saw this craft, i cant stop thinking about this sighting it really has got me hooked on trying to find the truth behind all of these sightings and beleive me they do exist i just hope that a member of the public from redmond also saw this and could verify my story.… ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was driving on a main thoroughfare in my city one sunny sunday in October of 1995. In the eastern sky I notced a metallic saucer shaped object travelling towards the north at a fairly high rate of speed.Being inside my automobile and on a busy street, I have no idea if the craft could be heard or not. It did not appear to be close enough to the ground to hear any sound anyway.I was amazed at this scenario as I am absolutely certain it was no conventional aircraft of any kind. I immediately began to honk my horn and even rolled my window down in an effort to garner another witness to this phenomena. Despite the volume of traffic on that busy thoroughfare(13th Street), I was unable to attract anyones attention. To this day, I find that circumstance very peculiar to say the least. I continued driving and abruptly pulled into the nearest parking lot so as to watch further. By this time the object had disappeared behind some trees only to reappear as two having split in half.There also appeared to be what seemed to resemble smoke trails behind each component.  They also looked to have been closer to the horizon, but I cannot be certain of that fact due to the possiblity of them being much farther away than they appeared. (due to the curvature of the earth). They simply disappeared below the horizon. I find it very difficult to believe that I was the only witness to this, nevertheless, I have been unable to locate any other witness(es). I do not consider myself a UFO enthusiast on any level. I have had 4 sightings in my lifetime, this was by far the most intriguing of them all. I do not read on the subject with the exception of the ""Gulf Breeze Sightings"" back in 1992. I did however report this to a guest on the Art Bell show a number of years ago (perhaps 2 or 3) and he replied that it was probably a meteor. I am certain this was no meteor. I am an amateur astronomer and have seen many meteors. Aside from that fact, again, this was in a bright, cloudless, sunny sky. I never really made the effort to report it to anyone else after this experience. In fact, I reported it then as I am doing so now only after the happenstance of venturing onto an interested party of which I never really sought out. The first reporting occurred after I had listened to an ArtBell show during one of my many bouts of insomnia. This time I ventured onto your website link from the CoastToCoast website. As far as my background is concerned, I am a college degreed individual, seriously and sober minded, and not given to hyperbole or fantasy. My exposure to any occult activities have been passive only as I have never practiced any form of occultism, but I have read somewhat concerning the various phenomena within this realm.

Quickly scanning the sky with my binoculars, I found three other identical objects.  The objects, which appeared as two black spheres one over the top of the other and connected by a thin short rod (simillar to a barbell stood on end), had no wings or rotors but still hovered in place. These objects were high enough in the sky that they could not be seen without binoculars.  After watching the objects for about 20 minutes, I tried shifting position in order to steady my binoculars and get a better look at the objects.  This took maybe five seconds, but when I looked for the objects from my new position, all four of them had disappeared and could not be found again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My father's neighbour and I were out baling hay in the late evening. Sky was black. He had a bigger baler, and could go faster then I could. When he would catch up to me, I would pull out and let him pass, because there wouldn't of been enough room for the two balers to be side by side, and still be neat in the field. I had pulled out made my circle so I could pull in to the hay row again when he passed.  His tractor and mine had cabs on them.  While I was waiting, I noticed these bright lights in the sky, and I instantly thought it was a very low flying plane in distress. Although it is a no plane area - my father's ranch is about 70 miles away from any aircraft station.  Right away, looking out the window of the cab I could see that it was not flying, but rather stationary, and these lights were so white bright, and flashing like birthday candles.  I thought that it must be of the reflection of lights of his tractor and baler causing tricks on the glass of my tractor cab.  (Before I forget, this was the year I believe that there were several sightings of unidentified objects in Saskatchewan) I poked my head out of my tractor cab to see what was above me, and believe me this was not a reflection of his lights. It was not exactly right over me, but to the south of the tractor.   There was nothing between me and the object in the sky. My hair stood on end, I wanted to jump off my tractor, to try and get on his to be with somebody.  This is the strange thing about it, it took off to the east and left this string of light, then it stopped, and went south, with this string of light it left, it stopped again, and then went west with again this string of light and disappeared over the valley hills.  This string disappeared shortly after it appeared when it travelled.  Both tractors were running of course, so there was no sound that I heard.  It was a very large object - now this is just a guess - I would say it was a little less then the size of a two ton truck.  It is difficult because the lights were flashing so bright, that it was difficult to see and it was round. His tractor had already past so it wasn't his lights shining in my eyes.  I have tried to figure out what it could of been and I can't think of what else it would be. I am a rational person, with a history degree, and am known as very matter of fact, and get to the point person. I seen what I seen.

These creatures did not speak with words, instead they used telepaphy. Some how I could hear there thoughts as well as them hearing mine.

I asked how it was possible to travel that fast it told me that the shape of the craft in which we travel is key. Only a sauser shape or cigar shape,or round vessil could travel that fast because of the pressure that is excerted on a craft at that high a speed. though we were communicating rather well, something went terribly wrong.

The lights were headlight-sized from my vantage point, but were incredibly high. Because of my perception of height, I had judged the lights to be much larger than any aircraft known to man, possibly being hundreds of feet in diameter. I did not observe any contrails or vapors eminating from the lights. The time of day was beginning to turn to twilight and the skies were blue. I was driving eastbound on Forest Hill Blvd and first witnessed them around the intersection of Jog Rd. At first, the lights appeared to be static, just staying in one place. Then, the lights appeared to begin to rise slowly upward and began to fade in intensity. The lights then disappeared, but there was an incredibly large hazy halo left behind for each light. The lights were gone before I reached the intersection of Military Trail. For weeks afterward, I tried to find further information on this incident. I did recall some online articles trying to discount it as military missiles, which from experience could not have been fired from Cape Canaveral. I think the article went on to say that it was ship fired missiles and another article said they were missiles fired over the Florida Panhandle from one side to the other side. Problem being, that I did not witness any East, West, North, or South movement of the lights. I did not witness any vapors or contrails.

I imediatly realized that I was seeing a u.f.o. as I had never seen anything like this before in the broad daylight.I stood very still and was a little concerned with the fact that I was all alone and could possibly be abducted.I watched the entire time as it passed hopeing that it might change course or maybe even get a little closer to where I could see it even better.It came to a point where the sun reflected off of it for a moment.Not knowing the true size of this object I could not determine how high or far away it was. I would have to guess that it was at about 5000 to 10000 ft. up.The shape did appear to change at a certain angle as it seemed to go from cigar to football looking.I could not hear any sounds other than the sound of the process area that I was standing in when noticing this object.I called the local sheriff dept. to both report what I had seen and ask if anyone else had called about a sighting, they answered no.This was a unforgetable experience.

I have been hesitant to talk about it, however having discovered this website I thought it is time now to do so. I am reporting this just as I wrote in my journal that night so it isn't as though I am relying on fuzzy memories.  It was on the night of our wedding anniversary and my husband and I were driving home from my mother's house on the west side of the city. I was driving north on Canal St. then took a right(east) onto Brook St and proceeded to the intersection of Elm St. From there I went left (north) onto Elm and it was near the Bellman's Jewelers store that my husband first noticed what looked to be a very large jet. It was pretty low and appeared to be heading toward the direction of Manchester Airport. He lost sight of it momentarily as it seemed to disappear behind the New Hampshire Insurance building. It was so large and bright that he told me to watch as it would be flying right over our car. But as we were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Elm and the Amoskeag Bridge we both kept looking for the jet however it didn't appear. When the light changed I drove on slowly past the NH Insurance Building (it is on the corner of Elm & the Amoskeag) looking for the jet that had seemingly disappeared. I was looking out of my side window as my husband watched from the front windshield. It was near a funeral home that I decided to pull over to the curb as a set of lights caught my eye - red and white, not blinking and distinctly shaped like a triangle. At first I thought that it was somehow attached to the roof of the building like a set of decorative lights. But I realized that the lights were not fixed, rather they were HOVERING. And it was very large. I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, like I had been kicked and lost my breath. I was overwhelmed with a sense of fear, wishing I wasn't there. I screamed at my husband ""It's hovering!"" He leaned over to look out the front windshield and the object began to slowly move toward the south. It was so close to us, just across the street. My husband then opened the car door and stepped out and look. I started to panic as I was afraid for him. The object made absolutely no sound and seemed to float effortlessly southeast over Elm St. heading toward the airport.! By this time I was so frightened I only wanted to leave. I shouted for my husband to get back in the car. When we got home we stayed up until 3 am talking about it and I had a restless sleep filled with nightmares.  The above description, as I stated before, was taken from my journal. To this day I am frightened when I recall that night.  My husband had always said he would have to see something for himself before he could believe yet he cannot explain what we experienced.  That it hovered soundlessly I cannot put out of my mind and I cannot come up with any sort of reasonable explanation. I hope I never see anything like that again.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,42.972094248608535,-71.45090269016697

I've been reading about the Hudson Valley sightings and was excited to read that there are many similarities to what I saw, and I'm certain that what I saw is consistent with those events.  Here goes:  I'm really not sure of the date, but on the evening of the sighting, I was at the opposite end of my house, which was a duplex, sneaking a smoke with my 2 brothers.  I remember looking at the sky and saying out loud how cool it would be to see a UFO.  Suddenly, my mother called for me and said that I had a telephone call.  It was my friend from up the street.  He wanted to borrow an audio cassette of my brother's, and asked if I could bring it to his house.  He lived in the third house up the street from us, to the east.  As I walked to his house by myself, I looked up to my left (North) and saw a formation of lights heading Southeast.  There was no sound coming from the lights, so I figured this was something to keep an eye on.  I ran to my friend's house and told him he needed to come outside and see what was going on.  We walked further up the street to the east and just past the next intersection where we could see that the lights had stopped directly over the local recreation area's pond.  There was no noise, and no movement.  I can't recall whether the lights were blinking or not.  As we were observing the object, a smaller object of white light came over us from the original direction of the larger object (North to South) and seemed to fly up into the center of the lights, where it disappeared.  After a few minutes, the object started moving to the Southeast.  The recreationarea also has a big sledding hill, over which the object eventually disappeared out of sight.  We were pretty excited about the whole incident.  I went home and told my mother and brothers what I had seen, and on the local 11 o'clock news, a report about it claimed it was a bunch of private pilots out of the Stormville, NY airport flying in formation as a practical joke.  Knowing that airplanes don't hover and do make noise, I can say with 100% certainty that we were not watching private airplanes.  Again, I know this was a longtime ago, but I noticed in the articles on the ufoevidence.org wesite there aren't any mentions of anything being sighted in my area.

We watched it move to the south and about the time it was over the town of Sutherland, I called on the radio to another Officer who was in the Wallace area (22 Miles to the south on highway 25.  I advised him about what I was looking at and he said he would start heading North and see if he could catch it.  Just as I had mentioned the Craft we all noticed the three circles flash bright white ( about the same shade of white as a monitor displays when you have a bland white page on the screen.) a couple of times.  The Craft started moving faster and closed the distance between Sutherland and a position just south and west of the Gerald Gentelman Power Plant about where the correction line is in the highway.  (About 8 miles) in about 40 seconds.  The craft then veered to the south east and headed on a line of travel that would have taken it close to Dickens. seven (7) miles to the east of Wallace on Highway 23.  The officer to the south called me back a few minutes after I had talked to him and stated he could see the craft and estimated it was moving about 400 miles per hour heading off the the south east towards Dickens.  He also stated it was Eluminated be the lights from the power plant whne he spotted it and disappered into the darkness.  I have no Idea if this was an Experimental Aircraft but I would have to say it was twice as long as an Airforce C5 Galaxy and 1 and a half times as wide.

This incedent occured in my early teenage years which would be somewhere between 1984 and 1987.  It also occured during a cold month like december thru march.  I was with my Aunt and my brother.  We had just parked in the visitors section of the elderly highrise building on front street, which runs beside the susquhanna river.  We began walking toward the highrise when we noticed a large object (memory is to unclear to define shape) it was flying very low and moving at a unhurried pace.  It did not zoom or pause in mid air it simply continued very slowly across the sky.  I also remember that it was very silent, there were no load noises or roaring or humming sounds.  I do remember that there were a few lights( three or four in total) which were white and were on the outside perimeter, there were no lights in it's center.  The object flew directly over us.  It flew so low that we were worried for a few minutes it might hit the highrise building, which is fifteen stories high.  After it passed over the building it seemed to blend into the night sky and totally disapper.  My Aunt who is a huge skeptic of such things went right into my grandmas building and called local athorities to see if any other such sightings had been reported or if they knew of anything that was supposed to be flying in the area.  No other calls had been received and to there knowledge nothing had been noted as flying low in the area.  I know that I remember thinking that there was no way the object looked like a plane or a blimp.  It had been very low and not hard to determine that it was an object unlike anything we had ever seen.  To this day I still find myself wondering what we saw, explained or unexplained it was indeed a unique experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-26T00:00:00,40.8322,-76.7388

During what I recall as being a warm summer's night back in 1987, I chanced to gaze straight up into the clear (moonless?) sky as I sat chatting with my landlady on her back porch steps. Although there was a noteable diffusion of light across my field of vision due to nearby city streetlamps, the view of the night sky was such that countless stars could still be clearly identified. To my surprise, however, the field of motionless stars I expected to see was instead replaced by a field of 'moving' stars, meandering slowly about in a fashion much like tadpoles in a small pond. These objects replaced the stars, they did not obscure them. That is to say, I could not observe anything at all in my field of vision of the sky except the objects. There must have been 30 or more in that particular area of the sky. They had the same shape, size, color and brightness as the stars I fully expected to see. They did not exhibit any visible trails or emit any audible sound. I pointed out the phenomenon to my landlady and she observed them as well as I. We had the luxery of being able to watch the event for as long as we pleased: the objects were still moving when we retired inside for the night which was about an hour later. The next evening was almost identical in terms of viewing conditions. As I sat next to my landlady in the same location as the night before and roughly about the same time, we both observed a repeat performance of the event. A short while later, two friends came by to visit and observed the phenomenon with us. It scared me very much and I can only imagine the reaction of the witnesses with me, although they did not appear to be outwardly that concerned. To this day I cannot explain the event to my satisfaction. For those were the nights the stars themselves came out to dance! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sky was completely clear.  There was very little ambient light in this area.  The object was in the southern sky.  It moved covering the area between 40 and 70 degrees vertically from the horizon and a horizontal area of about 30 degrees.  The object did not make any sound that I could here.  The object moved at a continuous velocity.  When I say a continuous velocity, I don't mean on average.  I mean that it's motion was mechanical in nature.  It's motion made it obvious that it was an engineered device of some sort.  It was very precise in it's movement and speed.  The object would move in a straight line for a second or two, and then continue at another angle between 90 and 180 degrees of the preceeding path.  It did not stop or even slow down for these changes in direction.  I can't call the changes in direction turns, because the motion was not at all curved.  The changes in direction were precise corners with no change in velocity.  This motion reminded me of the motion of a spot of light on a vector CRT or that produced by vector controlled laser optics.  By the way the object moved, it looked as if it had somehow been projected onto the clear night sky.  The object itself was a point of blueish-white light not much different from any star in the sky that night.  It was dimmer than the brightest visible star but brighter than any moving satalite I've seen with my eyes alone.  I saw this while relaxing with my grandmother on her patio.  We would often stay out late, listen to the radio and talk.  I was very dissapointed when the object finally vannished low in the sky.  I was unable to get my grandmother to see the light.  I wanted a witness to my claim but went to bed knowing I was the only one to see the object.  The next morning my grandmother and grandfather called me into the kitchen.  A small article in the local paper explained that dozens of people in northern West Virginia, including law enforcement, had reported seeing a ufo that zig-zagged across the sky befor disappearing behind the hills.  It seemed I had some witnesses after all.  A bit about my background-  This was my first UFO sighting.  I was about 14 years old.  My grandmother was in her 50's.  Everyone in my family- I mean everyone has or has had a belief and interest in the spiritual/ paranormal.  My interest in such things is probably the strongest out of any of my family aside from my uncle when he was younger.  I have had many dreams about future places and events.  Some have already come true in ways that were very obvious to me, others I feel will, in time, unfold.  I have a background in electronics, fine arts, and music.  I have composed two feature length musical scores for B-budget films. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-26T00:00:00,,

The approximate coordinates of the house from which my sister observed the UFO are:  44:55:00 N   68:41:00 W   In the fall of 1989, my sister, then 16 years old, returned home after seeing a movie with a friend. It was probably between 9:30 and 10pm.  She looked out of her bedroom window and saw a large, gray object with a dome top and one or more rows of white lights around the lower edge. There was one very bright light illuminating the path ahead of the object, which was flying ""just high enough to clear the tree tops"" --  (probably 50-75 feet above ground level) She estimated it to be ""about the size of an average house.""  What struck her most was that the object made absolutely no noise, and was traveling too slowly to be an airplane. The bedroom window faces due north, and the flight path was south, toward the house. When the craft passed over the house she ran to a back window to see if she could catch another glimpse, but she saw it just for a second as it disappeared behind the tree line and disappeared.  My sister was slightly shaken by the incident, but did not tell anyone about the sighting for years because she feared ridicule. She eventually told me and one or two others.  I have heard many accounts of sightings.  This one is unique because I do not believe it would be possible for my sister to imagine or create what she described.  She has always been a very down-to-earth, responsible, and realistic person. She is a college graduate with a degree in Human Development, was the director of a private pre-school for several years, and is currently a Case Worker for a Social Services Agency.  She was a popular, well-behaved high school student with good grades and had no reason to seek attention. (She doesn't even like science fiction!)  The only nearby military airports are unlikely to be involved in experimental aviation. There is an ANG refueling wing at KBGR (8 miles) operating KC-135 aircraft, and a Medical unit with Huey and Bell helicopters. Brunswick Naval Air Station is nearly 100 miles away. I believe Loring AFB was still operational at the time of the sighting; it is almost 200 miles to the north.  My sister provided a pencil sketch of what she saw which will be submitted.

It was around noon and I was taking pictures of my children playing in the mtn wildflowers and taking in the refreshing mtn air. We decided to head back down the trail to the car that was parked just off the side of the access road up/down the mtn. We were getting cold and I ran out of film. We were almost down the hill, just about 50ft from the car, when my wife and I heard this loud roar. It sounded like a fighter jet. I saw two dots heading in out direction very rapidly and as I concentrated on focusing on them I saw this little dot in front of them. At first I thought maybe it was just vulture or some other raptor flying in the foreground, but as I observed, I saw that this dot was staying in sync with the two bigger dots as they were closing on our location. Then within just about 15 seconds we (wife/I) saw two military jets (black long noses, w/green camo(/f-16/f-111?)) enclosing on this cigar shaped object. They nearly flew just couple 100 ft above the hill we were just on. They were so close that the sound was deafening. One jet tried to come up on the ufo and even banked a little bit to maybe get a better look of the ufo. The ufo then seemed to really move quickly, and it started to pull away from the jets. My wife and I excitedly grabbed the kids and ran up the path to top of mtn we had just climbed. When I got to the top I could just see the two jets rapidly heading, I guess east over the mtn range. My wife says she saw a glimpse of a silver shiny color on the underside of the ufo. I don't recall seeing color; I just saw what look liked a dark line or cigar shaped object just a little shorter than the jet’s noses.  I served in the u.s.a.f  for 4yrs as a security police and never have ever seen anything like this before with military jets flying so low over semi-populated area. Vandenberg AFB is just down the road from Los Alamos, but does support fighter jet aircraft. VAFB mainly deals with missle launches. Interesting thing is later on in that month I would see these fighter jet kind of aircraft flying into VAFB. Which is odd, because when I worked at VAFB, I rarely saw these kind of fighter jets, except a day or two before an air show. My wife and I are not sure what we saw. I'm a skeptical about aliens, but have not ruled out military experiments or other phenomenom. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,34.7444,-120.27820000000001

The road cut through nearly thirteen acres of corn and vegetables owned by an elderly couple who raised produced for sale. About half way down the road was a little shanty they called their ""gardenhouse"" where they cleaned and prepared their produce for market. As we approached the shanty, we met the elderly woman coming up the road, heading for her home on the edge of town. We stopped to talk, she wanted to express her sympathies ad to ask about the funeral. My husband and I were facing north, the woman facing us, as we talked. We noticed a small bright light coming toward us out of the north. It was moving very slowly, but coming down, growing larger and brighter as it decended. The old woman saw the look on our faces, so she turned and looked up. By this time it was very large and a very brilliant blue-white. The old woman fell to her knees, muttering something in her native tongue, Italian, and ""crossing"" herself. We were paralyzed with fear! Suddenly, after hovering for a few minutes, motionless, it began to go around in wide circles, then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. The woman ran up the road to her home. My husband and I ran to my parents' home, where my husband called the Observatory in Pittsburgh to ask what this ""thing"" was. They could not give an explanation, but that it ""could not have been a plane or weather balloon, nor any invention existing at that time that could have done what this object did."" A few weeks later, reports started coming in on radio news about people in the west seeing strange things in the sky. Some were calling them ""flying saucers"" and ""UFO's,"" and some were wondering if some other country had invented some kind of new scientific weapon. We never completely got over our fright and have watched the sky ever since. My husband had been in the Navy in the war. We have see many natural things, such as meteorites, northern lights and man- made objects, but never have seen anything to compare to what we saw that evening. Note: The week before we saw the strange object, we were on our way to North Carolina to attend my Grandmother's funeral, traveling Route 11 through the Shenandoah Valley. We were traveling staight through, without stopping for the night. During the night we had a flat tire. Th five of us, my parents, my brother, and my husband and I got out of the car while the tire was fixed. While we were standing on the dark road, a very bright meteorite sailed across the sky, leaving a greenish trail and a ""swishing"" sound. The object we saw in Pennsylvania a week later did not resemble this meteorite in any way. It traveled slower, at first, then much faster than the meteorite, was a different color, and made no sound even though it got much closer than the meteorite did. The meteorite streaked across the sky, but the strange object moved slowly and then hovered over us before shooting straight up, lightening fast! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My friend and I were waiting for the tide to go out, in order to wade in the shallow water along Beach Blvd at Washington St and entered at approximately 9:00 PM and waded toward the downtown area, each with a Coleman gas lantern and spear, looking for flounders and soft crabs.  The sky was crystal clear.  I was 14 years of age and my friend was 17.  Looking up into the sky above Beach Blvd was West, slightly North.  I was an astronomy buff, and looked up immediately into the unusually clear night; there were only a few streetlights contributing to light pollution every few blocks,  Beach Blvd was much higher than the shoreline in places. I immediately noticed that there was an extra ""star"" in the constellation Pleiades, slightly brighter than its very dim stars.  As we walked back and forth between the sand bars, going steadily toward town, past it,  and then back to Washington St., this extra star got brighter and brighter, gradually becoming a 4th, 3rd, 2nd, then 1st, 0+ magnitude ""star"". On our return to Washington Street, we stopped at the railroad bridge, at approximately 2:00 AM (I looked at my watch repeatedly) July 3rd and this ""star"" was then as bright as a 200 watt light bulb. 200 W bulbs existed then, and I was often in a building owned by my family that used them.  It then began dripping what appeared to be a silvery liquid metal, like a foundry pouring molten lead. The ""star"" took off over Henderson Point i e to the NorthEast, at extremely high speed, completely silent, leaving 2 red-orange glowing trails in the sky , which remained visible for over 30 minutes.  I estimate the speed at thousands of miles per hour.  I have no idea of the altitude, as I thought initially thought it a star, but it was obviously in the atmosphere.  I never felt fear of any kind, although my companion was very scared.  There was no missing time or any strange after effects. Because of the the length of this event, I remember it vividly, over 50 years later. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))",,,

Told my friend to look up and he and I watched them for about 2 minutes. It was a arc'd flight in the vacinity of Fort Lewis. They were in formation as one then two and again one then two. Based on the size and distance away and because McCord Airforce Base was close by, I now estimate the size to be that of a Boeing 747. When we ran home we turned on the radio to a talk show and they said that over 100 people had called in asking if the Air Force was testing a new type of flying vehicle.  In 1957 when I had returned home from a date, I glaced to the northern sky overlooking Tacoma and noticed a disk shaped object the size of a Boeing 727 flying over Tacoma in and out of clouds. This lasted about 30 seconds due to the cloud cover. No noize and the object was metallic with what looked like windows around the perimeter of the DISK.  IN 1965 I student taught in Bellingham, Washington. In a science class I mentioned the fact that I did see a UFO once. An indian boy of age 14 came to me later because he did not want to be ridiculed and told me of an incident when he viewed a UFO hover overhead and then take off directly upwards at high speeds.  In 1968 I was a system engineer at Boeing after finding out how little teachers get payed since I also had a degree in Physics. I was in a car pool. I mentioned once that I had seen a UFO and one of the other fellows remarked that he had seen a cigar shape UFO once.  In 1969 I was a manager of system development at Boeing and one of my employees told me during lunch that when he was traveling to California from Washington, six USO flew overhead and caused some interference such that the cars on the freeway stalled out.  In 1980 as manager of On Line Systems for an insurance company in Galveston, Tx. I again mentioned the fact that I did experence seeing a UFO and one of the staff members said that he say a small sphere flying around his neighborhood in a northern state (don't remember which one.)  In 1981 again at lunch I mentioned something about UFO's and computer operator overheard what I had said and talked to me in primvate saying that he say a disk shape UFO ffying over the causeway one day when he was coming to work.

Oct. 1997 About 10pm my wife and I were returning from Ft. Worth, TX. I was pulling into the driveway which faces west. The sky was clear and dark except for the stars which shone brightly against the black sky. We live in a mobil home which runs north and south. We have a security lamp on the electric pole which illuminates our driveway near the house. Even before I completly stopped the car, I could not help but notice something EXTREMELY LARGE passing slowly over our house. We both got out of the car and uttered virtually the same words. ""What the Hell is that?"" Moving from South-West to North-East about 10 miles an hour was some huge flying craft. It was difficult to estimate size because it's only illumination was about seven glowing white lights along the wings in the front of the craft. In other words one light was centered at the nose and four down each wing. The craft was ""V"" Shaped like the front of a stealth fighter. It was enormous. I have since held my thumb up to the sky as a passing Commercial airliner flew over which easily covered the Jet. I believe the Jet was in the neighborhood of 3 thousand feet. It would have required both hands in front of my face to cover this craft that we saw. It passed so slowly that I knew it was no jet. The stall speed of even a propeller type craft was not even being met. It made absolutely No noise whatsoever. It was not a helicopter. As matter of fact it was too large to be even close to size of any Balloon, Plane , Helicopter or anything else that I have seen Man Made and in fLight. FT. Hood at Kileen, TX. is in the Direction from which it came. It blanked the stars out of the sky as it passed over which is how that I could tell that it was ""V"" Shaped. It had no flashing beacon nor the standard Red and Green Port and Starboard lights nor the flashing beacon all of which you expect to see on PLANES and Helicopters. Of couse I take into account that these would not be present if the Military was flying a secret ""STEALTH"" craft over. I believe that th! is Craft was flying no more than 1 thousand feet up. With that guestimation, I would say that the width was at least 3000 feet across and 1000 feet long. It blanked out a considerable portion of the sky noticing the disappearance of stars and their reappearnace. We observed the craft some 30 seconds until I could no longer make out the shape. The white lights along the wings did not seem to cast light in front of the craft They were however, visible even after it had passed over us. I never heard anything about it on the news. I have since heard of simular sightings within months of our sighting. I was prompted to leave this account by Mr. Davenport's Radio visit to COAST to COAST listening on  KVIL AM 570 Dallas WT.

It was a couple weeks before Christmas.  I told her that I would take it to the mailbox for her.  It was night and already dark.  The sky was cloudy and as I was walking out of my doorway I looked up.  These clouds were very high in the sky and in them, or near them, I saw two lights.  The two lights were round and sort of yellowish, they were not very bright, about as bright as a flashlight.  I saw these two objects following each other.  One seemed to be leading the other.  They were moving in small circles around each other, also making figure eights and very semi-circle movements.  They continued this for about 10 seconds before they both shot off into the night.

I had just exited the 101 freeway at Wendy Dr. and noticed a group of cars stopped in the middle of the street, as I too came to a stop I looked up and could not believe what I saw.  To this day it is still the largest non natural thing I have ever seen.  It was sort of a triangular shape ( not with equal sides ) and it had a cigar shapped pod at 2 of the chopped off corners.   It was a greenish blue color with the pods being a darker blue or purple.  And it was huge, there is a mountain raned between this town and the pacific ocean ( only 7 miles as the crow flies ) and this thing dwarfed the mountains.  This group of people watched the craft for about 10 minutes it just hovered there in the sky.  I stepped back to my car to turn it off and when I turned around it was gone.  Everyone just got in there cars and left.  My girlfriend was very shaken.  I droped her off and began to think, not to far from where I was there was a very large open area used for cattel grazing.  Just for the hell of it I drove out there to see if I could see any thing else. I rember arriving at this area, now this couldn't of been later than 1:30 at this point.  The next thing I remember I an turned around driving away from this area and it's after 3:00 am.  I remember thinking that took longer than it should have. I guess I had one of the now popular missing time experances. The next day I checked the local newspapers and there was no mention of what we had seen.  Just as a note all this took place with in 15 to 20 miles of Point Magu.  This is the Pacific Missle test range where they devloped the walleye, sparrow and tomahawk missles along with who knows what else.  The craft was almost over the base. it was litteraly over a mile in size.

I saw two instances of a UFO. On Friday night, we were shooting bottle rockets. I was looking up and saw what looked like a star at the moment, disappear out of site. It was bright, sort of close to the brightness of a satellite, not as bright as say international space station, but was just sitting still, then vanished. Then the next night, after shooting fireworks, I asked my brother if he wanted to stay out late with me on the dock and look at the stars, mainly look for UFOs. It was getting late, it was 100am when we went out already, it was so dark that you could see all the stars, it was a great night. We didn't see anything, then decided to go in and go to sleep. I was laying there, on the floor, on what used to be a patio, but was now enclosed with windows all the way around it. There is a tree just to the north of the house, but a great clear view to the NW. I was laying there, watching the fan turn above me. I was closing my eyes trying to go to sleep, and I remember the feeling that something was telling me to look towards it, as if something was looking at me and I had the sense to look back, I can't really explain it in words, it was more like the beings in the craft told me to look through telepathy. I rolled over and sat up a bit (on my elbows with my back arched) and looked out to the NW. There was my first definite UFO. It was bright white sphere. I was told before by my mom and step father of a bright light that was behind our house in MN that was shining through the woods and went back and forth, which happened a few before this. Just as I saw it for about 5 seconds, it disappeared, into thin air, blip, gone. I remember me saying under my breath, ""cool"" I haven't experienced such a sight since then. This is my account of sighting of a UFO. My co-worker has seen a lot more the me by where he lives now. I currently live in MO, and there is weird activity h! ere too. I have lived these following places, IA, MN, AZ, and MO. All have had weird activity going on. I hope that this helps with the reports.  ps can you e-mail me, and then you can talk to me further if you like. ummm, i forgot to add this, but my mom also saw the phoenix ufo. i have talked to dr sky about this too. I have been trying to reach art or george with no success. my mother told me that when she was leaving my aunts, which is south phoenix, ahwatukee, that she looked up and saw this huge gigantic object moving over, saying that it was at least a few football fields. she said that she could see the stars around it, but not in it. I have heard theories about the lights over the mountain ridge. I have heard that there was a big visual, ie the lights, and that it would distract most attention to what was actually going over phoenix, which would make sense, since my mother saw it over head. I don't know for sure, but she saw it over head in phoenix. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was just a few miles outside of Houston.  I had just left the little town of Smithers and I was looking for a Fair Grounds that I had thought they had there to overnight with 5 horses that I had brought out of Alaska.  I had traveled this Highway lots of times and usually stayed in Vanderhoof or Quesnel but the road had been bad coming down the Cassiar Hwy and had slowed me down.  My traveling companions besides the 5 equines consisted of my SharPei dog (CharChar) and 1 cat (Sally).  It was my traveling companions that alerted me to something unusual in the beginning.  Char started talking to me and howling in a strange way and was looking out the rear window.  I could see a strange white glow on her when I turned around.  At first this registered as light coming off my front running lights on the Horse Trailer, the problem being they are orange, not white.  Still did not register with me that there was anything unusual yet.  Then Sally, the cat, started making strange noises I never had heard before and she actually jumped up on the seat in front with me then jumped back to the back and went under the seat.  Her hackles were up at the time.  Meanwhile, Char is running from the back rear window to me and is talking and whining and her hackles are up.  I was at this point starting to get spooked.  I had slowed down considerably looking for the Fair Grounds and had been leaning forward on the stearing wheel (there was some ground fog in the valleys there too).  It was at this time that I realized the truck was glowing with a white light and the ground around me also was.  It was like I was in a big spotlight with  one of those new blue-white headlights they have out now.  I leaned forward and looked up and realized that there was something over me.  It was as larger than a large full moon in size in the sky and was a glowing green color with this large white light in the middle.  Like a stupid idiot I really slowed down and rolled my window down and listened. I heard no engines.  At this point I am trying to justify this with a meteor, crashing plane, helicopter, anything but imagining that I could be the perfect ""ufo medical experiment on wheels, 5 equine,1 feline,1 canine and 1 hominid."" This my daughter latered reminded me of and we had a good laugh, however I failed to see the humor in it at the time it was happening. I don't think I directly thought of this however I know it had to be in my mind.  The object suddently removed the light from me and then sped forward. I was at this point going up a hill and it appeared to be going to the top of the hill to land.  It was at this point I actually saw 3 points of light that were red or orange on the edge.  I thought they might have been engine exhaust or after burners.  It was a little unclear with the fog I was going in and out of.  This was not a heavy fog, more like a mist. It hesitated at the crest of the hill then suddenly made a sharp turn and headed due North from me.  It was at this point that I realized that I had come to a complete stop in the Highway.  Myself and Char were just staring at this thing.  I can't tell you what was running through her mind but I can tell you I was now scared.  It went through this mist and went right up and over a small mountain there.  I could see the glow of light from beyond the mountain like it had landed.  I got going again quite quickly and stopped in the next town to call my husband.  He is in the USAF and while I am relating all this to him it was at this time I realized that the entire Convenience Store was now quiet.  Everyone in there was listening to me! One of the customers in there told me that there had been sitings in the area all Summer!  Well I ask if there was a RCMP close at hand because I still thought that maybe I should report it.  The clerk in the store he did not think the office for just reporting would be open at this time so I just determined I would call later.  There were 2 logging truck drivers there that said that I could park between them if I was still scared since they would be there until 6:00 when the mill opened.  This is exactly what I did.  The next morning I started off again headed for Arlington,Washington. Somewhere before Prince George I spied a RCMP on the side of the road running radar and it was a woman.  I thought this would be the chance to talk to someone so I parked on the side of the road and approached her vehicle.  I had made sure that I had picked up one of my Business Cards first.(I run a horse transport business so I do a lot of traveling at night.  It is easier on the horses especially in the Summer.  I also had lived 17 years in Alaska so I knew this Hwy and this was a first for me on it.) When I came up the first thing out of mouth was that here was my business card, that I did not do drugs nor rarely drank and certainly had been doing neither the previous night.  She listened to my tale then handed the card back to me and kind of chuckled.  Without saying anything to me she got on the radio back to Houston, BC, Canada and told them I would be calling in a report.  I interrupted her to ask if it would be a problem if I called once I got to a land line in Washington and she said yes.  Well this went better than I had expected.  I really thought that she might have been calling out the ""paddy wagon"" with the straight jackets for me.  It was at this time after speaking on the radio she got out of the car and looked at me straight on.  She then proceeded to tell me she believed me and did not think that I was a ""NUT"" since if I was a nut seeing things at night then they had 2 RCMP's that were the same and were seeing things in broad daylight.  She said that a craft had been sited in the same area just a few days before.  I proceeded on feeling much better actually.  When I got to Arlington, Washington at a motel I called the desk at the RCMP's at Houston and gave them a full report.  Now, I am going to tell you something at this point.  I tried when this actually happened to give a report to you over the phone and you were very rude to me.  I had seen the lights over Texas also a month later.  THis was when they lights were appearing over Washington, Texas and several other places.  You said you were too busy to take the report over the phone and for me to file it on the Internet.  We just got a Computer here not to long ago.  So don't blame be for waiting for so long to report this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  We will forward the case to Brian Vike, B. C.

I thought this thing may be close to me but as it moved to the east it passed in BACK of the WAVY little Cirrus Clouds that are close to 30,000 feet in altitude ( yes, I am bright enough that I thought of testing its hight with CLOUDS). Again no sound.  I DID NOT THINK IT WAS A WEATHER BALLOON/ EVEN IF ONE COULD SURVIVE BEING INFLATED TO THAT PERFECT ROUNDNESS. TO HAVE APPEARED >THAT LARGE AT 35,000 feet it would have had to be huge. Bigger than a Boeing 747 because when watched from the ground a boeing 747 does not appear to be the size of the moon until it is much lower, say 5000 feet or less.  To approach that much pressure the high altitude weather balloons would be much closer to 25 miles above the earth anyway and would not even be visible). Again I could have followed the object but did not. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Dates are approximate.  PD))",2003-10-31T00:00:00,46.17882291666667,-119.16297812500001

About 2 weeks later again on the highway somewhere between Kelowna and Penticton I saw it descend through the clouds. It dropped about 50 m still oscillating and pulsing with the lights. In less than a blink it became an equilateral triangle. It wobbled a bit and then stayed suspended as if painted into the sky. It was after midnight,and it was over a building. It was dark grey, platform with the middle lights off. I only saw the bottom of the craft. It did not reflect any light. There were three small half globes in each corner, and one large center one.

There was no moon and there are no lights around. Our eyes had become accustomed to the low light and we walked to a lookout. On the way back I looked over the resevoir and saw a light dart up then down below the range of hills in the distance. I stopped walking and watched and it flew up again, hovered with a shaking motion, then ""hid"" again. The object had a white light on the front, a red light on the bottom and a flashing yellow light on the back. At all times it was silent. I drew my lady friends attention to the distance and it obligingly darted into view again. It didn't seem to be affected by inertia and when stationary, seemed to shake as if it was between two repelling magnets. At one stage it dissapeared behind the range of hills and a vivid red light lit up the trees on the ridge as if they were on fire. Then it flew up, darted round then flew down to the water. A bright red light eminated from the front of it, not a beam, more like ambient light. After a couple of minutes it flew up again and started moving in our direction. It started off about 2/3 kms away and got to a few hundred metres away before I decided to leave. There was a feeling of danger and were glad to go, despite my curiosity. One of the strangest things about the event was that as we left the house to start our midnight ramble, I had a feeling that we would see something and I said as much to my girlfriend.

First I would like to say that all my statements are absolutely true and I am sorry that I waited 3 years to file.  I will do the best I can to remember.  I served my country for 6 years in the Marines and have no reason or desire to decieve or waste scientific time.  I just think my account deserves to be included. It was a cool evening sometime in May of 2000. I was standing outside my friends house with a few buddies smoking cigarettes.  There was a total of 6 of us outside that night.  Sometime around 2300 in the Eastern sky a bright object appeared which resembled a very large star.  The light seemed to be coming out of the craft at a even and constant rate, so basically it was a ball of light.  Not like any aircraft I have ever seen.  And I have seen a lot, my MOS was 6060 flight equipment tech. Anyway what was really strange was the speed and angles that it was traveling for some strange reason the craft made several(3 or 4) rediculously sharp turns at angles approching or exceeding 90 degrees.  The craft covered a good deal of space considering it was at least 7-10,000 feet in the sky.  The thing I really hate to say is the fact that it sounds like many other UFO sightings I have heard.  Maybe we are not all crazy? Only myself and another friend so the objct. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I had a call from a friend telling me to go to his room.  (I was living in military barracks at the time.)  His balcony faced north-west, directly toward the peak of Kaala, probably 15 or so miles away.  He already had his video camera running and told me about this light that pulsed bright and dim coming from behind the mountain, rising up through the clouds, and drop back down.  So of course I stuck around for awhile, I have never witnessed anything unusual like that my entire life.  After talking for about ten minutes, camera still running propped up towards the mountain, we saw the clouds over there get somewhat lit up from some light source behind Kaala.  It raised up, kinda like a sunrise I guess, and kept going.  At first I thought it might of been someone driving around up there, but when it raised up through the clouds, pulsating from a dull orange to a brighter orange, going from dull to bright in about a second, I quickly changed my mind.  It pulsed at a rate which had similarity to a sine wave.  It went up, hovered for a few seconds above and behind the clouds.  We could still see the light pulsating, reflecting off and through the clouds.  It then dropped back down, between the clouds and the mountain where we got a clear view of it, and then back behind the mountain.  It quit, then about 5 minutes after it disappeared, it lit up the clouds again but never surfaced from behind the mountain.  This was all on video-tape and we showed it to a few friends.  I transferred it to my computer, (about 4 Gigs worth).  So quite a few people actually saw the shot, and still had no idea of what it could be (One person said it could have been some machinery that they use for the pineapple fields.)  Unforunately, he ended up taping over it, and my harddrive crashed.  Government conspiracy?  Maybe not, but it was still cool.  Personally I think it may have been some flares, and there also is an airfield back there, where people often skydive, so I am still very skeptical and know there is a! realistic answer to this.

In general shape it appeared to be simlar to the aircraft Dick Rutan is building to go into outer space, but that is where it ends.  The craft was a delta/flying winged aircraft with winglets or vertical stabilizers on the outside of the wings, the nasel (nose) of the craft was rounded and the empenage (tail section) appeared to have a slight down wash. Upto this point all seemed normal, but where a normal F117 or other aircraft would have a cockpit canopy  an oval shaped tower was located at 90 degrees to the rest of the plane - simlar to the command bridge on a submarine.  The surface of this tower was porouse, looking  like you skin does under a microscope.  It was curved over at the top as if the center might be open or accessible to enter or whatever.  This tower had three colours ringing it horizontally, they were flat gray, black, and a magenta (maroon), appeared to blend into each other with no clear division of the clours. Everything seemed normal aerodynamicaly for a high performance plane except for this unusal tower sticking up (i.e. immense drag etc.). The rest of the aircraft appeared to be a light gray along the lines of  what some Air Force planes are painted. Have not came forward with this at the time of siting because I thought just possibly the craft could be of this world and felt it not my place to disclose any advance craft of our nation.  However, it has now been about 13 years and I've sure not heard of any such craft in our  military inventory as of late. In closing, I am a retired soldier (22 yrs.) who worked in intelligence and hold a commercial aircraft license airplane single, multi-engine land with instrument and CFI. I seek no attention from this, but only wonder any other folks might have seen similar aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-26T00:00:00,35.1013,-110.6473

We were standing outside the house when my friend jokingly flashed his flashlight into the sky a few times. We got really spooked when right after that a strange object passed silently right in our line of sight across the night sky. I didn't see any actual detail of the craft, but it had 8 lights arranged in a rectangular fashion. It seemed to be quite close to us. That is, we were standing on the steps in front of the house and looking across the street where the object was at an angle that put it just above the trees. It appeared to be roughly the size of a helicopter at a distance of a couple hundred yards. The strange part, though, is that it made no sound at all. I live near an air force base and in the path of coast guard patrols, so I'm used to hearing passing aircraft. At the distance my mind was assuming the object had to be at (that is, a couple hundred yards), a helicopter would have been really loud. The night was completely silent, too, as the unidentified object silently glided across the sky. It moved in a straight line at a speed comparable to the coast guard helicopters patrolling over my house, which I assume is something like 40-50 MPH or so.  One other possibility is that instead of what I saw being a single, close aircraft, it could have been a more distant formation of aircraft (since I didn't see any detail of the ""craft"" besides its lights), which could also explain the lack of sound. The problem with this is that each light was a single, distinct point. Even at long distances a normal civilian or military plane has multiple lights that are easily discernable.

First thought was that this should be a helicopter from the near airbase, but helicopters do not move like that, and do not have this type of light. I would say that the object was looking like a bright star, which was probably not so far from us. It moved sometimes slow, sometimes faster, and traectory was not straight, but rather chaotic. I actualy have some idea where this object exactly was, but I am no sure if I can say that in the Internet. At 4 o'clock my colleague came to change me. With him there were three more people. Later on he said that after about 15 more minutes, the object suddenly disappeared: 'It was like a falling star - not falling on the ground, but falling in the sky.'

I first posted my account online in 1996 or 1997, but I’m not sure where I posted it, and have not found any record of the report to date.  My original report may have been written better than my recent one.  To the readers, I apologize for this shortfall. I spoke recently with the other witness and I have made a composite drawing of our accounts.  I neglected to describe the presence of ""portholes"" or windows in the side of the UFO.  The oversight is the result of poor preparation.  I apologize. Perhaps a more personalized account of the event will shed some additional light on the event.  The sighting occurred on September 11, 1995, the day after my father-in-law died.  My friend and I were traveling in my 1985 Pontiac Sunbird south along highway 97.  The time was certainly between 4:30 to 6:00 pm because the sun was still fairly high in the sky, but was beginning to cast long shadows.  The sky was clear, but there were high clouds, the air was fine and all things considered, it was a fine day for a drive.  I’ll recount the thoughts in my head in italics as the event unfolded:  "" JUST DRIVING. Great weather, nice drive; dry pavement, sunshine, cool breeze As we headed south towards Pierce City, I was driving 50-55 mph and was getting prepared to slow down in a few moments, the edge of town was in sight from the hilltop and we began to crest down it.  A BLIMP? What’s that to my left?  Big Silvery metal-looking thing. Floating just above the trees. On down the hill, in a field to my front and left I noticed a cigar shaped object with bright lights coming from the center below it.  I assumed it was a blimp with a flashing advertising sign underneath it.  WHAT’S TO ADVERTISE? What are they trying to sell?  There’s just trees and squirrels out here.  Where’s the gondola (where people ride).. Oh portholes! how weird, retro, looks like something from a Jules Verne novel! Cool!  HAH At this point, I had noticed that there were porthole windows inside the object itself.  That is odd, blimps have big windows on the little gondolas that hang beneath it.  I remember seeing a single row of about 10 little glassy portholes along the side.  The lights below it were very bright, which I expected were just advertising lights.  Then I laughed out loud and pointed the object out to my friend.  I said,  ""Look at the blimp!""  He knew I was wrong immediately. In a later conversation, we discussed the number of portholes, I thought there were between 7 and 10.  My friend said there were twelve.  When I asked him if there could have been 9, he said in a very matter of fact tone, ""There were TWELVE.""  Rather than get beat up over the matter, I dropped the topic, and now that I think about it, 12 seems about right.  THOSE ARE BRIGHT LIGHTS! Those are bright lights on that thing. Ow they stab my eyes.  Maybe it’s just a reflection from the sun. ""Damn that hurts, why is the car all lit up??  Why is he being so quiet? In this very short time I found myself being confronted with bright lights, an awestruck passenger and a UFO, even though I still thought it was a blimp.  My laughter died when I was being  ""flashed"" by the lights.  If you’ve been flashed by a car on the highway at night, you can begin to understand the annoyance I was going through.  The car had a reddish-yellow glow on the inside from the lighting and I could see my own shadows in the back and passenger’s seats.  My friend was absolutely catatonic with his stare at the craft.  It was only then that I began to realize what was going on.  NOT A BLIMP AT ALL What’s he gawking at?  That’s no blimp. There’s no tail on it, no writing.  No gondola.  No propellers!! No tail fins!!  crap. As soon as I pass this tree, we can get a good look at this thing.""   At the point I realize it is not a standard blimp is the point where my mind begins to race.  It should be noted that my eyes had a burning sensation. And we both felt a strong ""current"" going through us.  The current is no more than that weird feeling you get by standing to close to a microwave or watching tv from less than a foot.  (We both agree that there was nothing to get excited about) ""Because I am an avid reader and a speed reader, I have terrific eye speed.  I was able to search the craft for humans, writing and propellers.  It had none of them. As we began to approach a roadside tree, we were on pace to be alongside the craft in a matter of seconds. A SILVERY STREAK Alright let’s see what this is. Around this tree.  What?  Where is it?  A streak, going up  and right.  IT'S  OVER THE ROAD  "" Gone!  Gone  GONE. I wouldn’t know it was a UFO until the thing just vanished!  As I prepared to look as the tree passed from view, it plainly wasn’t there.  My friend just made a weird ""huh?"" noise and I noticed it was streaking up and to the right.( for you geometry people the rate of angle was 60 degrees, straight and at the speed of a blur).  When I say blurred, I mean the craft flashed like a strobe light and at a high speed.  It was quickly overhead and then disappeared completely.  The object had moved from a hover to a speed I would estimate as a little faster than the speed of aerial rockets in fireworks displays. What WAS that? I didn’t know then and I still don’t know now.  But I have happily reported all I know to the people of the world.  My friends have seen UFOs but they won’t report them.  That’s too bad.  But it is their own business, and I respect it.  I encourage others to report what they have seen.  It’s doubtful that the government will send thugs to your house, or aliens will abduct you for talking.  I don’t really believe in either entity much. I was moved by my sighting, as was my friend.  He would see another one later.  I know I shouldn’t tell his story, it’s not mine to tell, but I’ll share it anyway. After we saw the UFO in 1995, we searched the skies looking for another.  I haven’t seen one since, but in June 2003, my friend saw his SECOND UFO. He had been waiting for over 7 years to see one again.  He calmly pulled over to the side of the road, parked his car, and reached into the back seat.  What he was reaching for was his camera.  He had it handy.  He pointed and clicked.  But he had forgotten to wind his film.  He quickly wound his film and aimed.  As he got the UFO in the viewfinder, it disappeared!  Now he keeps his camera wound and ready.  He’ll get them next time I’m sure! It might sound like a made-up story, but I believe it, he’s not the type to kid around.  He just sighed and laughed, because he knows I believe him, we’re not crazy, and life is still too good to worry about things like that.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,36.9459,-94.0002

The object never moved or made a sound the 5 plus minutes I sat there looking at it.  It's like my eyes were seeing this object but my brain wasn't registering what I was seeing.

However when I went up to  my office later that night around 7 or so, I looked out the window and saw it was still there and very bright. It was to the left of sunset so I figure it was lit up by the sun. Then it turned orange, and sort of faded. I assumed that it was a balloon because this is an area where hot air balloons are so prevalent.  But it was odd that it stayed there for so long. Usually balloon rides are relatively short. The other unusual thing I noticed is that the bottom/sides of the thing seemed to have some sort of energy that was distorting light, as if it were engine exhaust or something like that.  I just found out about the ufo reporting page and noticed that others reported it too. I *did* photograph it and put the photos on  my web site.

It is a 'comment' report on a follow-up investigation done by a Michigan MUFON Field Investigator.  Occurred : 9/20/2003 18:00 (Entered as : 09/20/2003 18:00) Reported: 9/21/2003 6:45:44 PM 18:45 Posted: 9/24/2003 Location: Fraser, MI Shape: Light Duration:25-30 minutes star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky My Brother was out in the yard and called to us to hurry and come look at ""this"". In the sky directly above us were what we at first thought were hot air balloons that ascended so high they appeared to look like stars in the clear blue sky. There were 3 in a formation of a perfect triangle to the left and 4 to the right in the shape of a diamond. Then they began to dance in the sky with each other returning to their positions. Coming very close to each other but never colliding. There were 3 sets of these formations. One had a stream of light coming from it leading me to believe it was a hot air balloon but when it ascended up and disappeared I dismissed that idea.  Nearing the 20 minutes of watching these star-like objects dancing in the sky others started to appear as dim stars and became brighter up to 50 were in the sky at one time dancing, but never colliding. They ascended and just disappeared. There was no sound, no aircraft in the area, no tails on the craft above us.  The observers ranged in age from 81 a homemaker, a police detective (just retired)51, myself (laid off) 48, retired auto worker 53, spouse 54, niece 32, Ameritech line man, 51 and spouse, 51.  Comments on - WUFOD Case 2-826 - Fraser, MI Multiple Witness Daylight Sighting I received FI (I.e. Field Investigator) David Twichell’s photocopied forms and report on Sunday November 9, 2003. My initial impression of this case was that it was a solid case that would produce quite an extensive report due to it being a daylight sighting. The investigator originally included with his report a copy of the original WUFOD report in context of an email I sent him, Form 1 (2 pages), with an extra page for the spillover of the reporting witness’s personal account, a 2 page hand-written description of the object by the witness, Form 2 (3 pages), Form 4 (1 page), Form 5 (1 page) with an added handwritten page describing the psychological and physiological effects as reported by the witness, a 3 page typed report by FI Twichell, a 2 page printout of the weather conditions for Mt. Clemens, MI on September 20, 2003, a one page small printout of a map of the sighting location and two cassette tapes of the phone interviews of all witnesses involved.  There were 8 witnesses in total however after all was said and done only 1 witness’s signature and form are on file with Michigan MUFON. The 1-hour onsite interview was done on November 3, 2003 with R G and her mother S at R’s home. The attention of the investigator has been drawn towards R G, who appears to be the dominant witness and whom initially filed the report. I will summarize my thoughts on the other witnesses accounts first, then R G’ account, and finally on the case as a whole.  MA D, wife of L D, described the event in a very straightforward serious manner, with excellent detail. The time of the event as noted by M A was around 4:00 pm (2 hour discrepancy here compared to other witnesses T.L.) or a bit thereafter. She mentions that one of the objects could’ve been a ‘party balloon’ floating upward with a spiral tail attached to the balloon. She mentions that L, her husband, in fact said it was a party balloon. M is in agreement with most of the other witness’s in the fact that she stated she was facing south and the objects were moving from west to east. She suggested that she thought it may have been a ‘weather gadget’ as appears in the movie ‘Twister’, and may have had something to do with weather testing. She mentions a 45-minute duration to the sighting. She described the movements of the clusters of objects as being ‘like a butterfly’, no jerky movements. She also didn’t report any physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting.  L D, the witness who was first to see the objects mentions them catching his eye while he was walking up the back steps, to go in the house, around 3:55 pm. He was looking towards the west at about 40o up from the horizon. He stated the sighting duration was approximately 47 minutes. He too reported no physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting. He mentioned initially seeing 7 shiny ‘dots’…. 3 being in a ‘straight line’, and 4 being shaped in a ‘straight edged arch’. He mentions some of the objects rotating around in a circle very slowly. Most of his account matches closely with that of his wife M A and that leaves me with the question of, “Was there significant collaboration between the two witnesses resulting in some level of contamination in these two accounts? This seems most evident in the time at which they estimated the sighting began.  S D - L’s Mother - The initial part of this taped conversation has only the voice of FI David Twichell due to the fact that his speakerphone was not turned on. After David asks her about what time [the sighting began - T.L.] there is some silence and then David mentions a time of 6:30 pm during the early part of their conversation. I’m making what I believe is a valid assumption, based on the taped conversation, that they are speaking of the onset of the sighting event. She mentions her friends present at the sighting location counting about 8 -10 lights. She stated they were moving around one another and darting back and forth. She also mentions a sighting duration of 15-20 minutes. Here we see a large discrepancy in the time of the event onset and the sighting duration as compared to L and M A’s account. S states the objects were seen ‘overhead’ in the southeast initially and then darted to the west for a short distance further stating that she didn’t have to move her head very much to follow them. She mentions also that the sun had set approximately 1 hour after the objects disappeared. The sunset, as listed at the bottom of the weather data, was at 7:30 pm so her approximation of the onset of the event being at 6:30 pm could very well be correct. She too mentions the possibility of the objects being helium balloons. She also stated she was emotionally excited and had ‘chills’ up and down her arms. This witness has had a previous sighting of a cigar-shaped object, which she experienced in Canada but no specific information was given about this sighting.  AM G - She initially states the time of the sighting started at 5:30 pm. She states she was initially facing south, which is in agreement with most of the other witnesses. She mentions the objects slowly moving, or drifting across the sky and that she watched them for approximately 2 hours (a notable discrepancy in the sighing duration here - T.L.). For the most part the description of the objects is in agreement with the others. She states she suffered from no physiological or psychological effects, however she does mention one interesting effect and that was she saw “little white specks” like TV static in her eyes due to her head being craned up towards the sky. She had to repeatedly look down to relieve this effect and readjust her eyes. She believes this may have been due to her looking up in the sky for long periods of time. She said the objects were at an elevation of approximately 80o to directly overhead. (Here too is a discrepancy in what was said to be a 40o elevation for the objects mentioned by the initial witness L. - T.L.) J G had very little to add to this investigation. His interview was extremely short. He was in the house watching a football game and showed very little interest in determining what the others were viewing. He states the sighting onset was approximately 6:00 pm. He stated he didn’t look at the objects long enough to discern much detail. He stated what he saw was a bunch of cluster type star shapes and then went right back in to watch the football game, not looking at them long enough to even determine if they were moving. He stated that the other witnesses stayed outside for 15-20 minutes watching the objects.  M Z stated onset of sighting event was about 5:30 pm. She stated she saw white ‘balls’ like a balloon but it wasn’t a balloon. She states there was about 15-20 of them and the sighting duration was a good 45 minutes. She stated that the objects were in different areas and not in one spot. The witness says they [her and the other witnesses] were all kind of nervous. M stated that R called [reported them to MUFON] because her and her mother thought these were some kind of thing from outer space. She states the objects were moving in different directions, yet says that it could’ve been the wind blowing them. She said at no time did they change color. No physiological or psychological effects noted by this witness. Witness, in my opinion, seemed very hesitant to give out her address, and left only her phone number with FI Twichell. Her husband M was interviewed later.  MZ stated he saw 10 whitish things that could’ve been balloons. He didn’t watch them too long and didn’t think anything of it. Stated it didn’t interest him so he went back in the house. Onset of event he says was 5:30 - 5:45 pm. To him it looked like balloons. He stated they were kind of drifting not going any certain way. Objects were at a high altitude. He watched the objects for approximately 5 minutes. Nothing unusual noticed, as they were too far away to tell. No color changes noticed. Very short interview…approximately 3 minutes.  R G, the witness who reported this incident, was affected quite differently by this event. She states the onset of the event was around 6:00 pm with a total duration of 25-30 minutes, which fits in well with most of the other witness’s accounts, except for those of L and MA D. She first thought these were hot air balloons. She went on to describe their movements using the word ‘dancing’ meaning they would move towards and away from, and around each other. She initially saw 7 objects in two different groups. She describes the color as being dim blue then turning brighter. She goes on to describe in detail, as evidenced in the taped interview, many perceptions that weren’t described by the other 7 witnesses. R’s size estimation being that of an aspirin, as suggested by the FI is quite in opposition to the starlike description given by the other witnesses. She relates her account in a very excited way with a lot of emotion in her voice. The other witnesses sounded much calmer when relating their accounts.  R mentions another sighting she witnessed about 17 years ago in which she called Selfridge ANG at that time as well, with no response from her message left on the automated answering system at the base. 20 minutes into her phone interview R adamantly mentions there was not a plane anywhere in the sky. She then mentions, about 27 minutes into the interview that “after, a jetliner was by and it was higher than that”. This point being unclear as to whether or not the objects were in the sky during the time the plane was seen. I asked FI Twichell to clarify this if he could. He states, “As to the plane involved in the sighting of Sept. 20th, I’m sorry I’m not making myself clear on this. I didn’t make a copy of the recorded interviews so I can’t check them for clarity but the witnesses agree that they did not see any conventional aircraft in the sky until the very end of the sighting episode. While the objects were still above them, a jet, coming from the direction of Selfridge, came into view and headed in the direction of the objects. At this time, the objects ascended and were gone from view. MA stated that the plane was visible while the objects were still visible.  R goes on to mention her husband’s flu-like illness previous to the sighting and it’s complete reversal during the sighting, and then a subsequent relapse afterwards. She feels this may be relevant. Her husband did not mention this during his interview. R also noticed a definite difference in local animal activity whereas the others did not, and also mentioned an eerie silence during the event. She goes on to describe the remainder of the sighting as mentioned within David’s report.  On Form 2, first page, under ‘Shape’ I noticed that ‘disk’ was checked off but I hadn’t heard any witness mention anything about a ‘disk’ shape to these objects. I queried David about this and he replied, “The one object that appeared to be larger than the others, with the curly-Q tail, was described by R G as being more disk-shaped than star like. She was the only witness that made this observation. I’m not aware of where this statement appears in the context of the material that has been made available to me (T.L.).  I completed forms 4 & 5 as indicated on the forms. These were sent by the FI, via postal mail, to the witness to be completed and signed. Once she returned them he felt they shouldn’t be altered after her signature was placed on the form. I added the necessary data in order to complete the forms.  WUFOD, NUFORC and Filer’s Files were checked for sighting reports that may be relevant to this report but nothing of any significance was discovered. This sighting was also reported on September 21, a day previous to it being reported to WUFOD, to Peter Davenport’s NUFORC website. See http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31702.html I’m not aware of any other communications between R and Mr. Davenport. Mr. Davenport has made the original report available to me.  Due south of the sighting location is Victor Airway 221- 464 which is on an 85o (E-W) heading. Wind direction from ground level (329 ft. at DTX weather station at Pontiac White Lake) to ~35,000 ft. ranged from 240o - 270o (blowing from the west to east approximately) at speeds ranging from to 6 - 50 mph respectively. From 35,000 ft. to 97,000 ft. the wind direction was a bit more sporadic, ranging from 20o - 240o at speeds ranging from 58 - 3.5 mph respectively. These figures were taken from radiosonde data from the above-mentioned Nexrad weather station located approximately 30 miles northwest of the sighting location near Waterford, Michigan. Archived NOTAM’s (Notice to Airmen) were also checked for the date in question but nothing of note was listed.  In my opinion it is evident that helium balloons tied together could account for some of the movements described by the majority of the witnesses. As far as the event time and sighting duration discrepancies are concerned I would tend to think the 6:00 pm time range is correct due to the fact that the party was completed and the cleanup had begun. The football game (Michigan vs. Oregon) was televised at 3:30 pm with the postgame show starting at 6:30 pm. The sighting duration discrepancies are wide ranging but all estimates are, as far as typical UFO sightings are concerned, rather long in duration. This would make me lean even further towards the ‘balloon’ hypothesis as a possible explanation due to the objects slow and drifting movements. There are some aspects such as the color change and ‘beam of light’ or ‘light bar’ noted by a few of the witnesses that would be difficult to explain via the balloon hypothesis, other than it being some type of reflective string used to tie the balloons together.  Overall, I would have to evaluate this sighting as BORDERLINE IFO due to the distance between the witnesses and the objects, the object’s ‘point like’ appearance yielding no notable surface characteristics or structure, and their slow drifting movements.

I was walking my dog West, on Ole Daniel Boone Road, toward I-75. I had been watching the sky quite a bit because Mars had been close to Earth and this is also the first I have lived back out away from city lights in about 10 years. There was what I thought was a star, cradled in a dip in the tree line. It looked large the way Mars had, so I was particulary interested, though Mars at this time of night was SouthEast. I thought it might be a larger planet or something, but when my dog stopped to go to relieve himself, I realized that it was moving. There were powerlines that also ran through the dip in the tree line that gave a point of reference and it was moving in relation to that, most noticeably. I figured that it would be gone shortly, so I stood a and watched it a while. I didn't think it's movement was anything a helicopter couldn't do, but I also knew, from a figure I'd just heard that it costs about $500/hr. to operate a helicopter and that helicopters are typically going somewhere. What point would there be to just bobbing and drifting side, after dark? I was basically white and oval and some times seemed to shade to having a blue-ish halo. The center never changed colors.  I kept expecting it to dart off as they supposedly do, but after a while, I decided I wanted to see if I could get some witnesses, so I could talk about it to somebody without them thinking I was making it up. So, we ran back to my fourplex where we have a second floor apartment, where my wife, sister-in-law and nephew were. I breathlessly  (I'm overweight) told them to come out on the balcony, hoping that it would still be there. It was a little harder to see, because there's a big orange security light behind the building, but it was still there. We stood back there and watched it and talked about it for a long time, and we all were kind of waiting for it to dart off, but it just bobbed and weaved. I actually knelt down and put my chin on the heels of my hands to make sure my head moving wasn't making it look like some fixed object was moving because the treeline was only about 100 yards away. I saw on FOX that a lot of people watching Area 51 thought they were seeing a UFO weave side to side, but that they were seeing an airliner, bringing people to work there, correcting itself, as it was approaching a runway. So we talked about that for a while and decided that if we were watching a plane from head-on that it would eventually make some progress, but it never seemed to. My nephew didn't really understand what it was and was starting to get bored and acting up a little bit, so we actually all just finally went inside and the clock showed it was 10:10, but my wife sets it up a few minutes so she won't be late for work, where there's a fast clock. When my sister-in-law left, about 30 minutes later, we looked again from the parking lot to see if it was still there and we didn't see it, but she later told us that as she was driving home she could see it, West of I-75, but South of where she lives in Lexington. If I had to guess, I believe the light was between Richmond and Nicholasville, KY. I would not have reported this, normally, but I have just read the story of what happened in Morehead, KY and the c! rop formation in Flemingsburg. Though this may not be a particularly interesting UFO story, it may be significant that there was a certain level of activity in Central and Eastern Kentucky, within a certain time frame. I am going to e-mail an animated gif I have created in photoshop to demonstrate, in a very simple way, how it behaved, though it didn't move quite this jerky and had no particular pattern of movement.

They continued this routine, come on, go out, change places, come back on, for approximately 7 to 8 minutes. I don't know if they stopped the routine, I watched until I couldn't see them anymore. Another thing, I don't know if this has anything to do with the lights, but there were also three small points of light that I thought were airplanes at a distance, but they made a triangle around the orange lights. From debth perception, I know the two aren't physically connected though. A question that might need to be answered is, is there a military base, or testing/practice area close to Circleville?

I wish someone could shed some light on this matter.  A lot of time has passed since the event, but I'll try to recall the incident as accurately as I can.  It was late summer in 1961 when ((deleted--witness #2)), ((witness #3)), ((witness #4)), ((witness #5)), and myself were camping on ((deleted)) farm.  I believe it was on a Friday late in the afternoon when we set up camp.  I always gathered the firewood and started the fire whenever we camped out.  Just before dusk I set out to gather some firewood.  ((deleted)) farm was a pristine farm consisting of series of rolling hills covered with little vegetation except in the ravines or small valleys.  It was in these places that I set out to find some firewood.  As I reached the top of the second ridge I looked down into a grassy ravine and observed a dead tree lying on its side.  The bark had fallen away revealing a bleached trunk and branches.  It had been there a long time.  I went down to the tree and gathered as much firewood as I could.  I thought to myself, just before I descended the hill to the dead tree, how beautiful the contrast of the bleached tree was to the green grass cropped by the sheep.  I returned to the camp with my first load of wood and I asked ((witness #2)) if he would assist me in retrieving some firewood several ridges over.  Thus between the two of us had a sufficient amount of firewood for the night including my first gathering.  Late that night we were in our tent telling scary stories.  All of us were around 14 years of age since we were classmates at Princeton High School, in Sharonville, Ohio. Around midnight we heard a strange sound above us which lasted for about 10 or 15 seconds.  The best way to describe the sound is to say that it was a high pitched whiring sound.  It sounded something like a jet engine at idle, but not as loud and it had a softer sound.  We were already a bit spooked and this unknown sound startled us.  I grabbed my bee bee gun and quickly exited the tent, not so much as to face off with the intruder, I just didn't want to be in the tent where I could not see the present of possible danger.  All the guys exited with me and we gathered together looking to the Southwest.  That seemed to be the direction of the last sounds we heard.  I may add that it is also the direction of the GE, Evendale Jet Engine Plant.  After spending a few minutes outside, we reentered the tent and bedded down.  I settled into my sleeping bag while listening for and pondering the possible sources of the strange sound.  As I said GE Aircraft Engine Group was West or Southwest of us about 6 miles and the nearest road was to the North of us about one half mile. I thought perhaps it was the sound of squeaking brakes of a Semi Tractor and Trailer descending down the hill on the road to the North of us or perhaps it was a late night test of a jet engine being tested in one of the many test cells at GE.  In the middle of my curiosity I must have fallen asleep and I didn't awaken until the next morning.  It was chilly so I decided to gather some firewood from the same spot as the evening as before, which was Southwest of our campsite.  To my surprise, next to the dead tree was a perfect circle burnt in the green grass, green for empahsis.  The charred area was approximately 20 feet in diameter and it was Northwest of the fallen tree approximately 20 feet.  I descended to the strange circle and I remember wondering why I didn't notice the circle the night before.  Then I ruled out the possibility of missing such a blaring landmark since I recalled thinking how beautiful the contrast of the dead tree and grass was just the night before.  I even considered that the KKK may have had meeting and built the fire, surely they would have used the firewood from the fallen tree and it was undisturbed and the charred area was not that of a normal fire.  The grass was simply charred black.  I thought I would test my recollection of this site as it was the night before, so I returned to the camp and asked ((name deleted)) if he would help me gather some more firewood without telling him of the burnt circle of grass.  I wanted see if he would have any reaction to the charred circle of grass.  I remember this part of the incident and the conversation that ensued quite well.  As we arrived at the top of the second ridge ((name deleted)) said, ""Look at that!"" I said to ((name deleted)), Look at what? ((name deleted)) replied, That circle of burnt grass. I said, So...?  He replied, It wasn't there when we came here yesterday.""  I knew then that this circle of fire had not been there the day before. ((name deleted)) and I investigated the charred grass and discussed the possible origins, but all of the possibilities seemed rather lame.  We both agreed that it was not there the day before. I refrained from saying anything about a flying saucer though the thought came to my mind. ((name deleted)) and I returned to camp and invited the others to come and see something.  All of us were baffled.  ((name deleted)) never burned open fires on his farm.  Open fires on local farms like ((name deleted)) farm or like the one I lived on at this time was an event that rarely occured.  To burn underbrush or dead trees was a fire hazard too great because of the dryness of the season.  Sometime afterwards, I woke up in the middle of the night after a terrifying dream.  I dreamed that I was in a struggle or fight with someone.  It was very dark in my room even though my eyes should have been adjusted to the darkness.  I suddenly realized that a large amount of liquid was running from my nose.  At first,I thought I had a major nose run, but the smell around my face was strange and I could taste the liquid and it was different.  I made my way through the darkness to the bathroom and fumbled for the light switch.  I turned on the light and I saw blood on the light switch cover and then I looked into the mirror and to my utter surprise the lower half of my face was smeared with blood.  The blood was still gushing from both nostrils.  I had never been prone to nose bleeds even when I got into a scuffle now and then.  I cleaned myself up and woke my father and told him of the incident.  Lastly, my concentration on my studies fell way off and I do admit that I wasn't interested in school at the time, but stuff came to me easily until the above events.  I apologize for the lengthy description and I freely admit that I have in the past fifteen years read about people being abducted and/or abused by so called aliens but what I have expressed is true.  I have never seen any hard evidence of the existence of aliens or their spacecraft.  If there is something to my story and the many others I want to know what happened to me and the others...

I was facing my boyfriend laying in his arms in the front seat when he grabed my arms and just turned my body around in the car and said quietly to me, look over there. My heart raced when in the field through some small little trees we saw this very round and shiny object like surgical steel  in a circle shape but had a flat bottom and top. We all got out of the car so scared as we were young,we thought no one would believe us. We stood there watching this object glowing for as long as 10 mins.and then watched how it took off. It used a hugh beam of light to push itself up off of the ground by the light comming down and moving the craft up and then it would shoot another beam of light down to push itself up again higher and higher until it had gotten high enough to start the lights around the indented center to glow around it and then we watched this ufo jolt faster than we could keep our eyes on it with no noise whatsoever. We were so shocked or in shock at what we all we had observed that we all decided it was not the place to be. We do however have what they called the Nike Site which is a Government Base which was around 1 1/2 miles away from that field. That field was owned by some people in Providence who let the pigs live there in old buses and live off the land and they used them for pig roasts. We never reported this but I told my brother whom was in the Air Force and he told me we should have reported it. At that time I guess they were looking into ufo's at that time. He flew so he didn't take what I had told him lightly. However shortly after telling my mom and  my brother my mom saw an object one night hovering over our neighbors hugh front yard, they had cows and farm animals and lots of land.She told me the nest day about it because as she watched it she said for a half hour or more, wh! ich she said seemed like hours, she said she was frozen stiff and couldn't move. She told her friend and her friend showed her the Pawtuxet Valley Times front page which showed a news article or picture about the night before. My mom is not alive now or I would ask her but she told her friend that she thought she had lost her mind and or was dreaming while standing up looking through our bathroom window that night. She didn't report it as she thought everyone would think she was nuts. Back then in those small towns which aren't small any more, no one believed you unless it was gossip. But to this day I still remember it so well as it was so fascinating and I know what my friends and I saw and we often talk about it. But there is only 3 of us left. I only wish I could see one now. I would have the guts to go back the next day or maybe while it was still there and try and find out all I could about it. We had no idea how long it had been there before us because we parked there before it was dark and when that craft started to leave and push it self up with the beam of light from underneath it was dark, so it lit all the field up. We could see the buses that sat a few 100 feet away in the back of the field. The light from underneath also started to come out form under the craft as a hugh circle of light and then as it ascended upward it sort of came down like a cone shape of light. Like a flash light would do if you started with the flashlight beam face down on the floor.  Well I could talk forever on this subject but enough is enough. But if anyone in Coventry wants to talk online with me just put something on the web here if you can or put a small ad in the Reminder and I'd love to talk to you on the web. Thank You for letting me finally tell my story to people out there who don't belive. But you will when you see it as I did. It was both an experience I'd never miss and one I had many night mares about.  BELIEVE! I DO! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,41.6933,-71.6395

Why I did this is beyond me now, but I pulled up next to it and stopped. It was hovering above the ditch in the exact location where the main entrance to Carl Sandburg College is located now. The college campus didn't exist there in 1967. My fiancee opened her door and stood on the pavement looking at it. I leaned towards her open door then got out my side also. A beam of light like a spotlight came on and shown at an angle down on the ground to the west then it slowly moved off tinto that direction.  The object was approximately ten feet to our right and 20 feet in the air so we were very close to it. It  sounded like a huge vacum cleaner.

We drove down to a corner and turned south just in time to see it accelerate then shoot straight up into the air in southwesternly direction, and at an incredible speed.

I was allowed to go half way around the block and play with my 3 year old girlfriend ""Fluffy"" after 9 AM...her brothers and sisters would be off in school and that is the time my mother said I could go over to Fluffy's house to play. As I walked around the block to her house, I looked in the sky for cloud pictures and there were no clouds, a cloudless sunny day. I went down the driveway as usual to the back of her house and already found her outside in her backyard by the tulips along the side of the yard next to neighbor's garage.I think it had to be the month of May because of the tulips. Fluffy was wearing a new white blouce with rick-rack stitching across it...I asked her if it was new and she said yes and I told her how pretty it was. I asked her what game she wanted to begin playing and she said hide-and-go-seek!  Then it became very, very windy and I was laughing trying to part my long hair out of my face...I noticed the grass was long and blowing strongly too and had not been cut or mowed...I looked over to my girlfriend ""Fluffy"" and she was already crouched in the corner of an ""L"" shaped hedge by the side of her house...I said I hadn't even counted to ten yet and you're hiding! The wind was so strong and I was reaching toward her and she looked very pale and scared. She was shouting at me, ""What is it? What is it?"" and I looked up and saw large square grey tile shapes (metallic, yet I didn't know the word back then) it was low and hovering near the height of the tall tree and high enough up right above the neighbor's garage and I said, ""I don't know...I don't know!""  She was begging me, ""Don't go! Don't go!"" I reached my hand out and said, ""I'll take you with me cuz you're my friend, cuz you're my friend.""  The next memories I have are: Her mother is standing at the back door swinging it open and yelling angry at us, ""I've been looking for you children, where have you been playing, get in here, lunch is ready now!"" (the house has an added on back edition with large picture window facing the backyard and window that looks out to the side of the house by the hedge area, neighbor's driveway.) We were at the side of the house together and it was as if we had become unfrozen from time and were now walking toward her mother upon hearing this to go inside the house. I am confused because I know I just got over there past 9 AM and how can it be lunch time now? Why is her mother seem upset and angry with us? We walk in the house and Chicago WGN Channel 9 is on TV with popular kid's show that comes on at noon called ""Bozo's Circus"" The ping-pong toss into buckets one thru six are happening in the show...which means it is almost over, at the end. I sit down at the kitchen table and look at the clock on the wall and it reads 12:25 PM and I am counting from 9 AM to Noon trying to figure out how it can already be that time...we hadn't even played hide-n-go-seek...why is her mom mad, has she baked a lunch casserole or fancy dish. She serves us folded over half sandwiches of peanut butter and jelly. After lunch, Fluffy and I go down in her basement with crayons (we know we can not draw on the walls of the house)  and put some chairs against the wall underneath the see thru stair steps where we draw with orange, bright green, and red crayons a big spooky man ...he looks scarey like a monster and we put him there on the basement wall that day under the stairs down to the basement laundry room.  Fluffy's five brothers and sisters come  home from school in the afternoon and discover the drawing teasing each other and asking one another who put that on the wall to scare us. They don't believe us when we tell them we drew it, we explained we stood on chairs to draw him tall and big.  The picture remained on the wall till the mid 1990tys before her parents decided to paint the basement with two coats of paint.  I go home that day before 6 PM dinner time to tell my mommy and daddy that I saw something in the sky. I tell them how windy it was and my mom says you must have seen a helicopter and I say no, it didn't make any sound. My father asks me what it looked like and I say big square grey shapes and he says you must have seen a blimp! I don't know or realize what a blimp looks like until I am six years old and I see one in the night sky. My folks remember this day because I would not stop talking about going over to Fluffy's house to play and seeing something in the sky. I remember the feeling of not feeling safe. Her mother did not know where we were and we went away somewhere all morning and came back after 12 o'clock noon time. Fluffy and I both had 3 foot tall manequin dolls and she took her doll out to where the autumn leaf pile is burned in the back yard behind her house and lit a match and burnt her doll.

Now I looked back and left and paid closer attention to the windo3ws. This time the first thing that struck me was how wide they were but the odd thing was just how narrow they were. They didnt seem that high off the ground and hanging in a cloud. They were 6"" to 8"" long and about 1/2"" high and very bright but not like headlights. I saw no beam, but more like a room light up with bright lights, where you cant see out but people can see in. I thought I saw movement behind the lights but that could have just been my eyes playing tricks on me.

After the football game at the high school in Lawrenceville, GA., my cousin's daughters school, my cousin and I were waiting for her husband to get the car and drive around the very crowded lot to pick us up, I looked up at the sky, as I so often do, and floating above us was dark, like the night sky, triangular object, I'd say at least the size of the football field in length and nearly as wide.  It blocked out the stars, and was low enough that I could see its shape, just like something totally black against a nite sky, ie: just black enough to be darker than the sky. It had absolutely no sound. I said to my cousin, ""Look at that.  What in the hell is that?""  She looked up and said, ""I don't know"".  She seemed less concerned, interested, at the moment as she was watching for her daughter and husband and saying hi to friends from the school, other parents, etc.  I was visiting there.  But I was so in awe of it I kept looking at it.  It just floated over us and all the people leaving the game and over the football field and stands. The back of it had a huge round what I would call like a fire burner that I have seen in the past on the back of fighter jets.  Don't know if those still exists or not, as I haven't seen one in years.  It was round with firelight.  NO SOUND AT ALL, tho, that I could hear.  Even hot air balloons have a kind of swooshing sound as they use the ""burner"", or whatever, to push hot air up into the balloons, which I have heard at the annual balloon race in St. Louis.  I kept calling my cousin's attention to it and she would look up and comment so I know she saw it, and we did talk about it later, but she was preoccupied watching the traffic, etc.  Two things really amazed me---I was incredibly in an awestruck state of mind, and I felt no fear, but alot of curiousity.  AND noone, with all those people around us, seemed to notice or be looking up or anything.  I am amazed that I didn't call out to look at that---but I was so in awe--almost trancelike, tho I was in no tr! ance, observing it in amazement. It drifted off.  I saw no lights on it other than what I call like the big fire red burner on the back of it.

Blue lights seemed to be scattered throughout a spherical area in the center of the triangle. The blue lights repeatedly flashed in the same ""seemingly random"" sequence with a momentary hesitation between cycles. Length of cycle was about two seconds.  Distance between triangles was about the width of the moon. All lights remained in ridged formation which never varied. No physical structure or ""craft""  connecting the lights was visible and no stars were obscured.  Elevation was approximately thirty degrees.  A faint engine noise could be heard. Two other people in separate houses under the apparent path of the lights reported hearing a rumbling sound from something passing overhead.  While standing in a street in Grandview, WA, the lights was first seen to the north traveling east. Over the next five minutes they traveled one complete circle around the town until reaching the point where first sighted. Apparent radius of route was maybe three miles. The lights then traveled north east toward the Hanford Nuclear Reservation until out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-10-31T00:00:00,46.2642,-119.9051

I noticed a bright white, smallish blob of light traversing the night sky, at high altitude, traversing the sky from east to west.  It caught my eye, because objects at that altitude do not more that quickly.  It was not moving at an ASTOUNDING rate of speed, but it was moving too fast for the average jet operating at that altitude, so it caught my eye.  As I watched it cross the sky I noted that it seemed to be heading for an identical small blob of light that was STATIONARY, situated at the same altitude, due northwest.  I watched this drama unfold, as the objects seemed to be heading for a rendezvous.  They finally met, and seemed to form a larger blob of light, though there was some separation between them.  Then the pulsing rings of light began, light pulses that were slow, forming vast concentric and expanding rings around the center of the two objects.  There would be a huge flash, followed by an expanding light-ring that filled perhaps 1/16 of the sky.  As one light ring dampened out, the process would repeat.  At this point, I dashed in the house to get my wife to come see.  She also saw the light-ring phenomena.  Finally, the light rings stopped, and the two bright blobs of light simply disappeared.  Again, this event was not reported on in the local papers, in spite of the fact that this was a HUGE phenomena.  I thought it could have been some kind of USAF operation, perhaps an exercise in signalling, but nothing was ever reported.  The date is very approximate -- it could have been anytime between December `1999 and January 2000. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two reports from same source.

I dont recall the exact date of this, all i know is it was in the winter of 99-00, probably between January and February 00.  Its taken me awhile to come forward cuz it was a very scary experience, and many people would question my sanity.  It was shortly after 11:00 pm, and i was reading up in my living room by myself.  We lived on shore property of a lake at the time, and our living room was an upper story room directly overlooking our lake.  My recliner was right next to our huge picture windows, and it was a great view...anyways, i simply saw a beam of light shoot into my house.  It didnt just ""appear"", it seemed to grow from a point i could not tell over the lake, and expand into the room.  It was about the diameter of a softball, and very opaque white in color.  The most incredible thing though, is that when it reached its furthest point, it actually hit the lamp kiddy-corner from me in the room!  Immediately the light turned OFF and the ""lazer beam""  just withdrew.  I was so completely stunned that i just sat and stared-i mean this beam had passed no more than 2 feet directly in front of me and turned off one of my lights!  So i tried not to freak out, and decided to stay where i was and watch.  No more than a minute later the same beam shot back in, hit the lamp, and turned it on!  At this point, i was beyond scared.  So i got up and ran into my bathroom, crouching low to my floor so i wouldnt get hit.  The bathroom was directly to the right of the lamp that was being hit, so i partially closed the door to ""protect"" myself and still watch. For the next 5-6 minutes the beam continued to shoot in, turn on or off the light, then recede.  After those 5 or so minutes, it didnt happen again, the light just remained off.  So from there i booked it downstairs to my mother's room.  She was trying to sleep of course so when i frantically woke her and raved about ""lazer beams"", naturally she  was a lil' peeved! But my mom sat up with me to look out her window (same lake view as upstairs) ! for a couple minutes.  We actually saw different beams of white light shooting horizontally in various directions. By the time 10-ish minutes were done, the lights were done.  I (carefully) went upstairs to make sense of it all attempt sleep.  I must add to this that When i went back up there, i heard a very low-decibal sounding hum, that kind of vibrated inside my ears, and it seemed to be all around and above our house.  I figured i was only hearing the refridgerator, but i know how that sounds-quieter and higher piched than this new sound-plus i heard it shut off short after.  The low humming continued a few more minutes, but i was so spooked i went to bed!  I should also add that there were other instances when we lived on the lake that we had seen diagonal light beams, discs, and strange sattelite-type lights.  I was 15 at the time, just a home-school student getting ready to go to college early, and always an honest, intelligent person.  I was most definately not on any hallucinogenic drugs either!  My mother can vouche for what i saw, and i'm happy to share it w/ u.  But i do have a ?:  has anyone else seen these?  I really havent heard anything quite like what i saw, inspite of the fact that i listen to Art Bell and Whitley Strieber religiously! O- almost forgot to add that the next morning when i examined the window the glass was fine, the screen looked sorta burnt, and there was a perfect circle melted out of the weather plastic!

At this point, coincidentally, a Passenger jet was also entering south Florida Airspace from the South East, high enough to create a vapor trail. At this time, the ""Unidentified Object"" appeared to be standing still, directly in the path where the jetliner would soon pass. As the jetliner approached the object, suddenly, the object maneuvered its way down from the path of the jetliner, which from my ""Viewing Vantage point,"" avoided the collision. After the jet passed the high noon position, the object returned directly on the path of the jet where the vapor trail was left, & hovered there until it began to ascend until it disappeared from eyesight.  2nd Sighting - At this point, about 2 minutes after the 1st sighting, another similar object appeared from the very same position & angle in the south, & began the same trajectory of flight towards the high noon sky, while the sun's light revealed a colorful spectrum of light flash, as the object hurdled across the horizon. Unlike the 1st object, this object did not appear to stop moving, as it also disappeared in the high noon sky. At this point, I placed a call to my local authorities.  3rd Sighting - A third object began an identical trajectory across the South Horizon. By this time, I grabbed my ""Camcorder,"" & began filming its unusual flight patterns. When my local authorities arrived at my home, the provided the officer with a copy of my videotape. The officer told me that she was going to confirm the sightings, with local ""FAA Authorities.""

The hotel staff and myself watched these objects moving around the sky for the next two hours, some of them moving in perfect formation with the others until the sun started coming up. I took many photos of these things which must have been moving at phenemonal speeds; you can clearly see that the stars are stationary in these photos but the ufos are moving so quickly that they have left light streaks on the image in the time it took the for the camera to take the picture whilst the stars are totally stationary. These 'lights' seemed to be under intelligent control. They almost seemed to be putting on 'as show' for us!

Anyway, I was sitting in my back yard smoking a cigarette about 9 pm sometime during the early part of the year (I think it was in February) when I suddenly noticed a bright glowing object off to my right perhaps 1000-1500 ft. away and perhaps 50 degree angle from my position on the ground.  The object really caught my attention because it made several rapid ""jerking"" maneuvers and then went through a rainbow of colors in a few seconds and then started flashing a white light.  I quickly ran to the back door to call my roommate.  He came out and observed the original object which had now begun to move to the northwest at a rather slow ""helicopter-like"" speed.  By this time, two additional objects (flashing the same white light) appeared and were moving into formation with the first object.  What was striking about their movement was its ""unnaturalness"" if you will.  They both moved very quickly and literally stopped in an exact triangular formation with the first object.  Then all three began flashing the same white light in unison.  Suddenly, we noticed two additional objects literally appear out of no where and move into formation with the first three in the same odd manner.  We watched the 5 objects move out of sight to the northwest.  The entire sighting lasted perhaps 5 minutes.  It should be noted that traditional aircraft were clearly visible at the time of the sighting as we live in the flight path of Bush International Airport and a local airport.  We have never seen a UFO but we are confident we have now!",2003-08-28T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

Its body was slightly arched like the mid-section of a rainbow, with a pod-like appenditure on each side. It appeared to be composed entirely of light, as if it were a hologram. Against the backdrop of a clear night sky, it was initally just bright enough to catch my periferal vision, but as the craft advanced toward the east where the sky grew hazier, it became brighter, apparently because the water droplets were beginning to reflect the light that the object was emitting.

The lights were spaces as if there were a nose light, and two under the wings lights, near the wheel wells, as per military aircraft design.  Then one of the lights went out. Leaving two lights.  I thought how odd.  Normally in military aircraft, the pilot cannot extinquish say the nose light.  Then another light went off, leaving just one bright light.  I thought, wow this is really odd, how are they pulling this one off.  If the plane was in a turn, it could possibly explain the lighting, but there were no red port lights or green starboard lights.  There were no anti-collision lights present. Then the single light went out, leaving complete darkeness.  As a former military pilot, I just thought this whole episode odd.  Later it was rumored to me that there is a secret military base located in that part of Oregon.  A year later I ran into a gentleman and his twelve year old son.  They were staying at the Lakeside Motel in eastern Oregon near Christmas Valley.  He said it was around two in the morning and he and his girlfriend's son went out to retrieve the boy's shoe from their truck.  When he walked outside, he noticed that there were no stars in the sky.  On more careful observation, he saw a large craft passing two hunderd feet above him, moving at approximatly 40 mph.  When the aircraft passed, and the stars reappeared, he said it was the classical red/green/blue lights circling around the aircraft.  He said the object was 3/4 of a mile large.

I fully understand that people often do not report in a public manner having seen what seemed to be a UFO experience for YEARS.  I fully understand, because I have lived it.  My husband (at that time) and I lived in very rural Robertson County, Texas, a beautiful area with tens of thousands of trees.  We had many neighbors, all living on 10 to 50 acres of land, and lots of uninhabited land in between us, a peaceful, rural area of Texas.  We lived there 9 years.  When this happened, we had been living there maybe 8 years.  (As a footnote, my former husband lives there now.)  We call our place, ""Hole in the Woods"".  What happened was this.  We lived in a silver, metal, aluminum luxury-type mobile hunting lodge, about as big as one can transport behind a truck, 33', with a travel license.  Of course, it had been immobile since we trucked it in those many years ago.  It was our home.  When home, we had serenity!  So did our neighbors.  The closest town was Bryan, Texas, (15 miles), twin city to College Station, Texas, home of Texas A&M University.  Well, my husband had gone to bed.  I was sitting in the living room, which had a view out of a 8' picture window of the beautiful southern sky, enjoying the silhouetted view of a tree-line that was just past a 50' power line cut.  I was peaceful, I was happy, I was just minding my own business.  I'd lived there, and looked at this view, for years.  What happened next rocked my world.  And I do MEAN, ROCKED.  Suddenly, a massive sound started, and then, as I was LOOKING out my window, four helicopters were flying directly towards the window, at an amazingly low altitude.  It seemed to me they were not hardly far above the top of the major power poles crossing the land.  Not very far over them. The sound became deafening, I saw the four helicopters, in a rectangular pattern, two in front, two behind, so low, so loud, that the ground, the house, everything was shaking!  I was freaked out.  And then, to make matters worse, beside the back two helicopters, off to the left (from my perspective) I saw also a somewhat pale, but definitely red, round light flying in what seemed to be in tandum with the back left helicopter.  I noticed that it seemed to not be making any sound, and I sensed a body, but couldn't see one. But the overwhelming experience was, the horribly loud sound of those four helicopters so close to the ground!  Shaking everything with their roar.  This came upon me very quickly and I was overcome with confusion, and seeing the red light also confounded my experience.  Next thing that happened was that my husband came stumbling out of our room, from a deep sleep, yelling, What in the hell was THAT.  I told him what I'd just seen.  The noise was now gone, and he went back to bed.  I was left sitting in my chair with an uncomfortable thought, aliens.  What if they landed in the woods and are coming to our house!  Believe me, I had never spent any time thinking about aliens!  I had not purposely ever read one single thing about aliens.  But I had a memory of having read that sometimes, helicopters signal alien craft.  Why I thought of that I don't know, what I knew at that moment was, I was feeling afraid that those helicoptes had maybe landed in the woods and aliens might be coming towards my house.  So, my husband had gone back to bed, and although I was a little uncomfortable, I guess, I just sort of ""got over it"".  NOT FOR LONG.  I was still looking out the window at the sky.  After about 5 minutes (this is an ESTIMATE), I saw something that to this day I don't know what I saw.  But I know what my mind thought I was seeing.  Suddenly, lights in a line, ""dropped"" into view in my window.  My mind said, ""Oh my God, a Mother-Ship.""  It was GIGANTIC. And sure enought, that damned thing kept dropping down, and I could see an outline in lights of what looked to me to be a mother-ship.  Believe me, I didn't think about or believe in alien spacecraft AT ALL. And it was moving closer.  I sort of freaked.  I started screaming, ""((name deleted)), ((name deleted)), get up.  YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!""  My husband came stumbling out of our room again, and I frantically pointed out to him what I was seeing.  He immediately said, let's go outside.  He ran out the door, and I ran out behind him, down the side of our building.  But I panicked before I got to the end of the house, and turned around and ran inside, honestly, holding my hands on the side of my head, scared to pieces!  When my husband came in, what he told me, I refused to believe.  I refused to believe it so much that I don't remember what he told me he saw.  I would be lying if I tried to re-create what he said.  What he and I both know is that for the next couple of months, we were ""suspicous"" of what might happen in the night sky which we had been so familiar with.  Nervous about it, to be honest.  I kind of didn't want to look at the night sky, afraid something would receive a signal from me and appear.  Less than two weeks later, my husband and I were driving home from work, about 1/2 a mile from home, down our winding, curving lane (Taylor Road), not thinking about anything, when we came into a clear place on the road, the only clear place on the way home down Taylor Road, and we were just looking forward, driving, when we both saw another spaceship.  Just happened.  There was this huge Texas blue sky, with a huge billowly white cloud in it.  And so help us both, we just both accidently were looking at the sky, when a UFO came flying out of that cloud, shrouded, zoomed forward and then zoomed back into the cloud.  We just looked at each other and said, did you see that?  End of story. ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-26T00:00:00,,

It was approximately November. I arrived home from work at approx 02:30. My wife at the time said ""I just got our daughter back to bed"". She was sleeping fine and awoke talking to herself and when my wife went in to check on her, my daughter said that she was taken to a space ship. My wife asked me if I had been letting her listen to Art Bell and we went to bed. I woke up around 06:30 to meet my daughter when she woke up. When she woke up I asked her a series of questions and this is a pretty accurate transcript of our conversation. It's one I may never forget. Remember she was 3 and 1/2 years old at the time. And she was and still is a fairly bright kid. Me: I heard that mommy had to come into your room last night. Did you have a bad dream? Her: No, I went to a space ship. Me: What do you mean you went to a space ship? Her: Some aliens came into my room and took me to their space ship? Me: But when mommy came into your room you were sitting on your bed. Her: I came back by then. Me: How many aliens were there? Her: Three Me: Did you get a good look at them? Her: Yeah Me: Can you draw me a picture of what they looked like: Her: I don't know how to draw aliens. You'll have to show me. Me: Aliens are cool! But I wonder sometimes what they look like. Did you see their hands?. Her: She held her left hand about 8"" from the tips of her right hand fingers sort of like an extended ""time out"" gesture and said ""They had long fingers"". Me: Did they have hands like your hands? Her: No they were skinny and long Me: Did you see their faces? Her: Yeah. Me: What did their eyes look like? Her: Big eyes. Me: Did they talk to you? Her: Looking confused she finally said yeah Me What did they say? Her: Nothing, they had no mouth. Me: But you said they talked to you Her: Yeah. I don't know. [I'm thinking telepathy at this point] Me: They had no mouth? Did they have a nose? Her: really little. But they had big heads Me: How tall were they? Her: A little taller than me. Me: Where did you see them? Her: standing by my closet. Me: How did you get to the space ship? Her: I don't know we were just there. Me: Can you draw me a picture of the space ship? Her: I don't know how to draw a space ship, you'll have to show me. Me: It was dark in your room, was it dark by the space ship too? Her: No it had lot's of lights, all different colors but they were all on and real bright. Me: Where did you go on the space ship? Her: On a table. Me: What did you do there? Her: I just layed there. I was scared to move Me: what did they do? did they hurt you? Her: she repeatedly points at her temple Me: They pointed at your head? Her: No, they poked me. (I'm now thinking implant) Me: They poked you? with what? Her: something pointy, right here. And it hurt a little. And she points at her temple again. [I saw no marks of any kind] Me: When mommy came into your room you were sitting on your bed. How did you get on your bed if you were in a space ship? Her: I don't know. I just floated down. Me: Did they come back with you? Her: they went back when momny came in. Me: I saw an alien in a movie and they were scarey and all different colors and different. She interupts me and says, It hurt a little when they poked me but they were nice. and I think they were green or something. I then asked again if she could draw me some pictures and she repeated the I don't know how you'll have to show me answer.  So I had a little 3 and 1/2 year old girl who was transported from her bed in the middle of the night to a space ship, implanted and presumably examined, had a conversation via telepathy with 3 aliens who then accompanied her back to her room.  And she basicaly shrugged it off like it was no big deal. We figured she did not see any television that day even remotely referring to a space ship or aliens or anything similar. So the question is. Did it happen? Did she have an etremely vivid dream? or?... She doesn't remember a thing about this now. She's 9 and perfectly normal. At the time I tried to contact [someone] but had irratically available computer so I couldn't e-mail or search the internet for UFO sites like yours to properly report this. But I figured you'd find this interesting. So now that I found your site I sent the info.  Thanks ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-26T00:00:00,42.7945,-88.3994

Oval and glowing. It was huge. During what I remember as the second week of February, 1998. Myself and three other people (2 girls, 2 guys)went to Villa Roma Ski Resort, Callicoon, NY in the Catskill Mountains on vacation.  The third night we were there, we all got into a big arguement.  One of the women we were with stormed out of the Condo and disappeared. We were getting worried because she was gone for a while, so I left to go look for her. The area was very dark. The areas surrounding the resort were wooded. I wandered around calling for her for about 15-20min. I actually started getting nervous because it was so dark out there that I headed back to the condo. Before I got to the door I looked up to my left because I thought I saw something go by. My first thought was it was a helicopter. But I never heard it go by. I only saw it. I walked to the left of the condo, then along the left side. What I saw next has haunted me ever since. In the sky a little to my right(1 or 2 O'clock position) was an object. This object was huge. Maybe two times the size of a passenger plane, oval and glowing. Not lit up like a lightbulb. Kind of like glow sticks but hazy. And it didn't make a sound. I began to make all kinds of excuses for what it could be.  It was moving in what I think was a northerly direction. In the most unbelievable way! It looked like when you throw a Frisbee. It almost bounces on air. Like it's hitting air pockets or something.  I know that's probably not helping you, but I don't know how else to explain it. It looked very unstable in the sky. Like it was vibrating.  I was just standing there.  I wanted to run but I didn't. I don't know why! So,I just stood there with my mouth open.   It was moving north very slowly. Then it just swung around backwards(south), and stopped! Like it saw me! At this point I believe I may have been in shock or something because I was frozen with fear! It was just sitting in the sky, still.Then out of nowhere it took off. Flying straight in a what I think was south-westerly direction. Straight, then up, then gone! Just like that. The speed it was moving across the sky was incredible. The whole time I was telling myself I wasn't real. But I know it was! I still have the same feeling in my chest everytime I think of it! This incident took about 15-20 minutes from the time I saw it, to the time it disappeared.  I immediately ran in the house and told everyone what I saw. Although they were very inquistive, I felt like none of them believed my story. So I stopped talking about it. I didn't want anyone to think I was crazy! Since then I've only told two people and you are one of them. Since that night, there's not one night that has gone by that I haven't stared into space, for atleast a few minutes. This has changed my outlook on man and God quite a bit now. I'm just looking for answers now.  I am of very sound mind. For the rest of my life I will swear to what I saw on my children. I would agree to, or volunteer for hypnosis and or a lie detector test. By anyone! I know what I saw and I will never change my mind. All I do now is try to search for answers. So if there is anyone out there who can help me please contact me.  What are they doing and why are they here. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-26T00:00:00,41.7806,-75.0221

Thinking it might be some illicit fireworks left over from the 4th (fireworks are VERBOTEN in California), I stepped out into the back yard to watch.  I saw some 4 or 5 more explosions (rockets) with the traditional red-white-blue streamers coming down.  After the 4th or 5th rocket there was a long pause.  I didn't know if that was the last rocket or not so I just waited.  While I was waiting I glanced around the sky.  It was very clear and the stars were bright.  Looking up at about a 45 degree angle to the North, I saw a particularly bright star which I glanced at for a second or two and moved on to other stars.  But before it was out of my field of view, I caught a movement and I glanced back. Thinking it might be a satellite, I continued to watch as it slowly moved toward the south. But, After 15 or 20 seconds it made a sharp 90 degree turn!  Then at about 30 to 45 seconds more another 90 degree turn!  As I watched, it inscribed a perfect rectangle.  It made almost 2 complete trips in this rectangular pattern while I watched.  I estimated it took about 2 minutes to complete a rectangular trip, and made approximately two of these trips while I watched.  Then there was a split second when it streaked off at about a 45 degree angle which led away from the rectangle it had been making.  In about 1/10th of a second the light just went out.

I listen to c2c on the way home and have often said dang I never see anything.  I travel east from HWY 41 down Lynch Rd toward I-64. 3 blocks from work there is very little artifical light and open fields so I have a clear view of the night sky for miles and miles.  There is an Airport (evansville regional) north less than 10 miles.  Starting in October I've noticed a bright light in the direction I'm traveling  just a degree or so south of Lynch Road. I note this cause like the other man I see it a long time and it only seems to move left and right slightly.  I spectulated as to what it was ..something traveling toward me?  A balloon? Mars?  A Star?  Lynch road was built up to the I-64 bypass and there it ends uphill into farmland.  If Lynch was 12o'clock then the light was at 1:30am.  It glowed and shimmered like heat on blacktop. From 2 miles away it was just smaller than a dime. (I held one up) Seeing it as I traveled it seemed not natural or right. There was only one big light as if it were a tiny star hovering over a field I could see a silo slightly North of it.  I watched it more than I watch the road. I was driving straight toward it trying to see it but I couldnt actually focus on it. I thought I could make out a shape in the glow cause I was kinda making a joke about it to myself ..here's my c2c call! I was thinking how could I descibe it to Art Bell. ""Round bright slightly shimmering light seeming to cover something not quite circular."" I entered the I-64 ramp but I stopped trying to see it better it never moved.  I couldnt focus good on it beyond the light so I continued on I-64 traveling south toward Indiana 66...looking left at the light it suddenly blinks out. well I thought whatever it is it's gone.  At that moment  large heavy duty helicopters flew over there were 3 of them in formation traveling Southeast in a straight line toward where ALCOA sits on the Ohio River. Of course I'm thinking wow..this was an Art Bell moment.  I had that same moment for the next 5 weeks either on wens or thursday nights.  Big light...Military choppers. I know that Indiana has military bases and Kentucky has them too.  It's not heard of but not too common for those big choppers to travel over us.

object moved from south to north but had an unusual vertical bobbing action to it.,Maud,OK,2003-10-26T00:30:00,unknown,2-3 minutes,"Occurred : 10/26/2003 00:30  (Entered as : 10/26/2003 00:30) Reported: 12/20/2003 2:14:16 AM 02:14 Posted: 1/17/2004 Location: Maud, OK Shape: Unknown Duration:2-3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33967.html,"object moved from south to north but had an unusual vertical bobbing action to it. Although I'm from a major metropolitan area (OK City, OK), the observation was made at my father's home.  He lives in an extremely small town about 60 miles from me.  I'm generally considered a no-nonsense individual. I've been on this planet nearly 50 years and while it's possible I may have seen a ufo in the past, I'm almost always the first person to say, No, that was an airplane, or heavenly body or atmospheric condition or whatever.  Nevertheless, on Sunday, October, 26th, 2003, at approximately 12:30 am while admiring the vividly clear 'country' sky, I spotted a brighter-than-usual light off to the s-se not far above the horizon. The intensity caught my eye but then as I tried to figure out what satellite I might be watching, it began to move in a way for which I was not prepared.  The movement was vertical. Up... and then down again.  Repeatedly, at about 1 full cycle per second.  While I could not see a 'body' attached to the light, if the light had been all there was to the object then the amount of vertical movement was (I roughly calculated) about twenty times the diameter of the light.  Since I had no idea at first how far away it was I was using relative measurements.   In any case, my first impulse was to think my eye was 'playing tricks' on me. However, fatigue was not a likely answer since when I'm at home I work as a computer programmer and my most productive hours are from around 11:00 pm to approximately 6:00 am.  In other words, that's the part of the day when I'm most alert.   Another thing: I had my right eye damaged in an automobile accident 11 years ago, and while this may seem like a hindrance, I consider it an advantage in situations like this because since the car wreck I've learned to judge depth differently than most people. Also, although I program computers for a living now, I spent most of my life as a draftsman and had a great many opportunities to work with trigonometric functions while drawing various layouts for anything from buildings to bridges. I'm no stranger to calculating distances using triangulation. In addition, I've had numerous trig and calc classes in both high school and college.  So,  since the object appeared to be stationary relative to latitude and longitude, I thought maybe I could judge its location by how it lined up with a major near-by tree limb as I moved around the yard. This is not a bad technique.  In fact, I judged the light to be 1.5 to 2 miles away.  At this point the idea of ufo had not crossed my mind. I thought maybe it was a ground search light from a near-by town.  Problem is, most small towns don't own search lights of that magnitude. Plus, the sky was very clear  (no clouds) and the air was thin which meant no moisture for light to bounce off.  In retrospect there was another thing that was gnawing away at me and I didn't realize it at the time:  The thing seemed to be waiting for me to watch it before it started moving.  I know that sounds weird but it sure seems that way now.  To continue... Just about the time I thought I'd figured out how far away it was, it began to move northward while continuing the vertical movement.  Not all that far away it wasn't moving very fast.  I'm estimating it leveled out at around 60 mph and by this time I'd estimated it's relative angle to the ground to be approximately 15 degrees. It was fairly low on the horizon.  Within the range of its vertical movement, its average deviation was consistent during this northward movement.  After a minute of so of watching it move toward a point which I would estimate to be about a half mile east of me, I began to get concerned. Unless this thing was a balloon, I should have been hearing some noise. However, there are two problems with this line of thought: 1) A balloon couldn't bob up and down that quickly and 2) On a clear night like that night, sound travels pretty well.  I could easily hear highway traffic a half mile away.  The concern finally got to me and I ran to the front door and yelled to my dad.  By the time he got his shoes on and made it outside, the light had moved behind some trees that line the east side of his property.  I pointed to the area of sky north of the trees where the object should re-appear and wanted him to see this thing with strange flight behavior. Unfortunately, it never re-appeared and he finally gave up and went back inside.   I know this may be disappointing compared to other reports and I barely consider it worthy of most people's valuable time just to read it, but I tell it here because I have no logical explanation for what I saw.  It actually happened and it really gave me goose bumps when I realized that what I was looking at might be something from our government's secret arsenal or perhaps something even more exotic like an extraterrestrial object.  By the time you get my age,  firsts don't happen as often as they used to but this was definitely a first for me.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

High) listening to, along with the rest of the class, the teacher's lecture.  It was a morning class, and I believe it was about 10:30 am.  I was sitting by the window and happened to look out toward the east (about 30 degrees to my right) and saw an odd lighted shape, sort of like the left half of a lighted oval, at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  Toward the east is an area with a few houses and about a half mile of heavily wooded and at the time undeveloped land on either side of Salado Creek (the creek was about a quarter mile to the east of the school and runs north to south ).  That land currently contains Martin Luther King Park.  It was a largely clear day, but it seemed as though the lighted oval was behind a patch of cloud.  This shaped did not appear to be a solid object.  There was no noise associated with this sighting.  There was no noise associated with this sighting and I do not recall seeing or hearing any other aircraft in the area.  While trying to figure out what this shape was, the shape faded away.  A few seconds later, the shape reappeared slightly to the right and above the first location.  This time it was brighter, with a distinct symmetrical oval shape to the phenomena, and bright white in the interior.  In the middle of this oval was what looked like a thin bright horizontal line, much like a filament in a light bulb, which was centered in the oval and taking up about half the horizontal dimension of this oval.  This central filament type light was bright, but not painful to look at.  At this point, there was no question in my mind that I was seeing something that was unlike any aircraft that I had ever seen.  San Antonio in 1971 had substantial Vietnam related military flight activity from Ft. Sam Houston, Randolph AFB, and Kelly AFB, especially the frequent low level helicopter flights of UH-1 Huey helicopters.  Whatever I was looking at was nothing like any military or civilian aircraft I have seen either before or since (as an adult, I became a licensed pilot and was an Air Force flight test engineer).  As I was about to get the attention of the classmate sitting in front of me it faded out once more.  It came into view a third time, again slightly above and to the left of the previous appearance.  Like the first view, it appeared to be behind some kind of mist or light cloud and was only partially visible, with the left and top part of the shape being visible.  The bright filament was not visible, and this time I could see what looked like a very small reddish tapered dome on top.  The tapered dome was relatively small, roughly one tenth the width of the full oval and about one fifth the thickness of the main oval.  After a few seconds, it faded away again.  I looked all around the sky for it and about ten seconds later saw almost directly overhead a white light fade in an out of view twice.  It did so at a rate roughly the same as the interval between the first three sightings of the phenomena.  However, these last two were more points of light and I could not discern any shape to it.  The entire sighting lasted roughly one minute.  I took a fair bit of ridicule about this whenever I mentioned it, so I kept quiet about it.  About two years later when I was in high school, a classmate (who I had never told about my sighting) related a story about some odd phenomena he saw one night in the same general part of town near Salado Creek.  When I asked him to explain how it looked, he described the oval shape and the filament type light in the middle.  I could not tell from his description if it was exactly the same phenomena I had observed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-03-02T00:00:00,29.488865917141535,-98.4752404435546

What has always fascinated me about his story is that he made my parents and grandparents aware of the sighting at the time, and it has been mentioned intermittently (albeit with embarassment/disbelief by the adults) ever since. In other words, he reported what he saw to them AT THE TIME, and in detail, so this is not some false memory of childhood recalled/invented many years later. Recently I broached the subject with him to get a definitive account of what I believe is a genuine ufo occupant encounter.  At the age of 5, my brother was playing near the gate of our dairy farm, which is located approximately 100km south east of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. He remembers my father and grandfather were still milking the cows, and it was approaching dusk. Suddenly to the west he saw what he described as a 'big bright star' in the sky between our property and a particular neighbour's property (knowing the distance across the paddocks between our farmhouse and theirs, a midway point would be approximately 200 metres away. He watched the 'star' abruptly shoot to various positions in the western sky several times and become stationary again. After a while it began to 'fly closer' towards and to the north west and he could see that it wasn't a star but a 'spaceship'. Its interesting that the words he gave me to describe it recently, at the age of 34, were childhood words, which re-inforced my impression that he was definitely recollecting something he saw at that age. Descriptive words for the craft he gave me were 'metal machine', 'shiny', and 'spaceship'. When I asked the shape, he said 'a flying saucer. Like the flying saucers you see.' He vividly recalls that the 'spaceship' hovered at what we now estimate to be about 50 metres away (based on his recollection of its position in relation to landmarks below) and a 'hatch, like a gangplank' opened up and a man in a silver suit with a jetpack flew out. He variously this figure as a 'man with a  jetpack', and a 'spaceman'. The 'spaceman' performed a number of manouevers in the sky, occassionally coming very close and then flying off at a distance, before approaching and landing on the dirt road near our gate, approximately 10 metres from my brother. He told me he became terrified at this point and tried to turn and run, but was frozen to the spot. ""You can't run, even if you want to, you can't run"" was all he would tell me about the incident from that point on, apart from being adamant that our grandmother, standing at the door to her farmhouse, about 10 metres beh! ind him 'saw it too. She saw it. She just wouldn't talk about it."" What intrigues me to this day is that as long as I can remember the story has remained consistent amongst our family, including this detail about my grandmother, who according to my father may have originally confirmed my brothers story but subsequently dismissed it from her mind and denied it.

They invited me to sit down and tell my story, all along I could see they were both nervous as hell.

Thought I would post my sighting from 1977 to notify that these orange balls have been around awhile!  If they are man-made probes or drones; we had them in 1977!  The date given above is approximate; it occurred sometime in March or April, 1977. Story below...  ""doc"" ((name deleted)) and I were night skiing Stevens Pass ski resort (Cascade mountains, Washington State) in the spring of our senior year of high school (that's how I'm certain the year was 1977).  We were skiing down ""Red chair"" at about 8:30 pm, when I noticed an orange light in the sky, while skiing.  ""Huh"", I thought to myself, ""a firefly"".  Although it felt wierd that a firefly would be up in the mountains while they were still snow-blanketed.  I had never seen a live firefly; only pictures in books, but my mind automatically labeled it a firefly.  I slowed to a stop over about 30 seconds, keeping an eye on the ""firefly"".  As I was slowing to a stop, the light increased in apparent size from about star size to about half to 3/4 the size of a full moon.  The light was brilliant orange; scintillating light around it; the overall shape was circular but with ragged, jagged edges of this brilliant orange light.  After I came to a stop, I watched it, mesmerized, for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  During this time, it's size and appearance did not change and it remained perfectly stationary at about 30 degrees above the horizon--I know that it remained stationary; because it remained just above and to the side of a mountain peak (behind ""Big Chief"" chair lift, to the direction of the eastern side of the ski area) that served as a reference point for me.  During this period, my friend ""doc"" ((name deleted)) skiied up and stopped beside me; I glanced over and saw his eyes glued to this wierd orange light.  As we both stood still watching,suddenly the object instantaneously darted across the sky--it went from being absolutely stationary beside the mountain peak; to traversing (in a time period of about 3 seconds) about 150 degrees of the horizon--from our vantage point; it traveled starting from the east and briefly disappeared toward the south behind a mountain peak; quickly reappearing on the opposite side of this mountain moving toward the south and continuing toward the southwest; when it finally disappeared from view behind another mountain to the southwest.  During this traverse, it was losing altitude; the angle of descent appeared about 5-10 degrees below horizontal, from our vantage point--before it finally disappeared, it was actually below us in elevation (down a valley) at about a 5-10 degree angle.  During it's transit, the object travelled almost too quickly for our heads and eyes to be able to follow; during its transit it remained brilliant orange and about the same apparent size; but appeared to have a short orange ""tail"" behind it--hard to say if this ""tail"" was an optical illusion; due to it's tremendous angular velocity from our vantage point.  Also, I seem to recall a faint hissing sound starting just as it disappeared from sight, and continuing for several seconds after it had disappeared from sight.  But no sonic boom or other sound.  I then looked at my friend, whose mouth was wide open ""did you see that?"" he said.  ""What the hell was that"" I replied.  We just looked at each other, then skiied down to the bottom of the run to get on the chairlift to ski some more.  I asked the lift attendant if he had seen anything in the sky, he said no (however, helping people on the chairlift he was facing the opposite direction of the object; and there were bright nite ski lights in the direction between him and the object).  My friend ""doc"" ((name deleted)) and I compared notes on what we saw; our descriptions matched.  What was and still is most baffling to me was the instantaneous change in the object from being perfectly stationary (for 30-60 seconds) to moving at an extremely rapid velocity--given the first mountain it moved behind (and reappeared) was about 1.5 miles distant,and that it traversed about 150 degrees of horizon within a few seconds, it must have been moved at least 3 miles within a few seconds, corresponding to over 3600 miles per hour!  And it appeared to attain that velocity instantaneously; certainly within the half-second or less which it would take our minds to register the change from stationary to moving condition (I was a very good ping-pong player and fair badminton and tennis player,so my mind has been accustomed to very quickly registering rapid changes in speed and direction in ball-shaped objects)!  This huge acceleration rules out any manned aircraft; g-forces would tear any human apart.  Perhaps now in 2004 we have unmanned probes or drones that can perform extreme accelerations (like antiaircraft missiles); but I don't think this was possible in 1977.  A meteor is ruled out; because it was stationary in size and location near a mountain peak for 30-60 seconds; and the apparent acceleration was instantaneous, not gradual (as could happen due to parallax effects).  I think any man-made vehicle, or known natural phenomena can be ruled out.  A missile might be able to accelerate like that; however I think with only a ground-based boost system (not a mid-air launch).  This leaves unknown natural phenomena (e.g. some type of atmospheric plasma ball?) or....any ideas? P.S.  There may or may not have been a solid object behind this light--we did not observed any solid object; however the light was so brilliant that it would have obscured any otherwise nonluminescent object that it emanated from.

We observed together on a knoll next to Davidson's Orchards twinkling lights. The sky was overcast at 2 in the afternoon with a low ceiling. There was no action at the airport. Davidson's is north overlooking south to the airport and my view is west. Earlier two army choppers flew slowly through the valley.The army was doing maneuvers around Vernon the previous week. At first we thought it was a signaling system that the army was trying as the army camp is directly south and in view of Davidson's Orchards.  The lights were on the ground and randomly flashing colors of pink,red,green blue and brilliant white. We looked through the binoculars and there were no people around it. We have agreed the size comparable to a single dwelling house. The knoll is about one kilometer away as the crow fly's. We watched it for about one half hour.  As an after thought the white light had a shadow line (my last report) which was not in the piece that broke away but remained in the curling end. I was thinking of a description. if I put a dot on a flashlight lens and then blew smoke in the ray the light behaved something like that. It swirled around the shadow line. I had to let the memory come unaided. I observed more than I thought. Because of the other sighting on the same hill (small mountain maybe 900 m) I had a feeling of X marks the spot. Two days ago I noticed a chopper circling the hill then it widened to the surrounding area.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

We are responding to an article that we read in the Bulletin covering a white light and the possible link to UFO's. We just wanted to bring to ""light"" something that we saw now that this article has been written. A few months back, we are ""best guessing"" in May, We were both laying in bed, and we both awoke about 3:00 a.m. to a bright yet soft orange/amber light shining in our bedroom window. While it filled the entire side of windows (bedroom and back door) we felt it odd and yet not concerning enough to get up from bed to investigate the light. Neither of us heard anything but were both awaked by the light. We furthermore didn't even discuss it until the next morning when one of us asked the other if they had seen it. To our amazement we had both not only seen it, but didn't say anything at the time thinking the other was  asleep. the next morning we joked about the possibility of the light being from a UFO as we tried to come up with ANY possible occurrences to account for how the light not only filled the windows but from where it appeared to originate, which was to the right side of the house and up. The light seemed as strong as a searchlight and yet as I said soft in color. No other noise was heard at the time and we BOTH saw the light and didn't mention it to the other until the next day. As best as we can recall, we are thinking the event happened either somewhere during the weekend of 5/2-5/11 or the weekend of 5/16-5/25. Neither of us have ever made any reports of this nature and it is only because of the article that we do now. We are interested to know if you have had any other reports of this nature during the May timeframe. We did ask our neighbor the following day if she had seen the light as we were new to this area. She had indicated she didn't because her bedroom did not face the same direction. We being new to the area didn't make any further note as we just didn't know what it could have been.

At approximately 00:10 on 05-19-03 soon after passing a Frenso, CA turnoff about 60 min. north of Harris Ranch our SUV (98 Explorer) was headed south on I-5 when the driver noticed some bright, white lights up and to our right.  He wondered if there was a highway above us, because the lights seemed to be heading south parallel to I-5.  Suddenly the lights turned and zoomed down toward the freeway rapidly.  He guessed it covered 2 miles in about 10-15 seconds.  At this point the craft slowed down, and he alerted mo of its presence.  We both thought it was a very low-flying, large airplane, and we watched as it crossed the freeway in front of us.  It was so low, we were barely looking up.  The craft turned left and headed north above the ground next to the north-bound side of I-5.  It appeared to be trying to land, when suddendly this large craft (about 40-60 feet across) banked sharply, about 45 degrees.  We were amazed that a craft that big, flying so low and so slow could have turned that sharply successfully.  It seemed that there was no way without stalling.  As it banked, the three bright, white lights seemed equidistant apart, one in the center and one on each end.  The craft was TOTALLY silent.  It crossed I-5 in front of us again, this time it was heading west and was only about 100 feet in front of us, and about 40 feet off the ground.  It was so low we hoped it wouldn't hit us.  We thought it might crash in the field to our right, but it descended and decelerated, no noise, no noticeable dust.  It seemed it would land safely as it almost skimmed the ground.  At this time, we were looking out the side windows, to our right, down and slightly back.  The craft seemed lower than our SUV. It seemed the bottom was flat, because the lights were skimming the ground.  The only lights we saw, were shining forward on the craft.  However, from this oblique view, they seemed to be positioned at a slightly obtuse angle (approximately 150 degrees).  It was very dark and neither of us saw any shape to the craft, except for the position of the lights.  All three lights seemed to be in the horizontal plane, as it skimmed the ground, at about 15 to 20 mph, almost touching it for about 150 ft.  Then just as I thought it was about to land, it suddenly tilted up and disappeared.  Soon after this the driver saw the three bright, white lights, in the rear-view mirror.  I turned and watched out the back window as it made several more passes across I-5.  The driver caught glimpses of these passes in the rear-view mirror.

MUFON/OHIO FOLLOW-UP: A resident of West Chester reports dramatic sighting near his res.that was accompanied by a local power failure.,West Chester,OH,2003-06-02T03:00:00,oval,15-20 minutes,"Occurred : 6/2/2003 03:00  (Entered as : 06/02/2003 03:00) Reported: 8/25/2003 6:10:25 PM 18:10 Posted: 8/28/2003 Location: West Chester, OH Shape: Oval Duration:15-20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30908.html,"SUMMARY: A resident of West Chester, Ohio reports a dramatic sighting near his residence that was accompanied by a local power failure.  Greg M.(name on file)says he was awakened around 2:30 AM by the sound of his UPS system beeping to let him know the power was out in his home.  Greg informed me that an UPS system is an uninterruptible power supply.  Bascially a battery backup to his computer. It can run his entire system with no utility power for about 2 hours.  When its activated it signals an alarm to notify him that the power has been interrrupted to the house so he can safely shut down the computer.  When Greg heard the beeping he thought maybe a storm was coming so he got out of bed and went downstairs to unplug the TV and stereo.  That is when he noticed a strong smell emanating from the family room.  It smelled like a high concentration of ozone. His lotic breeze smelled similar when being cleaned but the device was unplugged and had not been used for several days.  Greg grabbed some candles and was getting ready to go back upstairs when he happened to gaze out the back window and spotted an object in the sky.  The witness claims that an oval or disk shaped object was visually observed. He stressed that the object was 'not quite exactly' oval or disc shaped.  When he first observed the object he believed it held stationary, but after a few minutes it began to wobble.  Greg likened the wobble to a left to right motion but not like a pendulum swinging.  Greg estimated the object was around 1/4 to 3/4 miles distance from his location and at an elevation of 600 to 1,000 feet up.  He said the shape could be clearly seen and if it had been closer, could almost be compared to the size of a bus.  The bottom half of the object could be seen; being comprised of luminous blue/violet light.  On each end of the object were two lights of aqua blue color.  These lights were reportly spinning very fast and according to the witness, appeared to strobe or pulsate.  Greg stepped outside to get a better look at the object. Once outside the witness say, ""The silence was so complete that it felt like I had walked into a sound proof room.  There was not a sound of any kind.  Not insects, cars, nothing.  Not even a breeze could be felt.  It was a very eerie feeling.""  At this time Greg noticed that lights were on across State Route 747 which he can see in the near distance.  The state route runs not too far from his back yard.  However, when checking the front of the house he noticed the lights were off on his street. Going back in, the witness notes that his cats were nowhere in sight.  They are usually with him or near by when he is up.  I asked the witness if he had watched the object depart?  Greg claims that he does not remember how it left.  He states that he remembers standing out back gawking at the object in the stale silence. The witness sounded perplexed as he related how he usually would have stood there as long it took for the object to leave or do something.  He says that he honestly just remembers the parts leading uo to the sighting.  He says he watched it for 15-20 minutes and then went to bed.  He said he did not remember going back to bed. Again, he says he would of stayed or called someone or done something besides dismissing it. He did not understand his actions in regard to this.  Upon awakening the next morning the witness says that a candle contained in glass he had left burning had exploded.  He detailed how wax had been projected on the walls after the explosion and theorized that the glass container had been defective.  He said he does not know why he did not awaken from the sound of the exploding candle.  Checking his UPS systems backup which records data during the power outage he noticed that the electricity had been off for 5 hours and 11 minutes.  Greg states that this is impossible because he remembers waking up with plenty of time to get to work.  His printout reads as follows: Outage event at 2:23:43s Eastern time, duration of outage 5 hours 11 minutes 03 seconds.  So the power came back on at approx. 7:34 AM. Greg sent me the full printout from his computer system which he translated for easier reading.  This printout is on file.  FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS:  In an attempt to obtain more regarding the claim of a UFO sighting on June 2, 2003, near West Chester, Ohio, I placed a telephone call to the Butler County, Ohio Sheriff's Dept., the receptionist offered one item from her log that may or may not be of relevance.  At approx. 1:05 AM on June 2nd a house security system had been tripped at a location 3 miles from the claimants home.  No explaination was given for the home security system activation.  I also contacted the West Chester City Police Dept.  The receptionist there stated no UFO sightings had been reported for that time period. I also asked if any power outages had been reported.  The receptionist told me that they do not do reports for that.  I would need to contact the power company.  CINERGY INQUIRY:  Inquiry was made with CINERGY, the facility providing power to a large portion of Cincinnati and Southern Ohio.  I contacted the Operations Planning Engineer. He is in charge of the data for power outages in the area.  After pulling up the records for the area and the  address given he advised me that no power outages had occurred on June 2, 2003 for the West Chester, Ohio area.  I also asked Greg to check with his neighbors to see if they saw anything on the night in question.  He called me back saying that no one he talked to had bee up at that time of night.  Assessment of situation:  Greg sounded like an intelligent, coherent individual. In the early stages of the investigation Greg had told me that the power was only out in his house. Later he told me it was out on his street.  I do not know the reason for the change in his story. With the evidnece accumulated in the case and unless evidence surfaces on the contrary, I feel that the witness did indeed experince a UFO sighting.

The area is very rural so there is no background lighting from any populated area.  The house where we were is situated on top of a hill facing east-southeast.  Directly across the highway from the house is a field that had recently been clear-cut.   The house is about 1/8 mile from the highway.  Anyway, the night was clear and we were all getting ready to party.  I can attest that the friend I arrived with and myself had not had any alcohol yet.  I can't speak for the others.  We were all out in the yard just off the front porch.  I turned away from the porch and looked across the highway, as I guess others did at that time, since we all chorused in on a ""What the hell is that?"" comment at about that same time.  What I observed was a pink, amorphous object perhaps 1 mile away, directly over the aforementioned field.  I guess at that distance it was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length.  By this time everyone had looked, but I guess we were all pretty much speechless.  The center of the object appeared to change color slightly, maybe going into an orangish color.  The shape of the object had been shifting continously and at no time had taken on a ""normal"" shape.  It moved towards the south very slowly on level, then took about a 35 degree or so downward turn. It continued down for what I guess would be 25 yards or so, then came to a stop directly above a small stand of trees that had not been cut.  After a few seconds, the object began to descend downwards, still very slowly, and went behind the stand of trees, I assume to land, and we lost sight of it.  The object had no lights but rather the entire thing glowed with the pinkish light.  It could be called a neon pink probably, as it was pretty intense.  The idea of investigating came up, but was quickly voted down due to mass cowardice(myself included I must admit).  I've heard a lot of stories and seen a lot of strange things around there, but that one took the cake! Anyway, we were all there for at least an hour afterwards, I personally watched the area very closely, but did not see the object again.  My friend and I discussed it later and agreed that it was unlike anything we had seen.  I've also ready several reports on here and haven't read of anything like it.  Maybe it was swamp gas, but we don't think so.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,32.2339,-92.6756

This was most likely the Navy's ""Classic Wizard"" system.  You may read about it from a Russian report here:  http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/surveill/noss_andronov.htm   The brief description of the observation was excellent, leading to almost perfect confirmation of this being a White Cloud sighting.  Hope this helps.  As a synopsis, the White Cloud system has been know under other names, but its salient characteristic is always three satellites moving together and visible at approximately magnitude 2.5 to 3.5 in the night sky.  The posted observation reports the satellites in triangle formation.  This should almost always be true.  Due to the nature of orbital mechanics, the orbits of any two of the satellites must always intersect twice during each complete orbiting of the Earth as viewed from the ground.  The slightly elliptical orbits mean that the satellites are at slightly differing orbital altitudes during each orbital intersection.  Most of the time the White cloud formation will appear to be triangular, however it will occaisionally appear to for a very distorted triangle, or even a straight line.  It is possible that other agencies or other governments have ELINT tri-satellite systems in orbit, but the US Navy is the only agency I am aware of that uses this system in an orbital characteristic to create visible triangle formations.  By looking for electromagnetic emissions on the ocean and matching the patterns and characteristics of the emissions to a database, the satellites are able to identify with a high degree of accuracy the type of surface craft and country of origin.  Each satellite can do this, but to triangulate the exact targetting of such a vessel for an over the horizon strike, three satellites are necessary.  It is interesting to know this from Russian publications on the web.  If the information was not available in such a format, I would not write about it here.  Even so, I prefer to remain anonymous, as the national security laws may be misused.  -Regards ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report, who chooses to remain totally anonymous.

I live 1/4 mile East of the South end of the local airport, there was a 22:25 evening arrival every night.  I was standing on my driveway looking South when I saw what looked like the landing lites of the evening flight of a Boeing 737.  As the object continued in from the South it was not decending as it normally would so I watched to see what was going on (at this time I looked at my watch to see if it was the regular flight at 22:25 P.M.) After checking the time (now 22:45) I was courious as to what was flying so low but not continuing to decend as usual.  As the craft approached I began to see its shape, it was a Boomerang or Delta wing shape.  I looked to be no more than 500 or 600 feet off the ground, the wing span was about 200 feet and each wing tip was fitted with a winglette which extended 90 degrees virtically maybe 10 or 15 feet. Each winglette was fitted with what looked like little windows or lites simular in size to a 1 ft by 4 ft floresent lite.  The leading edge of the underside of the wings on each side had 3 rowes of simular windows or lites the first row had 4 end to end the second row had 3 end to end, row 3 had 2 end to end.  The craft was flying about 10 degrees West of due North and eventually disappeared from view.  The craft had no markings, no blinking lites on the wing tips or the under side of the craft only two forward facing lites that appeared to be landing lites.  I watched it fly from South to Notrht for 2 to 3 minutes.  This craft made no sound and flew very fast!  I would venture it was Military.  Since I hang out with the Delta ground crew I ask them if they had seen it, they said they were busy with the evening flight and didn't notice it.  I tryed to contact the FAA tower people but they did not return my calls.  It was very interesting to see, I wonder if anyone else has seen something simular? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Dear Peter: I was raised in the Seahurst/Burien area of Seattle/King county. I have seen and heard of many sightings in the area in which I reside/and have resided. The first was in aproximately 1969, we were on a neighbors deck in Seahurst, our address at the time was ((address deleted)) 25th ave S.W., we were not too long from the water/Puget Sound. Our neighbor had a telescope and we were looking at stars at approximately 8:00 p.m., we saw a rapidly moving object, maybe covering 20 miles back and forth, in the matter of seconds. This was my first experience with unexplained phenomena, I was 9 years old. I then became aware of events occuring around Seahurst beach proper around 1975. A friend of mine who lived at Seahurst beach ""((pseudonym deleted))"" told me about his brother ""((name deleted))"",seeing a large cigar shaped object in the early morning as he was doing his early morning paper route on the upper ledge of homes above the Seahurst Beach cove/fault line. I kept this information on file, and when I was in a Philosophy class at Highline Community College in 1982, I brought up this sighting, as well as the other, while we were discussing paranormal activities in our class. another older woman in our class brought up the exact same sighting as ""((pseudonym deleted))"", it seems she was one of my friends ""((3rd name deleted))"" mother and she also lived in the Seahurst Park neighborhood, ""I thought this very ironic and strange"". My last sighting was on July 4th 2001, at aprroximately 5:30 a.m. I am a musician, and my friend and I were working and recording music all night long on Tuesday July 3rd from 7:30 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. July 4th 2001. I woke up early to check my blood sugar, ""I am a Type 1 diabetic"", I went out on ""((4th name delete))"" deck, ""my fellow musician"" above Redondo to have a cigarette. I looked out over the Puget Sound, ""because it is so beautifull there"". His cat had come outside with me. I then saw a large Oval ball floating over the bay directly in front of Redondo, approximately 3 football fields away from me. It was black and silver inside, and the two colors seemed to be mixing together and rotating inside like wet paint. I would say it was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter from my perspective. It hovered and paroused the area until it went out of my sight, to the right because of the large trees in the area. The strange thing was, is that ((name deleted)) cat was watching it the whole time with me. Of course ((name deleted)) and my friends thought I was crazy. I now live under the flight path coming into Sea/Tac, in Des Moines, WA. I have many times thought I heard, stange sounds and lights outside of my condo/bedrooms window. Since I am a type 1 diabetic, and am prone to insulin reations, ""911 medics have been here more times than I wish to mention"", I do not know if these experiences are real, or part of my imbalances in my brain. I know that on July 4th 2001 my blood sugar was 125 mg/dl which is normal. Go figure?",2003-11-26T00:00:00,,

A formation of bright lights were clearly visible against the blue sky but were travelling perpendicular to the normal flight path ( we live next to the airport ). The lead object was the brightest and largest and they seemed to be fairly high up with the others strung out somewhat irregularly behind it but all were moving at a steady rate ( south to north ) until they disappeared first behind the building and then into the clouds on the northern horizen. They had emitted no sound. I had sent the wife to get the video camera and so I have some of this on 8 mil video ( erasing my daughter's daycare graduation ceremony in the process ).

I had gone to bed early and had awoke to get a drink of water and to check on the candle which I had lit earlier. I had walked over to the balcony and notice a series of bright lights over the water maybe about 150 feet. The object looked either triangle or egg shaped with the small end at the top.

I decided to lie down and watch it, and it appeared to be, imitating my candle on the coffee table, with the changing of colors, so ((name deleted)) my husband suggested I blow out the candle, which I did, but the colors continued to change but much differently this time. I went back to bed but lined my body in such a way that I could size up if it moved by the lines on the balcony windows, It stay positionary for 3 hours, only one time moving unbelievably fast straight up and back down. After that it appeared to have 3 smaller lights move towards it, and just as they disappeared in it, it light up on the my right side with a bright orange color which reflected off the clouds. It appeared to stay in front of the clouds because I could see it at all times. Then again 3 smaller lights that would have appeared to be stars, again moved slowly towards it, and appeared to melt into this thing, again sending off a bright orange color on my right, illuminating the sky this time. Then it suddenly disappeared, I watched every night afterwards and nothing at all, no lights even close to that what I had seen, this thing was very bright, it didn't move except that once, and it had lights flashing into different colors.

Niles is a subburb of Youngstown, Ohio. Jamie is a legal secretary by profession and single.  On Novemeber 14th, 2003 between 5:30-6:45 pm Jamie took one of her dogs for a walk.  This is rountine for her every day after work.  She has two dogs and walks one at a time.  She takes a path down from her home to Lincoln Elementary School.  There is a small wooded area in a field that is off to the side of the school.  Its about a 10 minute walk. On this day she happened to notice two lights in the sky above the trees.  She described the lights as grayish-blue in color.  One was round and one was more oblong in shape.  When asked if she thought these were just lights or if they could be solid objects, Jamie expressed she felt these were ""objects"" rather then lights.  She first thought they may be search lights or spot lights or even planes but then noticed they did not have a beam from which light could radiate nor were there any sounds of engines.  The shape of these objects could be seen though the thin clouds. At first Jamie stopped and watched as these objects would come close together and then move away from each other.  She felt as if they may of been playing tag. At one point she thought they were going to crash into each other.  I asked if there were military planes in the area on a regular basisthat  did maneuvers?  She said that,yes, there were but she knew what they looked like and could hear the sounds of the engines.  The color of the plane lights were also totally different from what she saw.  She said that she finally stopped watching the objects and began to walk her dog. She immediately noticed that the objects began to slowly follow along about 30 feet away and about 50 feet above the tree line and behind the clouds.  As she walked they kept pace.  She got to the end of her walk and came back with the objects still keeping up with her.  She did not mention how the objects turned to follow her back. When Jamie got to the house the objects seemed to ""park"" themselves above a weeping willow tree in the side of her yard.  This tree is about 40 feet from the house and about 60 feet tall. The objects hovered about 50 feet above the tree.  Jamie said she ran into the house and began crying.  When she explained to her family what had just taken place, all 5 members of her family went out and looked up at the objects still hovering above the willow.  Jamie explained these objects were there before she went out and was gone by 8 pm so she speculates they had to to be there for at least two and half hours. Jamie went on to state that she and her parents decided to walk the second dog to see what would happen.  As soon as they stepped out the objects took up postion above the tree line once more and began to follow along.  The pattern was repeated. Note: There was no adverse reaction from the dogs. Once back to the house the lights again took up ""sentry"" watch over the willow tree.  By now the parents were also frightened and they called the Niles City Police to report what was going on.  The dispatcher said they would send an officer out to investigate but no one ever showed up. Jamie said her father did ask if spot lights were being used in the area where they lived and the repsonse was ""not to our knowledge."" Family members would ocasionally check to see if lights were still over the willow.  At this point Jamie says she went to the National UFO Reporting Center website and began to send in the report while the objects still hovered over the tree.  No one saw the objects leave the area. Five days later on Novemever 19th around 7:30 pm, Jamie was getting ready to walk her dogs.  When she went outside the one round grayish-blue object was back.  Jamie and her mother walked the dog.  They took the same path but this time went to the left side of the school and back around to see if the object would follow.  The object kept pace even going around the building with them.  By now there was no tree line so the object stayed behind the clouds.  Jamie stated the object would jump from one cloud to the next without coming into open space in the sky as if it wanted to stay concealed. This time Jamie called the news room of the Tribune Chronicle in Warren, Ohio. The gentleman who answered asked about the object in ths sky and said he would check witht he weatherman to see if anything unusual was going on with the weather.  He did not call back.  Comments: Jamie sounded to be a credible witness and while speaking to me by phone she would ask her parents who were in the background several questions.  I could hear their respones to the questions.  We have multible witnesses to these sightings.  No one could supply an answer to what the objects/lights could have been.  The dispatcher stated no spot lights were being used at the time.  Military aircarft exercises could be ruled out for the fact that these objects stood staionary for long periods of time and seemed to leave their positions over the trees to follow witnesses. Even if it was search lights or spot lights, I do not believe they would have hovered for long periods of time. Additional notes: I called Jamie's residence again on December 20th to find out if the relative at the airport would speak to me. This time Jamie's mother answered the phone.  She said that her brother who works at the airport did not have addtional information pertinent to the case.  She also expressed how frighted her and the family were during the time the objects were present.  She stated that she and Jamie both felt that they were being ""watched"" by these objects.  She went on to say that Jamie stated to her that the hair on the back of her neck stood up as they walked the dogs as if someone was staring at them from behind. Jamie's mother also stated that Jamie had forgot to tell me that when Jamie went to the bathroom window to look out, one of the objects seemed to sense her presence and moved quickly to an evergreen tree about 20 feet from the bathroom window and hovered there about 50 feet above that tree. She says that Jamie got the distinct impression the light was trying to see into the room. I called the Niles City Police Dept. and asked about an incoming call made on the date in question.  I was told that no call was placed to the staion on that date about lights in the area.  I find it strange that the call was not on file.  The officer I spoke to was very dismissive of my call and acted like he did not have time to talk to me.

On November 20, 2003 I had been taking a nap and at 6:00 p.m. ""something"" told me to wake up and open my eyes.  As I did, the first thing I saw was a big white light in the sky across the street.  It was so big and nearby, it could have only been coming from a helicopter.  But it was an unusually warm day in WI and I still had my windows open.  Had it been a helicopter, there would have been loud noise coming from it.  There was no noise whatsoever.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and it went behind the house across the street so I lost sight of it.  It just silently glided out of my view.  About 15 minutes later again ""something"" told me to take the dogs outside.  My dogs never go out at that time (they're on a regular pattern and had gone out a little earlier already).  As I took the second dog outside, I looked up in the sky and telepathically said: ""Are you still in the area?""  Right then I noticed a plane going overhead.  I said out loud: ""Oh, that's just a stupid plane again!""  And before I finished that sentence, I saw something else and said: ""THAT's not a plane!""  Not too far behind the plane was a configuration of three amber circles enclosed in a amber rectangle. It glowed amber as if it was pure energy and a sentient being in and of itself.  As it glided through the atmosphere, it didn't fly straight like human made planes do, rather it traveled on an angle.  I watched it only for a few seconds before it just disappeared.

Something to watch: In December my mother was diagnosed with Advanced Breast Cancer.  Since I myself was healed by an ET, I have strongly requested those same ETs to heal my Mother.  Beginning in December, the Phoenix area (within WALKING or WORKING distance from my family) has had a UFO Sighting / Flap.  And in that time, a mysterious white ""UFO"" van has been spotted numerous times right near where they live. So I have Faith that they are going to heal her.

A fellow called me on the toll free line to tell me that he and 7 other witnesses observed a beam of light which came down from the night sky. The light was seen from the witnesses location which was in the southwest part of Airdrie, the beam of light was in the northwest part of the sky. Due to homes being in the witnesses line of sight, they were not able to see if the beam actual hit the ground. I asked the witness a few questions about what this beam of light looked like. He said it came straight down, not on any angles nor were there bends in the light. The fellow told me that it had an orange glow to it. The amazing thing is that this beam of light sat in one place for approx: 20 minutes, enough time that some of the witnesses ran in to telephone other friends and family members so they could go out to see this strange event. I also asked if the beam of light lit up any of the area, the witness said no, due to obstacles in their way.  No sound was heard, plus the beam was rather wide, not just a thin beam of light. He said it was moderately cloudy as I wanted to know if any type of object was seen in the area where the light originated from.  No object was noted. No aircraft were visible at the time of the sighting flying through this airspace. I wondered if this may have been a helicopter, but again not a sound was heard coming from the area and I am sure the witnesses, and the others you went out to watch this would have heard the sound if it had been some type of normal aircraft.

At just about the half way point of the flight (approx. 18:45 local time) I noticed a bright object above the horizon.  Thinking it was just a planet, I didn't give it a second glance.  About 10 minutes after I had first noticed the object, I saw my captain adjusting our TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system) to the farthest setting of 80 miles.  I then looked out at the object and it was now below the horizon.  I asked the captain if he was trying to see if the object was an aircraft using our TCAS.  He said yes.  The object which appeared to be approximately 20-40 miles in front of us was now changing colors from it's original white, to red and green.  At first we thought it was just another aircraft with it's anti-collision lights on until the color changes.  I was handling the radios and decided to ask air traffic control if we had any aircraft in front of us at a range of 20-40 miles.  His reply was that we didn't have any traffic within 80 miles of our position.  He asked me to describe the object, which I did, and then he proceeded to contact another aircraft that was at our 9 o'clock position and 80 miles from us, to see if they saw the object that I described.  They (the other aircraft) responded that they saw the same thing.  We never gained any ground on the object and as we started our decent to Memphis, the object in front of us did the same.  The object went into the cloud layer and we never saw it again.

I looked in my binoculars but could not make the shape out-it just looked like different colors blurring together.

At 33 years old, I still think about my experience often.  I was only 11 when in 1980 (?) something really wonderful was about to be experienced...a UFO sighting.  It's as clear to me now as it was 22 years ago.  Was I dreaming? Seeing an illusion? Was it a meteor or a meteorological event?  I'm certain it was not!  How can I be so certain?  I was with a friend who also saw everything.  We ran home to our parents to tell the story.  The next day, Edmonton radio and newspapers claiming the phone lines were choked with similar testimony gave us credibility.  Representatives from the University, (who never witnessed the event), explained it as a possible meteor.  So here is what really happened... Armed with a pair of binoculars, it was a clear summer starry night when my friend ((name deleted)) and I set out to star gaze.  While ""break and enters"" where the hobbies of kids our age, we enjoyed astronomy. We actually wrote papers on the planets and studied the constellations. Call us geeks, but we found it exciting.  Facing the northern sky, we settled into the side of a hill not far from my house where lights could be dodged. My parents were stationed in Edmonton for a 5 year term. Life on the Greisbach army base was, to say the least, boring, so the patience we had learned was about to be rewarded.  After about 40 minutes of just laying there, I happened to take interest at a red star in the east. I pointed it out to ((2nd witness)) to get his opinion. Although we both agreed it was just a star, I still kept a wary eye on it. It wasn't long before I was asking ((2nd witness)) to confirm if the star was moving.  It seemed to be growing!  Awww...just a plane we decided.  He went back to gazing at other objects.  A few moments passed and I nudged him asserting that it was no plane.  Now we were both watching intently.  Then the most peculiar thing happened.  A beam of light grew from it.  Our mouths were fixed open in awe.  I fumbled with my click camera, but was more interested in taking in the event.  The beam of light grew long across the sky as it moved at a constant rate from east to west, well above the horizon, but not overhead. The distance was difficult to judge, but it seemed far yet near.  Kind of like a Las Vegas building. They look near because they are so big.  As it stretched across the north in front of us, stranger things appeared.  Two stars appeared on each side of the beam, and then another two, and then another two. Then all stars did the same thing the original beam did.  They stretched out thinner beams in front of them.  The beams had bright lights at each end.  They were positioned perfectly symmetrical.  The middle beam was bigger than the surrounding beams.  When the event was directly in front of us, again each of the smaller beams were surrounded by stars which then shot out their own beams.  Now as the event passed into the west, (which still had a bit of twilight), it did the exact reverse!  Small beams collapsed into stars and into single beams and then the last big beam collapsed back down to a star which eventually winked out.  The main event had lasted for only a minute, but it seemed longer. Chris and I looked at each other in excitement.  We stayed there for another half hour hoping for more.  Our excitement got the better of us and we ran home to tell all!  If anyone else has seen and remembers this, please contact me (email address below).  I would like to compare notes.  Also, I can't remember the exact date but I would love to search the newspaper archives for this event.  Its possible the army was experimenting with some sort of transportation device; But as I let my imagination take over, I think we witnessed an alien space probe passing by our planet on a planned mapping of our solar system.  Think of it like a car coming down the road. At first you see a small dot, then it grows into a front and then as it passes you see the long side of it and then the backside and finally a receding dot.  In this case the front was like looking at the end of a fiber optic cable and as it passed it looked like the whole fiber.  Its so hard to put into words, but it was an incredibly FANTASTIC event to witness. Whatever it was, it was VERY BIG!  If you ask ((2nd witness)) today, he thinks it was just a meteor.  I saw some very cool big meteors with a long sparkly death, and nothing in that shower could even come remotely close to what we saw. It was NOT a meteor. Meteors do NOT have symmetry! Nor do they fill up the sky.  But there was no doubt that it was NOT a meteor.  I had seen them before, this in contrast looked alien, moved slowly across the entire sky, and behaved mechanical.  I also forgot to add that there was supposedly a very low engine rumble.  I can't remember if I experienced this or if I got this from the reports the next day.  Like I said, we were too transfixed, all other non-visual senses seemed to be halted.  I should also state that we were NOT under the influence of anything... we were eleven!  I have better things to do then tell wild stories. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and he seemed exceptionally lucid and objective to us.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness, in part, because he is an amateur astronomer.  Please see his other report for February 28, 2004, also from Edmonton, AB.

As I got older, of course the more I remember. But what I'm expressing in this story now is something I will never forget. Mostly because I witnessed a UFO with someone else, my brother. Don't get excited, we we're not abducted or anything, but it's a classic story anyhow.  It was 1980, an average cloudless bright sunny day. I was like 6 years old at the time (I'll be 30 in March), and my brother was around 11 years old. It was in the afternoon, probably around 1:00 pm (the exact time is hard to remember because I was so young). My brother and I were both in the back seat of our family car while my mother was driving out of our neighborhood. As my mom pulled out of our neighborhood with us two in the back seats, I distinctly remember seeing something in the corner of my eye. My porifrial vision took over in a split of a second. I look to the right of me, up slightly outside of the car window, and I'm stunned by what I'm seeing...a glowing red oval shaped object, not moving at all. Dead still in mid-air. Then suddenly...GONE. It took off directly straight, away from the street we were on...out of sight.  My brother sitting in the back seat with me yells, ""Did you see that!!!???"" and I say ""YEAH!"" We were both freaked out and explained what we saw to my mom, and she continued to drive like we were her two little boys making a story up on the fly. ""Wow, you something in the sky?"".  This interesting, the shape of the object differs from what I saw and what my brother saw. I saw an oval reddish glowing circle, halow, so you could see a hole through it (like an aerobee frisby). My brother saw an oval shape, solid, no hole. Anyhow, we both saw that it was reddish orange, oval, not moving for 3 seconds and last but not least, it's light speed take off in mid-air.  I've made a picture of what we saw, remember this is an ILLUSTRATION, I made this in Fireworks (similar to photoshop), but it's pretty close to what we saw:  http://davidpaslay.com/images/ufo.jpg  If you have any questions, or have seen something similar in Colorado feel free to email me at:  ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I remember it being in June of 1987 but the actual day is hard to remember.,Burlington,CT,1987-06-15T20:00:00,fireball,2 Hours,"Occurred : 6/15/1987 20:00  (Entered as : 06/15/1987 20:00) Reported: 2/26/2004 11:04:16 PM 23:04 Posted: 3/2/2004 Location: Burlington, CT Shape: Fireball Duration:2 Hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35290.html,"I remember it being in June of 1987 but the actual day is hard to remember. There is a stretch of road that runs through Burlington Ct called rout 4. Located off this road and between Johnnycake Airport and the Burlington Trout Hatchery is a stretch of winding roads that takes you into the direction of Nepaug Reservoir. Along these roads which has zero street lights and is very wooded is a clearing that overlooks a small section of the reservoir. On this night my brother, his friend and myself were sitting on the hood of my car looking up at the night sky that was loaded with stars. I remember talking about the Challenger accident (6 months eariler) that for me was still fresh in my mind. My brothers friend was the first to notice a star like object crossing the night sky. Looking in the direction he was pointing I observed this object cross the entire sky within seconds as far as the eye could see than turn around to make a pass back in our direction. This happend 4 times in a matter of 1 minute. On what was to be its final pass we noticed in its path was a much larger object, the best way I can describe it to you is it looked like a circle formation of star like objects. As the moving craft reached this larger circle (maintaining its same observed speed) we thought it would continue going but when it reached the outer edge of this larger circle it was just gone. At that moment we looked at each other amaized at what we had seen, and over to our left, above the water and small hilltops were these three(3) fire balls. The formation between these 3 fireballs and our location was a diamond. We looked at the objects for at least 30 minutes. Within this time frame each one moved very slowly, the one to our far left seemed to drift straight back and away from us than it was gone like it flipped off a switch. The object to our far right descended straight down behind the tree line. At that moment we noticed a small plane making its landing approach at the near by airfield, thats when I made the joakingly remark and said (pointing to the object dead ahead of us) ""Watch, I bet this one will bounce"" Just as I said it, the object started to bounce itself behind the small hilltop. These objects were at the same level as the small plane was at the time of its landing approach to the airfield. By this time we were speechless as to what we saw. At that moment we heard a noise that came from the very dark woods behind us that sounded as if something fell from the top of the trees and hit every branch on its way down. If you had a stop watch at that moment I think it would have been a new worlds record for getting into a car, locking the doors, turning the key and getting our asses outta there. We drove to Torrington Ct which is about a 30 minute drive, within 10 minutes of getting into town we saw another friend of my brothers, we told her what we had seen, drove her back up to the sight and each one of the fireballs were back in the exact place we saw them the first time. After a few minutes they each began to move again as they did before. We never looked up into the sky to see if the star formation was still there and whatever had made the noise that scared us outta there in the first place I guess was gone cause we didn't hear any noises again. The person we found to show her what we had seen had seen enough and wanted to go back after observing the objects for only about 15 ! minutes. Whatever we had seen that night, in the sky and over the reservoir were not low or high flying air planes except for the one noted. As far as what fell out of the tree, who knows, but I bet it hurt.

Estes  Avenue 1/2 block from Sheridan Road while living in a second floor apartment with my husband at the time. It is near 10 PM at night and I (administrative assistant) am drying and putting away dishes telling my husband (graphic artist/muscian) that I just have the feeling someone is going to stop by our place tonight. We are getting ready to watch the 10 o'clock news and begin to unpeg the futon couch to  make it into a bed in front of our 27"" floor model TV.  He comes over to my side and says, ""Look out the window"" and he takes my hand and we walk over to see what the bright light flooding the courtyard is about.  We find it very strange and I ask him, ""What do you think it is?"" He says, ""Do you think they are filming a movie on top of our roof?"" I say, ""It is very bright like the Kleig movie set lights...that's so silly, it's the middle of February at 10 o'clock at night and why on top of our roof?!"" He suggest we put our coats on and go outside to check it out.  I step outside the foyer door onto the sidewalk where I can see my shadow like daylight (not full moon light) and exclaim how bright it is that I see my shadow like in daylight! We look up toward the roof and it is just so brilliantly white bright and we can not see beyond the castle cut-out like roof edge. We decide to walk out of the courtyard where the sidewalk is to see if we see movie trucks parked on the street and we do not. We decide to walk around to the west side of our building and there is no bright light there and nothing we can see three stories up on the roof. He wonders if there is a helicopter on our roof then, though we hear nothing like a helicopter. As we are walking back toward the sidewalk and down the street toward our courtyard we both stop simultaneously noticing that something feels very different  and we bounce off of each other some strange feelings...how it's 10 o'clock at night and there is absolutely no busy traffic, no traffic sounds, no traffic at ! all on S heridan Road and we observe the light changing from green to red...we notice there are no ""double parked cars"" or pizza delivery cars, no one out walking, etc. It also seems strange that no one is looking out their windows noticing the bright light in our courtyard alone. It seems like time and space are at a standstill and we are the only two people left in the world! We decide to go back to the courtyard and try and look up toward the top of the roof again. I pull out some sunglasses I have in my coat pocket and put them on to see if I can see any better with them on. Next we remember going back inside the apartment on the second floor. Once inside our apartment I say to my husband, ""Do you think we should call the police? Or will the lights be gone by the time the police arrive  here and they'll just think we are nuts?"" He suggests we talk to our neighbors in the morning to see if any of them saw anything and to just wait and "" time""  to see how long the lights continue to stay on outside. We look at an electric wall clock in our dinning room/music room that reads 10:30 PM and I say we couldn't have been out there for more than 10 minutes, how can it be 10:30 already! We both look at the VCR on top of the TV and the clock reads 12:00 midnight. We both feel that something is wrong with the time. We notice the lights are gone by 12:15 AM according to the VCR clock and the clock in the other room is stopped and stuck at 10:30 PM...it never works again.  We feel very exhausted and confused and go to bed. By morning time, we notice the VCR clock is correct in correlation with the morning tv programs. Now we both realize we could not possibly have been outside for nearly two hours when it seemed less than 10 minutes! None of our neighbors had noticed any light in the courtyard night before at all. I am very alarmed and I call my mother (LPN nurse) in Indiana saying I have something strange to tell her and she says she has something very strange to tell me about how she woke up in the middle of the night wit! h three short dark beings by her bedside all 3 wearing large different hats. She finds herself paralyzed and in terror, she closes her eyes and opens them again and they are still there. She is unable to wake my father (retired pipefitter) up. She wants to move and run and can't, she wants to scream and can't. She is reciting all the bible verses she can recall to her mind hoping  this will make them go away because she thinks they are evil and they are still there...she says she was not dreaming and they were very real to her and eventually they did go away. She is a very skeptical/logical person and is unwilling to talk of or speak of this bizarre thing to anyone else. She was very frightened and terrorfied by the experience and wonders if I could possibly have anything to do with it? I tell her the story about the lights. Over the course of a year, my husband is contiunally physcially ill and I go to the doctor with him to explain he is being mis-diagnosed and they need to find out what is the matter with him with the same symptoms I have been noticing. Seems he could have what is known as ""yuppie flu"" as he is a 60 hour a week work-a-holic...chronic fatigue syndrome...it is very controversial in the late 1980tys and his doctor decides to become more specialized and find out as much as he can to help him. By the 1990tys my husband's insurance company wants to know which he has - chronic fatigue syndrome or epstein barr virus...there is ""tilt-table"" test at St. Joseph's Hospital in Chicago and it is determined he has both in high numbers which qualifies him for disability pay, later he develops hypo-thyroid condition and fibromyalgia. He gradually recalls feeling back to the experience that he may have been ""ruffed up by some men""  It saddens me to see him ill and I decide because I am the healthier one that I will undergo some hypnotherapy sessions to try and recall that missing time. During the sessions it is like I am re-living the experience. When I put on my sunglasses to look up on the roof toward the br! ight lig ht to see better...under hypnosis recall I find myself suddenly level with the roof top in the air and I am looking at a round bell-shaped craft with windows and an open door with pale light inside...there is brilliant bright light outside and a blue flashing light outside...it is attractive and over-whelming feelings of fun-ride over here, like excitement at an amusement park and next it is urgent, like an emergency...hospital emergency room rush over here.!I have not made it past this part in my hypnosis experience, so it's suggested that my mind/unconscious is blocking me not allowing me to see it all because I could not handle it...also I have heard of some kind of hypnosis gift or technique called ""rapid induction"" where a few dozen hypnotherapists in the U.S. are able to take their clients under very deeply, fully, walk them thru whole traumatic experience without them coming out of sesssion and able to give counsel at the end of session (such as in kidnapping/rape cases). I have not met any hypnotherapists who do such. I have come out of my sesssions feeling post traumatic stress disorder, so I had decided to stop altogether. This experience in Chicago I would say has been very life altering. ((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.  Date of event is approximate.

At first we thought the object was a kite, because of its erratic path, but then it would often straighten up and move in a very deliberate direction, like a manned object.  I used my digital camera as a binoculars by looking through the zoom lens at maximum range, and after close inspection I clearly saw something moving on the side of the object facing me. To me, depending on the size perspective, it seemed to be either a small craft reminiscent of the old Apollo Lunar Landers, or it was something like an Autogyro, the old ""flying chair"" device that's been used in military recon missions for decades. If it was the latter, the movement I saw on it could have been the person operating it.  The object was seen by a great many people in the parking lot and by persons on the Eastern By-Pass.

(I am reporting this over one year following the sighting.) However, I have been very careful about reliving the actual event in my mind, just the way it happened, and I've taken great care to not allow the reports of others to influence or haze my experience. In fact, what I view as the most fascinating component of my story has not been described in anyone else's reports about this supposed same craft my friend and I viewed on the night of July 23, 2002.  Throughout this written account, I denote the significant differences in my report to the reports from other Angelinos who viewed a similar object on the same date and near the same time I did with ** surrounding those facts.  On this night, I was helping my friend move his tools into my house, where he was to stay before flying to New York the next day. As we carried items toward my house from the curb, he asked, ""How's it going around here lately?"" Almost jokingly, I responded, ""Well...a lot of sky activity tonight, it's strange."" (I had noticed many planes in the L.A. skies that particular evening, for some reason.)  Just as I made this comment, at 22:05 on this night, I looked up to an object that had caught my sight. It was positioned almost directly above my house, located in the heart of Los Angeles. At first, it seemed to me to possibly be a large blimp - with what I guessed to be ** white and bluish ** or ** white and greenish ** blinking lights along its **oblong shape** - traveling very slowly above my home. As I stood watching it (mouth agape), my friend came out of the house and joked at my expression. He said, ""Yeah, right,"" in reference to his knowing how I have always wanted to be witness to a UFO...he believed I was still passing a joke, attached to my previous comment.  I told him to look at what I was looking at. He turned to see what I was seeing. My friend (who is in no way intrigued by the idea of alien spacecrafts exploring our planet) said, ""You're right. Oh my God, you're right.""  I was in awe of the size of the object. By this time, I comprehended that the object was moving much too slowly to be even a blimp. I yelled excitedly for him to fetch any camera from inside my house. As I watched the object, I slowly and consciously concentrated on what I was seeing. I held my arm out to the coasting object. The best I could judge was that it would have been two feet in length if it were truly located at the edge of my fingertips. I concentrated on the lights I was seeing emitting from the object. As much as I tried, I simply could not decide for certain if the faint lights I saw around this thing were ** white, or if they were blue...I couldn't even detect if I was seeing green or red lights for sure **. It was strange to look directly at these lights and very consciously not understand what color they were. I finally decided that they cast themselves as a faint ""white and bluish"".  As I answered my friend who yelled from inside, ""Where is there a camera?"" I saw something else that challenged my concentration. Plainly, the object was beginning to alter its shape as I watched it. ** Slowly, the shape ebbed from an oblong form into a definite triangular figure. ** I watched this occur. I occupied my mind and thoughts on staying focused on these happenings that I had no time to be disbelieving of them. Yet, I was more than mildly curious to how this could be actually happening - to be watching something that was seemingly a structure change forms before my very eyes like this. At this time, it seemed the lights were becoming a little more clear in their emission. ** I was becoming more decided on white and green blinking lights now, with a steady red one located toward the anterior position of this thing, although I am not certain that this ""steady"" red light was ""on"" the entire rest of the time I watched the object. The blinking white and green lights seemed to also have some red in it as well during its slow trip over my neighborhood. **  My friend came out of the house with one of my cameras. To my dismay, it was a Polariod instant camera. He handed it to me and looked back up to the sky in the direction where I was looking. I realized then that I was still standing in my own front yard, and the object was still somewhere over my house. In about one minute and thirty seconds, the thing had not moved enough to even take the distance of my rooftop in the sky. My friend's question to me then verified that I had indeed watched this strange thing change shapes: ""Is that still the same thing?""  I very kindly asked him to see if he could locate another one of my cameras (reminding him that this could very well have been an event I had longed for most of my life). He obliged and went back inside.  I aimed at the shape with the camera and had trouble spotting it in the night sky any time I tried to view it from the viewfinder. Maybe the lights were too faint, and possibly the camera's little square viewfinder was caked with dust. Instead of losing viewing time for myself, I simply aimed the camera a number of times toward the slow-moving object and clicked, hoping for the best. I was in my neighbor's yard by the time I heard my friend clicking with another (disposable) camera from my yard. He said to me, frustrated, ""Anytime I look through the camera lens, I can't see it!""  We both slowly walked southward on our street and through people's yards, trying to get a good shot of the thing. We did this for roughly ten minutes. I watched the thing continue to move southward, over Los Angeles (seemingly at a fairly close proximity to where LAX - the airport of Los Angeles - is). I remember my friend tiring of the event while I stood near the end of my street, then backing up, to still watch it until the last possible moment. I can not recall what I was viewing at that point in time - nor can I recall at all what it looked like from behind. I just remember being saddened that the sight of it was gone as it finally disappeared behind some tall trees, far in the distance.  Summary:  Shape: Oblong, changed to traingular  Noise: None whatsoever  Speed: Incredibly slow (I'm terrible at judging this to mph)  Size: If touching my fingertips, the object would have been two feet in diameter, and almost twelve inches in width, I believe  Lights: Blinking, faint at one point, difficult to discern color (best guess is white and bluish or white and greenish); when shape was altered, I recall seeing a red light at the front end of the object (a steady light, at least for a while) and the other colors were a blinking white and green, sprinkled with more red  Odd feelings during sighting: None whatsoever  Odd occurrences during sighting: None whatsoever  Other witnesses: Friend  Evidence: Photographs (see below)  Of course, we got to see the instantaneous developing pictures right away - they rendered nothing. I scanned those and tried using all sorts of filters and utilities from different computer imaging applications to no avail.  Somehow, I lost the disposable camera with the photographs of the objects. That camera was not recovered until last week. It now sits in a desk drawer in my office, awaiting film processing. I work at a major motion picture studio in Hollywood, where there is a Camera Department (in my group), so I am hopeful of finally developing the images of this object we saw that night.

My children and I were swimming at my mothers house. It was shortly after dinner time, but the sun was still above the trees. They live outside the city on and acre of land and recently had 5 very large trees removed from the backyard in order to put in the swimming pool. We are about 25 miles away from Akron/Canton Airport so we are used to seeing aircraft flying overhead. Those traffic lanes are generally East-West and NorthEast-West.  We also have several small airports nearby where little two-seaters and bi-planes take off and land. What made us stop and stare at this particular craft was that it was flying at about 2-3000 feet and going from North to South. The craft was shaped like a missle almost, but there were no wings, no lights, no landing gear, no sound, no CHEM TRAIL. The sun (which was in the west) appeared to be reflecting off the exterior of the craft, yet as it traveled south, the glare never stopped. If you have ever watched an aircraft pass overhead, there is always a point where the sun is no longer reflected off the aircraft and back in your eyes and you can get a better look. This was not the case. What I originally took to be sun glare (bright white) must have been lighting of some kind. My mother (58) and step-father (60) both saw it and we discussed it for almost an hour after it was gone. Two of my 4 children also remember seeing it, but have nothing new or remarkable to add.

The length to diameter ratio was probably between 4 and 5.  The sky was totally clear, and the sun was at a late afternoon angle so the object was reflecting greatly.

This sighting occured during the fireworks launched over the city of Seattle. I was staying at the Best Bestern (sic--Best Western/University Towers) Hotel in the University District of Seattle, WA. I was looking out of my hotel room enjoying the 4th of July Fireworks. My girlfriend had a room just above me on the next floor. I called her up to tell her what a great view we had of the fireworks. As I looked out the hotel window enjoying the multitude of shows (there were about 3 different ones going on) I looked on another part of the skyline where there were no fireworks but rather 4 triangular ships that seemed to be doing an acrobatic maneuver. First they simultaneously shot out in directions: North, East, South, and West and then they returned back to the original positions. They were not behaving like fireworks, I never saw fireworks act like this. Rather than think they were UFO's, I originally reasoned that they were miniature models of UFO's that someone had rigged up a radio control mechanism to. I called up my girlfriend that night to see if she could see them. Unfortunately she could not. I now believe that these objects were the same type that were viewed in Phoenix, Arizona on March 13, 1997 documented in Chuck Missler/Mark Eastman's book, Alien Encounters. I bought this book because of the sightings I had observed this July.

Dear Mr. Vike  Here's an interesting image from the footage - what do you make of it ? On the afternoon of July 6 , 2003 my husband noticed a gleem way over head , it looked odd so I went and got my camcorder w/ 500 digital zoom . Couldn't see what it was until I zoomed in . I recorded the most awesome 3 minutes of what was definitely an unidentified object . We looked through frame by frame and found some ' brow raising ' images .  For one I am a 31 year old skeptic , don't care for politics or red tape . I am the type of person that looks to the logical explanations in all  ' unexplained ' from paranormal to the unexplained but this footage is like nothing I know is on record to date . It isn't just a sliver ball darting around , the footage has captured more detail than that , the object is definitely not a sliver ball .  I was in the Navy , have been on carriers / sub-tenders , I have seen aircraft ... stealth , bomber ... etc. But I have never seen anything like this !  And the footage shows ( I was filming by a tree ) you can see the object moving as the leaves in the same frame remain still . Also taped the moon to show I did not mistake the object for ' swamp gas reflecting off a weather balloon causing steam to rise in a dioxide mist '  Let me assure you this footage is true . Pictures can be found at: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/united_states_ufo_reports.htm  This footage is so solid I am willing to sell all rights of it .I realize there are many are hoaxed projects - experts that can sniff out a fake crop circle a mile away .I do feel this footage will be talked from all aspects of the UFO pros & cons for years to come.

He wanted to mention that he had never been a big believer in UFOs, but after July 10, 2003 his thinking may have changed a bit.  The witness was sitting on his front steps in Winfield, British Columbia and looking to his west into the starry night. He spotted the Big Dipper, the handle of it when he saw what looked like a satellite moving horizontally towards the Big Dipper and across it. The fellow said to himself, ""this is really moving fast"", what is this? The object was flying still horizontally through the sky, when it passed by the Big Dipper it changed direction on a dime and shot back and up. But as he watched the object traveling in an upwards motion, it came to a complete stop. The gentleman had a Sony camera with him at the time and happened to capture approx: 2 minutes of footage which he is getting to me soon.

This long, narrow road has a unobstructed view of the night sky, almost like being atop a huge tower.  After many disappointing vists to this area, myself and three of my close friends saw something absolutly mind boggling.  It was approx. 12:30 AM when we first noticed a strange orange and red light sitting still above the tree line in the southeastern sky.  It was much larger and brighter than any of the planes or stars that we saw.  It did not move from that location, so we really didn't think much of it.  Approx. five minutes later, the exact same light we saw above the tree line, had moved to the eastern skyline.  We didn't take our eyes off of it from that point on.  The light began moving from the northeastern skyline to the southeast and then back again for approx. 10-15 minutes.  It seemed to have no pattern whatsoever to it's direction of flight.  We could tell that it was getting closer to us, and then very far at a tremendous rate of speed.  The most amazing thing happened after it had dimmed away for minute or so; We suddenly witnessed it very close again, mostly orange in color, but sometimes red, blue and white.  It was close enough that we certainly would have been able to hear if it was jet or prop powered, but there was dead silence.  It got even closer, staying just above the tree line.  It was moving from south to north when we ran down the road to catch a glimpse of it between two large trees.  We saw a classic ""movie made"" disk hovering at a 45 degree angle.  We could see 4 or 5 bright white round lights either on the top or bottom perimeter of the disk spinning on axis at a reletivly slow speed. We witnessed this actual disk for only 10 or 15 seconds.  The object changed from a spinning disk, to a white ball of light and took off at an amazing rate of speed (again, no sound) making almost a horseshoe loop in the sky, and then it was gone.

I had a call today from a fellow who is now residing in Vernon, British Columbia. He saw a flier on the wall at the Vernon library requesting that if anyone has witnessed an unusual object in the skies to write or call me. So he did. The witnessed lived at one time in Terrace, British Columbia and had rented a moving truck and was moving to Vernon, B.C. he had everything packed up and hit the road early on April 6, 2002 and started his long journey to his new home. He passed through the small community of Clinton, B.C. which is midway between Vancouver and Prince George and is located 39 kms north of the Trans Canada Highway #1 and Cariboo Highway #97 junction, having an elevation of 887 meters. The population of Clinton currently stands at approximately 740. As he was driving south a few kilometers out of Clinton, B.C on a straight stretch of road at dawn when he noticed something rather unusual way off in the horizon. He said he was able to observe a dot, or very small object which seemed to be floating around, still very far away at this time.  As he drove, he slowed because what ever this was he was looking at was acting really strange and it started growing larger in size due to it heading in his direction. The witness told me, his Dad is a pilot, his Uncle is a pilot and his cousin is a pilot and he said he has been around aircraft all his life and knew what he was seeing was something he had never observed before. He also reports that what ever it was had no strobe lights on it, as it drew closer the object took on a metallic silver color to it. The shape was that of a saucer type craft, and as it approached it dropped in altitude to approx:1000 feet and flew straight over top of the truck he was driving, moving at an incredible rate of speed.  He also told me the object was approx: 60 feet across and the bottom of it was completely black in color. Just as the object passed over head his eye caught sight of another craft of the same kind and it to passed overhead quickly and both objects were out of sight within a second or two. The objects were traveling north to east. He said there was not a sound to be heard. He immediately pulled the truck over to the side of the road and jumped out to see if he might be able to see something in the distance, but these objects were gone.

This all took place as I was staring into the night sky sitting at a bus stop. Was it commercial? NO! Was it military? If it was, then I'm curious why I didn't know such an aircraft even existed. And just what would the military be doing flying this secret craft so low over Santa Cruz anyway? Was it an alien aircraft? I want to say no - but to me it's kind of just unexplainable. Also I want to add that I wasn't on any drug's or alcohol. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) ATTENTION: Web Master. I actually filed a report with you  a couple day's ago, and I noticed it had not been posted yet. I was hoping I could change a few thing's, I originally reported the date as being 4/21/2002 - it actually was 4/18/2002. Also, the time I reported was 21:45 - it actually was 20:50. I had found a note I wrote myself the night it happened with the correct info.  I have read a lot of other triangle reports, I can't believe that many people have seen this triangle. Although most description's are very different from mine, some are very similar. I would like to change my mind on being contacted by an investigator, as long as it is discreet.

My friend and i were smoking a cig in the parking of a church up on a huge hill about 200 feet above, 50feet inland of the 5 freeway. To the west was the ocean about 1 mile away.  Previous to the object (or light)catching my eye, I was facing the south(along the 5 freeway), My friend was facing north.  clear sky, not one cloud.  So anyway--then a bright yellow/gold light appears south of our position. I grew up in this town and it only has one freeway, so i know every inch of the 5 in SC. My best guess would place the object at first sight--about 1.5 miles south of the church.  I told my friend to look at it because it was very bright and rather unusual for a copper to be flying so low at 10pm. SC goes to sleep at 10pm-the city is dead till morrning.  SO we kept watching the light.  After 3-4 min. we agreed that the light was moving North directly toward our position up on the hill. NOW IS THE MOST INTERESTING PART---what ever this flying object was.  It took it 15 min to fly from south of MISTY RIDGE( the next huge hill south)To directly over our heads (1.5 miles away).  when the object passed over our position on the hill, the thing must have been moving less than 25mph.  It just appeared out of nowhere--cruzed at 15mph along the 5 freeway, went over our heads, and just kept on going. It made no sound--we would have known if it was a copper.  I'm assuming that the craft was all black- because i could only see three gold lights in a triangle shape.   FOR REAL---IT MADE NO SOUND--not even the sound of the freeway could silence a copper flying right over our heads.  During the sighting the object was low in altitude.  i'd say- 300 feet.  when the object flew over our heads it was NOT far away(we were up on a huge hill)--I'm suprised that I couldn't see the body of the craft. i tried to make out the actual shape but i just  couldn't see the body (black/on black sky).  It just looked like 3 bright lights in a triangle formation. I watched t! he first 3 seasons of the X-files--so i asked my friend some questions.  We experienced no communication with the object. we felt no loss of time.  we didn't feel sick/nauscious. we saw it--it most likely saw us--it flew by.  That's my story. OH YA- SC is the southern edge of orange county--right on the border of CAMP PENALTIN and the TRW facility (trw-where the military worked on laszer guidence systems). My former highschool is located just 2 miles from the TRW facility. back in 1997-98, at night we would drive to a place where we could see the TRW plant and watch the laser fights.  NO JOKE- they were having lazer gun fights out there on the base. I saw all colors of little streeks zipping back and forth. looked like a water gun fight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The first time was on December 17, 2002 at 9:00-9:30pm, for about 1 minute while returning from a trip to central Arkansas to my home in Jonesboro, AR.  The 2nd observation was on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2002, again between 9:00 and 9:30 pm with another witness from my parent's backyard in Jonesboro.  I have been thinking about making this report for a long time but, after reading many reports in this database, I had not read any descibing a similar object until this week. Several days ago I read a report of a sighting on 9/25/03 with a similar object described.  Not only that but the sighting was in the same location as my first sighting and at the same time of night.  My first sighting on December 17, 2002 occured as follows:  I was driving north on Hwy. 67 and at about 1 mile southeast of Newport, AR I exited 67 on an offramp to the right and stopped at a stop sign before making a right turn on to hwy 14.  While stopped at the stop sign I looked ahead and slightly up and saw the object about 30 degrees above the horizon and approximately 1 mile away from me.  I am a former private pilot and I would judge the object to have been 300-500 feet above the ground.  The object was moving east to west at a speed so slow my guess is it was about 30 mph or less.  Although I describe it as an object what I actually saw was about 7 or 8 lights.  I had the impression that the lights were attached to an object and may have outlined the shape of it.  I do not recall how many lights there were even after seeing it a second time several weeks later.  The lights were a dim red and steady, not flashing, and the placement of them would outline a football or egg shape.  The outline of the lights was as large as my hand held at arms length.  I do not remember the weather that day or night but the object was well below any cloud ceiling  there would have been.  I watched the object move slowly west for about 1 minute or less (I couldn't hear any sound), made a right turn and continued home on Hwy 14 heading east.  The second sighting of this same (or a similar) object was on Chistmas Eve, December 24, 2002 from my parent's backyard, again at about 9:30pm in Jonesboro, AR.  Again it was to the north of us (another witness was with me) and again it was slowly traveling east to west.  It was slightly further away from me this time and, as a consequence, the red lights were a little dimmer.  I have no doubt that this was the same type of object I had seen two weeks earlier.

I leave for work at 5:10am every workday and was traveling east down Valley Ridge Blvd.  Just a few blocks before reaching I-35,in the southeast,I saw 2 brilliant green orbs with a green teardrop trailing each one heading straight down.  They were not together.... one was lagging behind and to the right(west) of the other one and was slightly smaller. They didnt fizzle out,,, they stayed the same intensity until going below my line of sight. At first I thought, ""Wow!!! That was 2 of the strangest meteors I've ever seen!""  But then as I drove on I got to thinking of the few meteors I've seen in the past and they were always pinpoints of light with a skinny trail mostly bluish white in color.  I've seen some green meteors but they were pinpoints of light with a skinny green trail but these were large... almost like what I'd call ""gas balls"".  I finally convinced myself that it was probably the reflection of the green traffic lights at the intersection that I had just passed because that was the exact color of the objects, but I've gone through that same intersection every workday at near the same time and no reflection looks like what I saw. When I arrived at work I asked if anyone else had seen the green lights but nobody had. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-11-26T00:00:00,33.044733514986376,-97.01126376021797

I was lying in bed listening to C2C AM on my AM/FM alarm clock-radio.  Suddenly, the radio signal was reduced to an annoying ""buzzing/humming"" noise.  I tried cranking the dial up and down on both AM and FM but to no avail.  While I was trying to acquire a signal, I began hearing a ""whirring"" noise in the ambient background.  Unable to find a radio station after several minutes, I gave up and turned my radio off--strangely enough, the digital numbers on my clock still worked and the minutes seemed to pass in a normal time-frame.  Once I had turned the radio off, the ""whirring"" sound became more prevelant.  As soon as I consciously thought about the ""whirring"" sound, I suffered migraine-like pain in my head. As I lay there massaging my temples I suddenly felt a sensation of absolute and total primal fear.  I wish I could describe it better but essentially, the part of my brain that warned my ancestors that they were about to be eaten by a saber-toothed cat fired off at full strength!  I knew that if I moved or turned on my lamp that something ""bad"" was going to happen to me--I've never been that afraid in my life. Maybe three minutes after the migraine ensued, I heard high-performance (military) turbines speeding through the sky at what I estimate to be less than 1,000 feet ASL.  As soon as the jets - I distinctly heard two aircraft - came over the town, the noise, the feeling of dread and the pain ceased immediately.  For the next few minutes, I heard the jets perform a hard climb and then all was silent. I am new to the area I live in and I don't know my neighbors, so I was reluctant to ask strangers about any experiences they may have had that night.  I am a University student, a security expert, and an aircraft enthusiast.  In general, I am fairly skeptical about UFO phenomenon and extra-terrestrials.

At this point it was still to far away but as it headed towards us I could tell it wasn’t a helicopter. I got out of my car and said, ""What the hell is that? That's not a helicopter. He turned and we watched it as it approached us from the south heading north. This was flying disk silver on one side with a black square in the very center of the disk and the other side was black with a silver square in the center. It was flipping end over end like a spiraling football. To the west of us was a hot air balloon, which do always fly in the area during that time of the year. The hot air balloon was barely moving so the disk couldn’t have been a balloon because it was moving at 30-60 miles an hour. It was approx 50-100 feet in diameter and flying about 500-750 ft in the air with out a sound. As soon as it was right above us I ran inside to my company and tried to get the photographer for our company to come outside and take a photo or video of it. I was working for a video dating service at that time. He finally came out as it was off in the distance still spiraling and heading north towards downtown Kansas City. He snapped a couple pictures of the disk with a 35 MM camera as it was heading off in the distance approximately 2 miles away. It was reflecting the light from the sun every time the silver side was pointing up. I watched it for a couple more minutes as it disappeared off in the distance and then went on break. I ran over to my girlfriends parents house and told them what had happened. My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me shortly after this incident.

As a retired USAF aircraft maintenance man I assumed that I was seeing landing lights since we were near the airport, however, they were more intense than I had ever seen and within 30 seconds or so, were near enough that I could distinguish 6 individual lights across the front. We had pulled onto the shoulder as had 2 other cars and were watching as the straight line of lights stopped and the object turned up at an angle and then we could make out a full 3D of a triangle shape that appeared to be larger than a football field. No sounds were heard from the object, however, the radio station I had the car radio set to inexplicably changed on its own to a different station. My wife was telling me to stop totally so she could get a better look, but instead I stepped on the gas and got the heck out of there as did the other 2 cars.

The principal MUFONGA investigators were Olivia Newton, State Section Director for the Lilburn Georgia area, and Jim Clifford, Deputy Director for Georgia Investigations. On 15April03, Peter Davenport, NUFORC Director, contacted this writer, Tom Sheets, SD for MUFONGA. Mr. Davenport made MUFONGA aware of the highly unusual nature of this event and after additional discussion it was decided to have Georgia Field Investigators to probe further into the case. The Newton/Clifford team was contacted by this writer and agreed to proceed in contacting the witness(es) and in visiting the event scene. As stated in the posted NUFORC report, the witnesses are related, two brothers and the wife of one brother, mature adults all. (All three witnesses posted accounts to NUFORC). The primary witness in this case (W-1) lives in the north Georgia area near Atlanta. The FI team met with him and conducted an interview on 30April03. He recounted the occurrence originally posted to NUFORC. The FI's described W-1 as being very serious and intense, holding firm eye-contact with the FI's throughout the interview. W-1 was also concerned with the post-event emotional state of his older brother and wife, since they all felt that their lives had been changed by the event. During detailed questioning, he went on to provide more details; describing the red round objects as being SOLID, and NOT transparent light; about the size of half-dollar coins; no detectable heat or cold seemed to have been produced nor was any odor noticed. The tiny objects were also described as giving off little beam like projections or rays when close to the floorboard, and perhaps numbered as many as fifty. The FI team made arrangements to meet on 5May03 with W-1's older brother (W-2) and his wife (W-3), who reside in Meriwether County. A visit to the scene of the event was also planned. The exact site was easily located on Hwy 41 about four miles south of Greenville. The FIs made photos and inspected the surrounding heavily wooded terrain. No signs of recent passage were noted (knee-high weeds and grass). Only a few houses dot the area. Later interviews with residents of the area turned up no productive leads, but some vague comments came out about ""unusual"" events in town, but with no specifics (this MIGHT (?) be related to the many past UFO reports of the 1990's as described below). FI Newton later visited the Franklin D. Roosevelt Airport in nearby Warm Springs but developed no new information. The W-2 and W-3 interviews were conducted in their Meriwether County residence, which was described by the FIs as a neat rural Georgia home, full of family photos. Interviews were conducted separately, and consisted of recountings of the NUFORC posts. W-2 reiterated that one of the red discs had remained motionless on the very area of his recent colon surgery for about five seconds, while the others continued to whirl about. He later wondered if perhaps this object had possibly destroyed any cancer cells that might have remained after the surgery. W-3 was described as an especially genuine, forthright and honest person. In fact, FI Newton ranked her as one of the best witnesses she'd ever interviewed (and she's interviewed hundreds). W-3 recounted her NUFORC post, and corroborated other details described in this report(s). According to FI Newton, before MUFONGA's involvement in this matter, W-3 was so aggressive in her search for answers, that she automatically undertook chores normally completed by FIs. W-3 visited the Meriwether County Sheriff's Department, the local GBI office (Georgia Bureau of Investigation) and also met with some residents in the sparsely populated area of the event. However nothing was developed. FI Newton concluded that these three witnesses were extremely credible, and NEVER displayed any body language or clusters of kinesic-like signals that would indicate deception of any sort. Newton indicated that these witnesses felt that they were ""chosen"", and were being scanned by these tiny objects for whatever reason. The FI team considered many causes in this case. Ball lightning (especially fragmenting ball lightning ref. Wm. Corliss ""Remarkable Luminous Phenomena in Nature"" GLB9......though the weather was clear and mild); pranksters hiding at the roadside to ambush motorists with laser pointers; automobile deodorizers that exude mist and thus might refract light; natural ""spook"" lights or glowing plasmas and other such things. Due to their large number, bizarre movements, apparent solidity, and the object's close proximity to the witnesses, these mundane explanations were set aside. During his interview, W-2 stated that he may have observed a ""rolling red phenomenon"" just outside the window of the vehicle in the instant before the tiny objects appeared inside, but it was so brief he could comment no further. FI Newton discussed this case in depth with a local physicist and two geologists. These learned scholars could provide no helpful information other than what we already knew. The Sheriff of Meriwether County served as a police SWAT/Medic and was an associate when this writer was Chief of Police in College Park Georgia. This writer discussed the case with him. He had received no similar reports, but advised that he would contact MUFONGA ASAP if anything turned up. The Sheriff's brother is also a GBI Agent and an associate of this writer and would likewise forward any information obtained via his channels. As indicated by FI Newton, it should be noted that a very short distance south of the event scene is Warm Springs Georgia, the site of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ""Little White House"". FDR spent much time there in the 1930's and 1940's due to the geothermal springs and their reputed healing qualities for polio victims. FDR passed away there in 1945. While such unusual geology is found in a few places around the USA, it is unknown if such terrain might somehow be connected to this case. It should also be noted that the area of the Georgia-Alabama state line experienced a 4.9 magnitude earthquake at 4:59AM on 29April03, 16 days after the Meriwether County event. The quake location was at 34.51N 85.60W placing it about 30 miles NW of Rome Georgia, which would make the quake center an estimated 130 miles or so NNW of Meriwether County. The Brevard Fault line begins some miles north of Lagrange George, running NE toward South Carolina. Several major newspapers in the southeast, including the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, picked up the case from this writer's ""MUFONGA Updates"" and printed the story of the investigation and these confidential witnesses. The by-lines referred to the event area as ""BOOGER BOTTOM"" due to our informal name for that vicinity. FI Newton, along with W-3, discovered that the local residents used that term when referring to the area. The term was originated long ago when illegal liquor was manufactured in these woods, and the ""moonshiners"" wanted such a connotation to hopefully keep revenue agents (!) and other trespassers away. The term ""Booger Bottom"" DOES NOT refer to any ""portal area"", anomalous zone etc. It's strictly a local nickname for the above stated reasons. In fact, a bestselling book and major motion picture, ""Murder in Coweta County"", starring Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith, somewhat illustrates how the area got it's name.........a true tale of moonshine and murder. The moonshiner and murderer, John Wallace, owned and lived in the area known as ""Booger Bottom."" During the inquiry, we also received several citizen emails describing this ""true to life"" legend. Additional Notes- Meriwether County is on the eastern side (and considered an outlying part) of an area once known nationally by Ufologists as the ""Troup-Heard UFO Corridor"". From about the mid-1980's through the late 1990's there were perhaps as many UFO reports received from this area as in Pine Bush N.Y. or Gulf Breeze Florida or even the ""Mysterious Valley"" of the southwestern USA. This writer and especially my associate, former SD John Thompson, spent much time through the late 90's investigating these cases. While this report is not the place to recount these events, it should be noted that the area WAS, and perhaps remains, one of those localities that has an abundance of UFOs, unknown entities, and other paranormal type occurrences. FI Newton has commented that throughout the many weeks of this investigation, the witness' accounts have remained consistent......from their NUFORC postings to their ""sit-down"" interviews, including conversations with this writer and even during a national radio/Internet broadcast with Jeff Rense and Peter Davenport........consistent one and all. As it now stands, MUFON of Georgia believes these citizens encountered multiple unknown anomalous objects, up close and personal, on Georgia Hwy. 41 on 13April03. A report regarding this investigation is also to be filed in MUFON's ""World UFO Database"". MUFONGA would like to thank Peter Davenport for passing this case to us for additional investigation.

I am not sure if i have the site for what i have to say but if i don't get it off of my chest i am going to go mad. About 3am on sunday 5th october, my shift partner and i get a call to check out a disturbance on the Tintagel/Boscastle road. Report indicated a motorist had passed an area close to the Boscastle end and had seen a lot of flickering light beyond the main road. Normally around this time of year we get reports of this nature because of the sale of fireworks everywhere during the build up to Guy Fawkes night. Kids somehow get hold of them and can be a real pain causing all sorts of problems and sometimes fires due to misuse. We headed toward the area from the south and arrived at 03:35 approx. About a quarter of a mile before Boscastle we pulled into a small parking area opposite a tea-house on the main road. By the tea-house there is  a small gathering of houses/buildings all which were in darkness. We started to walk up the main road toward Boscastle, but after walking for five minutes my partner called my attention to the area back toward the tea-house. Above the visible horizon at the back of the tea-house we observed low level flickering of amber/white light. So we turned and headed back toward the tea-house. We then continued to walk up along side the tea-house in the direction of the lights. After passing a few more buildings the path sloped downward toward a wooded area. As we approached the the wooded area the flickering was still visible just above the outline of the treetops. We followed the path along crossing a small stream and heading further in to the woods. After about ten minutes we could see that some of  the trees ahead were being lit up by dim flashes of light so we carried on toward these trees. I think we were both expecting to find a bunch of drunk teenagers fooling around with fireworks as in years gone by but it was not the case. I was first to see what looked like round white lights moving at all kinds o! f speeds in and around the trees. We walked another ten yards or so then stopped and crouched down by a large fallen tree to asses the situation. Each ball of light was a little larger than a tennis ball and they way they flew reminded me of the way a fly does with no true path of flight, they were all over the place. I tried to count them but it was very difficult due to the speed and way they were flying but i think there must have been around 40 of them.After another ten minutes a few of the balls flew in the same direction just inches above the ground toward one end of the area in which they had been flying and seemed to join up making a larger ball of light which intensified and hovered in that one area. Looking at the ball of light i could make out 7 black specks in a circle in the center. These black specks started to rotate and the light got brighter and was too bright too look at. I looked away from the main ball and back to the flying smaller ones. Each of these had intensified also and went beserk, flying at incredible speeds in such an enclosed area. I could hear the noise of leaves being sucked into the air when they flew inches from the ground. My partner shifted his position and broke a branch on the fallen tree with his arm making a loud crack. Immediately the lights stopped and rose to tree top height and then, a few at a time quickly faded out light a headlight going off until there were none left. We heard continueous cracking of branches high up and moving away from us through the woods. I got quite unsettled and insisted that we return to the car though my partner insisted that we examine the area with our torches. In the leaves were trenches and spirals and small piles of sticks. Some areas had earth scooped out with more twigs and sticks in piles around these areas. All the while in the distance we could hear the sound of breaking branches and i was feeling really not good about being there so i shouted at my partner now was the time to leave. We returned to our car. I don't know w! hat the hell it was. Surely ufo's are big things these were tiny. We have not reported the incident and i have not even told my wife and my partner does not want to talk about it either. I don't even know why the hell i have typed all this here as i don't feel any better for it.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,,

This is a personal journal entry taken from the week following the sighting. May 27, 2002. It’s been a long time and much has happened. Firstly I should report that on Tuesday, May 21, 2002 I had three separate UFO sightings. It was garbage night at around ten thirty. The evening was clear, cloudless and refreshing. I was looking up at the stars and moon, as I often do on when it’s nice, making my last trip down the driveway with the blue box in tow. Up towards Mount Hope Airport I saw six lights, two triangles fat side first, coming as a unit towards the house at an indistinguishable height. They immediately got my attention because they were nothing like any airplane lights I had ever seen. As, what I thought to be a plane approached I observed that the lights were all the same color; orange, dim and larger than I usually see on planes at night around here. As it passed over head I became even more fascinated (perplexed) because the plane made no sound. The lights were indeed close enough that I should hear sound, and in fact, they were close enough that I should be able to see a shape or silhouette of some sort. Yet there was none of that either. In fact, I could see right between the lights to the stars beyond. Now I was transfixed and as it went a little farther the light pattern of two triangles rearranged themselves,  scattering into a haphazard pattern indicating to me that this wasn’t one plane but six individual units. I was pretty freaked out but surprisingly less than I would have thought. I made some phone calls (two to a very unappreciative friend because his daughter was asleep (jerk!)) and then went out front to have another look. I called my brother with my portable phone but wound up talking with his wife because he was at the Leaf game. I didn’t bother mentioning to her what I was calling about because of the subject matter. As I was rapping up the call I saw another one. This was a singular, orange, dim light (same as the others) coming diagonally from across the street, perpendicular to my house, and going west. It was a spot of light too fast for a plane but! too slow for the steak of a shooting star. It was strange talking to someone but not being able to tell them. Then finally, after I got off the phone I saw the last one. It was a line of three horizontal lights (same as the others) traveling on a similar path as the first but a little more west.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,43.23776070381232,-79.86514418377321

On a cloudless, moonless early morning back-roads drive from Morehead City, NC, to the Outer Banks on June 30, 2003 we observed at about 60 degrees up in the northeast sky a bluish-whitish glowing ragged line of light in the shape of a large ""W"" lying on its side, with the tops of the ""W"" facing east.  Connecting the tops of the ""W"" in the shape of a semi-circle which looped below the entire ""W"" was a fainter light of the same color.  The entire image measured roughly ten times the size of the moon when similarly positioned at other times of the month. We pulled off the road and got out our camera equipment, checking to see if clouds had developed in other areas of the night sky.  Other than the unusual blue trail of light, we saw only clear sky and bright stars from horizon to horizon.   By the time I dialed in the proper settings on my camera equipment, the light's intensity had diminished by roughly half, and I was able to capture only a few faint images.  By this time, the ""W"" had begun to dissipate by expanding outwards from the center in a uniform manner. Curiously, the trails of light did not behave as a jet contrail would behave as it is blown apart by high winds, with the entire trail moving down the sky uniformly as it disperses.  This ""W"" shaped light simply expanded out from the center, with the trails of light growing wider and fainter in intensity, until the entire image was no longer visible.  We continued our drive back to Kill Devil Hills, where as we were unloading the car at around 3am we observed the same configuration of lights in the same location of the sky.  This time I was able to capture images immediately.  I also took a picture of the only clouds in the sky we were able to find -- due south along the horizon.  There was a distinct difference in the appearance of the clouds versus the ""W"" light -- in other words, the ""W"" light did not have the same characteristics as the clouds on the horizon. Over the following 20 minutes, we observed the ""W"" light as it dissipated just as the earlier sighting had.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,35.8144,-76.7201

Walking along Canyon Road facing east, I sighted a pink-white oval canted down at left, up at right.  It seemed to be 2000 to 3000 feet above ground level, moving slowly toward me at elevation, and then began rising slowly.  I had a digital camera with me and proceeded to snap some photos, and one movie mode clip, on two separate memory cards.  The object seemed to color shift from more white to more pink, then darker pink, as it rose up into some cloud cover.  I had observed the clouds being formed earlier.  They were a combination of jet contrails/chemtrails that had fanned out into cloud, and some fast forming 'popcorn' clouds which seemed to come out of nowhere to become thicker, more dense cloud along with the jet trails.  The object changed its attitude from low at left side, to low at the right side and high at the left, in other words it became pitched in the opposite direction.  it also seemed to change size and clarity, not with respect to rising and becoming smaller, but as it entered the cloud cover it became smaller and more like a bright point of light than an oval shape.  This is also the point at which its attitude pitched over the other way, as described above.  As it rose up into the cloud cover it changed to a double oval shape, still pitched, with the lower oval magenta in color, the upper one pale yellow with a green luminous fringe, and the two ovals were separated by about half their thickness by two or three balls of dark blue color.  Size of the object was small, perhaps 1/10 of my thumb width held out at arm's length.  I had paused to take the photos, but as I had filled both camera memory cards, I put away the gear and continued walking east on Canyon Road.  The object had risen above the cloud cover, reaching a height over 30,000 feet, and became lost.  It never really stood completely still, and rose vertically and moved horizontally mostly to the west and south, but in no regular pattern, only that of its own apparent making.  It made no sound.  One aircraft! was seen flying near the object near the end of the sighting, but I had already filled the memory cards.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,45.4835597,-122.8374352

Three couples have reported seeing green lights in the area where the ladies had the missing time. Although this sighting report is a bit earlier in July, we still may have a connection to the whole case.  I saw in mid- July may have left evidence of some sort if you would like to look into it further.  Sometime in the middle of July 2003 before I went to bed I smoked a cigarette on my back balcony facing I think SW looking towards the mountains behind my house. It was around midnight and I seen this bright neon green light lighting up the base of the mountain moving slowly along. There is rolling hills directly behind my house. Behind those hills a draw with ponds up those hills complete grass until it reaches a mountain same parallel as Black Mountain that is the ridge I am talking about but behind black mountain towards the back country in the direction of Ellison  more it is hard to explain. Anyways this bright green light moved around level with where the trees would about be.  This light I saw was not too high in the sky. I kept watching it didn't know what it was figure a UFO again.  Weird thing  at 2 am that morning sirens woke me up and I was very disturbed so I went outside for a cigarette and it looked like a huge forest fire coming towards my house, flames in the air and I couldn't tell how far away the fire was so I woke up my boyfriend and we started running around wetting everything down.  Later that morning my hubby went to work, no sleep sadly, and he drove down Lahka Rd to see how far fire was away. About 5 acres away we estimated. Strangely enough these fires started way back away from the roads, way up the hill pass the houses in the middle of a grass field up towards the mountain.(the night I saw that green Light!)  I  have kept wondering how the fire could have started because it really was an odd spot to start. There was no lightening that night either. Clear sky. Never heard about this huge grass fire on the news! (dumpster fires make the news) My neighbors didn't even know the fire happened! I know the previous week to this fire that someone through a carelessly discarded cigarette into a ditch off Mackenzie rd not far from here but I was thinking that maybe you might want to just take a walk up to those fields that were burnt and have a look.  Or ask the fire dept if they know the cause of  that  fire. Interesting. Fire was basically on Lakha Rd or Latta Rd (Lakha turns in Latta after a little ways)but way way up the hill where there is no road. You can see the 2 large burnt patches if you are driving down Hwy 97 towards Kelowna just a little ways past airport look at the hills on left hand side before you reach the Old Vernon Rd set of lights.Or turn up Old Vernon Rd and look straight. Well I thought I would share this with you in case someone else may have witnessed that green light and then big grass fire the same night.   oh, that light by the way was not a plane. I see planes all the time because I live quite close to airport.  This did not move like a plane and it was not a helicopter( too dark for a chopper and it would not be out at 12 am) I would have heard it for sure because sound carries well out where I live.

A witness called today from Ontario to make a report of a sighting he and his wife had witnessed. The husband and wife had just got back from their son's ball game, his son had caught a ride home with his friends. When the couple arrived home and were going about their business, they noticed none of the telephones were working in the house. The fellow wanted to contact the phone company, but of course couldn't. He wondered if the phone in the barn might be working so he headed outside and was on his way to the barn, looking up through the Pine trees and across the highway when he saw an extremely bright white light. The witness said it was so bright that he could not even look at it without placing his hand up in front of him. At the point where he first noticed it, the light was approx: a kilometer away coming from the west and his neighbors farm.  The witness mentioned to me that after he first spotted it the first thing that popped into his head was ""camera"". Although due to being fascinated with the object he soon forgot about the camera. He ran back up from the barn area and banged on his home's door to catch his wife's attention. When she ask what was going on, he said to her, 'you have to come out and see this"".  He explained that he is not a man who gets rattled very easy, but what he had witnessed did shake it up a lot.  When the object came up close to his property it was not traveling very fast at all and had four bright white lights at the front of it and one red light in the middle, or center of the craft. He also said as bright as the lights were, they did not illuminate any of the surrounding area. He and his wife both thought it looked like a boomerang in shape. Also the fellow said it looked as if something was sticking out of the front of it. As the object left their property moving into the distance they lost sighting of the bright lights, but they did say the lights which were at the front of the craft were still lighting up the front end of it. (HBCC UFO Note: The witness said when he first saw it he thought it was landing lights on a large jet aircraft. He also wondered if it was going to crash due to it being at such a low altitude and no airport close by). There was also sound heard coming from the object. A very low rumbling sound to it, like a throbbing sound. As he pointed out, that if it was a normal aircraft and being as low as it was. The sound would have knocked his socks off due to it being very loud. But it wasn't like this at all. The object itself was dark or blackish in color. The fellow gave a ""guess"" at what the size may have been, using his home as reference of 74 feet long. He figured the distance between the first light to the second may have been roughly 70 feet in distance. So between the first light and the last the approx: distance would have been just over 200 feet. This would have been how wide the object was, or appeared to be.  Hopefully the other witnesses across the lake will talk with me over what they saw, which was the same object.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

No sound was heard due to them being in their home, plus HBCC UFO estimates the light was at a great distance away from the witnesses. No aircraft were visible around the area at the time of the sighting. No tail was seen traveling behind the light. The light was moving in an northeasterly direction.  HBCC UFO ""thinks"" this may have been a meteor that the folks witnessed. Thank you to the witnesses for their report.

I talked with both these witness to watched this event. Two friends were outside sitting around enjoying the night and a cold drink. Both men told me they saw what they thought was a very bright star stationary in the sky. They never gave it a thought so they just sat chatting and scanned the stars. When one of them looked over towards where they spotted the star, it was moving very quickly in their direction. At this point of the sighting, both sat up and took notice and watched as this bright white light got bigger the closer it got to them. A guess by the witness would have placed the light/object approx: 1/4 mile away when it suddenly turned to the south and flew off at an incredible rate of speed. (HBCC UFO Note: When the light/object changed direction the color of it changed from bright white to a dull orange).The men said they may have watched it for approx: 45 seconds at the most. Now looking back at the event, they wishes they had of kept their eyes on it when it was first spotted. But then they did not think much of it at the time. No sound was heard, and like both of them said. If it had of been an aircraft they certainly would have heard it as it being so close, and so low.  Thank you to the witnesses for the report.

This is a follow-up to the St. Mary's Lake, B.C. sighting which was reported to Mr. Peter Davenport at the NUFORC An additional witness interviewed.  I telephoned another witness tonight over the July 27, 2003 sighting in the Kimberly/St. Mary's Lake area. The witness reported to me that she was in bed, and couldn't sleep due to the warm temperatures outside. Her bedroom blinds were up and the window fully open and then she gave out a cry, ""holy cow"". Their home is up on a large hill which gives them a very good view of the surrounding area. The witness suddenly noticed, what she thought was a bright star or maybe an airplane coming in with it's landing lights on because it was moving at this point. The lady mentioned that it was extremely large in size and flying very low. Actually the witness just laid their waiting to see a green and red light, thinking it was certainly an aircraft coming down the St. Mary's Valley heading in to land at the near-by airport. She told me that the airplanes take the route down the St. Mary's Valley when heading to Vancouver and back to Kimberly B.C.  The lady still laying there and watching the bright white light moving faster as it grew closer. All of a sudden it started maneuvering in a zig zag pattern. At this point in the sighting, where she could not see it anymore she jumped out of bed and headed toward her bedroom door, opened it and ran through her cottage styled home until she reached her front door of her home. The time she unlocked her front door and stepped outside the light was gone. I mentioned to this witness after taking her report about the 8 witnesses who saw a ray of light over the Jaffray, B.C. area which I reported on. She told me the light/object was traveling southeast from Kimberly, B.C. and would have flown straight over Jaffray, B.C. (HBCC UFO Note: What makes this interesting is that we are finding more witnesses to the sighting which was originally reported to Peter Davenport at the NUFORC. Plus other people who witnessed the ray of light and the object itself. From what I am gathering is that the light/object may have caused the ray of light. But of course this is a guess on my behalf. I was also contacted by a very kind person today who read my report and told me of another witness who had made a posting at a UFO forum board and explained to everyone about this ray of light, same location, different witness. This lady also took pictures of the light ray and I am now trying to track her down so I can give her a phone call to gather more information on this whole event.

A nice lady (a grandma) called me and told me that she and her grandchildren were having a camp out of their patio as it was a beautiful warm night on July 27, 2003. She went on to say she had a very strange experience and saw something she could not explain. They have a large deck which faces south. Due to her having some trouble sleeping the lady awoke and around 2:00 a.m. and wondered around her deck looking up at the starry night sky. As she faced the south and looked up over a valley just west of town she spotted something very large. From her advantage point it looked about cup size. The witness said the object looked like a disc, or wheel shaped standing on it's edge. She also added it looked as if the object was cut into six section. Just like as if you were to cut 6 or 8 pieces of pie (6 or 8 triangular shaped pieces).  There were lights running around the object, all white in color. The lady also said there were a good number of lights on it, but was not sure just how many there were. She also believes the lights were moving around the object. There was no sound heard coming from the unknown and her thoughts were whatever it was, was not all that far away from their property.  The object sat stationary, it did not move. Using some of the structures on their deck to keep track of the object,  she eventually said it started moving but very slowly, but faster than any of the nighttime stars, etc.. After a period of time, the object disappeared.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

He put the torch on the fence and lit it. The wax of the torch was on fire so we wondered if we should blow it out or leave it burn. As I was looking at the fire I noticed two balls of light in the sky, it was still daylight. They appeared to be close, only feet apart and not moving. They appeared to be at the same altitude. The light on the right, as I was looking up from my lawn chair, turned into a silver triangle in the sky then as it flew away it turned from silver to black and the ball of light on the left seemed to follow it,  it disappeared. It just vanished.  After about fifteen minuets I told my cousin and his friend. I was embarassed to tell them right away.

I stepped outside onto the patio facing south. I looked up thinking to myself that the stars were so bright and pretty. I also remarked allowed to myself ""Well Lord, the stars are still in the sky"". At that moment I saw what I thought at first to be a falling star. However, what at first appeared to be a star, was extremely bright bluish white. It appeared to be coming directly at me very fast, then turned east while at the same time coming closer. Then, all of a sudden the 'star' grew in size, appearing like an irregular oval-shaped rock, still bright, but appearing to be sort of 'bumping' going slightly up an down, slightly losing speed, toppling/rolling over, and leaving behind a bluish white trail (similar to a chem trail). Then the object disappeared instantaneously. I stood there trying to memorize exactly what I saw. My first analysis was that it was probably a meteor/asteroid? I also expected to hear something about a meteor thumping into some farmers field. Nothing.

At first I thought construction workers at night, as there was a new subdivision with new construction and development equipment left at night. outside.  I did not see any construction workers about or movement of construction equipment or hear any such sounds. I felt very mesmerized by the three round lights at a nearby distance above the ground level. They stayed on bright white round and in a triangle formation very steady and not appearing to move at all.  I was expecting them to move....and entertained thoughts of them moving together in triangle formation or splitting off in different directions...which did not happen at all as I looked for what seemed to be a very long time straight on at the lights.  They seemed very, very bright and facing  toward the road and the van and me.

When these thoughts clicked in my head I decided I had been looking at these lights much too long, what seemed like 10-15 minutes and I did not want to see them anymore or entertain thoughts of them moving, turning off,  following me, etc. so I decided to quickly drive off away to my campsite in Long Canyon instead. I fel! t that I had come to the desert to live and challenge myself to ""face my fears""...and I became too scared and drove off instead.

As I write this, it is almost seven years since the events described actually happened.  They left such a deep and disturbing impression that I still think about them from time to time, as I have never heard an adequate explanation.  I discovered this website while searching for something, anything that might have come to light in the intervening years, and felt compelled to add my account, as it includes some additional items that I haven’t seen reported by anyone else.  On the evening of March 13, 1997 I was camping just outside of Prescott, AZ, in the forest near Hidden Valley Dr.  There was a campsite nearby that was closed for the season, but my tent was outside of the campground area, on a hill I would estimate to be about a half-mile from Highway 89.  Just after 8:00 PM, I noticed several lights in the sky off to the West-Northwest.  I assumed at first that they were airplane lights, as they seemed to be the usual colors of red, green, and white, but they seemed to be moving somewhat erratically (hovering and bobbing in the air), and I got the impression there was something generally weird about them.  The colored light they were casting seemed to project in much stronger beams than I have ever seen from an airplane, and they seemed to be rotating and changing colors from a common source, rather than the clearly separate lights that airplanes have.  I recall that there were two of these objects, but there may have been more that I dismissed as airplanes before noticing the oddness of the lights.  At around this same time, I saw first two, then three lights off in the trees to the Southwest.  At first I had thought they were the eyes of an animal, God only knows how I could have thought that, but then I noticed the third light, and also noticed that they seemed to be pulsating, growing dimmer and brighter by turns.  These lights appeared to be very low to the ground, somewhere amongst the trees and evidently some distance away.  As all this was going on, and I was getting generally freaked out, while I was looking in the direction of the red/green/white lights, I saw a chevron formation of five very bright white lights appear out of the West-Northwest sky.  This formation banked towards the South, and flew directly overhead.  I was observing this from just inside the tent, with the opening facing Northwest (I was already pretty badly frightened by this point, and had gotten into the tent for security), so I lost sight of them after they passed overhead.  I cannot really make a decent guess as to their altitude, or how fast they were moving--from the time I saw them to the time they passed overhead was less than half a minute, so I had the impression they were moving pretty fast, and at the time (having seen them from a great distance off) I assumed they were at high altitude, but descending as I watched.  My impression was that they were five separate objects, although they remained in perfect formation when they performed the banking maneuver.  I believe these particular lights passed over at around 8:15.  They made absolutely no sound.  This brief sighting of five lights flying in a ""V"" was my only glimpse of what is now called the ""Phoenix Lights.""  For several hours, however, I continued to observe a number of strange things in the sky, including the red/green/white lights, several lights that I would have thought were stars if they had not been moving in jerks and starts in random directions, and at one point what appeared to be a circle of orange light (pretty much the color of fire) passing through the sky from East to West, also without any sound.  I was so exhausted that night that I eventually fell asleep despite all the bizarre things in the sky.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,34.63572068965517,-112.5686275862069

Almost 7 years ago my friend and I had been out riding in the woods outside of Libby, Montana, about 4 miles up Pipe Creek Road.  We had stopped so that I could take a nature break and as I got out of the pickup I notice an odd kind of light in the sky just north of our position. The light had a fuzzy apearance as if it were a real bright, but seemed to have a creamy skin surrounding it.The object wasn't really bright like a star would be and I couldn't tell just how  far away or  how  high it was in the sky.  I hadn't seen anything like it before but know it wasn't  a star or a planet and when I said to my friend, ""Hey, check out that weird fuzzy light in the  sky.""  It  moved slowly in behind a tree.The tree blocked our view of the object but I told him to keep looking  at the  upper part of  the tree  thinking that it would appear on the other side of the tree as it passed in the direction that it was moving  but it didn't come out the other side .It apeared to me to be hiding out of plain view from us.I had a feeling that this was something that maybe didn't want to be seen.As we continued to focus on the tree for about 30 seconds or so,it  shot off from behind the tree in a southern direction so fast that it apeared to leave a streak across the sky.I asked my friend if he had seen it and if he had ,what direction it went, he said  ""south"" and  I knew then that I wasn't seeing things .He  asked me what the hell was that? and I said  it was the light that I had seen when I first got out of the truck. I really  can't say how big it was norit's altitude. It  seemed to  hover silently and then instantly travel  in a  southern direction at a very high rate of speed. Nothing I know of can move that fast from a standstill to instant  acceleration. We talked  about it  to ourselves for a few days and then I heard about the major sighting in Phoenix,Arizona via an Art Bell broadcast a few days later. I'm not too sure if it had  anything to do with the Arizona sighting but it was on the same night and  right arround the same time of that  event. I did look on a map and Libby Montana is  almost due North of Phoenix so there may be something  to this sighting that connects the two together.There is also a hydroelectric dam about 15 miles  north of where we were so it may have been of intrest to the object.I do appologise for my late entry of this sighting but feel that it may be helpfull in some way, Sincerly, ((name deleted)), Libby, Montana  ps: I Do Believe we are not alone ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness via telephone, and he sounds quite credible to me.

We watched it for a while and wondered if it was a sightseeing helicopter as it had been moving slowly back and forth high over the water along the coast off Esquimalt harbour. The more we stared at it the more we thought it was strange. Light seemed to be emanating from it. It didn't seem so far away that details wouldn't be visable yet we could make none out. It slowly began to move away from the shore out over the straight. It hovered  for a few more minutes almost directly in front of where we were standing. I waived at the object as it seemed to be watching us and the second I did that it streaked accross the sky at a speed neither of us had ever seen and then in a white flash it was gone. It disapeared. I saw the light flash and the object vanish well before it reached the south eastern horizon. It made no sound.,2004-03-02T00:00:00,48.456685618166524,-123.38397199327164

It seemed strange, and everything around us seemed still, no other people around.

It kind of spooked her... and later, her youngest sister (aorund 20 yrs. old) told us she'd had a dream about my wife and i walking by some water somewhere and there was a ufo involved somehow, which adds an extra wrinkle to the story i reckon.

These lights were too high to be airplanes, and they weren't fireworks, missiles from submarines, rockets from Cape Canaveral, or fighter jets issued by Patrick Airforce Base (which is down the road) because it was too high for any of these objects to be.

It was a nice day, and I casually looked up at the cloudless sky as I was at my car, and noticed a weird craft a few hundred feet in the air.  I initially thought it may have been a rod. But from what I have heard, rods are extremely fast, and this thing was just slowly coasting through the sky.  I could cleary see the shape, and it was cylindrical, with what appeared to be two small fins at the very end.  There was absolutely no sound, and definitely a complete absence of what could be wings. It was white in color and I saw no lights. But in the daytime I probably wouldn't be able to see them anyway. I watched this object as it approached me, flew directly overhead, and gradually veered off making a slight curve until I could no longer see it.  It took about five minutes from the time I initially saw this thing before it faded out of view.  A plane could never move that slow. But don't get me wrong, there is no doubt in my mind that this thing was not a plane. As I stated before, there were no wings. I do not want to speculate about what it may have been, so I figured I would report it to you, and you can compare it to other reports you may have received.  Also, as I walked back into the mall a few minutes after I could no longer see the object, I noticed a helicopter flying in the same general dircetion as the object I saw.

Each wing starts off straight, but then is bent upwards around the mid-length of the wing and then bent downwards to form two sides of a triangle. The under side of the wings(the part I could see) appeared to have what looked like veins that emmitted a low intencity green light. The light intencity from the craft was not strong enough to overcome the light intencity of our street lights in our parking lot. Using buildings and trees as a heighth and width reference I would say that the craft was flying at 60-100 Ft. off the ground. The wing span I would estimate at being 40-60 Ft. in length.

There were traveling from west to east heading out over the Atlantic Ocean.  I didn't see them until they were directly overhead the beach. They appeared to be flying at about the same level as the lowest cloud tops. It was a mostly clear night, but a few puffy clouds were scattered about the sky. The moon was lighting up the beach.  I pointed them out to my wife and said, ""Look at those things flying in formation."" She said, ""That's just a plane."" Then I said, ""No. That's four separate objects flying in a line, wing tip to wing tip.""  Then I watched as the left end object swung out wide from the formation and then shortly thereafter rejoined the formation exactly where it had been. The wing tips were exactly spaced between the objects and the speed was exactly the same for all of the objects. If those were airplanes I had never seen the bottom of airplanes glow in a soft white light and the shape was not an airplane shaped even a reflection off of an airplane would not look like that.  The flying objects stayed in a perfect line formation, wing tip to wing tip and suddenly faded into the blackness of space a few seconds after the left wing object rejoined the formation. I will never forget it. I had never seen anything like it. I am 51 years old. My wife was 45 years old at the time.  I will never forget the soft white glow crossing the dark sky directly overhead. I didn't get scared or anything. There were lots of people out on the beach that night. But I don't know if anyone else looked up to see what we saw.

At about 5:00 AM on Sunday morning July 27 2003 my family and I were driving south on Hwy. 77 heading toward south texas. We had just passed the Nebraska/Kansas line and were a mile or two north of Marysville Kansas. (1/2 mile north of a railroad crossing). I was driving the car and everyone was awake. My wife was in the front passenger seat. My three kids were in the back seat. One of my kids said, ""What is that?"" I had seen the object but it had not registered in my mind as anything but an airport beacon. Every one in the car became aware of the object and saw it pass the car. The first thing we saw was a very bright blue/white flash south south east of the car (We were traveling south at about 65 miles per hour). In an incomprehensibly short amount of time (1-3 seconds, I would lean toward 1 second) it passed the car flashing 3-4 times. The object disapeared north north east of the car behind us. The first flash seemed to be the brightest and the last the dimmest. I had to snap my head over my left shoulder to see the 3rd of the 3 flashes that I saw. I thought it was an airport beacon but I realized that it passed way too fast for it to be a stationary object. We watched road reflectors pass the car and estimated that the object passed the car at least 5 times as fast as one of those and they are only on the edge of the road. This happened so fast that we could not tell how far away the object was. It was above the horizon but when we went back through the same area a week later we figured it must have been just above the tree line (perhaps 35-40 degrees above level ground). This still does not indicate the actual distance to the object. It has occured to me that the object could be one of those lights associated with earthquake activety but beyond that it was quite beyond my explaination. Fort Riley is just south of Marysville but a military aircraft would have had to be very close to pass us that fast and we did not hear anything.

I would not have given it much though except that it was so large and bright.  I watched it as I drove looking for some type of support like a pole underneath it or perhaps an aircraft above it.  I reached a point where there were no trees in the way of my view and I saw for the first time that it was hanging in midair completely independent.  Intrigued I pulled my car over to the side of the road, got out, and tried to make sense of what I was seeing.  It was a ball of light, about the color of an florescent light bulb only a bit whiter and much brighter; and when I say ball I mean a 3 dimensional object in the form of a sphere, and it was as far as I could tell a perfect ball shape, no flaws apparent, very vivid, very well focused, sharp edged sphere. The color was uniform through out its surface except for a small patch of orange on the bottom. You know how when you look at an incandescent light bulb you can see the filament burning inside of the clear or frosted glass? Well it was nothing like that.  The light was even through out, almost as though it WAS light.  The object made no sound, it did not change in intensity, there were no sparks, no fumes, no smoke, no windows, no antenna, no landing gear.  I could not tell it's size but I know it was big.I could hold my hand out in font of me at arms length and cover about 90% of the object. I didn't have the slightest bit of fear, I was to busy taking it all in.  Every fiber of my being told me that what I was witnessing COULD NOT BE HAPPENING.  I spent the entire time determining what it was not, and believe me  I wanted it to be something I could identify, but it was not.   1. it was NOT an airplane 2. it was NOT a balloon 3. it was NOT a helicopter a) if it was a helicopter with a spotlight pointed at me, then they would have had to be pointing the light directly at me and continued to point it at me until it went out of sight because the light never became an ellipse.  It maintained its circular (actually spherical) shape for the entire observation; plus I never heard a sound. 4. it was Not burning swamp gas a) it would seem to me that if it were a gas then it would have been some irregular ever changing shape as it would be unconfined. 5. it was NOT Venus, a meteor, or a re-entry / launch 6. It was NOT the moon. 7. I don't think it was ""Balled Lightning"" what ever that is. I don't know if it can exist on a clear, and calm summer night; but it just seems as if it could not have been so large and so steady then move slowly away without a perceivable change in color or intensity. 8. It was NOT a satellite. a) it was not viewable the next night same time/place; b) it filled a full four inches of my field of view, c) it did NOT appear to ""move along"" with me as I traveled south. I started out looking forward towards the object. Then saw it through a break in the tree line and it was right beside me.  By the time I pulled over (half a mile later) it was slightly behind me. 9. It was NOT built by McDonnell Douglas.  I observed the object for about 2 minutes then it moved slowly away from my line of sight toward the East until I could no longer see it.  This is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me in my 36 years. It was real, and I will never forget one moment of it.

The story is real but the names in this report are fictitious for obvious reasons.  Pat - Driver of the car. Linda - Passenger and friend.  Date:  July 31, 2003 (Thursday) Time:  Between 1:00 a.m. & 2:00 a.m.  Today, Monday - August 18, 2003 I received a telephone call from Pat who lives in Kelowna, British Columbia. The lady was very upset and had a time speaking of the event that took place with her and a close female friend of hers. She told me today that a friend had brought over a newspaper article which was run in the Kelowna Capital Newspaper. The headline read ""Seeking Witnesses to UFO."" which showed up on August 15, 2003.  Here is her story.  She tells that her and her friend are having a very hard time dealing with what took place. Also another couple who live in the area watched an aerial craft hovering close to the location where the two ladies had parked there car at the side of the highway and gave confirmation to the incident, or at least witnessed an object.  At approx: 12:05 a.m., July 31, 2003 the two ladies were playing around on the computer when Linda said, we haven't done any star gazing in a long time....so Pat the lady who contacted me said, you're right, lets go out and do some star gazing. They left home at 12:05 a.m. heading out to an area where they would get a look at the clear night sky without having lights to obscure their view. Pat drove to Glenmore which is north from where she lives and is on the back road heading to Winfield from Kelowna, B.C.  They were driving along and Pat reported that there was quite a bit of traffic for that time of the night but after they decided to stop just off to the side of the road to see what they might notice, the traffic stopped coming. There was not a light from any vehicles, not anything other than a very dark stretch of road. Pat grabbed her flashlight and shone it into the sky as she has done this in the past. Her friend Linda has the binoculars on the other side of the car scanning the starry night sky. They were there only a minute out of the car when her Linda said, this is really strange. There are three stars up in the sky and formed into a triangle shape. All three lights at this time were solid white. Both ladies watched as the three white lights started moving, but moving together. The witness with the binoculars said stars don't do that, and Pat replies, of course not..... as she thought it may have been a plane or something. Linda replies, no this is not a plane as the lights were changing color to a neon green and the object had stopped and hovered just ahead of their car.  Pat turned the headlights off, and shone her flashlight down the road in front of her car. They were worrying about animals such as a bear, cougars, etc.. being around in this isolated area. As she shone the light up the road both of the women spotted something which frightened them a lot. Five sets of eyes staring at approx: 40 feet away from them. As frightened as they were, their first thoughts were of coyotes or some other wild animal, but she said once you really look your brain takes it in.  Pat describes the creatures as being roughly four feet tall, dark gray shoulders and coming towards the women. Pat said ""I was so scared I could hardly talk and could hardly breathe"". She yelled to her friend Linda, ""get in the car, get in the car"". Pat said they both scrambled to get back into the vehicle but she said it was like moving through quicksand and it felt horrible. Being so terrified and trying to move as fast as they possibly could, it felt as if everything was slowing down around them.  Once they were both back in the car, Pat tried to turn the ignition on so she could get the power windows up. But all the electrics on the car was failing. The dome light, headlights were going off and on, on their own and as she said. ""Everything was going nuts"" !  Finally the car started and they turned around in the middle of the road and sped off towards home and as they traveled along they noticed a fair bit of traffic coming in their direction. (Pat commented to me, where was all the traffic when all this was happening?) As they drove along the road, Pat said to Linda, ""this is the weirdest thing. ""She said I feel like electricity, my whole body is tingling just like I was zapped by a charge from a battery"". When Linda heard this, she said, ""I didn't want to say anything to you as you might think I was nuts, but I am feeling the same. As if I was hit by an electrical charge."" As Linda was explaining how she felt, and facing Pat she glanced at the clock in car and said, ""Jesus Pat, look at the time"" ! Pat said what are you talking about ? Linda said we were only stopped and out of the car for a few minutes at the most, and the time of the car's clock reads an extra 25 minutes of time.  As they drove along and close to home they both discussed it and wondered if they had imagined it all. As they were just about home, they turned onto Baker Street which is covered in darkness next to a field. All of a sudden they saw this bright, glowing neon green ball low in the sky. The object started moving to the right, ""stop"", left, ""stop"", right, ""stop"", left, ""stop"" and then it started to move away until the ladies car came to a halt, and so did the object. Before they knew it, the ball of green light started heading towards them at a high rate of speed and hovered  high above their car. At this point they just wanted to get to their home and be as far away from whatever it was as possible.  The driver sped off quickly again and they headed into an orchard which was very close by. They thought they would not be seen hiding amongst the trees, plus there was no lighting in this area to reveal their position. Pat looked at her friend and said, ""they will never find us here"". Both women are sitting in the car trying to get themselves together as the driver said she was losing it at this point. Only after a very short time after arriving in the orchard Linda said, Pat you better look out the front windscreen and look up slightly. We don't have just one green ball of light, there are now three, glowing green objects. The way the green lights were in the sky, it looked as if the they formed a triangle formation and all moving now together. After a short period of time each of the green lights moved away in different directions.  (HBCC UFO asked if the witness could give some idea of how large the green lights were. The witness told me each of the lights were approx: half the size of a full moon). After seeing the lights flying off into different directions the ladies raced home as quickly as they possibly could.  Once safe at home, both ladies shaken, they tried to come up with some reasonable explanation for what just happened. They tried to put it out of their minds but that was impossible !!!!  Later on both ladies turned in for the night and when they woke up in the morning, Pat discovered a large bruise on her left breast and another on the bottom of her foot.  She did not know how they got there but she did know they were extremly painful.....  As she sat drinking a cup of coffee Linda finally got up and was walking down the hall towards the kitchen when she said, ""god, good morning - do I feel rough this morning"". After Linda finished saying that ....Pat watched as blood came pouring from Linda's nose. Pat jumped up, ran and grabbed a towel. Linda also commented that she was having a lot of pain in her lower back area. She asked Pat to have a look to see if there was anything that could be seen. So she looked and gasped, there was a large circle burned into her skin and was located in the middle, lower back area (tail bone). Also bruises were found on Linda's body as well, some of them appeared to look like finger marks and there were three of them on each thigh. Both women at this point were shocked, upset and very frightened.  Linda, who was up visiting from the Abbotsford ended her holiday and headed back home. Two days after being home in Abbotsford, B.C. she went to consult her family doctor due to still experiencing the terrible pain which was originating from her lower back, plus it was not getting any better. Her doctor examined her, and her injury to her back, the doctor said if I didn't know any better I would say you have a radiation burn. He was of course referring to the burn mark on Linda's back. The doctor is still trying to heal this mark on her back, as something had burned right through the outer layer of this ladies skin.  (HBCC UFO Note:I will be keeping in contact with the witness to this event and hope I may be able to help in some small way).  Update to this Story:  On the night this frightening experience took place, another couple who couldn't sleep decided to go out for a walk on the warm evening. They looked up at times into the night sky, and all of a sudden they noticed a bright glowing neon colored light. The couple also added that the light was moving in the strangest way, by coming to a complete stop, moving again, stopping and then moved off very quickly. The light was seen in the same vicinity where the ladies had been stopped at the side of the road.  This sounds like it gives confirmation to what the ladies saw that night.  HBCC UFO Research Foot note: I would recommend to anyone finding such marks as described here in this report, that they consult a professional, such as their family doctor. One has to remember that they do not have to walk in to the doctor's office and make claims of missing time, or possible abduction. Let you doctor come up with the answers. Also there are some very good people who carry out work in the abduction field, and I will be very happy to put you in contact with such folks if you would like. Just write to me and request that I do so, and give me permission to pass your personal information along.  I would also like to add, this Missing Time event took place around the same date 147 witnessed watched one amazing event unfold in southeastern British Columbia. I also received a flood of sighting reports which also came from this area. July 27/28 to August 18, 2003.  If anyone has any questions, please feel free to write me an email.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Connection With Missing Time Experience,Kelowna,BC,2003-07-31T02:00:00,other,(?),"Occurred : 7/31/2003 02:00  (Entered as : 07/31/03 200 am) Reported: 8/27/2003 12:09:24 AM 00:09 Posted: 8/28/2003 Location: Kelowna (Canada), BC Shape: Other Duration:(?)",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30946.html,"Connection With Missing Time Experience  This witness had no idea about the missing time event.  I had a telephone call from a lady who lives in Kelowna, British Columbia today, August 26, 2003. She explained that a friend had cut out an article which ran in the Kelowna Capital Newspaper about a UFO Investigator Seeking Witnesses To A UFO Sighting.  The lady told me she saw an unusual object in the night sky on July 31, 2003. She also told me she has a habit of glancing up into the sky as she has a beautiful view of the stars and it is very dark in her area. On this night the woman had already turned in, but couldn't sleep due to how warm it was in her home. The lady got up out of bed and went outside for some weird reason and when outside the lady looked towards the south. As the witness sat out looking around she spotted something, her thoughts were there shouldn't be any airplanes out here at this time of night, but there was something very strange. She watched an object traveling from east to west and described the object as being almond in shape and a luminas green in color. The witness also reports only seeing one green light.  The lady reports that from their location, which was not at all far away from the two ladies who experienced the missing time, something very strange took place. She brought out her camera to take some pictures, but as she tried to take her photos, the camera would not work. It went dead! Also she reports that the evening was warm, and she could hear coyotes cutting up. But soon they became silent, and so did everything else around them including the crickets which were making some noise. She said it was if someone had clicked off a switch. The air went from a nice sweet smelling night to a musty cold in this dead silence.  Also this witness said that two nights ago a person telephoned the radio station (CKOV) on an open line call in program and reported seeing a streak of light, and at the front of this streak a round ball was noted and the caller reported ""it"" had landed somewhere in South East Kelowna in the exact area where the green object had been witnessed, also where the two ladies had their missing time event.  HBCC UFO Note: This sighting is very, very important due to the date of this sighting, the time it was witnessed, the color which was green and the shape, which is reported here to be almond in shape. Also what has me all excited over it, is due to the location where the object was observed, which was where the two ladies watched the beings on the side of the highway and the green lights, then experienced the missing time. There will be more coming on this case, also I have interviewed the second witness who had the missing time on July 31, 2003 and will be writing up the report really quick. Before I forget, I will be contacting CKOV in hopes of getting some information, and if not maybe I may get lucky and have them request that this witness to the streak of light get a hold of me.

However, it may be a star or planet.  It is simply a round, indistinct light, photographed against a featureless sky.  Orbiting objects do not remain motionless in the night sky.  PD)) Orange Ball Joined By Second That Formed a Debris Field - Filmed Orange ball object slightly to my North North East. Two to three times bigger than Mars the last few weeks. Sun was just about to set, but was still daylight. That's what caught my attention, seemed to early for such a bright star. A plane flew in the general vicinity and the red lights were not the orange of the circle of light.... sooo.... I went inside and got my hi 8 camera and came out and filmed. Seemed like it had moved south since I had I eye balled it last ..... continued filming while standing. Decided with the zooming I was doing I needed to lay down on the deck and film from a more stable position. Did that and filmed close ups. No details, just a orange ball of light, but not a star. Then ........... then I noticed some other white balls of light near by, there was a large cluster of em! ....and they were 'drifting' to the north and spreading out. Must have been more than a dozen. Dispersing with out any trails of anykind, just like watching the ufo footage over Washington DC in the fifty's!! As the sun set they all got dimmer until they were gone. Had to be very very high altitude, and I suspect in orbit, as the several minutes I filmed them they didn't not travel far. The low angle of the sun lit up what ever was in orbit.  After reviewing the tape a few times, I have reached several conclusions.  I don't know what the orange colored circular object is, but I suspect it was in orbit and reflecting the sun. It has to be huge, much larger than the ISS.  Something broke apart in orbit and followed a path away from the orange colored circular object, but no noticeable change in appearance to the object.  The 'debris' field and path looks more like the shuttle break up footage than the 'Washington Fifty's Ufo's"" The reason it looked like that to me was the poor detail of the eyepiece I was viewing through in real time while filming. The difference in this footage to the shuttle break up is that there is no fire, no smoke, no contrails, no paths of any kind.  Seeing the debris field expand, it can be noticed that some of the 'objects' are tumbling and reflecting light differently as they travel. Two or three brighter bigger objects don't seem to be tumbling so much.  There are dozens of 'piece's.  The brightness of all the objects decreases with the setting sun, with the larger orange colored circular object being seen first and last.  The path of the debris field is in a Northerly direction, which is damn peculiar for a geo sync object...... if the two events are related that is. Due to the high strangeness of each, I suspect they are.  Filmed in regular eye light spectrum and infra red ""SonyNightShot"" mode. Images of the mystery objects were much brighter in the night shot mode ..... Orange ball was visible to the naked eye. Once you know there was a debris field from the camera shot, it was noticeable as a 'smudge' to the naked eye.  In the last few days my thinking is that what I may have filmed is an asteroid coming right at us so the field of motion was considerably reduced. With the high rate of meteorites streaking across the sky world wide of late, and the closest pass of an asteroid ever just last month, I am wondering if this is a continuation of that activity.  IF this is the case, then I may have come close to filming dooms day.... especially from the debris fields visible in this footage. Have emailed 101203.zip that contains several high resolution frame captures from the film. ((name deleted))",2003-11-26T00:00:00,41.67504576271187,-86.27111065375303

Ok, how to start... It was 17:50, and it was in Chelsea, a small town of the Pontiac region, right beside the Ottawa region, on the other side of the Outaouais River, in Québec. The precise location was above the clean separation of the ""Basses-Terres du Saint-Laurent"" and the ""Bouclier Canadien"" (I apologize, I don't know the english version of these geographical regions). I was on my way to work, it was my mother who was driving, when we noticed what we thought was an extremely bright star. We kept on discussing as we watched the star dissapate slowly and by then, we could clearly see three a triangular form. The best way to describe it would be, if you take a perfect triangle, and draw three lines from every corner of the triangle to the center, those three lines would define the shape of the object seen in the dark skies. When it shone brightly, we could see nothing out of the ordinary, it really looked like a simple bright star. But then, once the light had faded, not only could we clearly see the form, but we can notice a total of about 6 lights that stayed on the shape. One at every corner, and one in the middle of all three lines. I remember, we rolled down the window, and we could hear no sound emanating from the craft. Knowing that there are mountains near, we only had about 2 minutes to gaze at it until it flew out of sight, past the mountains. We were all amazed at that time, but then, when my mother and I came back from work, I was looking at the stars again, hoping to see my UFO once more, and then, one of the bright stars faded again, and the form could clearly be seen once again. I was simply amazed. This time though, the craft was flying in the opposite direction and was heading, well, seemed to be heading for Hull, a town next to Ottawa, on the other side of the River. I was flying lower than before and much faster, it was about 23:33. The 6 lights were also less visible and once the brightness had faded, it was very difficul to follow its trajectory. Our hypothesis wa! s that it was (and I must specify that this was my mother's idea) that maybe it was a plane that forgot to take off its ""brights"" as it took off. But after a short debate, and my explanation that planes do not have ""brights"" in front, like a car, she changed her opinion to mine, that is that it was a UFO. But I still think it could've been a space shuttle. The line that was vertical could be the vertical wing on a space shuttle and the two other lines could be the wings, with the lights as any flying craft would have. And the brightness could've came from the gigantic reservoirs of fuel that ignite and propulse the shuttle up into the atmosphere. The only thing wrong with this is that there are no space shuttle launching pad around, and not for miles and miles around. Also, the chance of seeing the same shape twice, and so low in the air would make out to be quite a waste of time and a very weird space shuttle trajectory. Might I also add that very few planes ever do fly above this town, and one last detail: the craft was not moving vertically nor was it very high in the sky, nor was it loud. Silent. Silent, and moving horizontally and extremely fast. I can only come to the exhaustive conclusion that it was and remains a UFO, that is and Unidentified Flying Object. Might I also add that it would not be the first time that there are sightings in this town. Personally, this is my second sighting here, and I know other people that have seen just as much.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,,

It was having an effect on the air in front of it as it moved, creating a wake which was visible.

One of us, I can't remember who, had spotted a dull looking object behind where we were standing (I'm unsure of the direction from which the craft approached). The craft had to be a quarter mile long and half the size in width! Now the starnge part, the craft was almost like a Star Trek shaped vehicle, only it was tubular in frame configuration, and had two similar sections front and rear. The rear section,again, attatched by tubular material to the front section, clearly sat higher in elevation than the front section. As the craft passed over us, it made no sound whatsoever, not even a wisp of traveling through the air. And the most peculiar thing was that there were no lights on this craft at all. I've always wondered about some of those strories I've read where these craft have a ""Fourth of July"" display of lighting. considering these craft are real, which I do believe they are, why would they need to display something greater than say an anti-collision light on a normal aircraft. Rarely have I ever read of a similar experience. The remaing two strange things are, I can hardly remember the names of the people I was stationed with of which I had the experience, and, the craft glided over a ""Major"" Army base!

I went outside the arena with my mother and a friend of hers. We walked to a coffee shop about 1/2 mile away. While on the way back, we all noticed a very bright light in the sky. It was a cool clear night in mid-March. The object was extremely bright. It sort of was going straight and slow for about 20 seconds, then made a very sudden turn to the right. It suddenly stopped after a few more seconds. It was quite high up it seemed - 2-3 miles? At that point, several smaller lights or objects - I counted at least seven, emerged from the light and were flying around the still stationary larger object. The objects eventually made their way across the sky away from view. Total time - about 2-3 minutes. We were all quite puzzled by the event. On a side note - I remember we were talking with my mom's friend and her husband a few weeks later when they were over for dinner. He told us when he was with the US military in the early 1970's, he was a radar operator responsible for an area in the US mid-west. He used to track objects on the screen flying at extreme speeds - but he was also warned to ignore them and to keep his mouth shut. He was convinced from our descriptions, that what we saw was definitely not a normal aircraft.

It was around 11:00 PM on a fall night in 1970.  I lived in an apartment house in New York City's Lower East Side.  A number of friends in the building had dropped in, and it seemed that a casual party was taking place.  It was a tiny apartment, and quickly filled up with cigarette smoke.  I suggested that we all go up to the roof to chat, where there was more oxygen available.  We all grabbed our drinks and smokes and paraded up three flights to the roof.  Everyone was talking at once, having a good time.  I noticed that the sky had a very dark, high overcast, and there were no stars visible at all.  In a few minutes, I saw that the moon had risen, and was near the horizon behind a little storm cloud with lightning going on in it, which was odd since no other clouds were visible.  I remember nothing else until I became aware of the fact that all of the people I was with were silent, staring blankly at the rooftop, and I was the only one who seemed conscious. Then, all at once everyone began talking as if there had been no break in the conversation at all.  I saw that the moon was much higher, and on the opposite side of the sky, but that it still had the little storm around it, with lightning.  Suddenly everyone had to get to bed, even though we'd only been there for a few minutes.  It was two AM when I got back to my apartment.  The next day I recalled the odd appearance of the moon, so I checked a calendar with the Moon's phases, and it had been a New Moon, with no visible Moon at all.  Needless to say, the event left my eyebrows raised for quite some time.  Thanks again for your work at keeping this magnificent repository available for the sharing of all our strange sightings.

Because you just don't forget about something like this, it's just to big.Maybe I am not intended to understand why or how.I do know you cannot erase these kind of memories from your mind.I only hope one day I  might find my answer,as so many others need to know also. as to why these events take place.I have had other strange happenings since ,another time ..thanks for reading… ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Meanwhile the steerman took the binoculars and reported (very nervously) that the object passed close to the ship (less than a 100 mts)had no specific shape, only a black mass with some red and yellow lights. There was no sound at all (engines or water movement), but the object was moving fast, estimated 20-25 knots. After passing by the stern, it faded several minutes later.

It was hovering very still above the water about 1000 ft away and about 150 ft in the air, it was a very clear evening, the object had a very bright white light coming from the very center and on each side of the white light were flashing red lights and on each side of the red lights there were non-flashing blue lights. My neighbor pulled over his car to the side of the road and I stopped behind him and we both got out, his family stayed in the car. He asked me what I made of that, I told him it obviously is not an airplane because its sitting perfectly still, my first thought was that it was a helicopter but it was too large and although his car was still running there didn't appear to be any sound coming from it. As we stood there for a few minutes looking at it he told me they had to leave so I pulled up the road a bit closer to it and shut the car off.  I watched it for another several minutes before it started to move toward me, there was absolutly no noise coming from this object,  it was silent and it was moving very slow and the only change in the lights is that before it started to move toward me the bright white light in the center dimmed. As the object which was clearly a craft of some sort approached me it turned just app. 20 ft before it did, I was more in awe then I was scared, when it turned to the northeast it turned very smooth just like a car turns, it was also at its very closest at the turn point, it kept heading northeastward at the same slow speed just above ground at app 150 ft above ground level.  I watched it till it was out of sight then I turned the car around and went home, I phoned the RCMP and asked if they had any calls about strange lights in the sky, after talking with them for a few minutes they told me to get in touch with the airport...so I did, and they put me through to the control tower, I told him my story and he was quite interested knowing that I sounded sincere. He told me that there have been no flights out in the past two hours and none were do in for another hour and a half {small airport} and he said that aircraft had a red light and a green light not red and blue lights - after the report to the control tower there were a few small planes I noticed circling around the area...but this thing was gone by then. Since this has happened some years back I can not exactly remember the date, but the details as I have described them about the sighting are, I will never forget it, I have since moved not to far from there and occasionly talk with my former neighbor, we still agree what we seen that night.

During the course of the interview Mr.((deleted)) recounted another sighting witnessed on 15 September 98 that had not been submitted to MUFON until now. While the reconstruction of a UFO sighting that occurred two years ago poses obvious problems for the investigator, it should be noted that the witness made a written account of the incident within days of the its occurrence. The information contained in this report corroborates remarkably well with the account of two years ago. Mr.((name deleted)) web site is: http://rockc.tripod.com.  Subsequent to our first meeting, Mr. Rock accompanied me to the Westminster campus where we reviewed the sighting on location and made measurements to establish the distance to the UFO from the witness when first and last seen during the course of the sighting. There are ample points of geographic reference on the campus to establish, with a high degree of confidence, thedistance to the object; however, the estimation of the apperent size of the object is made with leddcertainty. The narrative that follows reflects calculations of size and distance based on these measurements that, while stated in exact figures, should be regarded as the best approximations obtainable without the aid of special equipment.  At 4:00AM on the morning of September 15 1998, Mr. Rock was working at Westminster College located at 1840 South, 1300 East, in Salt Lake City. He had stepped outside to throw away trash and sip some coffee. The witness stated that the night was cool, around 65 degrees; visibility was clear without any clouds. While facing west, sipping coffee, he fired his laser pointer, which is used at work to identify areas that require cleaning, into the sky in the general direction of Jupiter+.  Within a minute or two of firing the laser, a gray, spherical object, calculated to be 70 feet in diameter*, appeared, in the western sky, hovering over an adjacent building at a distance of 260 feet from the witness at an altitude of 40 feet above the ground. The appearance of the object was sudden and was not preceded by movement from some other location. It simply appeared.  Upon seeing the object, the witness turned off the laser pointer. Mr.Rock stated that at that moment he was quite awed by what he was seeing and doesn't recall feeling or thinking much in the ensuing moment. The object sat completely motionless for 2 to 3 seconds then moved north toward the witness at a speed estimated to be 60 mph**. Witness stated that the object had no apparent period of acceleration; i.e. the object was motionless one instant and then moving at 60 mph the next, without any incremental increase in speed. He watched the object pass over him, headong northeast when lost from view as the object passed behind a building. The moment before the sphere moved out of view was when it was in closest proximity to the witness: 60 feet away at an altitude of 40 feet, with a calculated diameter of 58 feet*. During these last few moments, the witness observed the underside of the sphere, which he described as ""Reddish, pinkish with pits and pings and very much crater-like"".  He added that, apart from the bottom, the object was smooth,gray and featureless.  Witness also said he felt as if the object was aware of him.  As the object passed over the witness it went behind some trees and continued east behind a building.  The witness pursued the object on foot but before he could clear the tree cover he heard a bang and when he came into a clearing the object was nowhere to be seen. Witness stated that he then returned to work and was very excited but was not able to relate the story to any of his co-workers because he doesn't speak much Spanish and they do not speak English.  Witness said that he was not able to sleep more than a couple of hours during the next two days because he was so excited and impressed with what he had seen.  After a couple days the witness contacted Peter Davenport, at the National UFO Reporting Center, who was given permission to tape the conversation.  That conver- sation was aired about a week later on the Art Bell's ""Coast to Coast"" radio program and should be made available when archive conversation, at that web site, is completed.  Witness stated that during the entire event no sound was heard coming from the sphere nor was there any perceptible emission of any kind.  There was no disturbance to the immediate surroundings caused by the object.  Astronomical data for the date and time of sighting:  Moon: 18 degrees altitude; 84 degrees azimuth, 16% waning crescent  Jupiter: 23 degrees altitude; 241 degrees azimuth   +Data confirm the witness's statement regarding Jupiter's position in the sky.  The moon, while low in the sky, would have been behind the witness in the east.  *Calculated diameter of the object is made for when the object was first and last seen.  There is a difference of 12 feet between the two perspectives that probably reflect an uncertainty of the actual size rather than to suggest the object changed its size.  **Based on a total distance of 310 feet traveled by the UFO from initial sighting to when last observed, the calculated speed is 70mph if the time required was 3 seconds or 53mph if 4 seconds had elapsed.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

There was no light sorce in the room to create the light. On her side of the bed there was a small metal framed window. I got up and walked around the end of the bed. I was amazed at the amount of lightin the room. The double pane glazing was of a cheap design and moisture had seeped in. This caused the window to be less than transparient. A common in that part of the couontry. To see what was causing the light she opened the window. The slide wasn't exactly smooth, and the window banged open when she forced it.

However, I could just make out the triangular shape. The sides were verticaly flat, with ridges running horizontally. It appeared to be black. However, dure to the brightness I can't be sure. I looked at the craft long enough to make these observations. Then the most extraordinary thig happened. I closed the window and went back to bed. I say this was extraordinary because I just saw something I've wondered about all my life and I just turned my back and went back to bed! I didn't take a picture. I didn't call anyone. I didn't go out side to get a better look. I just closed the window, walked around the bed, got in, and went to sleep. It wasn't until the next evening that I mentioned it to my wife. Atfirst she just looked at me like I had lost my mind. Then she said that she had a dream just like that. The window being banged open is what she remembered. She also said that she remembered a person standing across the street looking at our house. I didn't see anyone. This is true as I remember it. I have no reason to fabricate this story.

It made no sound. One night, in the township of Footbridge WI,(just outside of Kewaunee) a friend of mine and I were planning to go fishing in the Kewaunee River. The spot we picked to go is very dark, no lights from houses or street lights. It's basically a dead end parking lot. We were sitting by our cars talking and it was one of those calm nights where you could hear a dog barking from a mile away.The sky was very very clear, all the stars you could see were visable. Minutes prior a jet had flown over us and it was VERY high up in the air, and we could hear it because it was so calm outside. Not more than 20 minutes later, another flying object came through, only, we never saw anything like it. It had an orange glow underneath and to the sides. This craft was no more than an eighth mile high, and unlike the jet, no sound was coming from it. We were probably 1/2 mile from it and we watched it fly over the trees from the east to the west, slowly for about 2 minutes. My friend had then called his brother on his cellphone and asked him to look outside at it. (His brother lived about 2 miles from there). He was already outside watching it and said he could not tell what it was. The way it would jerk around and how close to the trees it flew. From where my friend and I were sitting, the craft went over the treeline and we couldnt see it anymore. His brother watched and he said half a minute later, it completely vanished. It was disk looking and on the lower half of the disk and very bottom it was orange. Strangest and most fascinating thing I ever saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

We observed these lights for over a span of 10 to 15 minutes, I happened to look up into the night sky and saw more than a couple of stars move, like when you see falling stars, except that these did perfect circular movements and just disappear afterwards.  After witnessing this we noticed that over the horizon of the pacific, quickly a kind of mist or clouds covered these lights and we could no longer see them.  After getting to our destination, as we got out of the car and as I looked up into the night sky, I saw behind the hills a kind of lightning or flash, this was on a clear starry night.  Previously, the day before this, it was around midday.  It was a clear blue sky day, I saw a metallic object cross the sky, it looked like it was far since it was just a small dot, it was round and metallic, the speed of this craft was quite normal and just eased it's way across.

I pointed it out to my friend in the back seat.  We started to discuss what it could be.  The driver suggested 2 cruise missles of some sort.  The lights appeared to be hovering up and down and a steady rate going the opposite way down on the north bound highway.  Almost as if observing us in vehicles, poosible taking scans of some sort. As we got closer we noticed the lights were comeing from 2 ufo's going south in the north bound lane.  There was other traffic on the highway at the time, so im sure there were other witnesses other then ourselves.  Even the car infront of us stop abruplty.  I also noticed a semi truck pulled over to the left side of the highway going northbound. The driver of our vehicle slowed down alot so i stuck my head out the window while the car was in motion so i got a good look at the crafts.  The vessicles were about 20 feet from the concrete of the highway.  There was an extremly bright light in the front of the vessicle, then what appeared to be contrete with 3 columns of hieroglyphical writing.  With another brighlight at the end of the vessicle.  We got off the highway about 2 exits up and went into a church parking lot that was write off the freeway to smoke a ciggerate and talk about what we seen before we left the area.  When we noticed a 3rd craft going east passing over the highway.  This vessicle was triangle shaped, dark green with red and yellow tubing that was intergrated into the bottom of the vesslicle.  Possibly some type of piping with fuel being fed to the engines. This triangle shaped ship was moving a bit faster and was noiser then the other 2 seen previously.  After the triangle shaped vessicle passed over us and was no longer in sight we got back in the car about 5 mintues later and left.  As we approached the onra! p to continue driving home to washington we noticed a army truck with 2 soldiers standing on the side of the onrap looking up at the sky ignoring any other distractions.  Diddnt even look at us as we drove by.  We were gonna stop and ask what they were looking at but then we changed our minds and got on the highway and went home.  Were these 3 vessicles some type of new secret military aircrafts or did the army respond to ufo's intrusion into our airspace. We might never know.

UFO Posted by Jim on 07/11/03 at 21:37 GMT This occured in 2001 in Jupiter Fasrms Florida after returning home from work.  I'm 43 and have had three encounters I can recall very clearly . Two were in the middle of the night both at tree top level. Number two of my three sightings was a red-orange glowing ball that passed slow and soundless overhead . The third and last was at 3am on a warm and clear florida night . As I pulled into my driveway ,getting back from work, I noticed a bright 5-foot ball of light weaving through the sky over my house. I lived out in the country in Florida this was in 2001 at the time.As I got out of my van I continued to keep my eye on this ""thing"". It seemed to be alive as it flew over my home and then over the trees zigging and zagging the whole time(it was having a good time I felt).This sphere was a dense ultra white ball,completly soundless with obvious itelligence.  Soon it must of noticed I was watching it because it darted quickly away flying straight over the Australian pines surrounding my home out in Jupiter Farms(the inland rural quiet stacks, Burt Reynolds and Lonnie lived down the street a while back...for what its worth!)as it and sped away it's body got brighter and left a tail or trail that streghthed a extra few feet.Oh yes , it also grew in size a foot or two as soon as it began to leave...I clearly startled it is what it appeared to me!I stood there shocked and amazed of course and hoped it would return. Perhaps 5-10 minutes later this bright ball of intelligent light now came slowly over the same  trees it had dissapeared over before and then dropped down so it was now only 20-50 ft above my head !!!  I froze...slowly it passed right over my head and then in what seemed like slow motion began to cloak it self before my eyes. I was able to get a good look at it floated by me and did see a outline from it for a couple seconds before it was completly gone! Soon I had the feeling I was being watched so for the next twenty or so minutes I just stood outside looking at the stars. Sure enough over head I saw a white light the size of a medium star traveling at impossible speeds pass ! right over me high in the sky.It flew west to east then and before while it was partying over my home it took off south and returnedto me heading north.

We ran toward it, and as it seemed to hover, quite low, we could look right up inside of it-- it was a large, round or oval(disk shaped) craft with a row of lights around the perimeter of the underside of it.  The lights seemed to move around the perimeter of the craft.  We could see what seemed to be a bright hazy light coming from what appeared to be the bottom of, or inside of the aircraft.  After hovering, it moved away, but continued at a very low elevation for quite a while-- all of the kids on our street who were outside ran after it for as long as we could before losing sight of it.  As long as we were fairly close to it, we could hear a rather strange whirring or whooshing noise.  As my mother had gotten a glimpse of it from inside the house and the porch, she called and made a report to the police department.  The next day there was a small article in the Savannah newspaper  stating that there were numerous reports of the sightings, but the air force had determined that it was actually a weather balloon.  However, I don't think it was, judging from my memory of the object.  There was nothing about it to suggest a balloon of any kind.  I have long been curious about any other reports of this sighting, but have been unable to find any, and the Savannah Morning News cannot even find the small article about the sightings in their archives (I'm not positive about the date, or even the year, but am fairly certain it would have been the early 1960's).  I am a college graduate, professional woman, married to a law enforcement professional.  I've never observed any other UFO type objects at any time before or since.

A family re-union was taking place inside my home at the time and several others were with me while observing.  Out of nowhere an oval craft appeared about 1,500 feet directly over our heads.  The craft was completely silent and appeared to be about 30-50 feet long.  It was metallic on the bottom and had four oscillating soft looking lights.  The color of the lights were white, amber, purpleish and green.  Ocillation events for these four lights occurred about every second or two.  The craft stayed in this position long enough for me to grab a few of the other relatives inside, one of whom was my uncle who had a commercial flying liscense.  My uncle immediately called a nearby radar station at a local airport.  They stated they didn't see anything unusual on their screens.  After about three minutes the object left out of sight at a 45 degree angle at tremendous speed (no trail and still no sound).  I estimate its speed must have been every bit as fast as a meteor since it completely disappeared from sight into a clear night sky within two seconds.  To this date I am still mystified by what we saw and can not begin to even guess at the technology employed by this object.  The Air Force Project Blue Book mission caught wind of the report in our local paper and sent me a 20 page report to fill out.  I was already deeply into astronomy at the time and even then found the report criteria quite insulting (ie; where was the moon, how big was the moon, etc).  All I know is that I have seen strange aircraft, the planets, and lots of other celestial objects most of my life but this was not even close to being an astronomical event or piece of earthly origin equipment.

I was laying in the back seat of my mother's car, traveling from Fort Wayne to Berne, Indiana. What I recall is observing a glowing dull orange ball in the sky through the back window of the car.  I also remember the tan (my mother says red) interior of the car. The ball reminded me of the color of a basketball, likely due to the color. This is the extent of my memory of the incident  From what my mother says, we rounded a curve on US 27 southbound between Decatur and Berne at a town called Monroe.  After the curve of which there was a small woods on the right, my mother observed about five to ten cars slowing on the straight stretch of the road leading to the intersection of US 27 and State Highway 124 known as Coppus Corners. She says she doesn't remember brake lights, but remembers the cars slowing eventually almost to a stop.  From the sky to the right (from the west) she observed an orange sphere or ball traveling downward at about a 45 degree angle towards the highway.  The object traveled to a point just to the right (west) of the highway, made a bouncing movement as if it was hopping the highway, then sped off again upward at a 45 degree angle at an astonishing rate of speed.  She does not recall if it disappeared due to the distance it traveled or if it just disappeared. She was unable to give me a size or distance of the object.  The cars in front of us then began to accelerate up to normal speed and she never heard anyone else mention the incident.  My mother is a no-nonsense wife of a minister (my father) and says that the incident was ""surreal"" and she recalls not wanting to discuss the incident with anyone. She was surprised that she did not hear anything about the incident, but that might have been because the other witnesses felt the same way she did about the incident.  The date and time are approximate as I thought I was older when it happened, but she told me that my sister was with us and that she was less than a year old when it happened.  My sister was born in September of 1968 which is how I came up with the year 1969.  My mother does not even remember the time of year, but said the windows were up in the car.  My mother and I would really like to speak with someone in one of the other vehicles, and that is what brought me to search the website for similar incidents and then post this report myself.

I couldn't even begin to tell you what height I thought they were, just that they looked low on the horizon and not quite straight overhead.  They went in a straight line of flight.  I have often thought about this and have never read anything that could explain what we saw.  There was no sound, which was strange for something traveling that low and that fast.

Saw individuals that were not human.,Ridgefield,CT,1976-05-17T02:00:00,unknown,10-15 minutes,"Occurred : 5/17/1976 02:00  (Entered as : 05/17/1976 2:00) Reported: 11/27/2003 11:47:57 AM 11:47 Posted: 12/9/2003 Location: Ridgefield, CT Shape: Unknown Duration:10-15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33415.html,"Saw individuals that were not human. This occured at what was then the Casagmo Apartments in Ridgefield (1976)  My (ex)wife and I were asleep - it was early Spring and the large sliding window was partly open (an inch or two).  A loud buzzing noise woke me (I remember covering my head with a pillow).  I realized that the buzzing seemed to come from inside my head. I went to the window and saw what I thought were 3 electrical company employees (linesmen) at the far side of the parking lot (less than 100 feet from my view).  I thought they were electrical linesmen because they had their backs to me and appeared to be wearing hard hats (vey shiny hard hats that looked like chrome). Each was dressed oddly (I say this because they appeared to be wearing dark ""wet suits"". Each looked to have on ""mittens"" as I saw only a ""thumb"" and what looked to be a mitten like glove. Each of the individuals looked to be 5 feet tall or less.  I said quietly to my wife ""what the hell are these idiots doing out there in the middle of the night?""  The 3 were clearly visible because they were illuminated by an overhead light source.  One ""individual"" was looking up into the tree line, another was looking very intently at the ground and the third was looking around almost as if keeping a watch.  I continued standing at the window behind a very large, potted philodendron plant that we kept in the bedroom.  The three individuals suddenly turned as if they were given a command (right face) and faced directly at the window where I was standing. (Please understand that the bedroom was on the second floor and we had not turned on any lights nor made any noise to attract attention - the buzzing was still quite loud at this point).  I felt immediately uncomfortable and crouched down behind the plant.  As the individuals turned toward me, it appeared that one of them had a reflective stripe running down his pant leg (much like the satin stripe on tuxedo trousers).  The helmets were no longer visible from the front (only slightly around the perimeter of their heads - for lack of a better description - like an ancient Egyptian headdress).  They had unusually large reflective goggles over their eyes (or unusually large reflective eyes).  I asked my (ex)wife to please take a look.  She got out of bed and came to the window.  My recollection is that the 3 individuals then turned to their right again (all at the same moment).  They all walked as if they were in a strobe light.  Two went out of my field of vision (behind the maitenance garage in the parking lot) and one simply ""disappeared"" from the open field.  The overhead light and the buzzing stoppeed at the moment the last individual ""disappeared"".  I did not tell my Ex what I saw but asked her what she had seen.  Her description to me was the same as what I witnessed.  She, however, described them as walking away in ""slow motion"" and she was also unclear as to what happened to the third individual.  We went back to bed.  The night was clear prior to the incident but it did rain after the incident.  In the morning, I went out behind the garage to see if there were a light source.  There was a fixture but it had not spot light bulbs in it.  There were no marks on the ground.  I saw no craft and maitained that if it had gone forward, backward or up I would have seen it so it could only have gone into the ground.  I mentioned the incident only to my closest friend who insisted that I get the number for UFO Locater and call them to report it.  After 2 weeks, I relented and went to the Ridgefield police and got the UFO Locator 800 number from them.  I reported the incident to Locator and asked if anyone else had seen or reported anything unusual that night.  They told me that there had been 26 reports for that same night from Katoonah, NY to Danbury, CT (along the power grid and fault line - which I never knew existed).  They subsequently called to interview me about the sighting.  When I told them the craft could only have gone ""down into the ground or I would have seen it"" they asked me if I thought that it could have gone to another dimension or time.  I had not considered that possibility and said so.  The memory is still vivid after nearly 27 years.  It was suggested to me that I submit to hypnosis to see if I could recall more.  I did in 1981 and had kept a copy of the tape that was made.  I heard myself yelling about the individuals looking closely into my face - yelling about their eyes and yelling for help because I was outside of my apartment.  I have rarely shared this information with anyone.  My Ex Wife refused to talk about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-12-09T00:00:00,41.3074,-73.4947

After 20 years I can't be sure of the exact date, however when I was shown the news article in the Matton Journal Gazete the news of the Jonestown Mass Killing was in the paper. Here goes the story:  My boyfriend and I along with his boxer dog we in my car driving down to greenup to visit his little boy.  As we were approching a little curve in the road there right above a small stand of trees at the edge of the field was this huge object.  I have always said that it reminded me of a large type of metal thing (long enough be hovering over and entire stand of woods)that just seemed to be pasted on the sky.  There was not a sound.  I just hung there right above the tree tops.  As, we moves toward it I could clearly see a row of light. This is how I was able to know that the craft was stationary-as the car moved around the curve I was turning and could see the lights beening out of sight as we came ""behind"" it on the back side of the curve. (there was lights there also. As I was looking behind me I noticed that the dog was staring at it too!  We drove on not saying anything at all for a few minutes and my boyfriend asked,""Did you just see something back there?""  I said yes. He said,""what did you think you saw""?   I said, ""you tell me what you saw first"".  We had this back and forth exchange for awhile before we talked about it because neither wanted the other to think them nuts!  He did see it too.  The rest of the evening we both felt as if we were in a dream like state.  I tried to call the Mattoon air port I didn't get an answer.  The next day my boyfriend brought me the paper and there had been several sightings that night.  One in Terra Houte, Indiana, and another in Decatur I think.  Any how I do not know what it was but I am positive of what I saw.  I haven't seen anything like it since.

It was on a clear hot august evening and I'm almost sure it was a Wednesday night. I was watching TV and my mom was sitting on the front porch trying to cool off. Before my mom even said anything I could see a bright light coming over spring hill. At first I thought it was a very low airplane since we live right in the flight path of Spokane Int. Airport and Fairchild AFB., and planes flew over all day and night. Then my mom yelled at us to come see this UFO. My brother and I and my cousin from Montana all went out to see this and it was round, rotating counter clockwise and didn't make any noise. It didn't seem very high up, maybe 150 feet.It was about 50 feet in wide by about 12 feet deep. There were square lights all the way around it, maybe 2 feet by 2 feet. The strangest thing was it was totaly silent. As it rotated there was a dark spot where it seemed like a light was out. A neihbor who saw it with binoculars said the lights were windows and he could see white walls inside. It was going from the N/E towards the S/W. But not very fast. A week later and every week therafter for several weeks an advertising airplane was seen over Spokane in crowded places like the Spokane interstate fair and Playfair race track and looked just like the disc shaped craft from a distance but you could hear it from several miles away, an obvious cover up. Everyone in Spokane who heard the stories of people in North Spokane who saw the original silent flying disc were effectivly convinced we saw the advertising airplane. I have lived in Spokane all my life and have seen two other UFO sightings in the 1990's which I will try and provide information on at a later date. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It must have been close to midnight, and the sky was completely  clear and all the stars were blazing bright. We walked down and stood on the beach for a while looking up and watch everything. A few shooting stars had gone over head and so we were really watching closely for anything . I had looked over to the ridge of hills on the far left side of the lake and I thought there was a radio tower with a flahing light on top of it. I pointed it out and then we realized that the light was far too high above the ridge to be a tower. The light wasn't moving and there was no sound at all. It was flashing white, red and green all lights were visable at all times, but the colours pulsed, but did not move or get smaller or larger.. We actually stood looking at it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it could be. And then to the right of the lake the full moon had come out from behind a small cloud, we all moved further down the beach to look over at it. About 10 mins later when we were about to leave the beach and go back to our camp, I looked back over to the ridge and the lights were gone completely. There wasn't time enough for it to fly away, if it was an airplane, we still would have seen it. The sky was so clear that any direction it would have gone we would have been able to track it,,, but the sky was clear.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,45.3334,-79.2163

I thought maybe I should call an agency and report it but I am pretty skeptical about UFO's and I thought what are the chances that I, someone who doesnt believe in UFO's, is going to see one. So I figured I would get online and see if anyone else reported a UFO that night. No one did. I haven't told anyone except my friend because people would think I'm crazy the same way I do about other people who report seeing UFO's. I was talking to my friend tonight and he is into UFO's and told me I should at least report it to you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect Mars may be the cause of the sighting.

I was on a cruise in the Caribbean from July 26th to August 2nd and had met up with some people. We had left Cozumel Mexico on Thursday July 31st and wereon our way back to Miami. Me and a few friend had just came out onto the front of the ship and were looking at stars. Me and 2 others noticed a light that seemed to be a ship out at sea (a considerable distance away) but the light wasn't consistant. One second you would be able to see it and then it would go out, and wouldn't reappear for 3 or 4 seconds. The times varied.  We were then looking up at the stars again and all saw one huge light come across the entire sky (towards the south) and it seemed to be a shooting star or comet, but the tail following it seemed to be just part of the initial light streaking through the sky, and did not last for more than a quarter of a second. 3 or 4 of us saw it and all yelled ""woa"".  The last thing only I saw, and was kind of akward. I was trying to scope out the planets that were visible, and the only one i was sure about was Mars (being huge and very bright at the time). I was staring towards the north at what looked like a planet that was shifting colours from blue and red. For 10 seconds the ""star"" was shimmering an inconsistant red colour, and then the next 10 seconds and inconsistant blue colour. The colours were always visible and did not blink, but got brighter and darker some times. It seemed to be very far away. I was staring at it afterwards thinking of what planet it could be, then looked one of my friends for 3 seconds. I turned my head back to the ""star"" and it seemed to be out of place in the sky in comparison to the others from what i had just been looking at, it was too far to the left. (2 inches from my view, so about this far |---------| in comparison to what i had seen). I stared at it and it sudenly dissapeared and reappeared where it had first been, back to the right.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

My old dog who has a weak bladder woke me up and wanted to go out side to urinate. I went outside in the back yard with the dog. I looked into the eastern sky and saw the same golden light I had seen the night before in the southeast. It seemed to go up or come toward me. I then went into my house to get my glasses as I am slightly nearsighted. I wanted to see if I could get rid of the ""flare""/twinkle of the light and perhaps get a better look. The ""object"" was still there (and still twinkled"" with my glasses on, but to a lesser extent) and then moved up and to the left in the sky. Then it dimmed out as if a gas or ""jet burner"" had went out. It was about 2 or so times the brightest object in the sky, which was Mars. I had not planned to report this again until an experience tonight. I walked to the Post Office to drop a letter off. A man was in an empty parking lot with a Meade ""Telescope"". He was charging $2.00 to look at the moon. I paid him and had a look at the cratered moon. I then asked him if he had ever saw anything unusual like a ufo. He said that he never had. But a man who was standing there and had looked before me, said that he had. He then confirmed what I had saw in the night sky over Wilmington. That is what prompted me to write again. Also I am wondering at the odds of me waking up in the middle of the night by my dog on 2 straight nights, and seeing these lights which quickly disapeared? I have looked every night since when I go out with the dog, but have seen nothing.

Orginial language text at bottom ---  I live in the small town of Mendoza San Rafael in Argentina. On 8/1/03 at approximately 2:10 am something happened that I, nor any of my family or friends that were there, had ever seen in our lives. I don't usually believe in things such as UFOs, but what I saw was definately out of the norm. We heard a very loud sound that was unlike anything I can describe. When we went outside we saw something that was round and emitted colors that changed between very strong white, yellow and red. Something like this I had no idea what it was and I first assumed it was a meteor due to its size, but it went across the very, very fast and all we could do is stand there paralysed with wonder as to what this object could be. It continued across the sky and I believe that it impacted the earth some distance away as we felt a tremor and my home shook as though a plane had crashed nearby or something similar. The local news reported it and gave commentary from people of the village who experienced it, but the Civil Defense service explained it as a meteor impact, although a search by the Civil Defense forces with use of airplanes, aerial photos, helicopters, men on horseback and trucks have not been able to produce any evidence of a meteor fall. Scientists will be coming this Saturday (8/7/03) to investigate the area, even though to date no evidence of any type of impact as been seen.  I work in the municipality of San Rafael and I have been informed of all the activity related to this event due to my contacts within the Civil Defense Forces and the Municipality of San Rafael.  ---- *Editors note, this is not a word for word translation, as Argentina speaks a Spanish dialect and it was necessary to change some sentences to retain English grammar and understandability.

We were still not in any metropolitan area, pretty much in the middle of nowhere.Off in the distance i saw a baby blue greenish and white light, spaced apart but on the same aircraft, which i took to be a helicopter. After a few seconds I look again and something about the way it was flying wasnt right. Just then my friend (the one was asleep in the backseat) in the passenger seat says, "" do you see that?"" I acknowledged it was wierd. A few seconds later it was right over us comming from the west to the east toward the highway at a pretty high speed. As soon as it was directly over us it flipped, reversed and started heading west again finally shooting away. When directly over us it could have been no more then 100 feet way. When it changed directions, i know something was up and just as it was starting to head away i stuck my head out the window to catch a glimpse and could actually see the craft. It was FLIPPING head over end as it turned! It was a greyish dull metallic i could tell. But as too its shape it was hard to make out being that i was doing about 70mph and it too was moving. But probably an oval or saucer. It had a greenish baby blue light on one end and a white light on the other. Me and my friend started yelling at each other ,""DID YOU SEE THAT ((deleted))!"" waking my friend in the back who slept through it all. Well there was about 4 other cars around me who all had to have seen the thing too. So thats why i say there are probably plenty of other witnesses.

Mr. Vike,  I didn't see the lights on July 27, 2003 but I think it was Friday September (Correct date - August 1, 2003) 1st I observed from my deck strange lights that appeared to be out in space. At first I thought it was a plane but then convinced myself it was to far up to be a plane. My next thought was a satellite, but then I saw another one and another one. We counted at least six and they traveled at different speeds and seemed to zig zag every once in a while. We watched for quite a while then they stopped going by. One seemed to travel at a great speed as for as high up as it appeared it crossed the sky quite quickly. It may have a reasonable explanation but none I can come up with. I do not consider myself a believer of UFOs, but I do know it is a big universe and to think in all of that space we are the only one's would be kind of a stretch.  Additional Information:  Hi Brian, It was pretty late and I was on my to bed. I said Sept. 1 but I meant Aug. 1 of this year (2003). I'll tackle your questions one at a time.  As for meteors, I'm no space expert but I do watch the sky allot and I've seen allot of meteors and shooting stars and they definitely not either of those. I mentioned they zig zagged once and a while and I should mention they also traveled in different directions. There were no tails or trails behind them but they were also pretty high up, just a dot of light.  As for time of night it must have been 10:30 or 11:00. My step-daughter and I watched for around 20 mins. I say Aug. 1 but I'm not quite sure as I didn't think much about it until my wife pointed out the story in the capital News the other day.  There was no pattern to them. They just traveled back and forth. We saw several but I was guessing we were watching 5 or 6 more than once. No stoppage and no sound as far up as they were.  It was kind of funny, earlier in the evening a plane passed over and my father in law told the kids it was a UFO. When we saw the lights we were quite taken a back. We tried to watch through binoculars but couldn't focus on the lights to get a good look at them. I told the Step-daughter that if they were UFOs then the air force jets should be coming by anytime but they didn't come. I'm sure what we saw had to have a reasonable explanation but I had to think after I read the story. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else saw these lights. Feel free to contact me if you would like anymore info.  On your website I noticed there seems to be allot of activity around the Houston area, what do you think they would be interested in up there?  Take it easy and have a good weekend.

I had my compact 10 X 30 binoculars and spotted four separate white circles attached in a circlular formation. I estimate their altitude to be about thirty to forty thousand feet. They were clearly above the cloud layer that looked to be at least twenty to twenty five thousand feet. What struck me as odd was the appearance that they remained fixed in the same location for the five minutes I observed them. I periodically looked at them without the binoculars and they remained straight over my head. I also observed either an orange glow off of one circles's side or reflection of the sunlight. I was wondering why the jet stream and winds at that altitude was not pushing them away from our location. Maybe these were just some very large weather baloons at a very high altitude. After about five minutes the cloud layer moved underneith their location and obstructed our view.,2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

She told me she saw something that was pretty peculiar around 8:30 p.m.  She told me it was remarkable to her, so much so that she wanted her neighbors around to discuss what she saw but no one was in the area at the time. she also believes that she may have been the only one who witnessed this object, but of course at this time she hasn't heard from anyone else yet who may have saw it.  The witness went on to say it was a perfectly round metallic silver object moving across the daylight sky. The lady also said it was round apposed to being cylindrical or egg shaped and stressed it was as round as a ball. The object was moving in a easterly direction and she got the impression it was very, very distant.  It moved at a steady pace, it didn't stop, it didn't hover it just kept moving along through the sky until she lost sight of it. She also heard no sound coming from it. No trail or tail was witnessed. She gave a guess at what the size of the object may have been. She took a guess and estimated it may have been the size of a nickel, or at least close after holding out her hand at arms length. She estimates she observed it for approx: 2 minutes before she lost site of it when it went behind the hills.  Thank you very much to the witness for the report.

My wife and I were driving south on Wickham road when a large white sphere shot across the sky it was going west parallel with the ground and appeared to cross the road about 7 to 10 miles in front of us the sphere didn't look to be very high in the sky less then 300 feet but was difficult to judge at night as you couldn't see a landmark to try and get a bearing on it. The craft then took a 90 degree turn straight down toward the ground and disappeared. From where we were it looked like it would have hit the ground in West Melbourne or Palm Bay. The entire event didn't last 5 seconds. From that far away it still looked to be a pretty big craft not 100 feet across but bigger than a helicopter. What made us think it was a ufo was the 90 degree turn at very high speed not that far off the ground I was expecting to see the ground light up from the crash but nothing happened.

Saw a triangular shaped craft that emmitted a beam directly at us and then followed over the top of our vehicle for a short distance.,Forest Lake,MN,2003-11-02T18:00:00,triangle,5-7 minutes,"Occurred : 11/2/2003 18:00  (Entered as : 11/02/2003 18:00) Reported: 11/12/2003 11:59:33 AM 11:59 Posted: 11/26/2003 Location: Forest Lake, MN Shape: Triangle Duration:5-7 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33039.html,"Saw a triangular shaped craft that emmitted a beam directly at us and then followed over the top of our vehicle for a short distance. On Sunday, November 2, 2003 my husband, my fifteen year old daughter and myself were coming home from a housewarming party we had attended for a co-worker of mine who lives in St. Paul.  We left her house that evening around 5:15-5:30 PM and drove our vehicle heading north on HWY 61 from the eastside of St. Paul to our destination in Forest Lake.  We had so much fun at the party that I turned off the radio in my SUV so we could talk all the way home about the good time we had.  There was a slight chill in the air that night, so I had the heater on blowing out heat, but the skies over us were dark but very clear.  As we approached Forest Lake on HWY 61 I was driving and my husband was in the passengers seat had reached over to turn off the fan for the heater.  We just started to reach town and had driven almost 26 miles now and our vehicle was quite warm on the inside.  The only sound was our discussion and the sound of the tires on the road.  At this time my daughter had taken out her prizes she had won from playing games at the housewarming party.  She won some nice jewlery and wanted my husband and I to look at it.  I turned and took a quick coutesy glance because I was driving and my husband began to examine her prizes.  We could see because we had now started to come into the out skirts of Forest Lake and there were street lights that some what lit up the inside of the vehicle.  I turned my gaze back to the road and off into the distance and coming from the east towards the west I saw some blinking lights.  At first I thought nothing of it, it must be a plane because we have a small air field on the south edge of town.  But on further examination the lights seemed to be different somehow.  They were different colors and seemed to be blinking faster than a plane would, almost in a sequence or pattern.  This had captured my attention and I could not take my eyes off of it.  I said to my husband and daughter, ""look you guys, over there up in the sky,what is it?""  My husband said, ""where! ?""  I said, ""over to the right.""  ""It is coming from over by the chain of lakes this way.""  I slowed my speed way down as I drove because we were approaching the south end of town.  I had noticed the lights blinking in the sky as I just passed the first set of stoplights on HWY 61 coming into Forest Lake.  I said to my husband, ""what is it?""  He said, ""ah,it's only a plane.""  But we all continued to watch it.  As we headed up to the second set of stop lights I had notice the  blinking lights became closer but still far enough away up in the sky for the shape to be unreckonizable.  The lights no longer were moving from east to west, but were now hovering to the right of HWY 61 above the homes behind the businesses that line HWY 61.  When we reached the stop light it was red and all three of us saw the lights stop blinking but they were still lit and the object quit hovering.  It proceeded from east to west so that it was above HWY 61 and then all of a sudden went in reverse and backed up very quickly, almost like it was lining itself up for something.  At this point my husband looked down to push the button to make the power window go down because I had said to him, look it just went backwards!  He said, ""I saw that!""  That is why he wanted the window down so he could hear the sound that propellers make if a helicopter is overhead.  I said to my husband,""that is no plane!""  I asked him again, ""what is it?""  He said, it is a helicopter, but I do not hear any sound.  He was busy pushing the button to make his window go all the way down, my daughter was putting her prizes away and I was looking straight ahead as we sat at the red light at the intersection of 11th and HWY 61.  I was in the lefthand turn lane to go west on 11th towards our home.  As I pondered what this might be for that split second.  All of a sudden this so called helicopter flashed a large beam of light down directly at us.  It flashed me right in the face.  I said to my husband and daughter in the back seat that object just flashed us. ""WH! Y?""  My husband who had his windown down by now said, ""that is a search light, they must be looking for someone or something.""  I told him, no.  This was different.  It was a light like a camera flash but as bright as fireworks, but only aimed directly at us in a beam.  My husband at this time stuck his head out of the window to hear for the sound of a helicopter.  He said, ""what the heck?""  ""I do not hear anything!""  So my daughter had pushed the button to make her window go down and stuck her head out the window too and she could not hear anything either.  But the object was too far up in the sky for us to make out the shape and form.  We only seen lights and at this point they were no longer blinking.  My husband noticed in the car next to us was a family looking at the same object in the sky.  They were not in the turn lane like us, but heading north on 61 into town  He said the father was on the drivers side and mother on the passesngers side in the frontseat.  They were looking straight ahead as if frightened, but there were two teenage girls in the back and they were looking out their side windows up at the object and he thought one was rolling her window down and was sticking her head out to get a better look at this thing that just flashed us.  At this point I said to my husband and daughter maybe it is one of those experimental government planes and they are taking it out for a spin and trying it out, but it bothered me that they flashed this light down right in our faces.  Well, at this point the stoplight finally turned green,it is a long light.  We could finally go and we thought we had seen the last of this object for good.  Both my husband and my daughter still had their windows down trying to hear for some sound, any type of sound.  There was none. As I made the turn they started to make a rukus about something.  So I turned to look in the direction they were looking and what I saw out my husbands window was this object come from the sky where we could only see it as lights and it wisked ! its way down to tree level.  ""Oh, my God!""  What is it?  My husband stuck half of his body out of the rolled down window and my daughter stuck her head out the window and I peered through the front window upward driving very very slowly.  What was now directly above us we could not believe our eyes!  We were all seeing it very clearly.  Looking upwards we could see the underneath of this object.  What we seen was a large triangular craft.  The top point of the triangle was in the front and pointing the same direction as the headlights on our  SUV as I headed west on 11th Avneue.  This tip had a light in the point, maybe a couple feet wide.  The two other points forming the back (base of triangle) of the craft had also had the same lights in the tips.  When it first hovered above us these lights were a light yellowish glow.  Glow meaning the lights did not illuminate on us or the road beneath the craft.  This triangular craft was an equal lateral triangle, all sides the same length.  The craft hovered directly above us and followed us down the road a short distance.  It was just above the tree tops as it followed us.  The craft was as wide as the road from shoulder to shoulder and was approximately a school bus and and half large.  My husband is better with measurements than I am, but I am the one filling out this report so bear with me.  As the craft slowly moved along above us, I was going about 25-30 mph it changed the color of the lights underneath located in the tips of the triangle.  The front one was now red and the other two, green and blue.  The outside edges were glowing with a yelowishgreen light all the way around the outside perimeter of the craft and also the same thing aprox. 2-3 feet inward.  The middle of the triangle was dark against the night sky, but could not see the stars through it so we knew it was solid.  My husband has good eyesight and does not wear glasses he saw the underneath with half of his body stuck out of the window.  My daughter her whole head was out of the window look! ing up.  There was absolutely no sound!  I said to my husband and daughter this is awesome, kind of like being in a movie because this is something you do not see everyday.  My daughter got scared.  She said, ""you guys, I think this is a UFO we are seeing and it is really scarey!""  I tried to assure her, but did not know what to say.  I told her maybe it is just a government experiment we are seeing, knowing it could be something more.  My husband said, ""well all I know for sure is no one can tell me this is a weather balloon.""  As the craft followed us a short distance it went a little faster ahead so it was right infront of us still at tree level.  At this moment I noticed that I had this trucker without a load and just his rigg behind me right on my back bumper and he was practically running me off of the road.  But I held my ground.  Then the craft shot straight up directly over us and higher than the trees so it could navigate over them. Once it was up in the air it shot very quickly south over the trees and then down again.  At this point we could only see the red light and it seemed to skim across Clear Lake and disappear.  We could no longer see it through the trees.  The trucker behind us was going hysterical all over the road.  We finally turned off of 11th and the trucker drove fast and furiously down the road toward the other side of Clear Lake.  We think he was either following it or trying to get away from it.  When we got home we were so amazed by what we saw none of us spoke about it until the next day.  When I went to work I told a co-worker who was at the housewarming party.  She knew me and I felt she would not make fun of me for sharing this expeience with her.  Later that evening my husband and I talked about it, asking each other what was the flash and could there possibly be any explanation for what we seen.  The next morning at work I spoke with the same gal and told her we could not forget what we seen because it made such an immpression on us.  That morning I got on the internet! and looked up planes to see if there were any shaped like a triangle, not really expecting to find any, but had to look none the same.  Then I thought about what my daughter had said and I typed in the acronymn UFO for ""unidentified flying object"".  My search engine brought up this site and on the home page as I scrolled down was a rough drawing of what I had seen.  I grabbed my co-worked after she hung up the phone and brought her over to my computer to show her the drawing on the web page.  She could not believe her eyes that it was there exactly how I decribed it.  I confided in a few others as they too overheard our discussion.  They know me and can vouche for my character.  This is not something I would make up.  I spoke with my husband at lunch that day and we were concerned about the flash we received.  We wanted to find a way to get in touch with those present that night.  I called one of the local newspapers and asked the gal who answered the phone if anyone called in to report something strange or unusual in the sky over Forest Lake Sunday night.  She laughed and said ""no"".  I then called the competition newspaper and was able to speak with a reporter who to print the story and wanted our names and possibly picures.  He said, sounds like you seen a UFO and having our names will make it seem legitamate. This way if someone saw it they could call the newspaper and get in touch with us.  I told him, not with out my husbands permission, I would call him back the next day.  When I did he never answered the phone so I left a message.  After talking with my husband he did not want our identity given out since we live in such a small community and we are active members in one of the larger churches in town.  He did not want us to suffer harassment or to be humiliated by those not believing our story.  We both however are concerned about this beam of light flashing us and are concerned about what it could do to our health.  We were wondering if others who may have had similar experiences could somehow ! get through to us through this website and contact us to let us know if there are any side effects or long term conditions that arise as a result to being exposed to this beam of light.  At his point I want to say to the readers of my report that all three of us, my husband, my daughter and myself are church attending Christians.  We live in a small, but growing community.  We are respected members of our community and church and live busy lives.  My husband and myself both are employed and hold responsible full-time positions and my daughter has been in classes for gifted children and currently in advanced classes.  My husband and I are both educated and above average intelligence.  We have no need to make a fraudulent claim and waste our time and yours reading this report.  In our busy lives up until now there has not been a lot of time to spend contemplating the existence of what we have seen.  This sighting has changed the way we view things and we will never be able to look at the night sky the same way.  If there is a logical explanation for what we saw we want to find it.  If there is not we will realize that this is probably a once in a lifetime experience.  Thank-You for reading our story and if you have any experience with being flashed with a beam of light from a triangular craft we would like to know about it.  Please contact the wonderful people who dedicate their time and energy to maitaining this site.  Hopefully they will put you in touch with us.

I cam out to see 2 bright red (welding torch) type lights coming almost overhead from the east in a horizontal configuration and then when it stood over Orwigsburg for 15 minutes it changed to a vertical configuration. They were about 1 mile from me. I banged on the neighbors house and told her to get out and see the UFO's positioned over her house. Other neighbors (about 7 people came out) and watched in amazement as these 2 objects hovered in the sky. The sky was clear with a beautiful blue lit horizon in the backround. I went and got my Digital Hi-8 camcorder and put it on a tripod and got about 4 minutes of it hovering over the town. The bottom disk would ""blink out"" and then reappear. I used the 450X zoom to get right on top of it and that really shows something amazing. I am a trained observer as an amateur astronomer and an independent video producer. This object didn't make a sound (no wind was blowing and you could hear a pin drop on the sound recording)! No navigational blinking lights typical of our own aerodynamic designs. I converted the tape footage to DVD and did single frame/slow motion viewing and I can tell you that this is nothing we made. There is an electrostatic discharge around the craft often see on UFO's in reference to the propulsion system reacting with the earths atmosphere causing a corona discharge or the craft to glow--this is typical of what the military refers to ""recified beam-field propulsion"". It's all on the video to see. What really disturbs me is the fact that I called the local TV station (WNEP) and Bob Reynolds called me back twice and said he was interested and said he would send someone down to pick up the HI-8 video tape and take it back to the studio on the 11th. They never called back.  I called the 2 local newspapers (Pottsville Republican) and the lady I talked to laughed hysterically at me. The people at the Call newspaper also didn't care much either. These people better wake up and take seriously what is going on her!! These craft are not from around here and I'm quite certain they are not from our solar system. Where are they from. I'll give you 5 good guesses to start: Epsilon Eridinus, Tau Ceti, Zeta 1&2 Reticulem,and  Proxima Centauri to start. I'm quite certain they are alien spacecraft and that their technology is easily a thousand years in advance of our own here.

They were completely silent from my perspective. They seemed maybe three times the diameter of Jupitor but not as bright. I'm not sure but they seemed to be in rows of 6-9 across moving in a column. Their speed was about the speed of a passenger jet comming in for a landing at Dulles Airport. I happen to live under flight path to and from Dulles. These craft, or whatever they were, seemed to follow that flight path. I have no idea what their altitude was. If I were to guess I would say maybe seven or eight thousand feet. I can't be sure though. To give you some idea of what it looked like to me, the first impression I had was that of a planetarium moving the lights across the sky. Eccept the circles positions relative to each other were not stationary. They sort of floated very slightly in relation to each other as they moved across the sky. I can't say how many because the column was there when I looked up. From what I saw it could have been anywhere for 15-1500. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.

At first we thought it was an aircraft that had turned on a nose light, but soon realized that it was much too bright and was much more pure white than an aircraft light. It also appeared to be at a higher altitude than aircraft would normally fly.  We asked Indianapolis Center if they had traffic at our one o'clock position.

It was early evening and already dark out, they were approximately 8 kilometers east from Endako when the wife pointed out an unusual object which was flying low and parallel to their vehicle along Highway #16.  The husband then slowed the vehicle down so he could get a better look at it. He told me the object, whatever it was, made some quick moments, away from them and back again, also jerking forward and slowing down almost as if it was pacing the car. The object was reported to have changed color a number of times, from a pale green, to red and then blue. There were no flashing lights on the object and the witnesses could not make out its shape due to the darkness of the night.  The witnesses claim the object stayed with them for a number of miles until they got to a bridge which crosses the Stellako River which is west from Fraser Lake, British Columbia. When the driver and passenger changed direction in their vehicle they lost sight of the object as it seemed to continue on its flight path straight east ward. The couple did pull over to the side of the road to see if they might be able to get a better look, but when they got out of the car the object had disappeared.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object breaks into parts followed by military helicopters.,"Brisbane (QLD, Australia)",,1982-04-20T20:00:00,light,approx: hour and a half,"Occurred : 4/20/1982 20:00  (Entered as : 04/20/1982 20:00) Reported: 3/10/2004 10:24:43 AM 10:24 Posted: 3/17/2004 Location: Brisbane (QLD, Australia),  Shape: Light Duration:approx: hour and a half",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35503.html,"Object breaks into parts followed by military helicopters. A lady telephoned me and wanted to report a sighting she and another had in Brisbane, Australia back in 1982. She was living in a two story apartment building which was located on top of a hill and had been living there for eighteen months. Also the building they lived in was right over top of the flight path for their major airport. The jet airliners would come in very low and the lady said it almost felt as if the wheels of these aircraft were skimming across the roof. So she was used to hearing and seeing the large aircraft fly over her home.  One evening the couple felt a vibration which was different from the normal aircraft. Actually the vibration traveled straight through their bodies. Thinking something was not right they went to their living room window which had a beautiful view of the city. What they saw was certainly unusual. The brightest object passed right overhead. The witness told me that it looked like burning magnesium as this was the best example the lady was able to think of. Whatever it was, was extremely large and very bright. The woman said it was a brilliant blue/white in color and it was blinking, or pulsating off and on. When it pulsed off they were not able to see anything until the light returned and it was only the bright light which was seen.  As it moved slowly through the night sky the object came to a stop over southern Brisbane. It was at this point high up in the sky it again disappeared due to the light going out and when the light returned the object was in a completely different location. It all happened so quickly they wondered how it was possible that any craft was able to move so fast and so far away from it's last location. This continued for some time, blinking off and on and again appearing in a different part of the sky. The lady said they watched the object for an hour and a half. Just before it left the airspace it was in, the object split into two separate lights. Both of them were now blinking on and off and the colors were amazing she said. She also added the object was shooting off what looked like flares and again these were colored as well. After a short time the two parts joined into one large object again then split into four pieces and now throwing off a large number of what they described as colored flares. Once again all the four separate parts came together forming one large brilliant object and started flying westward towards the desert. The witness said it was very exciting to watch from their veranda.  The lady went on to say they knew it wasn't anything that mankind had as she knew of no technology that would be able to perform the aerial acrobatics this object had done that night in a split second.  Something interesting the lady also mentioned was that the international airport had flights arriving and departing approximately every fifteen minutes. She said for the whole time the object sat over Brisbane there was not a flight to be seen coming or going or flying above. As the lady reported above..... the object left, heading west into the desert over the Great Dividing Mountain Range. She was so excited at what she had seen she could not go to bed. It was a warm night so she sat looking toward the mountain where the object had headed. Approximately thirty minutes after the object was out of her sight a group of lights appeared in the distance where the object was last seen. The lights were coming closer and it appeared that they were following the same track the object was traveling, just back tracking. As the lights drew closer and then passed right over top of their apartment the woman was able to see and hear what these objects were. There were four or five military helicopters that were flying in overhead.  After the helicopters passed by and out of her sight the normal air traffic resumed their flights.  The witness called the airport the following day and the folks there denied that something had taken place the night before. There was nothing in the local newspapers or on radio or television. The folks wondered if they had been the only ones watching the drama unfold in the skies that night. They never did find out what it was or find any other people who may have watched the same event.

A fellow called me from Prince George today (February 7, 2004) as he had a story to tell me over a sighting that he and a friend of his had back in 1985 while working in Houston and the Burns Lake areas. Due to his occupation the gentleman had to travel back and forth at that time between towns.  They were working on contracts at two different jobs. One late night, around midnight they were on their way back to Houston from Burns Lake, B.C. and were about 5 kilometers east of Houston. There is a long straight stretch before you climb a small long hill on Highway #16 which takes you right into the town of Houston. While traveling on this straight part of the Highway the witnesses passed the local golf course, looking straight in front of them and a little to their right, sits Mount Harry Davis.  On top of the mountain there sits the VOR (Visual Omni Range), at this point on the drive both men watched a large bright, white object rise from the VOR vertically into the air. They wondered if it might have been a helicopter with one bright light on it, but they soon ruled this out due to what the object did next. When the light/object reached a certain point in the night sky, it split into two balls of light and each ball of light ""shot"" off at an incredible rate of speed in different direction. The witnesses were so surprised that they stopped their truck in the middle of the highway, flew open their doors and stood watching this event unfold.  Both men started looking at one another wondering what it was they just witnessed as it was so very unusual.  They were so curious to know what was up at the top of the mountain, plus they wanted to look around for any sign that something may have been there, that shouldn't have been, they drove up the winding road on Mount Harry Davis and finally reached the VOR on top of the mountain. Nothing unusual was noted around the area, but they sure were baffled at what they saw the night before.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

My nephew and I  were driving on a remote hightway in the mountains of Colorado between Durango and Pagosa Srings, Coloradoat 11:45 PM.  This is a secluded stretch of highway where the mountains come down to the road on both sides.  My 23 year old nephew who is an areonautical engineer was driving while I was keeping a lookout for elk on the highway.  All of a sudden, the highway above and ahead of us for several hundred yards was lit like with street lights, although the light was indescribably soft and misty.  It did not alarm us.  Knowing this stretch of the road I knew there were no highway lights but accepted them and then looked up through the windshield to see their source.  There was a car coming from the opposite direction about a quarter mile away.  As I looked up through the windshield, I saw a huge round disc like soft light with grey metalic material surrounding it.  Then, I looked down the road above us and was able to count seven similiar lights.  They seemed to be approximately 40-50 ft. in diameter and about 100 feet above us.  I had just finished counting the lights when the object disappeared in a beautiful curving motion.  I then looked up in the clear dark sky and saw the object which in a split second went from something that seemed 400-500 yards long to a tiny two inch object way up in the sky where all we could see were the row of lights.  Then it disappeared.  I told my nephew not to discuss what we experienced until we got home 15 minutes later and wrote down our observations.  Our observations were identical with the exception that my nephew thought the object was only about 75 feet above our car.  The next morning we went to the local Pagosa Springs airport and talked with the airport manager.  He said a neighbor of his had a similar long lighted object hover over their home which was about 35 miles from our encounter.  WE reported our sighting to the local Sheriffs office.  After thinking about the experience, it was obvious that the UFO was traveling the same speed as our car (about 45 MPH), as the lights appeared to be stationary.",2004-03-17T00:00:00,37.3442,-107.0802

We worked rotating shifts and different areas of the base and this particular night I was assigned to work the ""South 40"" area, which was campsite area on the south side of the base. There were no campers in the area but I sat at the perimeter fence at a gate house with my engine off, lights off observing the stillness of the night. It was completely dark in the area but in the distance you could see lights of other buildings on the base. I was looking in an east direction toward a building where they worked on aircraft inside the building. Just south of that building was a building they tested jet engines at times during the night time. As I was setting there I noticed a lighted object over the top of the mile long building where they worked on planes. This particular building was approximately a mile and a half away from me but you could see the top of the mile long structure. Like I said it was dark and I KNOW for a fact the only lights the building ever had on top were the lights on the four corners of the building. In the center of the building I noticed a variety of lights but NOT blinking like the red flashing lights on the corners of the building. These lights were red, green and blue. I can remember there appeared to be about a dozen lights on the object. I could not see the size or shape of the object. During the night time you could always hear planes taking off or landing. You could at times hear helicopters in the area but this night I couldn't hear any noise at all from that direction. I kept my eyes glued on those lights and after about 3 minutes the lights disappeared. I was totally freaked out. I wondered to myself, ""Did I actually see a UFO?"" I didn't report it to headquarters because the police dispatcher would think I was crazy. After seeing the object I sat there staring at the building and couldn't see the object anymore. About 10 minutes later the police dispatcher called VIA 2 way radio and told me to call him. I was setting at the guard shack and used the telephone there to call. The first thing he asked me was where I was. I told him I was setting in the South 40 area at the gate shack. He, along with the other officers that worked that area knew when you worked nights there wouldn't be any noise. The dispatcher asked me if I had seen anything unusual just recently. I told him no but I asked him why and when. He then told me the residents in the Midwest City, Del City area had witnessed odd lights over that particular building and had called their respective police department who in turn called my police dept since it was on the Air Force Base. That is when I told him I DID see something and the object didn't make any noise at all. That is the only time I had ever witnessed anything like that but since others actually had seen the same thing I did I now DO believe there are UFO's.

Date: Fall -1991  Time: approx: 10:45 p.m.  A couple were driving home to Prince George after a day's outing in Fort St. James. As they traveled along Highway # 16 east and passed a well known tourist spot called Bednesti Lake, the passenger, the husband's wife, commented to her husband about where a light was coming from? A white light seemed to be reflecting off the hood of their car.  When she first took notice of the light it wasn't all that bright, but what got her wondering was they were traveling in a totally darkened out area along the highway. As they drove along the light grew brighter and brighter. It was engulfing the vehicle. The husband started slowing down because the bright light was actually making it difficult to continue. The passenger got up the nerve to lean forward and look out and up to see where the light source was coming from. All the lady was able to see was a beam of light, or just a brightenss which had engulfed the whole vehicle at this point. She said it was blinding to her eyes and it stayed right with them.  The witness said whatever it was followed them for a number of kilometers down the highway. Finally, because it was exceedingly difficult to see where they were headed, the husband pulled the car over to the side of the road, got out and as soon as he did the light went out. They did not hear any sound at all. They even thought it was a helicopter when it first appeared, but got very frightened as it paced with them for so long.  When the couple finally arrived home safely, they got up the next morning, the wife turned on the radio and while listening in she heard a news story about a man who called the radio station to report seeing an unusual beam of light shining down onto the highway the night before. Of course, the man who had made the report had no idea what the couple had experienced.  This incident happened a number of years ago, but it was still very fresh in the ladies mind when she was telling me the story. The woman mentioned it was very overcast that evening. Even when the passenger looked up through the front windshield the light was so bright it was to hard to see anything. It was extremely difficult to know if there was a craft of some sort above them, if it was below or above the cloud ceiling. I was told it must have been a narrow beam as it did not light up much of the surrounding area, but mainly lit up the outside, and inside of the car.  I would like to thank the people for their report.

I reacted by not moving at first and looking at it for about 10 seconds. It didn't have a specific color. It looked more mechanical than natural green color. It had a small antenni on the head.

I did that and I woke her up  and explained that there is ""something"" up there and that I did know what it was. She said that it is probably just a mouse and offered to walk upstairs on the 2nd floor where I had a bed and check the room out.

I am interested to know if anyone else has seen similar.",2004-03-17T00:00:00,42.14263184079602,-75.90816368159204

A lady called from Prince George, British Columbia to tell me of a sighting she, her husband, her brother and his wife had when they were camping at Stone Creek on the Fraser River as they went to do some salmon fishing.  The campers were approximately 40 kilometers south from Prince George. Due to it being rather chilly out that evening they lit a nice camp fire to keep warm and talk about the days events. She said it was a beautiful night as the sky was clear and they were able to view the stars above.  The witness said way in the distance to the north you were able to see the sky lit up from the city lights in Prince George. Straight in front of them was the Fraser River and across on the other bank was a tall stretch of trees. Approximately 100 feet above the tops of the trees sat a ""huge"", pulsating glowing orange/yellow ball of light which appeared to be swaying slightly. They said it came out of nowhere !! Looking at something so large and very close they all got frightened and all asked one another what is that.  The light stayed in it's position for a while and then it started moving away in the opposite direction from the witnesses towards the southwest rather quickly. Also the lady said there was no sound coming from the object, yet they could hear the odd car traveling the highway. The estimated the object to be twice a large as a full moon and of course as it moved further away is grew smaller in size due to the distance between the witnesses and the object. Something else she told me, as the circular object moved away, it did not shoot high into the night sky, but flew away in a straight line. I asked if the object lit up the area, she said no.  Everyone figured they observed it for approximately a couple of minutes, although the witness felt they had watched it for a life time due to the strangeness of it. They were going to check the fishing nets that were set that night, but after seeing this thing, they did not want to go anywhere near the river and went back to the tents. When they all returned home the next day the woman called the local Prince George radio station and told them what they had witnessed, as she wanted to know if anyone else had reported the same object, but no reports came in.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.

I just found this sight and thought I would report what I saw about a year and a half ago. I dont know if it was a UFO but it was definitely something I have never seen in the sky before. I live in a rural area in northeast Nebraska so it gets real dark and quiet at night. One evening I was doing some work in my shop and I heard a faint rumbling noise outside. I decided to step outside and see what it was. Its pretty normal for me to hear the rumble of high altitude commercial airplanes or the occasional ""thump thump"" of medical helicoptors traveling to hospitals between towns. When I looked outside to see where the sound was comming from i saw a large boxy/rectangular shaped craft flying approximately 500-1500 feet above the ground a little to the south of me. It came from the east and traveled west. There were several lights on this craft, some in front some in back and some on top, more than a typical plane or helicoptor. I stood there a minute or so looking at this thing trying to figure out what it was. It moved about the speed of a helicoptor but without the normal ""thump thump"" sound. The best way for me to describe this craft was that it resembled a semi tractor with its boxy shape and lights. I went inside and grabbed my binoculars. When I came out I followed it to the west for about 5 minutes with my binoculars until it was out of sight. I tried to see if it had wings or helicoptor blades or some kind of recognizable outline. All I could make out of the shape was the form of the lights. A boxy shape. I thought to myself that the whole incident was quite odd so I went back to work in my shop. About an hour later I heard another rumble sound and went outside to check it out. To my surprise it was the same craft traveling from the west to the east. Again I followed it with my binoculars as far as I could see to the east this time. There were no other aircraft in the air at that time, especially at that low altitude. That was the only time I have seen this thing. I figured it had to be something military but there arent any military installations that would be doing manuvers in my area that I know of. But then again who knows? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2004-03-02T00:00:00,,

Late summer of 2003, one afternoon, my wife and I were traveling east on Franconia Springfield Parkway, Springfield, VA. Just pass the Springfield Metro (subway station) and at about 11:00 O'clock position, my wife noticed two strange cloud-like formations in the sky. She pointed these objects out to me and they were very noticeable, being that the sky was rather clear and blue. At first I thought they were hot air balloons but then I noticed that they were like vapor clouds, and somewhat thick in consistency since both were casting a shadow. The shape of these UFOs were identical to each other, their tops were circular in shape, as domes, and both had ""trails"" at their base, similar to tentacles from a jellyfish. They did not seem to move from their positions, static as they floated above. I do recall thinking that they may have been the results of an aircraft ""aerial backfires"" (if there is such a thing) spewing vaporous balls of smoky, oily residue. No sounds were emitted.

Object was roughly the size of an aircraft carrier.  Mostly rectangular in shape although with other angular features.  Lights were scattered about the surface of the craft although I don't remember any specific colors.  Here's the kicker - after viewing the object for a minute a pair of doors opened on the craft.  Doors retracted into the top and bottom of a rectangular space in the craft.  The doors were much more wide than tall.  A second craft emerged from the rectangular space, moved away from the first craft, angled slightly and moved out of sight.  I only remember the second craft was disc shaped, I don't remember the color or if it had lights.  The doors from the first craft closed and it remained hovering in place.  No sounds were emitted from either craft.  After watching this unfold over 3-4 minutes I went back to sleep thinking this is too unbelieveable to be real.  However I did pinch and shake myself to make sure I was really awake.  Told parents about my sighting the next day and a base policeman stopped by to file a report.  The policeman dismissed my sighting as a kid having a dream.  It was all too real for me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-12-09T00:00:00,48.188894318181816,-101.33489034090908

There was no noise. It was heading north & was probably heading towards the Clinton Nuclear Power Station, that had just been built. It was flying very low, just over the cars (which were many). It could NOT have been a helicopter or other conventional aircraft for several reasons. ONe fact was that the snowstorm was raging. The wind was blowing very, very hard, & each flake of snow would hit out windshield about the size of a 1/2 a dollar. No conventional aircraft could have been flying in that weather. Two, it had no wings or helecopter blades because they would have hit the trees that overhung the 4 lane street. It was using a very large, very bright searchlight. It had to be some kind of Carbon-arc light because of the brightness of the spot it prodiced on the pavement. It seemed to be using the light to nevigate. It was moving about 5 MPH at an altitude of approximately 15 feet above the pavement.  I was sitting at a red light. When the light changed to green, I continued driving (south) again & it flew right over out heads.  & because I was in the center lane, I was unable to turn around right away to follow it. I finally was able to maneuver to the left lane & turn around 2 blocks later. By then it was gone. Illinois Power had just finished building a Nuclear Power station in Clinton.

I was just a kid from a rather conservative and religious family, who didn't give much thought or attention to things outside of the normal daily routine.  I had a friend who witnessed the event with me, my next door neighbor, ((name deleted)).  She was three years younger than myself.  We were outside in the early evening playing catch the sun had just set.  The lights from the dead end street we lived on put a soft light on her yard which was next to the field.  She threw the ball up into the air, and when I looked up to get a good position on the ball I noticed a formation of helicopters traveling in a southeastern formation.  I counted six or so, which were making fast progress, in single file.  The ball hit the ground.  I commented how strange it was to see that many helicopters traveling together and in that formation when we both heard a rather deep pulsating noise which made us both look toward the field.  I yelled, ""hey, ((name deleted)), common!"" and we both ran toward the edge of the field which was just between her house and the beginning of the first row of maple and birch trees.  There it was.  In a word, huge.  I had the impression that if it were on the ground, it would be the size of two houses.  I have often wondered how high the object was off the ground and if it were larger than that, but it sounded like it was close to us based on the volume of the thing.  The noise could be described as a vibration that came in and out of the audible range ... I could feel it in my stomach.  It had a strange echo or reverb which was peculiar to my ears.  The object was a long triangle and had absolutely no features to be distingushed apart from its lights.  I observed it as a very smooth and completely black object against a dark blue night sky.  There were no wings and I could see no jet intakes, hover vents, or anything which would explain its motion ... indeed it appeared to be floating very slowly maybe 100 ft above the treeline.  The trees it seemed to be over were not impacted or moved by the object like a helicopter or hover plane would produce.  The object appeared to be moving west, slightly to the south.  It gave me the impression of something ducking behind cover and waiting for the coast to clear.  Unless it was a sharply angled triangular blimp, it had no means by which I could determine it staying airborne.  I expect I was looking at the bottom of the object, except that the angle it was moving up and westward made me think it was the side of the object.  There were two series of lights, 5 running its length (on either side, or top and bottom depending on your perspective).  Each light in the row was a different color, but corresponded to the row of ligts on the other side.  Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White. (not sure about the order).  I wanted to get a better view of the object, and began running to get a better position to observe before it moved out of our visual range due to our low obervation ground and all the tall objects around us (houses and trees) when it vanished.  No flash, to streak, no change in noise volume ... it just stopped being there.  It changed my worldview forever. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I got out of the car in order to let her out of the back seat I looked up and saw a ""V"" shaped object fly in a southerly direction over the car. It had something like 6 or more round white lights indicating the shape of the infamous ""V"". At first I thought it must be 6 helicopters flying in formation but there was no sound at all coming from the object. I have a hard time judging it's height in the sky with no frame of reference but I guess it to have been about 500'. All four of us discussed what we were seeing but had no explanation of what we saw. We went on our way to drop off a second friend and on the way to his house we saw the same object still flying in a Southerly direction even though it should have already been far away if traveling at a constant speed by the time we got to the second location. We all jumped out of the car and watched it until it disappeared out of view over the distant tree line. This object was defiantly neither an airplane nor a squadron of helicopters. We still talk about the incident and still have no explanation. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) It was in 1985. I remember the date vividly because I was on my way home to watch the Led Zeppelin reunion concert; the first of it's kind since Bonham died in 1980. I did however think that the concert had taken place in 1986 and always looked for other similar sightings that took place then. Yesterday I saw an article about Live Aid and it had July 13, 1985 listed as it's date and when I crossed referenced I noticed a similar sighting nearby in NY. I wonder if there is any connection. I live in a very rural area just 15 miles outside NYC and thought that surely others must have noticed this craft flying low over their homes but was very surprised when I heard no corroborating events. I have been looking up in wonder ever since. ((END))",2003-12-09T00:00:00,40.95070882352941,-74.18926470588235

We looked around and it was gone.  After we calmed down we discussed what we saw.  This was not a hallucination, we were not under the influence of alchahol or any drugs.  This was a long time ago and I can recall it as if it just happened and I have 4 other witnesses that would testify under oath.  I thought that this should somehow be recorded in case anybody else had seen somthing like this that night.  I have lived in the area most of my life and have never seen anything like this.  Being that this was close to Rome NY where Griffiss Air Force Base (A SAC base) there must have been some kind of radar signature.  In any event, the object was guided as it had a controlled decent, a hover and then following us.",2003-12-09T00:00:00,43.244045312500006,-75.4753296875

Have been a witness to several 'haunted' house phenomena, however.  Sighting occurred over I-485 and Johnston Road exit.  While driving, I noticed a shiny, silvery object ahead of me in the evening daylight.  It appeared to be stationary which is why it caught my attention.  Over the next 30 seconds, I approached it and got as directly underneath it as possible.  That's when I pulled off the road to get a better look.  It was a brief moment after I pulled over that the object began to move away in a very straight line at a rather moderate and constant speed.  It was small from my vantage point, but very obviously oval shaped, and silver-reflective, and appeared to be darkened in the center.  Everything about it was just odd, from it's shape, reflectiveness, the way it appeared to begin moving from a dead stop, and the way it just seemed to 'cut through' the air in an extremely straight flight path.  It was still light outside, and I could see no lights, no trails, and heard absolutely no sound (I was pulled off the highway). There is quite a bit of air traffic over this area, and as such I am rather used to seeing airplanes in the sky.  This, I can say, certainly did not look like any airplane I've seen, nor a helicopter.

I was sitting on a chair with my bach to the wall, while I was facing the view which happened to be the night sky with the river below. My friend was facing me, that is why he didn't see it. A few degrees above my line of sight, the UFO apeared. I guess it was about a 1 mile away directly infront of me. As soon as it appeared it shot in a curve to the right and slightly up and vanished. I believe I saw it from behind. It moved incredible fast and with no sound. It wasn't just some ball of light, it was quite detailed, as I said before, I think I saw it's behind, which to me was a dimond shape but I think it would have been a triangle if I had seen a top profial. On the 2 wing extremes of the UFO were 2 large white lights which made me think of the Lockhead Blackbirds jets, but the lights weren't blinding. In the middle of the object was a dull red colour. I estimate the UFO was about 15m wide and 4m tall, I couldn't see how long it was.  The Perth flight paths are over my house and were I saw the UFO. My friends house also shows from its balcony a side on view the planes decending to Perth International and Domestic Airports a few km's away. You can also see the head lights of the planes from the eastcoast comming from the horizon over the Darling ranges in the east of Perth until they get closer and closer and then bank to a side on view for their decent to the Airport. I say all this because I am completly familiar with the air traffic around Perth, what it looks like day and night, the speeds they can go, their movability and the sound all the different aircraft make. You can easily hear a passenger Jet 1 mile away as well as a lier Jet, What I saw made no sound, even at the impossible speed it moved.

I am a college professor and joined four college men on the hike near Slate Peak, the highest place you can drive in Washington state in the North Cascade mountains near the Canadian border. The 6,600 feet elevation trail head is at an old air force listening station manned in the 1940s which is now marked by an unmanned observation tower closed to the public.  Our camp was about five miles north east of the trail head on a very isolated ridge with no other campers for miles and miles. The Pasayten Wilderness is one thousand square miles. While a very large forest fire was burning in an eastern region of the wilderness, we were at a safe distance. The fire was at a much lower elevation about 35 miles east and two valleys and mountain ranges away.  The first night of our excursion, we were sitting around a small camp fire above the lake looking at a perfectly clear night sky. Then a few minutes after 11 PM we saw a bright light like an airplane in the south east above the mountain ridge skyline about 50 degrees high. It moved like a helicopter, but made no sound. It seemed to be about three or four miles away moving north west, seemingly flying above the Slate Peak observation tower.  Suddenly something shot out of the light. We were astonished. ""Did you guys see that!"", I said. Yes, all but one student agreed.  He didn't bring his glasses and couldn’t see that clearly, but the other four of us all witnessed it. It looked like a shooting star, except it shot out of the airplane-like-light down towards the south east. We immediately thought that perhaps the projectile was a shooting star that just happened to shoot behind the light at the right moment, giving an illusion that the light was the source. Then one student said, ""Yea, but what are the odds that a shooting star would appear at exactly that point?"" We agreed that the sight was amazingly poignant.  The light then appeared to be moving directly towards us, as if to fly over our lake.  And I said, ""It must be a Forest Service helicopter. Put out the fire."" There was a burn ban which I admit we were not obeying. Moments after the fire was put out with a bottle of water, the light turned away from us and moved directly east. It floated lazily, as if taking in the scenery. It did not move like a helicopter doing a job. And there was no sound. The light moved away and faded into the horizon, turning reddish as it  apparently disappeared behind the atmosphere. We witnessed the strange light for about five or six minutes.  We tried to think of what it could be. One of the group remarked that it couldn't be an airplane or jet because there was no discernable shape, no sound and looked like a single, bight ball of light, like a head light pointing at you. His father is a pilot and he seemed sure that it was not a fixed winged aircraft. We had seen Forest Service spotter aircraft looking for lightening fires all day long and could hear the roar of their engines long before we could see them. We all joked that maybe this light was a UFO.  The next day, I took out my compass and topo map and plotted what I thought was the line of flight. Then I realized that the light seemed to out line the eastern side of the wild fire about 35 miles away. Maybe it was farther away than we thought. So, I told the men that it must have been Forest Service helicopter shuttling fire fighting crews or dropping water or fire retardant.  Then on Monday evening we had another sighting. This time about 9 PM, after sun set but before you could see any stars, one of the men looked up at the same spot to the east and said, ""Look, the light is back!"" This time we saw the same intense point of light acting like an airplane flying away. We saw it for about one minute. It certainly looked exactly like the night before, except that we didn't get to watch it for very long to notice any thing strange. There was not sound.  Tuesday the weather turned to rain and thunder storm clouds obscured the night sky. We later learned that this storm caused some small fires in a valley to the north west of our lake. In the afternoon on Wednesday, we heard a helicopter approaching. Then a large K-Max helicopter flew over our lake tugging a 300 gallon scoop. It hovered over the lake, scooped up water then made a wide turn along the ridge and flew over our camp into the hills to the north to drop water on a small fire caused by the lightening the day before. In about five minutes it returned. The third time we heard it approaching we ran down to the lake to get a close up view. We were directly under the chopper as it hovered. It was huge and make a sound so loud that my ears are still ringing. We noticed blinking lights on the tail and end of the fuselage. It made five water scooping trips.  But, later we reflected on the contrast between the chopper and the light on Sunday and Monday nights. It seemed even more strange. Unlike the chopper, there was no sound. There were no blinking lights. It moved slow and funny. The projectile shooting out of it. That just could not be a helicopter.  We hiked out on Thursday to stay at a hotel before driving home to Seattle on Friday. The ski lodge hotel was catering breakfast and lunches for fire fighter crews because their base camp was a half mile away. As I paid our bill, I met a director of the ground crew operations and asked him questions about the type of aircraft fighting the fire. He said that they use Bell helicopters to shuttle the crews and K-Max choppers to scoop and drop water. I didn’t reveal why I was asking him all of these questions, but he ended by referring me to a forest service information officer at a head office in the town of Tonasket.  Then I asked one more question, ""Do the helicopters work at night?""  ""Oh, no,"" he said.  ""They have to be able to see.""",2003-08-28T00:00:00,47.69328259259259,-122.19664407407407

At first I thought it was a tiny feather drifting with the wind a few feet above my head, but on looking again I realised it was much higher, moving in a straight line and at a steady speed. Not knowing the actual size of the object it was difficult to gauge its altitude against a clear blue sky; I would hazard a guess at somewhere between 3000 and 4000 feet, but that could be way out. The object was white, but with a slightly wispy, almost transluscent appearance which gave it a somewhat  indistinct outline, hence my initial reaction that it was a feather.  I could however just make out a definite structure, the best description I can offer being that it was basically rectangular in overall planform, and consisted of what might have been a lattice of booms, which gave it an appearance rather reminiscent of an old-fashioned TV aerial.  Seen from a long distance this would explain why it looked rather vague and wispy.  It was moving assymetrically, ie set at a slight angle in relation to its direction of travel, which was from west to east. It had every appearance of steady and purposeful foward motion, and remained observable as a white speck receding into the distance for a short time after it had passed overhead.  There may well be a perfectly simple and reasonable explanation for what this object was, but at the moment my only choice is to regard it as a UFO, by which I imply nothing more than an object, apparently flying, which I was unable to identify.  After I filed my first report on our glider pilots' discussion group, another glider pilot, who that afternoon had landed in a field some 30 miles to the east of my position, reported that he and his retrieve crew had also seen the same object.  They too were unable to identify it. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) I will certainly email the guy who corroborated my sighting and suggest that he and his crew each file a report. As for the wind, at ground level it was very light, averaging about 5kts I would say, and was blowing down the E-W  runway with a little right-to-left crosswind component, so I would say somewhere around  280-285 degrees.  The object I observed was coming pretty well directly parallel to the runway, and almost overhead of it - I had to crane my neck quite a bit to watch it when it was abreast of me.  Unfortunately I don't know what the wind at altitude was; I was down to be launchpoint controller that day and had to  resign myself to spending most of the day on the ground, so only had time for one very  quick local  thermalling flight to1800 feet, then it was out with the brakes and back down again.  I suppose it's possible that the object I saw was drifting with the upper wind, but with allowance for wind  deflection I would have thought its course would have diverged more markedly from that of the surface wind if that had been so.  Furthermore, its smooth and deliberate progress across the sky was highly suggestive of something that was being propelled and/or under intelligent control - directly or remotely.  Given what appeared  on  the face of it to be (as far as I could make it out), a somewhat unaerodynamic structure, I would have also expected it to have shown at least some signs of instability if simply being blown by the wind. I might also mention that in the past couple of weeks there have been other reports of UFO sightings in this part of England.  Very near to where the other pilot landed his glider there have been reports in  the local press of people having seen strange objects in the sky, see www.daventryonline.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=696&Ar ticleID=568425   I live some 50 miles to the SE from Shenington, and our local paper also carried a report of some people  in the next town to me having seen some strange lights hovering in the sky. I hope this helps. Warm regards  ((name deleted)) ((FOLLOW-UP #2)) Perhaps I should just clarify something regarding the wind direction though - I had described the runway as 'E-W' in my reply, because as the runway in use this was the direction of take off and landing.   The object I observed was travelling pretty well directly W-E, ie downwind on a heading of approximately 90 degrees true, and only with a small divergence from the *surface* wind blowing from 280-285 degrees.  Given the effects of wind deflection I would have expected it to have been a bit more divergent from this if it was travelling with the wind at altitude. I have suggested to the other pilot that observed this object that he and his companions also file reports to you. Best wishes  ((name deleted)) ((FOLLOW-UP #3)) Peter I understand there is now an explanation for the strange object I saw last week.  I was told there was a news report  about it.  I've been trying to trace further information from the BBC website but have not  come up with anything yet.  You may well have sources you know that you can plug into to find out more particulars.  If I find out anything I will let you know, hope you can do the same and we'll see who gets there first! ((END))",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

I saw that thing today against a clear blue afternoon sky. Oddly, the only difference is that what I saw was much larger- half the size or less of a 737 jet and the body of the craft was white, not silver as depicted on the website, with a silver area/stripe down the centerline. It accelerated from a speed of about 125-150 mph to several hundred mph horizontally at an altitude of about 2500-3000 ft in less than 1-2 seconds. It did not make a sound. I expected a sonic boom. It was not shiny, had no wings, tail rudder or lights. I realize that my description - white craft with grey/silver centerline pretty much describes an airplane. That's why I did a double take after first seeing it. The color scheme seemed airplane enough...but then the shape of it, the lack of noise/exhaust/contrail/lights and it's speed and sudden acceleration made me do a double take. I've never heard of white being a stealth color either. The sun was at my back and I could see this thing clearly for at least 3-4 seconds before it rocketed out of sight. It was no airplane, chunk of space debris or naturally occurring astronomical phenomena. It maintained level flight at a very high rate of speed and fairly low altitude before I lost sight of it. I had company with me.

The fellow was kind enough to share what he and two other friends had witness on August 8, 2003 at 12:32 a.m. Also I will be hearing from the other two witnesses who were there. I will update the sighting with their information after I receive it. Also pictures are going to be emailed to me so one might determine what this thing was. The witness I talked with said he has the pictures already developed and had them handy when chatting with me. He also mentioned that the pictures did not come out all that well, but you can still see something sitting in the night sky.  The witness told me that he and a couple of close friends had just dropped off one of their buddies. As they continued down the road they came to a full stop at the street light. The witness I talked with said while at a complete stop he turned his head to the right and saw a really strange object, he then pointed in the direction the object was sitting to alert his friends what he was looking at. All the fellows at this point were stunned at what they were seeing, so they pulled the vehicle over at an arcade business to watch. Due to this object being so low they wondered if it was attached by a cable, wire, etc.. because it sat stationary in one position. At this point they grabbed the camera, got out of the vehicle and took three snap shots of it.  He told me while they stood watching the object it started to pulsate then disappeared, or blinked out. The object was sitting at approx: 250 feet (or close guess) off the ground, it was also very close to the witnesses as they estimated it to be about 6 to 7 blocks away from their position. It was cigar shaped, and solid grey in color. The total viewing time was approx: 3 to 5 minutes after they first spotted it. Also I was told that stood out from everything around them, meaning it wasn't extremely bright, but you couldn't miss it sitting in the air. I asked if any sound could be heard coming from it, the witness told me they could hear a very faint humming sound after the object blinked out. The skies were clear.  After the fellows lost sight of it they jumped back into the vehicle and drove quickly to where the object had been sitting, thinking they may be able to get another look at it. But it had vanished. He also said there is a plant, (industrial complex) and this is where the object was hovering over top of. According to the witness the object was not seen flying in any direction as I mentioned above, it blinked out after sitting stationary for the few minutes.

PD)) Curious bright pulsing light. I have been sitting on my balcony while I have been on vacation this past week, waiting for my husband to come home from work in the early morning hours. What I am seeing is what I thought was the space station but after reading more about the station I can only conclude it is not. The space station would move quickly across the sky but what I am viewing is stationary. It fades to black and increases in bright red and white lights to an almost blinding radience. i have watched it for almost an hour for the past 3 nights at the same time. It appears in the SE direction. It seems to me as a cross like shape with red lights on two sides and white pulsing lights on the other two sides. It doesn't move just sits there, fading in and out. The fading makes it appear to be rotating. I really am confused as to what I am seeing and would really like someone to tell me it is an explainable thing. My husband has seen it with me last night but didn't observe it as long as I did. It  stays there for the same time each night but I always come in after an hour and just is still there when I go back out side. There have been clear night skies with no clouds as all the other stars are visible all around. Our town is pretty small and we do not have alot of illuminating lights so it is very clear. I am stumped with this.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,51.175804166666666,-115.56967083333335

I find it very difficult to describe.  There was what appeared to be light clouds surrounding it. It was fully dark outside.  The sky showed a dark cloud bank to the north and east and partly cloudy conditions with lots of stars visible to the south with what seemed to be a light low drifting cloud cover to the west. What I saw I can only compare to the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It seemed an object made of clouds was approaching from the west, approximately a mile away judging from the landmark it seemed near.  It was round, apparently flat and very large.  Holding both my hands at arm's length would not cover it.  The outside of the circle appeared to be moving very fast with lights in the pattern of a circle, blinking somewhat in strobe fashion, and the entire circle of cloud seemed to be moving in the direction of the lights about as fast as a fan blade would move on a box fan.  Inside the outer circle of lights there was another circle of lights also moving in a circular motion, but not as fast.  The object slowly approached were we were standing.  It made no noise whatsoever.  When it was almost directly overhead I could see that the very center of this cloud phenomenon was clear and stars were visible through it.  At the point it was almost directly overhead it turned on it's side (like a tire being picked up from being flat and put into a position of function)and took off at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing into a heavy cloud bank to the north and east.  Immediately after it did so, the sky overhead became completely clear with stars visible to the west and south, as though the thrust and/or heat had disippated the clouds behind it.  This lasted about 15 minutes from first sighting to disappearance.  I don't know how many people actually saw it, as a friend had called my neighbor and told her about it. It was so quiet that we (my husb! and and myself) would never had known it was there if we had not been told.

On 12/23/03 at about 7am pacific time my wife sat down with her morning cup of coffee and looked out our livingroom window. She observed a reddish streak of light at high altitude passing overhead in an easterly direction. It did not seem to be moving rapidly. She observed it awhile and when it seemed to fall downward in a rapid rate toward the cabinet mountain range she called out to me to come see something strange. I was upstairs on my computer and after she called me a second time I came to look. By the time I looked whatever was causing this effect had apparently fallen on the Montana side of the cabinet mountains and left the appearance of a very tight funnel at its base, very red near the bottom, that reached up to the upper atmosphere. My wife was never able to discern any object, such as an airplane, as this whatever steaked across the sky. As soon as I saw the funnel or plume I got my camera and began taking digital photos. The first exposure was at 7:15:17am and the last was at 7:26:30. I took 50 exposures. I had to leave for work after the last exposure and my wife said that by 9am the sky was totally clear.

The light was flickering on and off as if an engine was struggling to turn on.  But the light didnt flicker in a pattern.  I lost sight of it falling but I continued to follow it in the direction it was falling and it reappeard still falling and flickering.  I would describe the flickering as if someone was turning on a light off and on rapidly and sporadically.  I contacted the FAA emergency line but they werent helpfull at all. I contacted 4 MAJOR Los Angeles tv news stations and they werent helpful either.

I was in our local store the other day when a fellow had seen the logo on my winter coat and asked did I belong to HBCC UFO Research. I told him I was it, ( the one looking after HBCC UFO). He started to tell me about a strange sighting he had back in 1998 when hauling logs out of the Morice Lake area which is approximately 80 kilometers southwest from Houston, B.C. I asked him if he could call me when the man found a little time. He did indeed call a couple of days later and told me what he saw that early winter morning.  The witness was driving along the Morice West Road and just came over the top of a hill. Looking straight ahead of him he saw what he described as aircraft landing lights which were sitting on the ground. The lights were extremely bright and white. There was no flashing nor did the light move. Whatever it was, it was not moving.  He also said there was no one logging in that area at that time. He also told me that a road which did lead into the area was blocked by a huge bank of snow and the road itself was covered with approximately four feet of snow. The driver said he was really curious to know what he'd seen. The logger would have liked to have stopped but seeing the roads were icy and extremely slippery, a 70 ton load, plus other logging trucks coming behind him a kilometer away he thought it best to just keep going.  The witness got on his radio and asked the drivers behind him if anyone was doing any forestry work where he saw the light. Everyone called back telling him there was nothing in the area. (It would be doubtful that it would have been a helicopter at that time of the morning). Also I asked if it could have been a snowmobile and he told me no. There were no signs of anyone going in along the snow covered road and that was the only access to the area where the light was. He told me all areas around where the light was sitting was dense forest.  As some of the truck operators drove up over the hill they too were able to see the light and found it very unusual. It was a clear cold night and the northern lights were dancing across the sky.

Hello Brian.  I have an account I would like to share with you. I live just 30 miles south of Huntsville and have seen some strange objects in the sky where I live. Since you listed the pilots reports about some of their strange sightings I would like to share with you what I saw one winter eve. On Feb. 10, 1999 that night at 8:15 p.m. central I was outside enjoying the clear skies and beautiful stars evident in the winter months.  I was watching what appeared to be a commercial airliner traverse the skies from south to north towards Huntsville. As the airliner got to approx. 45 degrees above horizon while I was fixed watching it, suddenly a brilliant white ""star"" like object (round and approx. 4-8 feet in diameter) just appeared out of nowhere above and behind the airliner. It just blinked on and was at a estimated distance of perhaps 5-8 miles in the planes 9:00 position.  The light was motionless (for maybe .2-.3 second) after appearing then it zoomed down to the planes port side to a distance of approx. 1/4 mile away from the planes wing and the same apparent altitude. Once it reached this position it paced along the left side at the same speed as the airliner. I ran inside and got my wife and kids to come and watch as the object remained along side the plane until out of sight. The amazing thing about this incident was the objects speed. I've since given thought and some calculations as to the speed the object moved.  Since looking into the vastness of the space makes it difficult to determine exact distances but speculating distances and time the object traveled I surmised the object was at least 5 miles and possible as much as 8 miles away (assuming the airliner was at a typical altitude of between 28,000-32,000 ft. as a reference of distance from object to plane) and took only .3-.4 second to make up the distance that would equate to a velocity of between 45,000 to 96,000 mph. Pretty amazing to watch an object go from zero to 96,000 mph in an instant. The area where I live has in the past been a hot bed of UFO activity. One world known event occurred in Fyffe AL (1991 I think) where a cylindrical object was seen by hundreds of people including friends of mine. The object hovered over pastures where cattle mutilations were found the following day. One of my friends watched one eve coming home from work as it hovered and maneuvered slowly over a wooded area near Blountsville AL and shined a brilliant red beam to the ground. The next day the area was taped off with yellow tape and a crew resembling a bio-hazard team was scouring the area.  I have done some research into older cases that date back to the early forties and before. One was a coworker of my wife that saw a disc shaped object hovering above their farms pasture. Once the man (a boy of 10 at the time) approached the object it instantly disappeared. He described it as metallic brushed aluminum color, 40' in diameter and 10-12 feet thick as a perfect disc shaped and top/bottom equidistant from the center edge. This occurred in 1942. Another incident dating to 1938 where another acquaintance and a buddy was deer hunting in eastern Tennessee and saw a large disc craft between two mountains as he described ""down in a deep hollow"" move slowly below mountain peeks as if searching for something (wildlife?). I tried to shake him in his conviction to see if he would stick with his story and he told me ""so help me God we saw this......and we didn't tell anybody for a long time.""  I am convinced that our government knows more than they are sharing.  Thanks for your time.  Thank you to the witness for this wonderful report.

Date: February 2001 Time: evening  I received a telephone call from a woman who resides in Calgary, Alberta. The family has a very good view of the city of Calgary. One evening the family watched a craft over top of Calgary back in 2001. They reported observing an object for approximately two hours. The lady told me the family got a new telescope for Christmas and this evening in February was the first time they really tried it out. It was cold outside so they set the telescope up indoors and viewed the skies from the comfort of their home looking through one of their large living room windows. The lights were turned off as they did not want to have their view obscured.  The family noticed a bright object high in the sky and first thought it may have been the planet Venus. So they turned the telescope slightly to have a peek at it. (At this point I should tell you that the weather conditions were good and the skies clear and the temperature down to about minus 29).  As they lined up the telescope using the view finder and then looked through the scope they were surprised to see an object which was shrouded in clouds. There were no other clouds visible in the sky that they noticed. The object that was witnessed had an elliptical shape to it. One end of it was poking out of the cloud cover and they were surprised to see windows on the craft. She said she could clearly see through the telescope that the object had windows which ran down along its side.  The lady said it looked as if whatever this was, was trying to impersonate a star. The object would move around the sky very slowly and if anyone on the ground would have seen it, they may have just thought it to be a star or planet. She said it was very high up in altitude. After taking roughly a five minute break from looking through their telescope she came back and now viewed two bright objects. One was stationary over top of the other and offset by half the length of one of the crafts. Both objects still wrapped in a cloud cover and she saw a long tube which was connecting the two objects at roughly a forty five degree angle. The woman said it was a beautiful, cylindrical shaped tube wrapped in cloud. Also it was reported that the cloud cover stuck very close to the shape of the objects and not spread out across the sky.  It was the bottom object, or the end which was sticking out of the cloud cover that she could see had windows, which were the same shape of the objects or roundish. When the objects moved directly overhead of Calgary all of the electricity went out. When the objects moved to the outskirts of the city the power came back on and eventually the crafts moved out of sight. The lady said it was a very exciting night and one they would never forget.

All three of them claimed to have experienced some respiratory discomfort after this incident.I have lived in teh Trail/Nelson/Castlegar region for many years and have never seen a military aircraft in the area aside from an airshow.

I was kind of scared to look outside, but I did anyway, so I look out my living room window, and see just stars, but right as I was about to look away, I saw the stars moving!! I look back up, and I realize that there was a huge huge aircraft that seemed to be trying to cloak itself. at the beginning, it had a pointed shape, and the rest of it I really couldn't tell. It flew very very slowly over my house. It seemed to create a shadow over my neighborhood. So I went to the backyard to get a better look at it. If it weren't flying so slow, I wouldn't have been able to see the outline of the ship. all the stars that I saw, I think were the lights of the u.f.o.. Part of its cloaking device.

The most bizarre one though was in the summer - late July 2001. I was sleeping outside with my two kids - 10/6 under the stars in the back yard. We have a very private backyard - lots of trees/terraces and up against the mountain. The view from the yard is great, with the lake and the City below. It was totally clear warm mid-summers night and we looked at the various constellations and spotted satellites and fell asleep at about midnight.I woke up in the middle of the night - about 2:00 a.m., and immediately had a notion for whatever reason to turn my head and look to the north. I saw what appeared to be an extremely bright object traversing the sky in a north to south direction. I thought at first it was an extremely low satellite as it had no flashing lights whatsoever, just a continuous bright light like a streetlight again at about 100 yards or so. But it was so bright I wasn't really sure what it was. There was no noticeable noise. All of a sudden after watching for about 8-10 seconds, the object seemed to stop about halfway across the open sky, and either slowly went out - just like turning off a TV that is heated up - the light/picture goes very rapidly smaller, or it just took off at an extreme speed in the opposite direction. This all took place in a span of maybe 15 seconds. When it ""disappeared"", my daughter who was unbeknownst to me awake and obviously observing the same thing, commented ""Dad, what was that"" and ""I'm really scared right now"". I also experienced a very odd sensation right after the sighting. It felt eerie to me. Almost a feeling of dread. We all went quickly inside the house that night - ending our big camp-out.

It hovered silently underneath a cloud and then moved slowly Westerly for maybe 10 km and then again remained stationary.  Clearly there was no rotor blades and no noise(helicopters are very noisy even at a distance).  It appeared to turn from shiny silver to black (maybe because of the effect of the clouds).

Date: June 13, 2002 Time: 9:15 p.m. Email report: HBCC UFO Research followed up by placing a phone call to the witness. Video footage taken of the event.  Witnesses Email Report below...  On June 13, 2002 I video-taped a round dark object in the sky, my kids had noticed as we sat in our hot tub just after 9:00 p.m. The object sat motionless until I started filming. Then it darted in and out of clouds, also back and forth as I tried to follow it. This was a very scary experience for my kids. I live in Hayward, Ca. and noticed on your website another sighting in the area. I've never witnessed anything of this shape or speed in my life. I just want to get a professional opinion from someone else. Any ideas?  Telephone follow up below:  I had a pleasant conversation with the witness on the telephone. He described in detail what he and two other family members has witnessed on June 13, 2002. The man said it was something he had never saw before and was stunned at what they were observing. The fellow explained that on the night of the sighting he and the family were spending an evening in the hot tub and his daughter was playing a game , who could spot the most airplanes flying over head. The gentleman said that it is an active area due to two airports which are fairly close by. The Oakland and the Hayward airports.  It was the daughter who first spotted the object and said ""there is a plane"". The man's son looked and said he didn't believe it was a plane. The son asked his father to look at the object in the night sky. When he looked up to see what the kids were looking at he saw a black spot which was just sitting stationary in the sky just below the cloud cover. They all could see the clouds moving but the dark object stayed in the same spot, not moving. They all wondered what could this be as it certainly looked unusual and it sat in the one position for approximately one minute and again it was not moving. Some quick thinking on the Dad's part ... had him running into their home and grabbing a video camera which was sitting on the kitchen table. He ran back outside with it. He had borrowed it from a close friend a couple of days prior to this sighting to take some footage of everyday things. Also not being really familiar with the camera he was trying his best to catch what he could of the object.  As he lined the camera up on the object, it started to move very quickly. It would duck into the cloud cover then pop back out. It continued doing this a couple of times but always remaining in the original area, not moving any distance from where they first noticed it. It was night and I wondered how they were able to see a dark object against a blackened sky. The witness said, even though it was dark out you were able to see a whiteness of the clouds and the dark object which sat below them. So it was the lightened backdrop which enabled the family to see the darkened craft.  At one point the object moved into a darker cloud and as everyone watched it .... the cloud started swirling around and seemed to pull more of the surrounding cloud into the swirling motion. As it was doing this the cloud was growing darker. Again the object poked out from the cloud just slightly and moved back in again and this is when they all witnessed a strobing light coming from inside the cloud cover with the cloud starting to move closer in the direction of the family until it stopped and pretty much straight away moved back to it's original place. The total length of this sighting was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The fellow said all the time they spent outside that evening they had not seen any other aircraft in the area.  The man called the Hayward airport to make an enquiry about what they saw. The folks at the airport told him there were no flights going out that night. The witness felt that was rather unusual in itself. He thought maybe because the weather conditions were not that good and socked in very badly, that this may be the reason why no flights left that evening.  A still picture was made and blown up from the footage at one of the local universities. The Astronomy Department of the University and others checked the photograph out and saw that there was an object in the photo but no one could figure out what it was. So again the witness was left with no answers to this puzzling sighting.  The fellow told me after the sighting was over, they all went into the house as it certainly was a bit frightening to see such a strange sight. He told me he just paced around the home and wasn't at all sure what he was going to tell everyone about what they had seen and videotaped that night.

Date: Late August 2002 Time: approximately 3:00 p.m. email report  Shape of objects: disc, circular  It happened late August. I live in Manitoba (Canada) and just to the Southwest corner of Riding Mountain National Park are a few lakes. I stay at a northern Lake. It was approx. 3:00 p.m... Variable cloud, otherwise a very clear sky. I had been out fishing for a few hours that day and the fish were slow at biting from the heat of summer. I was just about to come in to the shoreline somewhat from the center of the lake. I reeled in and set the rod in the boat. I felt a strong gust of wind, having been fairly calm all that day and week.  It caused me to look up to the sky, suddenly there directly above me stationary in the sky was a silver disc object. The blue sky in contrast for the background. I could see the edge of a cloud float by above the disc, then blue sky again. It was up a distance in altitude but not to the clouds. I was rather shocked, it is not what you expect to see.  The first thought: I was just seeing things, quickly I realized that what I was looking at was really there. I was in awe, my heart was racing..it was there for 1 to 2 minutes then it went straight up. The accent was different from any flying machine that I know of. It had instantaneous movement and it was very smooth. There was no contrail of any sort..nor was there any sounds from it, not that I could hear (the boat was idling) the ship (object) itself was not huge but not small from what I could see. I also noticed it to be smooth, but it was not close enough for any other details to be revealed. The lake where the sighting took place is rather secluded and the are very few people there during the week days. It seems the classic scenario, perhaps it is..  I will be spending my entire spring and summer out there this year. I hope for another if not a close encounter. I will let you know if I do. It is strange, people, they just look at me as if I am weird or nuts. I want to shake them and make them open their eyes. But all I do is smile and tell them it is true. If you have any questions, or feel that I have missed something out. Please feel free to drop me a line as I said I will be around until Spring.  thanks.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Additional Information:  The object ..the thought..was not even in my mind until I looked up and saw what was up above.. the summer week was hot lifeless air..no wind at all..I looked up to see if a storm was coming or something . Only then did I realize that I was not by myself.  There were no lights that I could see...just a smooth silver disc object in the sky above me.  As mentioned the object was not close enough to reveal any other details to me...it seemed to be smooth in texture....but again...I feel I was not close enough.  When I first looked up..and saw the object...I began trying to figure out what I was looking at ....as the fact became more evident..my heart race increased and my breathing was more...intense...any other effects would more than likely be do to the increase breathing.  The boat was sitting in the water ...I was standing in the boat watching it..above me...from what I could see...it remained stationary for the entire time....then....wow....the way it moved...it was exciting...like watching a brand new concept.. and taking it all in, in awe. The craft was in motion instantly...no speed increase....just speed.  It's own shadow was evident on the north side of the object..as for reflection of light..there was a slight glint off it a couple times.

About 2 miles father along it, or another, reappeared and a second appeared along side it and after about 30 seconds they winked out one at a time.  Within a couple of minutes I turned right onto COR17 and then left onto the road my farm is located on which runs South West probably a bit more south so SSW.  As I cleared the hill at the beginning of the road another pair of orange balls were visible which also winked out again within 30-45 seconds.  I arrived at the farm about 19:50 and as the dogs and I exited the truck 2 or 3 orange balls illuminated to the SE in the direction of Fort Drum, NY.  These stayed illuminated for some time and I was now looking at them through a pair of 7X50 and 12X50 binoculars.  Even with he binoculars they looked round and I could see the lights of what I assumed were helicopters near them.  About 20:20 or thereabouts I called my neighbor and asked him to look in the direction of Fort Drum and tell me what he saw.  At first he said he didn't see anything but then I heard his wife say that she could see them and she redirected his gaze so that he also was seeing them.  The balls of orange were now staying illuminated for a considerable time, 10 to 15 minutes.  I called a friend of mine who lives in Governeur, NY and asked her if she could see them, she could not.  I talked to her for quite a while telling her when they were illuminated and when they were not but she never saw them.  The orange balls appeared to drift slowly downward very slowly.  While looking at them with my high powered binoculars it appeared to me that I could see a vertical smoke trail above them.  I re-called my neighbors who had seen them and asked it they could see the apparent smoke trails; they also saw them.  We then decided that they were some sort! of flares that the Army was dropping.  I watched them on and off until about 22:30 when they winked out for good.  As I recall it was a clear night and the moon came out full or nearly so. The apparent size of the balls was such that it would have taken 4 or 5 to cross the moon.  The apparent brightness was about the same as the moon.  Today whilst I was perusing your files I came across the report by the young man from Parishville, NY who saw similar orange balls over Drum in mid Sept 2003.  I started reconsidering what I had observed and although they may well have been some type of flare I could see no parachute canopy.  The apparent smoke trail was vertical which had there been a canopy above the flare one would expect that the smoke would have been dispersed or disturbed somewhat.  I have had experience with  USAF ground illumination flares; they were not orange, they were the brilliant white of burning magnesium.  With all of the night vision optics used by the military today I would not expect them to be using flares.  I spent 10 years active duty in the USAF 2 of them as a weapons mechanic 2 in college and 6 as a an Astro/Aero Engineer working space track radar for a year and 5 years as a flight test instrumentation Engineer.  After leaving the USAF I worked for a pyrotechnics company for a couple of years then as an Electronic Engineer for the Navy, Air Force and finally the Army from which I retired in 1995 as a DoD civilian. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for his submitting such a thorough report.  We have invited him to attempt to perform triangulation on the location of the flares, and to contact local military facilities, to determine whether they might have launched flares on this date.

Saw one light high in the sky directly over my house. I thought it could be a satellite until it excellerated and performed a sharp 180 degree u-turn at high speed. That is when I took notice to a group of five lights matching the movement one at a time. The lights seem to chase each other in an erractic dog-fight style manuver as they flew from north to south in direction. The first light would excellerate, turn immediately in the opposite direction and stop. Then the next light would perform the same manuevur and stop in a formation type pattern. I thought the formation looked a lot like the big-dipper. I thought I haven't seen anything excellerate, make an 180 degree turn and stop. At that point, I ran inside and yelled for the family to come outside and view the UFOs. My wife saw the lights and remarked that they were UFOs, because she couldn't tell what it was. My daughter (10 yrs old) yelled we are being invaded and she sat down on the ground in fear. Later she asked me if they were trying to tell us something because of the formation they kept returning to. My two young boys just watched and never really said anything about it. I told my friends about it. Later, my cousin told me he saw a news report about a person who saw the same thing, but he was in Las Vegas.

I thought it will be cool to videotape the eclipse session which it was a beautiful cold night. I observed on the TV screen while recording something flying by enough to watch it on TV (Monitor) passing the eclipse, It seem closer to me than next to the moon. I could not see it with naked eye, which I am near sighted and wear glasses, they were not glowing or shining, nothing blinking that I could see. I know colors don’t show up on B/W cameras, I’m not saying that it was UFO’s but it drew my attention and excludes the fact that there were not airliners. Where I am the airliners fly low pass my home heading to Newark Airport, also there is La Guardia, JFK airports in NY as well. Here is the clincher; these objects were almost one after another, within 3 to 8 seconds apart passing the same direction approx. 8 that I saw on the TV Monitor. It was spooky at first then I could not see the objects anymore. Since I had the window open I was getting really cold so few moments later I stopped and shut the window. I then rewind the tape and sure enough there it was on tape. It may be meteors or debris or I don’t know. What made me write this today was I saw the other post from Parker town NJ which is about 75 miles south East and Bridgewater NJ is about 18 miles North West from me. Did they see the same thing as I did? I cannot make an accurate decision as what shape these objects were. There were passing slow enough to see something passing by (Very Obvious). The time maybe off a little and yes the video was date time stamped. The view of the moon that I saw the passing objects was lower right meaning if you look at the moon it will be around 4:00 in direction. Oh well I have it on video so I will show it around.

At first I thought it was like a ""balloon"" much, much larger than a child's balloon compared to the size of cloud and how I visually saw object. I am sorry I could not give approximate height since I am not knowlegable about estimating such! As I continued to observe object it descended in a zig-zag, stair-step fashion down to the west across front of cloud right to the very center and middle of the puka hole in the cloud holding steady. It did not appear like the marijuana eradication black helicopters here...was not long shape and did not have rotors, just black and round. Seemed to high up in the sky and clouds to be a helicopter really.  Then in just a few seconds time it zipped down from the puka-hole and off to the west past the cloud and completely disappeared and no longer visible in the cloud or sky. This was rather startling as I expected to still be able to see it, whereas, it did a fast vanishing motion. I kept watch on the cloud and sky looking for it. Then totally unexpectedly it did reappear again from the east portion of the cloud, gradually coming out of the cloud and then fading back into the cloud. This left me with a rather disturbing feeling. I know the viewing time was 4 minutes long as I timed it on my stopwatch.

As they were heading back home, taking Highway #40 between Montreal. This is when they all saw something very unusual. it was still light out and the fellows first thought they were watching a police helicopter staying stationary in the sky. Still thinking the object looked rather odd they slowed the vehicle and watched, eventfully they pulled the car over to the side of the road and got out to have a better look at this thing.  After they all watched it, it did start to move away and extremely fast. They knew that it could not have been a helicopter just due to the speed it was moving at. He said it may have been in the shape of a cube, or rectangular is shape. The witness told me it may have been dark in color, like charcoal. But it was hard to tell for sure. While these men were watching this strange sight, three cars and a van had already pulled off to the side of the highway on the opposite side of the road from them and were all watching the same object.

The object made absolutely no noise and hovered with no movement (perfectly still) in the air for some time. The object was completely black but due to the overcast sky we were able to make out its shape in silhouette. It was like a helicopter but with out a visible propeller and it had two large square ""pontoon"" looking things on the right and left (from where we stood it seemed as though we were looking directly at the front or back of the object but i can not say for sure). When I spoke to my friend about it again last year he said that he remembers a small flashing light on the bottom of it but I don't remember this. We were joined by a stranger an he asked ""Do you see that?"" We all started to point and talk about it when the object took of south toward the side of Queen Anne hill. More specifically, it was perfectly still no wavering-nothing, then all of a sudden with out any sound or unnecessary movement it was moving at high speeds(jet like) it did not seem to accelerate but was just going that speed. Within less then one second it reached the side of the hill, ascended to just the crest and over the hill out of our view. I would estimate it covered the ground of about 3 miles in the matter of less then two seconds making no sound. I will speak to my friend again and see if he can give me a more accurate date as I have can not remember at this time what the year was.  This is the first time that i have reported the event other then retelling the story to close friends because in the past I know little about things of this nature and well had trouble believing it myself.

First off, I have a horrible concept of time so the day and year are estimates.  However, my memory of the encounter is clear as if it happened yesterday.  If verification is needed, proof could probably be provided by contacting one of three sources.  First, one could contact The News Enterprise since a short article was ran documenting the appearance of the object.  This article noted that two witnesses had seen the object, two policemen in fact.  I've no idea if they filed an official report on the matter but contacting either the Kentucky State Police post in Hardin County or the Elizabethtown Police Department might yield further information on the subject.  As for my encounter, I was driving home very early one morning around 0200 after playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends at the comic book store I owned when I saw the object.  I was on Hutcherson lane, about a half mile off US1600 when I experienced a compelling urge to look up in the sky.  What I saw surprised me.  Hovering above a field, roughly 500 feet in the air (hard to tell depth due to visibility and no frame of reference) was a triangular shaped object that would have likely dwarfed a football field had it landed.  At first it was difficult to discern the shape of the object since it was black and I was viewing it at night, thankfully it was a clear night.  Due to the three orange/red lights, which seemed to pulse slowly, I was able to make out the silhouette of a triangle.  The craft just hovered there as I drove under it, making no noise at all.  As far as I know, the military does not have an aircraft with VTOL capability that can hover without noise for an extended amount of time.  The cops that viewed the object spotted it from Ring Road, as far as I know, I'm the only one that got a close look at the craft.  As for the article in the paper, it stated that further investigation into the matter would be handled by one of the government agencies (I forget which one they mentioned now).  A few days later after the initial article, it was determined that the ""craft"" was, in fact, reflections from the fireworks at the Heartland Festival.  I assure you, what I drove under was no reflection from fireworks (fireworks that were over well before midnight by the way), nor was I high, drunk or no medication of any kind at that time.

My military occupation was Aviation Ordnance technician. I was assigned to an EA6-B Squadron. I don’t remember the exact date this happened but it was in the month of June, I remember that because I had just started working ""Swing Crew"" (that’s the shift that starts at 23:30 and ends at 07:30) at the beginning of June. We were just doing a shift change and there was a heated discussion between the two Petty Officer First Classes that were the supervisors of each shift and it was about something to do with some duties that were not completed by the previous shift. The supervisors had all of the people from my crew and the previous crew leave the shop while they had there heated discussion. Are hanger is on the side of the base closest to the water of the Puget Sound. Are shop was a trailer type building out side the west side of the hanger on the flight line. There is a clear view of the water when on are flight line. On this night, all flight sorties were over and the field and control tower was shut down for the night, which doesn’t happen that often, and it was very dark on the flight line that night, with all the runway lights off and all. There were about five people on my shift. With the exception of my self, they headed to the ""Gedunk"" (snack-bar) in the hanger. I decided to just hangout out on the flight line and wait for the Petty Officers to get through. I walked over towards the wash rack that was to the west of are shop. It was a very clear night and some times you can see the northern lights. I had seen them from the flight line maybe a month or so earlier. I was also looking up to see if I could see any falling stars or satellites passing over. I had been out there about four or five minutes looking up and facing west, when all of a sudden I saw out of the corner of my left eye what looked like a meteor falling at what I would guess to be around a 70 degree angle towards the earth. I looked right at it and I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. It was bright white and moving very fast, I could clearly see a smoke trail following it and it was so close to where I was standing, that I could actually hear it sizzling. I was waiting for it to impact the water of the Puget Sound where it looked to be heading. All of a sudden it changed directions abruptly at what I would guess to be some where between 200 to 500 feet above the water. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, it leveled off and headed in a northwest direction. I was speech less, I felt like a panic attack was happening to me. I looked around real quickly to see if anybody was around besides me to witness what I had just seen. I didn’t see anybody and looked back at the light right away. I couldn’t believe I could still see it. I was watching it for a few more seconds now and it turned from a bright white light to a red light. A second latter two more lights split horizontally from each side and there were now three red lights in a horizontal formation moving away from me towards the horizon, a second after it split into three, it did it again and now there were five red lights in a horizontal formation. I watched them until they flew out of sight. I told the guys on my shift about what I had just witnessed and they just laughed and thought I was pulling their legs. I asked around the squadron if anybody else had seen it and somebody said that some one else was talking about seeing strange lights in the sky that night, but I didn’t find out who that was. I watched the local news the next day and there were reports of people seeing strange lights in the sky around that time. I can’t explain what I saw that night, but I know for a fact I didn’t hallucinate it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-12-09T00:00:00,,

I asked what he was seeing and he said the same thing-christmas colors. We watched for 10 min. or so and decided it wasnt moving but wasnt a star or plane also.

It soon kind of floated down below the original one and they now started moving slowly to the northeast together. The 2nd one kind of faded back to where it came from and the original now started moving. It now was holding in the northeast sky but higher up and acting funny.

I live in a mobile home I often fall asleep on the couch with the TV on and the evaporative cooler otherwise known as a swamp cooler is always on that night the airconditioner in the living room where I was on the couch was also on. The ceiling fan above me was not on. I have five small dogs two were out (out meaning having run of the house) the others were in their sleeping crates. Well the story just about ends here because I saw nothing. Here is what did happen I awoke sometime in the midmorning with all the dogs sleeping as close to my head neck area as they could muster, I was VERY groggy but was stunned to see the ceiling fan going faster than it is designed to go. I mean it was spinning wildly almost as if it would spin right off the ceiling. Still groggy and having to go to the bathroom I stood and went to the hall at which point I notice the swamp cooler was not on (I keep it on 24 hours a day) I went to switch on the hall light and got no response I looked at the swamp cooler switch and it was on. Almost forgot to mention TV was off though on when I fell asleep also I live alone.Returning from the bathroom I picked up to cordless phone and it didn't work went to the other phone and same thing.  The cable box above the TV no longer showed the time which is constant and contolled by the cable company. I felt, not sick, but like my ying and yang were off. Just out of sorts. I called my mom and arranged to go have lunch.I went out to the fuse box to flip the switch thinking something broke the circut. But there were no switches down. Flipped them all anyway. Once inside nothing came back on. Except the ceiling fan. Went to meet my mom and before I got out of the car looked in the mirror and noticed brown dried stuff from my ear down the side of my face. It was obviously dried blood. I asked my mom after cleaning area to look inside my ear she said I must have cut myself because there was a mark inside the ear. Well I don't pick or scratch at my ear and the amount of blood that had poured out was mu! ch much more than a fingernail scratch could produce. When I saw my mom she said she had been concerned because she had tried calling and the machine didn't pick up and after two days she grew worried.....TWO DAYS?? ""What do you mean two days Mom I just saw you yesterday! ""No that was two days ago this being the third day""  I am dumbfounded I slept for two full days and two full nights. Impossible!!! I would at least awaken to go to the bathroom but didn't. When I got home I called an electrical contractor friend who came out and said there was nothing wrong with the fuses and that power was still coming to the house. He couldn't figure out what was wrong. This is an electrical contractor! I felt to crummy to deal with this. So I left the house and went to a friends house and then to feed my horse. When I got home the swamp cooler was on and working as was the hall light. The tv and cable box were not on I found a few outlets that had power and plugged the tv and cable box in and much to my surprise found that they were ""fried"" as was both phones answering machine and get this the surge protector!! Fried! None of my neighbors had their power out and SDG&E said there was no spike in my area. That is all I am quite curious as to what caused this and if my ear and sleeping for a stunning two full days and nights are at all related. It is noteworthy to mention I do not take drugs and do not drink. Any insight? I am perplexed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2003-10-31T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

Upon driving from Apple Hill Farms located 10 miles east of Placerville CA heading west to Sacramento CA, I decided to exit highway 50 into Eldorado County which is approximately 30 miles or more east of Sacramento.  I had anticipated the Moon rising around that time of the evening as it was almost a perfectly dark sky with vivid stars in appearance.  The planet Mars was already up in the east-south-east direction maybe 40+ degrees [10 oclock high] above the horizon.  I made an exit from the freeway and took a main road traveling back east and found an open hill area that I could set up my camera and take some time lapse photo's of the full Moon rising.  While waiting patently for this to transform [30 minutes]the planet Mars had two neighbors that I thought to be stars in the distance to the left of it, which was nothing unusual, just as bright as your brightest star in the sky but bold.  I kept notice of the two neighbors of Mars because they were easy to behold and I didn't recognize any star pattern that they belonged to, which I'm not a serious avid star gazer.  As I was shooting the Moon rising photo's I looked serveral times at the lights [or stars] next to Mars [approx a minute at a time] and the final time I looked the two star lights begin to diminish in perfect sequence, exact correlating unison and vanished.  The receding of their light took about seven seconds to dimenish altogether in unison from their star like brightness to nothing. They never moved, completely stationary all the time, and that's why I thought they were bold bright stars setting in the sky.  I continued to check the sky to see if maybe a patch of high clouds were obscuring their visibility, and I looked for possible high fog patches passing through the sky as well, but I didn't see any of these effects. Neither of the other sky objects were affected, all the stars and the planet Mars which were within close radius of the two star lights were never affected and their brightness never diminished at all.  Th! e sky was basically clear during that time of the evening except for a few stray patches of clouds/fog sitting on the horizon when the moon begin to rise.  Although it has been over a week since I viewed this amazing specticle of objects in unison I continue to check the sky each night to make sure that the star lights I saw were not stars hidden by a sweep of the milky way and to my amazement I have yet to see those star lights or objects again, neither can I correlate any of the stars or planets in the sky to the placement of where the objects were. I'm still looking each night but I have found no resemblance of distance or pattern of objects to relate.  The Moon was rising far to the left of the planet Mars which was already up in the sky, and Mars temporary neighbors were about two tenths of the distance from Mars judging from the the total distance between the Moon and Mars.  If anyone has an explanation I would appreciate being informed. I considered maybe a satelite or orbiting objects from earth, but the star lights I witnessed were stationary through out the duration [over 30 minutes].",2003-10-31T00:00:00,38.7365,-120.8043

So on october the 12 Sunday i remember specifically because we were whining about working the next day.  My friend Greg and I were sitting in his truck facing North East. I have seen NUMEROUS shooting stars i have watched meteor showers and this was no shooting star!   So about 12:00am we were listening to music when out of the corner of my left eye From the north west direction I see a Burning red light falling SLOWLY in a parallel motion it fell so slow that i had time to look over It was intense red like it had just burned in from the atmosphere almost?   Then it stops turns the brightest of green and fly in the north east direction paralell once again and vanishes in a brilliant greenish/blue flash.  This happened in a matter of seconds but a shooting start wouldnt have give me time enough to look before it burnt out and sure as heck wouldn't have shot back into the sky!  I looked at my friend Greg and said GREG i just saw some craziness, he said huh?  He hadn't seen it, but told me he HAS scene the same type of thing in our town before, so being me i ask around to other people id say about 5 people i asked have seen some mysterious flying object here.

I often, when outside walking our dog, gaze at the night sky. We have a large piece of property out back-where you could walk around looking at the sky, without bumping into anything. I happened to see what I thought was a jet miles away- a single light moving accross the sky. About the size and brightness of a large star. As I just began to casually track its flight; my eyes picked up two other lights of the same size, moving towards the first light at what seemed like the same speed. It did not take me long to realize, that, they were all travelling towards an imaginary center point in the sky. As they approached each other, I could see that they were maintaining the same speed, and distance from each other as they got closer. When the three lights reached the center and each other; there appeared for just a few seconds-one light. Then, like a bursting firework in the sky, the one light became seven or eight, that, moved away from each other in a near perfect circle, at about the same brightness, speed and maintained distance. I watched as they disappeared, over about 20 seconds or so. Afterwards, I felt calmly elated, sort of comforting to observe this sort of show in the sky-that I still feel to this day, was meant for me to see. I went back in the house with our dog to relay my experience-which no one really paid any attention to. It didn't matter then-or now if anyone would care to hear about what I had seen.

I was in a vehicle, stopped on Highway #301 amidst work traffic heading south in Waldorf, MD. Wednesday morning, August 6, 2003.  Time was 08:27:30.  The sky consisted of unbroken gray cloud cover approximately 200 feet thick with its base at approximately 400 feet altitude.  Directly above the highway in my line of site at approximately 10 degrees elevation, a small but very bright orange light came shooting out of the cloud base approximately 1600 feet away from me.  The object's trajectory out of the cloud base was horizontal at first but immediately curved sharply downward--directly toward the ground below.  The object continued to burn steady until it passed 100 feet altitude at which time it faded out within a full second and visually ceased to exist.  Estimated speed was approximately 50 feet per second.  I was facing SW.  The object travelled at first from my right going to my left (NW to SE) before diving.  Object appeared star-like similar to Planet Venus in image size and intensity with no noticable form.  If the sighting had occurred at night, the brightness could rival a welder's torch.  Size of object was likely only a couple feet diameter.  Size and distance range was determined by using estimated altitude of cloud ceiling and elevation of object at point of exit from the cloud base.  Object was very close to intersection of Hwy. #301 and Rt. #228 in downtown Waldorf.  There were at least 200 cars between me and that intersection.  There were at least as many cars behind me, as well.  Sighting was brief and unexpected.  No one was seen stopping and getting out of their cars.  Object looked generally like a flare from a flare gun but appeared to have controlled flight, in my opinion.  I am an independant UFO investigator with many sightings to my credit and have personally determined this to be a true unknown.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,38.61199692832764,-76.90655119453925

Just a few moments ago I was looking out my window and noticed in front of a cloud something that appeared to be cylinder-shaped making tight circles.  At first I thought perhaps it was an eagle, as it did have dark edges and a lighter center, but as it circled I saw it catch the glint of the sun and shine brightly for a second.  At this point I noticed there were two of them circling round and round, in relatively stationary, tight circles.  They were likely several miles to the west of me, and I'd guess about 5000 feet up -- perhaps 1/3 of the way from horizon to zenith.  I called to my co-worker and he came over and also saw these objects.  Most of the time only one could be seen, but a couple of times the objects were seen to move in an almost synchronised fashion.  They may have been cylinder-shaped, as they tilted while circling, but from my perspective it's hard to say -- i.e. they may have been disks.  I can say with confidence, they were not airplanes.  In any case, they were fascinating to watch for approximately 5 minutes, when I lost them in a cloudbank.  A few minutes later, at exactly 1.28, I looked out and noticed a dark airplane, flying relatively low -- an old, military-looking prop plane, from west to east.  It passed my building just to the south.  Incidentally, this morning I saw a small, silent, dark oval drifting very slowly overhead from west to east out my office window, which occasionally seemed to flash a light, and I went outside to watch it; it seemed to hover and float ever so slowly (at times seeming to almost stand still) -- directly overhead.  I won't make it a separate report, but I consider it suspicious; I wished I had my binoculars with me so that I could have confirmed whether it was a balloon!  My guess is that it was not a balloon, because it was drifting very, very slowly to the east, and the clouds above were moving to the east southeast.  Hard to say.

With that in mind, i have seen something in the sky that i'm not sure if it was mars or something else. On August 6th at 10:00 p.m. i'm driving with my two sons and look toward the moon (which was in the southern sky) and directly to the bottom left (at about the 8 o'clock position) we saw a light that was flashing red. Now upon focusing with the naked eye, we could see that it was not only flashing red but also had green and white flashes which would alternate between the three. Very visible! We were very impressed with what we were seeing. We returned home after discussing it on the road and nothing more was said. Now on the next night (August 7th) i went outside in my backyard and looked at the moon again (which was super bright)  in the southern sky, and noticed once again that the red, green and white light was there, only this time at the bottom right at around the 4 o'clock position. This time i went inside and grabbed my binocculars that have 20x50mm field of view 171 ft./1000 yrds. I could see it really well other then the natural unsteadiness of holding them. I'm not sure, but it looked to me as if it was moving ever so slowly. I'm not laying money on that tho. Well, i observed this light for about an 1hr and a half untill i could'nt see it anymore for it had been moving to the west and had tree blockage. I don't know if mars or any other thing would produce lights of red, green and white which alternate. Very very distinctive. These lights were just a little bigger than a star in size, but i'm not dismissing the fact that it could have been some sort of star or anything other then a UFO.

It was just before the full eclipse, I know the time approx from reading prior when the full point was to be reached just after 8pm local. It was in the final of eclipse. I had been outside in a dark area of the yard, I had been observing the moon, mars in the south, air traffic, and was looking also for sattelites by this time, which i have several times seen after my eyes get adjusted. Looking east at the moon, at a point 10 degree south and 1 o'clock high to my position i detected movement very far up, at first i filtered it out cause it was unlike any other movement i have seen in the sky before. I had nothing to compare this too and initially dismissed it. It came from very high up, outside the atmosphere i would have to say. It moved oddly..a translucent trail..it shifted/wobbled/fluttred its way to a point se at 30 degree altitude and settled a few degrees lower. I have observed aircraft since a child at boing feild in Renton, seen the harrier, sr-71, f-18's tail dance on the tarmac at airshows, and i recall being unable to identify what i was seeing cause i had no real world anything to compare it too. I was thinking..thats not civilian, and then out loud to my partner I said ""Is that military?"" Can you see that thing, Can you see it? and she responded to an affirmative, and she asked what is it"" and i replied i dont know, keep your eyes on it. I was standing all this time and i forced myself to move so as to take bearing on it. I was having difficulty judging its size. It was either footballs feilds in size about a mile away or Really big farther away. I noticed two things right away. the whole area...just lost sound and when i made sound it went into the direction  of the craft. WHat I saw was the Back end of a craft. There was a length to it forward that i was unable to get clear veiw of, but the back end of it showed as a wide thick rectangle. there were three round areas spaced evenly apart where light of changing hot colours emitted on the extreme ends, twinkling. I could see detail of the ! structure. the surface showed no indication of conformance to aerodynamic principles of smoothness, intead it showed angular extruded surfaces. It was white surfacing. The craft reminds me of battlestar galactica craft it was flatish white and some areas were highly illuminated. The whole craft semed to shift and then it could be seen sitting where it was, or its lights went off, like it blinked or the light was bending/flashing around it. There was more than one moment where everything was black and just the six round hot lights in the sky and I thought of ballons when i realized this craft was floating in the air stationary. It took over a minute for it to come down from up high and settle where i could see itlike this and I got to see it like this for about 10 seconds at least. It did a wiggle quite visibly and it started to ease forward and then it darted ahead, I called out behind me "" It's leaving"" to my partner and sked if she was seeing it taking off and she said yes. this craft was big, very big for us to have observed it as it travelled across the southern most/east, or south portion of the sky. It increased speed in  jerk and I exclaimed verbally how fast it was and got a ya from my partner. It sped south and then angled/deflected west into clouds or ?. About a minute or two later a thing i have also never seen before came flying at low angle from the east. It was bright, lite yellow/white glowing object in or out of the clouds the light of it showed, it was not round but an angled shpe of ""glow"". it travelled in a straight line. I was moving accross the horizon so fast i puzzled if it was up close, I accept the fact that this was a large object far away travelling at very high speed. I felt rather than heard its passing, it was radiating but not at what my ears pick up maybe. i think,it too did something to the sound. It travelled from east to west like the first craft and was gone.. We waited outside listening and looking. The moon was gone and the area was now clouding over and after anothe! r 10 minutes went inside to warm, my partner started to talk about it and i said stop, you go draw what you saw and ill go draw what i saw.  We drew and  had saw the same rectangular object, we both agreed it had fluttred down. She clearly recognized it to be machinery/craft,  but was unsure initially of size and distance. we both saw the same set of three lights and the rectangle backend of the craft and some structure forward. When the craft moved forward the pair of three round ligt areas remained constant in spread apart and facing direction.  We kept asking ourselves if we had just seen what we had seen. And the answer was always yes, we were not intoxicated and the drawings proved to us we had both seen the object, which I cannot deny was clearly an intelligent or purposeful moving craft that I SAW come down from very high up hover and do a systems check or something and then move south in quickening/blink/shudders/hops forward. My Partner is a Doctoral Candidate in information sciences, I am a late 30's software consultant with a background in oilfeild exploration and commercial diving. I have good eyesight. I know that what i saw was big, came from way high up, hovered so i could see the round engine ports of some sort, and that after a breif time, it moved out at very fast speed. It was soooo obviously a space craft that i was left knowing somehow that I am primitive, stuck on a planet of socially primitive beings.  Additional details and impressions. I saw or had sense that a number of things or objects were moving around in the air, but got no clear site of them if there were, but feelings that i get when bats or birds or bees, mosquitos, came up at the time and i tried scanning a bit with my eyes, the returned to trying to focus on the craft, which could be only for a second before it twinkled, blacked out or twisted light around itself. I also felt scanned, or as if i was being watched, that is a clear unmistakable fact that i felt that, and we both expressed the fact to each other of having felt it..being looked at.  When the second craft, the glowing object, I gotta confess, I was all senses lit up and very spooked and ready. I kept us outside, quiet for long enough to establish that there wasnt imediate nearby detctable action then went in and did best to establish to myself what i had seen. After we agreed that what we saw was a spaceship, we both got quiet, she went onto the internet, I made some more checks on the night sky that was now cloudy, then sat down and went over everything I had just saw.  I am known to have a photographic memory. We both know what we saw and we are both wondering what kindof peoples are we that interplanetary society is ignoring us, or blatantly moving about so. We are evaluating everything we know in respect of implications on our ...human society with respect to why a clearly advanced society or intelligence is not being acknowledged in our common daily understanding or is about the planet and ignoring us. Are we observed to be unsociable?   Clearly this planet was visited by a spaceship on the above date and time, it is now a fact that I am going to have to live with. Being as I am relatively young something tells me that this is not the last time that I will have direct knowledge of these objects, and the implications will some how be made manifest.  I also realize now that the object moved in such ways that my brain kept trying to interject that it was not there, as it moved in speeds/shifts that i had no prior knowledge to confirm it too. I am confident now that having the experience that i can anticipate the movements of these objects and tune an movementy awareness for them, much like training the eyes to see sattellites as opposed to aircraft or stars.

A gentleman called me today, December 24, 2003 to report a sighting he had, along with two other witnesses who were in his company at the time. The witness (driver) who called is a ex military man (air defense). The first thing the witness asked, did HBCC UFO receive any reports from around 1:00 p.m. today. I told the fellow that I had not received any other than his call. He was sure that two other vehicles had observed the same object he and his passengers witnessed as the two vehicles in front of him braked the same time he did. He also mentioned that if he had of been by himself he may not have reported seeing this strange object over Airdrie. The two passengers who had an early Christmas at another home received a pair of binoculars as a gift, which I packed away with other gifts in a bag in the vehicle. The witnesses had just come out of their home and were driving down 8th Street heading south. Approximately two minutes the driver said to the passengers, what the heck it that? Approximately one kilometer away from their location they all saw what looked like a large round ball or chrome colored marble as he described it sitting stationary in the sky above a colored shack which is on the opposite side of Big Springs Road.  All of the witnesses were very excited, or in his words, freaking out as to what they were seeing. The driver told one of the passengers to grab his new binoculars so they might get a better look at this strange object. After the binoculars were located in the bag filled with gifts they zoomed in on the object. The driver slowed the vehicle down so the ones holding the binoculars could get a better view of it. The sphere did not move, it sat hovering in the one location. From when they first noticed it, they said the whole event may have lasted for approximately 15 or 20 seconds before it disappeared. It ""did not shoot off"" in any direction. It just vanished !! (blinked out) The driver who said he had worked in air defense for many years and was very familiar with what is flying in our skies, said he has never seen anything like this in his life. Also the witnesses roughly estimated the object may have been hovering at an altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. The driver later on that day ended up driving back to the shack where the object was seen hovering above. He parked his vehicle and got out and had a good look around just in case he might have been able to see it again, or to see if there may have been any physical evidence left around this area. After a short while on location he told me that he felt rather uneasy and got back into his vehicle and left the area.  After they witnesses had watched this unusual object they picked up the Airdrie Echo newspaper and spotted a new articles on a few sightings which were recently reported to the newspaper. This is how the fellow found out about myself and knew he should make a report over what they saw.

Not certain what I saw.  At first I thought it (the brightest object) was an airplane.  Then I saw another (less bright) object near it and thought they were two airplanes flying in a pattern.  The brighter object, however, did not move as far as I could tell.  I called my wife to look and she thought it was some kind of light tower but it was too high in the sky for that conclusion to make any sense.  I kept thinking, ""this has to be a plane,"" because it was near a small airport where private props and small jets land and take off.  The brightest object remained stationary for about 5 to 7 minutes while the second object seemed to go back and forth toward the brighter object.  Then I noticed a third object, less bright than the other two objects, on the other side of the  brightest object.  It too seemed to move back and forth toward the brightest object.  Finall, the object with the brightest lights seemed to veer off and the other two followed it.  Some details:  the brightest object seemed to have a long rowof lights either as headlights or side lights;  i looked at the objects with binoculars but could not make out and form;  at one point i became afraid because the  brightest like did not move as i expected.

I observed a gathering of 6 red and white pulsating objects that were in a loose formation when I first observed them. There were two outer red lights with a white light in the center of each of the objects. The formation then broke into 2 groups of 3. 3 moved to the west, the other 3 moved to the southeast. From our vantage point from a second story apartment balcony, I would estimate that the objects were approximately (at first) 15 -20 miles to the northwest at an altitude of approx. 5 - 10 thousand feet. The objects appeared to travel at a steady pace; somewhat faster than would an airliner. The westward moving objects went out of visual range within about 3 minutes. The three ojbects moving to the southeast passed just to the west of the apartment complex. It also seemed that two of the objects passing over the area where we were were gaining altitude, while the third remained at consistent level. There was no sound that could be heard from the objects. As they were passing above us, I pointed out a high flying airliner to my friend, to compare the difference of the airliner's running lights as compared to the objects. The original formation's exact location would most likely have been about 2 -3 miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis.One interesting point is that while I was in route to the apartment complex, I noticed airliners coming in to the airport on their regular flight paths with what looked to me to be extremely - almost excessive - displays of brilliant ""collision"" lights. They were so bright that when I spotted the first one, I wasn't sure if I was actually seeing an in-coming aircraft or a brilliant UFO. This would have been about 30 minutes prior to the sighting of the formation from the balcony. On my way home, at about 9 PM, I couldn't help but noticed that all large in-coming aircraft to Indianapolis International were displaying the same ""excessive"" brilliance as the ones that I had seen about an hour before. This causes me to wonder if what we saw from the ! balcony was only the final minutes of an episode that had gone on in the skies above the city for some time. I have seeen UFO's before this incident, and would like to think of myself as a seasoned ""sky watcher"". I have become familiar with aircraft standard night time appearnces and proceedures   in the area. From the points mentioned in the above despription, I would have to say that there was nothing ""standard"" regarding the brilliance of the aircraft or the appearance, movement, and formation of the unknown objects.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

I had just come outside with my dog Bippy she really like the snow.  I was about to throw a snowball out to Bippy when a big green fireball with sparks stopped me in mid-throw.  It was desending at about a 45 degree angl in the northern sky it seems to just go out right before it would have not been visible to me do treeline.  At first I thought a meteor then i thought fireworks but i know it wasn't fireworks i've never seen a meteor but i have seen shooting stars and it absolutely wasn't that.  It traveled slow and was very vivid with no sound. It did look like it could have been a flare from a flare gun but don't flares leave a big trail of smoke behind?  This had no trail only white sparks and the fireball was very green like a green intersection light.  It seemed to be farely low in the sky to my location like i could have got in my car and found it with in a few miles.  I wouldn't be so curious if it wasn't for all the very similer reports I've been reading on this site.  I'm sure i'll hear that other people saw this too.  I do remember right after the fireball went out a plane or something high in the sky moving what seemed to me to be very fast for a plane but not unGodly fast across the sky heading in the exact direction where the fireball when out but was very far away to the point where when I notice it seconds after the fireball went out I had turned completely around and was now looking south southwest the fireball was north northeast from me.  All i could really see of that was the typical light on it just like on a plane.  It just seemed to be moving faster then any plane i've ever seen in that area. mind you i've always been a night sky gazer and at the time was in the backyard of where i live and have lived for the past three years.  Never seen anything like that ever or even heard of anything like that before that.  Thats why i was surprised to see so many similiar reports.

Number of witnesses: 3  Number of objects: 3  Shape of objects: spheres email report:  I was standing in the back of the house. It was a clear morning and when I sat down to take a load off my feet I looked up to stretch my neck. I stayed like that for a bit until I realized that I was seeing something really strange. I would say that at over 60,000 feet or higher there were three spheres separating and then criss-crossing each other.  I then called to my wife and Mom to see if they could see the same thing, and they did. I wasn't imagining it, it was so spectacular that I phoned the university of British Columbia and reported it but I never heard back from them so you are the second person that knows about it now. Thanks for listening to me.  Additional Information:  I telephoned the witness back as I wanted to gather more information on the sighting these folks had back in July of 2003. What I was told was certainly interesting. In the original report which is above, the date was left out at the time the sighting report was filed, mainly because the witness was not sure when the event took place. The fellow did ask his mother as she kept a diary of some of the interesting things which take place in her life and the sighting they all had was one of these important dates to write down.  Video footage was taken of the objects. He said that there were three spheres, silver, red and green all traveling together. As the colored spheres passed by the silver object it was reflected, or the silver colored sphere changed color briefly to the color of the passing sphere. The witness said it was like a mirror image to whatever was happening around it. He said after a while the objects separated, heading off in different directions. One headed in a north-easterly direction, the other towards the west and the final sphere heading south-east.  I then talked with the gentleman's wife who gave me a good description of what she saw. The lady said she was taking her mother out when her husband called to her to come and look at the strange objects he was observing. Her first thoughts when she noticed them, was of a jet aircraft, but after watching them, she soon decided it couldn't be aircraft she was seeing. The woman said they watched the spheres for approximately 30 minutes before they finally disappeared.  She said the first sphere was silver. It looked like a shiny surface with the sun reflecting off it. Also it was noted that the silver sphere was the largest of the three. The second sphere had a reddish hue to it and the third was greenish in colour. They were unable to look at the objects for any length of time due to the brightness of the day. The lady told me she could clearly see the red sphere move towards the silver one and went behind it and disappeared. The green one also did the same thing. Eventually both of the colored spheres came out from behind the larger silver sphere and moved around the sky. The silver sphere did at times sit stationary in the sky and the colored object did the moving around. This witness said the colored spheres would at times travel down on an angle both apart from one another and that move back up towards the silver sphere. The colored spheres traveled back and forth many times to the silver object and from different directions.  What puzzled the witness, was when the objects moved off in different directions as they left their sight. They figured the wind would have carried them all in the same direction. When the objects finally were leaving the area they did so quickly.

On Saturday night, April 12, 2003 between the hours of 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM, I was on the fishing bay bridge (Pensacola side) at pillar marker number 44 just before the so called ""hump.""  I was facing directly due East with the 3/4 full moon brilliantly shining at an angle in the sky between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock; and when I was facing directly south, the moon was brilliantly shining at an angle in the sky slightly beyond 12 o'clock.  The night sky was crystal clear with no clouds in sight, and the temperature outdoors was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  While I was looking directly due east, I noticed a large, star-like object between 22 to 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, and the object appeared to be located near Navare or Fort Walton Beach.  It was flickering like a star that cyclically changed into different colors of red, green, and blue.  My first thoughts was UFO because the lights were changing in a timely color pattern.  It also appeared and felt to my perception to be inside our atmosphere, but the distant was too vastly away to make any definite identification in which I could clearly identify what I was seeing.  It almost seem like it had an oval shape to it which the elongated part of the object was facing upwards.  I was wondering to myself if I was the only person out of about a hundred people who were fishing on the bridge that night may have seen what I saw.  So in a UFO joking mood, I decided to briefly shined my floodlight for less than a few second directly towards the object as in playful mode to get the attention of whomever may be inside if it was a UFO (like who shined that light at me, somebody can see me thought) which at time I was still actually thinking it was possibly a large planet or star, and I wanted to get the attention of the people on the bridge so they might glance at the flood beam and gazes towards the direction that I saw the star-like object in the sky.  The floodlight's beam could not reach the object that I saw in the sky.  Since the object didn't move an! d it appeared to be stationary, I decided that the object I was seeing was just a large star or planet since some stars or planets do flicker and shine similar like the object that I seen.  But the object that I just described is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  It is what happened two to three minutes later after I briefly shined the flood light at the object (star). While I was still facing directly east as I was fishing and becoming bored because the fish-bites were slacking, I saw an commercial airliner appear from out of the tree line directly from the North-East slightly over the bay.  The commercial airliner began making its slow, sharp bending approach about a mile out into the bay towards Pensacola's airport for landing.  As the commercial airliner was veering towards the airport, it looked like it had a zillion lights on it.  The commercial airliner disappeared from my viewing as it approached and  descended towards the Pensacola's airport landing strip.  The commercial airliner seem like it had been escorted because about 10 to 15 seconds later, two military aircraft appeared from out of the same direction and elevation the commercial airliner had just recently appeared.  The military aircraft didn't follow the same route that the commercial airliner took while it was approaching into Pensacola's airport. Instead, they made their turns towards Navare or Fort Walton Beach separating from each other as they flew towards those cities.  They also began flying in what appeared to be a zigzagging or searching pattern.  I could clearly see the shape of the military aircraft in the moonlight.  The military aircraft also had their identification lights on which were blinking red on one side of the wing, and blinking green on the other wing.  Their strobe lights could be clearly seen all the way across the bay.  Then about  30 seconds later, I saw an object come from the same direction and elevation the commercial airliner and military aircraft had appeared.  The direction of the object was either directly from the north or from the northeast at an angle of 45 degrees above the eastern horizon heading south.  This object seem like it had just tailed the commercial airliner or the military aircraft.  This object when first spotted appeared to be only 2 miles or less away from my position or 1/8 the distant from the fishing bridge to the midway bridge which is near t! he town of Midway.  This object was horizontally traveling at the same elevation the aircraft were flying and about the similar speed of a landing commercial airline, and the object was brighter than the brightest satellites; the object's light seem like the same intensity of arc-welding, yet, it almost seem like it was glowing but in a soft glowing manner of either a pure white color or of arc light color.  I can't recall if the object reflected a mirror image of itself onto the water's surface, but I think it did since it was so brilliantly illuminating.  The object also seem like it had a solid and spherical shape similar to a globe.  If the object that I was viewing was a satellite, it was too extremely low in orbit, for I seen satellite traversing the skies in the past.  This object had no distinguishing shape such as an outline in the moonlight, nor did it create any audible sound as it approached my position.  If I was to estimate the size of this object when I saw it at its closest approach to me of about a thousand yards or less, I would say it appeared no smaller than a baseball, or no bigger than a basketball.  When I first seen this object, I wasn't expecting it and it scared the blinky-blank out of me because the first thing that entered my mind after just shining the floodlight at the star-like object was ""OH blank!  That must be a UFO scout investigating who just shined a floodlight at the mother UFO ship!""  My fear then ease to ""it must be a satellite because it looks like a satellite."" But I was still wondering until after few seconds had past then I said to myself, ""That is an awfully low satellite going really slow.  It can't possibly be a UFO.""  I was mesmerized by the object because I never seen anything like it traveling so low and slow and brilliantly illuminated.  But still this is not the main reason why I wrote this account. What really caught my attention was the fact while I was watching what I thought may be a satellite traversing the sky, the object's (satellite?) illumination just simply turned off like somebody flick the light switch to the off position once it past my two o'clock angle.  The object's light just didn't dim and fade away like other satellites that I seen in my past.  Just about a couple of miles before almost entering Gulf Breeze area, this object just instantly stopped shining its lights.  This object didn't even forwardly project a beam like a headlight beam.  I seen meteorite's in my past, and those meteorites had always left behind what I call a trailing light.  The object I saw traversing didn't have this trailing light for like I said, it originally look like a satellite.  The military aircraft never ventured into the area where I saw that traversing object where it just simply disappear in a blink of an eye after viewing it for at least 30 second to a minute. Is it possible for satellites to just instantly blink out so far away from the horizon, or what I saw that night was truly an UFO possibly posing as a satellite?  I never in my past searched for UFO's in the sky, nor did I do any UFO sighting research about past sightings of them until these events occurred, and I am still seriously skeptical about UFO's reports, but the night I saw those events still has me thinking of what type of object it was that I saw traversing the night skies, and what was it that I saw motionlessly situated except for changing color pattern near the distant horizon?  Was it just a fluke incident of nature?  About a week after the incident, I looked at some star chart for that night.  All of the viewable planets were on the West side that night, and the only bright star viewable on the east side was suppose to be way down south.  I looked at the satellite charts between the hours I saw the glowing object, but I could not find any satellite that may had been traversing during those hours I saw the glowing object that instantly disappeared before my very own eyes.  I couldn't possibly be the only person who saw this object which simply vanished into nothing with the  moonlight brilliantly shining everywhere; there were just too many people on the fishing bridge that night.  Well, I guess I'll never know what I saw, and it almost a year later and still I can't find any answers to what I saw that night.  What I wrote is the best that I could describe of what I saw on the night of April 12, 2003.",2004-03-17T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

Unfortunately I wasn't wearing my watch but feel quite certain it started before midnight, on the 27th. Something about hearing it was 11:30 as I left the Grey Creek hall to lay on the beach and star gaze. Grey Creek is north of Creston on highway 3A. It started in the northwest looking like northern lights. No color, just white light glowing in sort of horizontal bands. One and then a second a bit higher. Then the bands merged into one and sank lower on the horizon.  Then a few small vertical slashes forming above and to the north of the white glow. Then it got interesting when a fatter vertical beam began to rise out of the glow, low over the horizon, but it was no longer perfectly vertical it was leaning over to the south. Sort of about 15 degrees leaning to the left. I thought that was unusual. It looked a little weird too as it got brighter and more defined. And then expanded right across the sky, in only a few seconds! At arms length it was about two fingers wide. Perfectly straight and exactly the same intensity from one horizon to the next, and at an angle from the northwest to the southeast. I guess it could have looked cylindrical as some witnesses claimed. I didn't look two dimensional at all. More like a big fat nasty chemtrail with a light on inside.  Now I will guess that it lasted for about 15 minutes without any changes until it got a bit fatter and duller and the sharp edges began to dissolve somewhat and become blurry with little shards of light coming off it almost like it was spinning glowing particulate off of itself. Then it bent! It curved into a graceful arc to the north and stayed like that for a few minutes before snapping back to a straight line, then continuing to become duller until it faded out completely leaving absolutely no sign of itself or the northern lights it seemed to grow from.  I'm 43 yrs and have been a sky watcher my whole life and have never seen anything like this before, and I've seen some strange things believe me. I've seen lots of weird lights flying about, something in the daytime that looked like a giant pair of broken scissors and lots of really unbelievably strange clouds. Oh yes and the chemtrails with little white orbs traveling through them too.  I hope I've been some help. I live in Nelson and your welcome to phone me if you like at:  Thanks Brian and good luck with your work,  Another Report:  Hello,  I was just reading Rense.com and ran across the article about the sightings on July 27, 2003. That night I was doing sound tech work at a festival 20 min. east of Kamloops. At about 2:00 am I looked up in the sky and saw a green beam from horizon to horizon. At first I thought it was the aurora borealis but it barely moved and kept it's orientation for the two hours I observed it. My friend who was also there thought it might be some sort of chemtrail activity, or maybe a Harrp test from up in Alaska. It is the strangest thing I have ever seen.  thanks  Another Report:  Hi there.  I just read your letter to the editor in the August 15th edition of the Capital News of the Okanagan, Seeking Witnesses to UFO.  I can't be sure of the exact date, but July 27th sounds about right. I live on the Westside shore of Okanagan Lake, in Kelowna. Around the time of night you describe, I took my dog out for his walk before bed, nothing different than most nights. But as I was standing outside our fence, I noticed up in the sky, a pale horizontal beam of light, extending from the west to the east, and sort of fading beyond my sight. I live close to the hillside, so it appeared to originate from the other side of the hill, maybe in Westbank. It caught my attention because it reminded me of how years ago when they opened a grocery store up in Westbank, they had rented one of those Hollywood style spotlights, and we had seen those shining all the way over where we live. But what I saw this night wasn't as bright, nor was it panning around as one of those Hollywood ones does.  I was actually going to go inside and e-mail my friend who lives on the other side of the hill and ask him if any place on his side was having a celebration that he knew of, but I dismissed it because it seemed so pale. My other thought I decided it might be a contrail showing up vaguely from a jet that had passed in the night.  Now reading your description, I'm wondering if it was the last bits of the same beam of light seen by people in Houston. It was definitely stationary, but not prominent enough that I was able to view any rotation or black shadow within it. I'd certainly like to know if anyone else in this area saw the same thing, and I'm wishing I had told my friend about it that night!  Another Report:  I read your newspaper article about unexplained sightings on July 27/28. We have lake property at Lake Koocanusa and we are located just 5 miles from Jaffray. Between about midnight and 1:30 a.m. July 28 my daughter, son-in-law, son, daughter-in-law and myself were star gazing. We get our lounge chairs out each night and just enjoy the night sky. We first spotted a bright light in the north western sky moving in a zig zag motion. It then just disappeared like it went out. Then we saw a very large beam of light. At first we thought it was northern lights but it wasn’t in the right area. This large beam of light was still there at 1:30 when we went to bed. ( We are always joking that the UFO's are going to land because I have 28 solar lights along a 500’ beach frontage.)  Another Report:  Dear Brian Vike  I live in Vernon BC. I live in an apartment facing west to the airport in Vernon, Davis Farm is on my right and the army camp is on my left. I was reading the statements about the strange light over Kimberly. ON that night I was on my balcony watching the one ray of Northern light touch on the hill behind Davis Farm. It did not behave like a northern light. It did not oscillate, nor dance or drape like a curtain. It seemed to just slightly waver on the top of the hill and remained in one form. The direction it came was from behind and the left which is southeast. Again not a northern light. It remained the same intensity of light which reminds me of concentrated moon light. It broke and one piece remained straight and the long line started to curl up and back around like a three quarter figure eight. I am a born skywatcher and I am glad now to have a place to record these unexplainable events. There is allot of activity around Vernon.

As it passed over me (I would say at least 5000 feet, I know this because I live near an airport) I followed it with my eyes until it rested adjacent to a tree limb in the foreground and the UFO in the background. It hovered for a moment and it began to wobble. This was very apparent. It was not a plane or helicopter, and this was very apparent. It moved smoothly with no sound, and when it hovered it wobbled. After about 1 minute of it wobbling beside the tree branch, it began to descend into the horizon. I went back down the stairs and followed it to the end of my parking lot until I lost sight of it again. It was moving quite fast.  Thank you to the witness for the reports.

RCMP Report. Date: December 26, 2003 Time: approx: 11:30 p.m.  This report is a short update on the case I am working on. After the witnesses from Sicamous, B.C. contacted me over what they had saw, I immediately started an investigation into the case. I called the Sicamous RCMP Detachment and requested to speak to the Constable who attended to the call. I was told by the dispatcher that he wasn't in that day and I left a message for him to call me back at my toll free number. I did talk briefly to the dispatcher who took the call that night from the excited witnesses. He did confirm a report was made and a RCMP Constable did go to the witnesses home to see what all the fuss was about.  After several days had past I received a telephone call from the RCMP officer who drove out to take a look at what the family was reporting. (the reason why there was a delay in the officer calling me back was due to him being off for a few days)  The police officer was pleasant to talk to and we had a nice discussion. He was very helpful in providing me with information on what he saw when he arrived at the location. He was directed to where the object was sitting in the sky. At this point the witnesses said to the officer that the object had moved slightly up higher in the sky and that they had taken video of it. The constable also told me that the witnesses said that it looked more like a diamond in shape when it was lower and orange lights had kept coming and going from the object.  The RCMP constable said the witness did point out one orange colored light to him, which he admits to seeing, but he did say he did not see it move. On the large object which caught everyone's attention that night, I asked the officer if he would be able to describe this to me. He said it was stationary, blue and red lights with clear lighting, almost white light in the middle. The officer also said he did not know what it was. It could have been a number of things. The constable did look through the binoculars at the object and gave me the description of what he saw and whatever it was, was just sitting there. So the officer did see it but he cannot testify to it moving around as he did not see this happen while he was there for a short period of time. The member went back to the detachment to get a phone number for a UFO group who might want to look into the sighting and passed it along to the family. The family called a UFO group and left as message but no one returned their call.  They kept searching on internet and found HBCCUFO ...  Another update will be coming shortly with the results of what was caught on video.  If anyone in the local areas around Sicamous, Salmon Arm, Chase, Sorrento, Enderby and communities in-between have maybe noticed this object, or something else unusual in the skies would you please be kind enough to contact me with the information.

Could the phenomenon have been the shadow cast by an unusually thick contrail, do you think?  If it wasn't that, I have no idea what you witnessed.  What direction were you flying, at the time, and where was the object, relative to your position, please?  Also, how did it disappear from your sight, please?  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((END)) ((RESPONSE)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   I'll tell you all that I can remember.   It didn't look at all like a contrail, or even a shadow. It was very dark, quite opaque. If you can imagine a thick black pen mark drawn into the sky, but very crisp. I would swear on all my senses that it was solid. It wasn't above us, it seemed to be directly to the side of the plane, far off, but who knows depending on its actual size. It was stationary --hovering, if you will. It looked like a perfect tear in the sky. We were heading west, so it was to the north of us.   I can understand where you might think it was a shadow of some kind, but it was so perfectly linear, not at all hazy or smokey. Like a perfect black line segment in the sky, short and constant. After viewing it for a while, one more became clearly visible above and behind it... it seemed to be futher back but there is limited perspective in the air, as you know. The new one was slightly covered by a cloud haze though, and not as clear as the foremost one. Also, they didn't disappear, but we eventually moved out of sight.    I took the time to go through the other sightings on your website, and it seems as if at least two other reports are very similar, if not exactly, what I saw.    http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33934.html and http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32509.html   I'm also at a loss as to what it was we witnessed.

Jan 28, 2004.  At 7:20pm, while taking my dogs outside, I looked up at the moon which was approx. 70 degrees in the western sky at the time, and I noticed what I thought was a satellite traveling across the sky in an easterly direction. The object appeared to me to be the same intensity as an average star and was not blinking.  I noticed it in the western sky, and watched it move under the moon (about 3 inches under moon from my perspective) and across the sky, heading toward Orion's belt. I watched the object for 1 min before opening up the front door and calling to my boyfriend, who was on the computer at the time.  I told him I thought there was a satellite and he should come check it out.  While he was on the way outside, I watched the star-like object pass through the constellation Orion and start to fade out, as if high, thin clouds were passing over.  By the time he made it outside, I could no longer see the object in the sky. I pointed out the direction (southern sky) of where I last saw the object to my boyfriend, but he didn't see anything. I continued to watch the southern sky to see if I could spot the object again.  My boyfriend was watching the sky to the NNE and spotted an object that looked like a star moving fast across the sky in a southernly direction.  The object moved at first in a straight line, then moved erratically, and back to a straight line.  The object seemed to him to leave sort of a small trail as it moved across the sky.  I looked up to where he was seeing the object and I did not spot it.  He lost sight of it soon after and also seemed to lose interest, as he went back inside.  The duration between the time that I first spotted my object to the time that my boyfriend went back inside was approx. 5 mins. I stayed outside watching the southern sky in the direction where I lost sight of the object I was viewing.  I watched for another 5 mins. or so and spotted the object again, in the same place where it seemed to pass behind the high, thin clouds, as if it had stopped and started moving again.  This could have been another object,  I am not sure.  It was still traveling toward the east, but the intensity of the light was not as bright as before, still suggesting the cloud cover.  I immediately called for my boyfriend to come back out.  When I looked back up to the sky, I could no longer see the object. It was a very clear night, with high, thin clouds starting to appear from the SSW on the GOES-12 infrared weather satellite (I checked this 30 mins. later), but no clouds were visible from my perspective.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

The ""aircraft"" made a slight bank to its right as I approached the merge to the 91,57 I looked to my extreme left now and could tell that the ""front"" was swept back, since it was night I could not make out the exact shape but could tell that there was a structure that was aft of the wings and there was a small ""beacon"" light underneath the structure to the rear. I could not see any marker lights on top where a verticle stab. would normally be on a commercial aircraft. I can only approximate its height at around maybe 2 or 3 thousand feet up (maybe less). I could not hear any noticeable engine noise (although I was on the freeway so it would have been hard to tell).

Soon, the big displays were gone, all but the driver, front seat passenger, and myself were asleep, and I was only seeing a few personal fireworks in the air.  I noticed bright white/pale blue lights kind of ahead of us to the left.  There were three, and if you could play connect the dots they looked to be at a perftect triangle formation, then as I watched them longer, I noticed a fourth light slightly off to the right,  and the angles of the triangle formation were changing.  They were just hovering.  The one to the right at times seemed to go the middle of the fomation, and at one point I thought I had seen a fifth one, but it was gone quickly if I did.

A gentleman called on to file a report. He first told me he lives in the next town north of Airdrie, Alberta. Back in the year 2000 he was living in Calgary, Alberta and they had just purchased the home north of Airdrie. The fellow works evenings, so one night when he finished off his shift at work, he asked a good friend if he wanted to take a drive and have a look at his new home he had purchased. He told me it was a beautiful evening and they decided to take the trip to look at the new home. They headed out, both men discussing the distance they would be traveling from Calgary to the new home. The driver thought they would be traveling some 40 kilometers, but his friend thought it would be a little further then that. The driver hit the button on the odometer which set it at zero kilometers. This way they would know just how far they were about to travel one way. The two men arrived safely at their destination and had a look around and took some time talking etc... It was starting to get later into the evening so they thought it best to get back on the road heading towards home. The passenger in the vehicle mentioned to the driver that he had in-laws living in Airdrie and would it be ok if they swung by to show the driver their home.  As they drove along the highway outside of Airdrie the driver noticed some very bright lights coming up from behind them. The lights were very bright, has the passenger had turned around to look he commented on the brightness and how fast the lights were approaching them. Both men thinking this was a vehicle never gave it a lot of thought, other than these lights which were almost blinding to the driver.  Now here is where the story takes a strange twist. All of a sudden the fellows came upon a large sign, it read ""Country Hill Boulevard"" which is the first exit to Calgary. What is puzzling is that from when the strange lights came up from behind them and to the sign which read ""Country Hill Boulevard"", there is a possibility that some time has gone missing. Both men do not recall driving through Airdrie at all. The driver took a look at the odometer and he noticed they may be missing 20 kilometers. As he mentioned to me, he never gave any of this much thought, but did find it rather strange. The driver also said he has driven this stretch of highway many times and nothing like this has ever taken place.  I asked the man if he or his friend had ever had any vivid dreams and he said no. As far as he knows nothing out of the ordinary has happened to him other than this one strange event. The driver did mention that his friend did lose a little sleep over the experience.

The man I spoke with said that ""yes, I'm seeing it too"" before I could even get the question out of my mouth.  We watched it even after the train had passed because I wanted to listen for any sounds, but there weren't any.  It appeared to be dark in color and sort of diamond-shaped, only it had six sides. I would say it was approximately 75 yards in length.  There were 3 lights that went across one end in the form of a triangle.

St-Polycarp, near Valleyfield, Quebec  Date:  August 16, 2001 Time:  10:30 p.m.  On the night of August 16th 2001, at 10:30, a spherical bright luminous object appeared in the sky over the village of St-Polycarp, near Valleyfield. The object was moving very slowly. The sky was overcast. 3 of us observed it: my girlfriend, her daughter and me. The disk seemed very big and very high in the sky. It came from the north-west part of the province of Quebec and was going south-east. There was no sound. I ran to the neighbor's house. His wife answered the door and as she was coming out of her house a commercial airliner flying at a high altitude was about to cross path with the object. The airplane was about the size of a 707 but the disk was much bigger than the plane. The object started to zigzag quickly to get up through the clouds and disappear before the airliner crossed path with it.  I went back inside and watched channel 740 on cable TV. They said the sky ceiling was 11000 feet high.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Also I want to give my many thanks to a wonderful lady who is translating all French reports into English for me to work on.

If you've never been to the Sky Bar it's a dimly lit outdoor bar overlooking Los Angeles, so its easy to see the night sky.  That evening was clear with a light haze in the sky.  At about 9:00PM my friend jokingly pointed to the west and said ""Here comes a UFO"".  I looked to the west and saw what appeared to be lights in a V-formation heading directly toward us.  The objects in the formation were emitting little or no light and appeared to only be reflecting back the lights of the city.  As I looked at them I at first thought it was a flock of large white birds heading towards us.  I trained my eyes on them as they approached looking for wings.  As the objects neared and began to fly overhead I could see that there were no wings and the objects were unexplainable.  What I saw were lights in a triangle formation.  There were approximately 13 lights (1 lead and 6 on each side in a V-formation).  What made it unusual were that the rear lights were constantly switching places with each other.  The object was completely silent and moving at a speed no greater than that of an airplane.  The object also appeared to be flying at about 5,000 feet and was flying in a Northeasterly direction.  We both watched as the formation flew directly overhead and flew over the roof of the hotel and out of site.  The object was obviously no plane as from our vantage point we could watch the airplanes approaching and landing at LAX, plus it made no sound.  Even small planes a couple miles away could be heard from our view.  I travel on business over 100,000 airline miles a year and have been doing it for 15 years straight.  I've spent alot of time in the air and around airports and have never, ever seen anything that could explain what I saw that evening.  My friend and I were both a little shaken by the event and we both said that something needed to be reported.  That's what I'm doing now.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

My wife and I were taking route 73 to Oxford, Ohio last night around 6:30 - 7:45 PM from Centerville, Ohio. Around 7:25 PM as we were aproaching Oxford on route 73 I saw a very bright light to the right of a radio tower to our north. I thought to myself ""I bet someone might think that light to be a UFO, but I bet it's some plane's landing lights."" It remained fairly stationary, which I thought odd. About 5 minutes later the lights faded and the seperation of the object and the radio tower (about 5 miles away) got smaller and the lights got much dimmer. The object was so far away that all I could see was the brightness of the light - I looked for blinking wing lights, but the bright light overpowered them (if it was an airplane). This occured about 1/2 of the way between Collinsville and Oxford. I didn't have any binocculars with me to get a decent view of the object. At home when I have seen landing lights as bright as the light I saw on 10/15, I can easily see two landing lights close together without binoculars. I am reporting this because I saw there was a report of a UFO in Trenton, Ohio 2 days before and on another site a UFO was seen in nearby Middletown, Ohio on 10/15.

As the object separated the individual balls changed color and stretched. The color was white, blue and red smeared or streaked as they moved. The upper ball and the two to the left disappear leaving the right two coming toward our location and grouping together about 25 to 50 apart. These two began to slowly blink in a ruby red color, one blink about every 4 or 5 seconds. They flew within about 8 or 9 hundred yards of our location in a arc back toward the mountain(north).

The reason that mine was included is I first wrote the report on correl then copied it to the spot.Also, to bad someone could not come up to investigate as stuff from the yellow object fell to the ground or in the lake near the shore(alot of stuff).There was one other vehicle looking in the area for it, as my son and I were.If the lake continues to get lower it may become visible.   What should we do if we find something?There also was a military hummer with 5 or 6 tubes on top of it in town sunday.I am familiar with jets and stars and planets and the station ,it flew over this location several months ago.I own a telescope celestron 8 inch so I know about those things.And I fly radio control aircraft and have about 50 hrs. flight traing in fixed wing full size aircraft.I have studied military aircraft and the space program for 40 years and if it was ours we are way ahead of anyone else.The single object split into 6 no sound from the two that past overhead.

I am yelling for my friends to look up but they can't hear me. The jet is still not close enough to me to hear the sound so there was none. Then I could not believe what I saw, a box, at least that's what it looked liked, appeared in the sky directly in front of the cigar, it also was the same color, a square door in the center opened up, it looked like a freight elevator door opening up, and the cigar went into what looked like a very,very black opening, the door closed and the box just vanished. The jet, you could here it now, circled around twice then turned east and left the scene. I was too far away from the aircraft to even tell what kind it was but it sounded like a single engine. I just stood there for a few minutes staring, then my friends showed up, I asked then if they heard me yelling, nobody did, so I told them what I saw and they said I was nuts.

In September 1980, I was driving from San Jose, CA to Denver, CO along with my son and our two dogs.  As we were approaching Elko, Nevada, I saw a sign that said Elko 18 miles straight ahead and a road that went off to the right and straight up the mountain.  I mentioned to my son that the road looked like an interesting one to explore and that we should come back later (we had planned to spend the night in Elko) and do just that. We set up camp in a park on the edge of Elko, ate and then took the dogs with us and set out to explore that curious road. It was getting dark as we headed out and was very dark by the time we got up in the mountain.  It was very quiet, very dark and very desolate up there and we decided to abandon our search and turned around and headed back down the mountain. My son was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat and the two dogs were in the back.  Suddenly, off to my right a bright light caught my eye.  Both my son and I said at the same time ""did you see that?""  It looked like a huge billboard type of thing with aluminum colored glowing squares that were blinking in some strange kind of pattern.  The minute we noticed it, it stopped blinking and disappeared.  I mean disappeared completely as though nothing at all had been there.  There was just an empty meadow where this thing had been.  The altimeter  ((sic.  Please see below.)) light came on in the car and the engine stopped running.  So I told my son to turn the car off and we would sit there for awhile.  Soon we heard foot steps coming toward the car which unnerved us to say the least.  But strangest of all was that the dogs did NOT bark.  I got worried and thought it was best to get out of there and told my son to start the car and let's go!  He reminded me that the car wouldn't start and I just told him to try again--it would start (I was kind of frantic). The car did start and we started down the mountain again, but by then I was regaining my composure and told him to go slow, real slow.  I turned around to look and there was an reddish-orangeish round light floating above the road (maybe 10 or l5 feet above)and it followed us down the mountain, almost to the bottom and then disappeared. When we got back to the campground it was around 2:30 in the morning so I do not know where all the time went as it didn't seem that we were up there for very long.  When we got back we were sitting outside, still in amazement over what we had seen when I looked up and there I was about 5 green lights and they were in some sort of formation that looked to me as though they were dancing to some sort of celestial music!  I know how improbable that sounds, especially after what we had just seen on the mountain, but I swear to God it is the truth.  We were not stoned, not drunk and not crazy.

I was giving him a ride home down Walton Ferry Rd heading due east. Walton Ferry runs down one side of a huge peninsula that ends at the lake. His home was at the end on a road going across to Sanders Ferry Rd. which runs parallel to Walton Ferry. We were roughly one mile from the end at the lake when he spoke up and said \""hey, do you see that?\"". I looked up and over the lake were five or six strange looking lights about half way to three quarters up in the horizon. They were in a straight line with the front light rotating to the end of the line about every 3 to 5 seconds. They were very bright and seemed to be hovering over the lake. I don\'t recall any colors, just white lights. Very bright white lights. Brighter than any aircraft we had ever seen. I slowly pulled the car over to the side of the road as did a couple of cars behind us who evidently saw what we did. The speed limit along this road is 45 and is heavily traveled. Neighborhoods all the way to the end. After about 30 seconds or so, the front light rotated to the rear and the then lead light literally shot up into the sky/space and the others followed. They moved at a speed that was literally unbelievable. We looked at each other, looked back at the people behind us, and all were like us with their mouths wide open and looks on their faces like what the heck was that?! We slowly pulled away from the side of the road and I proceeded on to his house. We must have been quite pale upon our arrival because his wife at the time even commented to the effect of \""what have ya\'ll been up to?\"". He was 23 or 24 at the time and I was 19 or 20. No drugs and no alcohol were involved! We see each other maybe once a year now, usually at a 4th of July party, but we have not spoken about this in quite some time. However, all the other has to say is, \""do you remember\"" and the other instantly knows what is meant. As a matter of refe! rence, I was watching the Rendleshon show on SciFi earlier, which prompted me to write this. The lights on the show, when over the farmers field bears a great resemblance to what we saw that night. The thing that amazes me the most is the fact that the time frame fits when we had our siteing. I can only imagine what was going on back 23 or so years ago. I can honestly say, this incident made us both believers. The speed would be the main deciding factor. There is nothing man-made on this planet that can manuever or go that fast.

It hovered the whole time we watched (my mom had slowed the car down to a crawl by now). It was about 150 yards away from us, right above the trees, directly over the river and 3/4 the size of a football field. It made no sound (we had our windows down) and shot off into the sky like a missle/rocket from a complete standstill. I have read reports stating it may be that UFO's use water as fuel and I have often wondered if it was just ""re-fueling"" while hovering directly over the river.

I attempted to point out the object to my fellow Scouts and my Scout Leaders, but no one else was able to pick it out of the sky. The Scout leaders called me a liar so I shut up about it.

Its velocity was analogous to a satellite however it was diffidently not in orbit as its trajectory was level as when it vanished it was not at the horizon. The zigzags (it made about 7 – 8) where of a very acute angle and no noticeable radius and the object velocity was unvarying throughout the 8 seconds that I viewed it. I said to myself out loud “I would like to see the pilot of that ride”. I stayed at the park until 4:00 a.m., but  didn’t see anything else.  I’ve look at Sweden’s national UFO web site several times this past 2weeks but nothing has been reported.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

I noticed a very large strangely beautiful cloud that was different from the others because it was lit up with what I perceived as a lot of electrical charge.  It was full of pinkish/purplish bursts of light at it's very center.  The outside edges of the cloud were so well defined against the dusky background of sky.  I was staring at this light show when I suddenly noticed a bolt of lightning come down out of the bottom of the cloud and strike dramatically towards the earth.  The cloud was almost perfectly parallel to my line of vision.  That is to say, it was directly outside my window at the same elevation as my seat on the plane.  I would estimate the cloud was approximately 500-800 feet away from the plane & I could see above and below the silhouette of the cloud.  It was just after the lightning bolt struck that I noticed that inside the cloud, but at it's very edge nearest to me, I saw two perfectly round greenish/yellow lights hovering at the very outside edge of the cloud, with just a bit of mist or fog diffusing the lights slightly.(still bright, easily defined round shape)  The 2 round lights were approx. 1-2 ft in diameter and maybe 6-8 ft apart.  They reminded me of 2 green ""GO"" lights like you would find on a stoplight, only they were side by side & perfectly motionless. I didn't think they looked like lights from a plane(too lrg) but if they were, I reasoned that they should be moving through the cloud.  I also could't imagine any aerial machine entering such a spectacularly electric-charged cloud.  It was alone, by itself, so I thought a plane would not be forced to fly THROUGH it.  I never thought it was a plane anyway.  I was in the 32nd row with my young child on my lap so I could see our right wing lit up outside our window in front of me.  It was nothing like those lights.  Our light was small, white! and sort of standing vertically & blinking. My initial reaction was that it was some sort of hovercraft.(although I have never seen a hovercraft)  For an analogy, it reminded me of two greenish yellow eyes staring out from the very edge of the cloud.  They never moved their position within the cloud.  If the cloud moved, which it appeared it did not, then they moved with the cloud in the same position. I never witnessed a craft.  I never really thought to look for one at the time.  If there was one it would have had to be the ""front"" lights I observed with the bulk of the object hidden in the clouds behind them. Just a footnote, which will make this story sound even wackier...it probably has nothing to do w/this ""event"", but while in a town north of me in IN I was with my mother previewing homes for my brother, whom is moving back to this area shortly. I own a real estate company. While traveling down a road towards our next home, a tornadic-like wind burst came out of nowhere and snapped a tree in half, which fell into the path of my van.  I was going approx 45-50 MPH and had I not swerved to get my vehicle off the road as I almost lost control in the grass alongside the road, we would have been crushed.  I have pictures I took at the scene which shows my van surrounded by the upper tree limbs, and across the front & back of my van.  We were not injured.  The van had some damage.  I am glad I had my digital camera w/me...as I was taking interior photos of homes for my brother to see.  There is a Sheriff's report on this incident.  This story is not so strange, in and of itself, but when my mom called me later that night she said when she got home, which is 25 miles south of the accident site, and she was sitting on her back patio, she noticed that a tree she had  recently purchased by mail order(one of several)and had planted, that was no larger in diameter than your index finger had snapped in two at the center and was fallen over itself. The area had rain that day but no strong winds of any kind acco! rding to the officers at the scene of the accident, or as witnessed by my mother and myself, who had been out all morning/early afternoon.  Later, we also have discovered that both trees were poplars.(hers and the one that fell on us)  That happened 11 days before I saw the lights from my airplane.  If you cannot already tell, I am unnerved by the whole thing.  I am wondering where that burst of wind came from that snapped a 3 ft diameter tree in two as well as a pencil sized tree in half.(in two entirely different locations) Her rear yard is fenced and the gate is locked.  Her dog was inside until she went out back with him.  We witnessed nothing else that day except that ""microburst"" of wind.",2003-08-28T00:00:00,,

No object or sound was heard, nothing at all actually other than the bright flashes of light.

Family. Plus Green Lights Return. Continuing Abduction Problems For Kelowna, B.C. Family.  Date: November 8th and 9th, 2003  Since July 31, 2003, after an UFO encounter, missing time and disturbing episodes which followed, one of the women has continued to have some medical problems. Cynthia continues to have a constant feeling of pressure on her head and is becoming worse as the days and weeks go by. This feeling of pressure has now moved into her neck. On November 8, 2003 Cynthia, while at her home, became cold as her body temperature dropped to 35.2 C. She immediately called the hospital and talked to a nurse who informed her that it sounded like hypothermia was setting in. The color of Cynthia's skin started to change, to become almost whitish/grey. She was freezing to the point where she felt paralyzed and had major problems moving or walking. Also her heart was beating really irregularly and she reports it was down to 44 bpm. Cynthia's daughter is also experiencing an irregular heart rate as well.  HBCC UFO Research Note: The average normal temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Cynthia's temperature dropped a little over 2 degrees and no explanation has been given as to what has caused this to happen. If your recorded rectal or ear temperature is less than 97°F (36.11°C), you have an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia). If your rectal or ear temperature is 95°F (35°C) or lower, call a health professional immediately.  Information on taking your heartbeat measurement.  Your pulse is caused by your heart beating. As your heart beats and forces blood through your body, you can feel a throbbing sensation (the pulse) by putting your fingers over one of your arteries at any point where the artery comes close to the surface of your skin, such as your wrist, neck, or upper arm. Counting your pulse rate is a simple way to estimate how fast your heart is beating. Pulse rate measurements are often done by a health professional as part of a physical examination or in an emergency, but you can easily learn to measure your own pulse rate as well.  A pulse is usually described in terms of its rate, which is the number of beats per minute (bpm). However, the rhythm and strength of the heartbeat can also be noted, as well as whether the blood vessel feels hard or soft. An irregular rhythm, a weak pulse, or a hard blood vessel may indicate a medical condition that needs further evaluation. The pulse rate is measured by counting the beats in a set period of time (at least 15 to 20 seconds) and multiplying that number to get the number of beats per minute. When you exercise, have a fever, or are under stress, your heart rate usually speeds up to meet your body's increased need for oxygen and nutrients carried in the blood. As a result, your pulse rate normally varies from minute to minute. Unless your pulse rate is being measured to check your fitness level or in an emergency situation, it is usually measured after you have rested for 10 minutes or more. This measurement is called a resting pulse rate. It is an accurate and simple assessment of the health of the heart and circulatory system.  I always recommend to people if they feel there are medical problems that they seek out a health professional.  On Saturday night Cynthia's daughter went to bed, after a short period of time she started having an unusual and vivid dream about being in some type of vehicle with two beings. She felt that they were there to take her somewhere. The young girl felt that where ever they were going wasn't the place to be. So in her ""dream"" she jumped from the vehicle and landed on the ground hitting her right leg and rolled along the ground for a short distance. Cynthia's daughter, who also has been a victim of these unwanted visits by beings from elsewhere, woke up Sunday morning, November 9, 2003 with extreme pain in her knee.  Actually as she climbed out of her bed her leg folded up right underneath her. She was fine the night before, hadn't been involved in anything which may have caused the injury that I have reported below. Cynthia's daughter's cartilage in her right knee is ripped/torn and she has to be on crutches for a while until it heals up. The doctor asked the girl if she had took part in any sporting activities, or goofing around with friends, ""she replied no""! After they left the doctors office and some time later the pain moved up into her thigh and is getting worse. Cynthia is taking her daughter back to the doctor, or the hospital to have her checked out again. Cynthia told me blood tests will be done in hopes of determining what caused the drop in Cynthia's body temperature, also checking to see if there are any problems developing with her daughter. She also mentioned that both her and her daughter are craving salted products and are extremely thirsty. Both mother and daughter are totally exhausted, as if the two of them hadn't slept for days. Cynthia said, how can a person who is sleeping soundly in their bed wake up in the morning with a torn cartilage in her right knee. I have to agree with her. Very strange indeed.  HBCC UFO Note: I telephoned Cynthia Monday night to see how both her and her daughter were feeling. Cynthia sounded extremely tired, like she had no energy even to carry on a conversation.  I must say I find this to be very upsetting for me to hear what has...... and is ....taking place with this family. I also am going to try to get down to see them if the weather holds. There is also more which has taken place, but due to this information being of a personal nature, ""I will not"" be adding this to any of my reports.  Cynthia mentioned that a couple of nights before November 8, 2003 her daughter woke up at 3:00 a.m. to a loud and very strange and unusual sound coming from the orchard behind their home. And the dogs in the area were making such a noise. She was so frightened from hearing such a loud and weird sound that she pulled the covers up over her head. She couldn't even give me an example of what the noise sounded like as it was so strange. The very next night after Cynthia's daughter heard this crazy noise, Cynthia said she got woken up at 4:05 a.m. to the same sound, or at least something she could not make any sense of. Cynthia said the dogs were going crazy, the cows in the area were acting up, so she got out of bed and moved onto the balcony and looked toward the orchard. It was dark and she could see nothing but could still hear the sound. She told me she started clapping her hands, making noises herself and the strange sound eventually stopped. Although the dogs still were acting up in the area but since the sound had stopped, Cynthia decided to go back to bed. However, no sooner did she get back under the covers than the noise returned. She rolled over and tried to block out the sound until she ended up going to sleep.  HBCC UFO Note: I tried to find out if abductees have even experienced hypothermia after an encounter. After searching and reading all kinds of matter I came up with nothing. So I contacted Mr. Derrel Sims and Mr. Whitley Stieber to ask if they had encountered anyone reporting hypothermia right after an event. They both were so helpful. Also I contacted other abductees but they also said they had never experienced hypothermia after an abduction.  Of course this raises some questions which people were interested in. From what I was told a lot of discussion has not taken place on the idea of hypothermia after an abduction, mainly because no one has reported this phenomena as taking place. Some abductees report feeling very cold leading up to the actual abduction, also feeling very cold just after it took place. Many report a coldness when inside a craft to the point they were shaking. Some of this I am sure is due to the fear one must go through when being taken.  So why is this woman reporting hypothermia ? Is it due from being in a very cold environment (on a craft), plus the fright of the whole situation. Did this occur because she was dropped off outside in a cold environment, which it was at the time of this incident. Or was the hypothermia condition caused by a medical problem no one is aware of right now. There always seems to be more questions than answers. Maybe the blood tests, etc.. will show something. We will have to wait and see and pray for some answers.  I will leave this off here for now. I would like to say this is the end of this story, but I have my doubts. The good thing is I keep in contact with Cynthia on a daily basis and have told her if she just wants to chat, then call me anytime.  More News That I Just Received:  I just had an email from a lady who resides in Vernon, British Columbia. She has informed me that a couple of business owners were in Kelowna, British Columbia on November 8, 2003 and watched green lights in the south west sky's over Kelowna. This event took place the very same night problems started again for the Kelowna family. I hope to have a full report on the sighting of the green lights. Also I want everyone to know, no information had been given out to anyone about what took place on November 8, 2003 with Cynthia and her daughter. So again we have green lights showing up and strange events taking place with a close friend.  I can honestly say, in my opinion, there creatures that take folks from the comfort of their homes are not here to give humanity a gift, as some may suggest. They are here to experiment, degrade and frighten everyone who comes in contact with them. No one will ever convince me other wise.  Take good care out there, and please if anyone who has been involved in an abduction and has ever experienced hypothermia after the incident, I would really appreciate hearing from you.

It was this that stirred my memory about that evening. I was DJing a benefit for a local soldier injured in Iraq and finished packing my gear about 11:45 pm on that night.  I stayed for a drink afterward and headed out about 12:15-12:30 AM.  While at a stoplight I looked up at the moon and saw a light, which I thought was a plane.  I did a ""double-take"" because I then noticed the light was part of a ""V"" of very faint lights, maybe 7 or 8 on each 'wing' of the V. The V was not too wide and appeared nearly as a single line.  It was very difficult to see against the ambient city lighting.  The traffic light changed to green and I proceeded, I looked up again but could not locate the lights.  I thought it was odd but since there is a major air reserve base in the next town- which happens to be fairly active at this time of war- as well as an international airport close, I passed it off as an odd reflection or trick of the eyes.  I was heading in a southeasterly direction at the time.

The reason I noticed it was the lights where shining so bright and the absences of sound. I could hear birds calling and also see other commercial aircraft in the same area just at much higher elevation. At first the craft was at tree top elevation. I was talking on the phone at the time of the sighting and noticed a failure in the cordless phone to a cellular connection.

And instead of manuvering, the object  just flew straight down thousands of feet to the ground (past the treeline at least) at a rate of speed no jet or meteor could go. this looked to be more than 100 miles away so I wasnt so tempted to drive over to the possible landing area.

A lady had gone to the internet in search of a Canadian UFO Investigator so she could file a report on some strange on-going sightings which had been taking place in her area. At one point the objects seen were so frightening to her and the family, that the RCMP was called to the witnesses residence to investigate. The witness did state that she was not going to call this a UFO, meaning something from another world because she really did not firmly believe in this. The lady went on to say that what she and her family have been observing was something they could not explain. Be it military or something else, whatever these objects are, they do some very bizarre things in the sky.  On December 26, 2003 the dispatcher for the  Sicamous, British Columbia RCMP detachment took a call from an excited woman who requested the RCMP  come to her home and look into the unusual sights that had been taking place over a period of time. Whilst making the report she felt that she wasn't being taken seriously ... and that maybe they thought her to be a little crazy.. however when an hour passed and the RCMP officer arrived in her yard it was a different story.  As soon as he saw the object he stood and looked in amazement.  He had no idea what it was.  I was told that the officer left the families home and drove towards the mountain where the object was sitting to get a closer and better look. (HBCC UFO Note: So far I have left two messages with the Sicamous RCMP detachment to have the constable call me back using my toll free number and as of yet he has not returned my call. I am not giving up on him, and I will keep trying until I get a hold of him even if it means becoming a pest).  ""An important part to this case is that excellent video footage has been shot by the family"".  As the tape is rolling you can hear the children in the background commenting on how quickly the object was moving all over the sky. It appears to be moving rather quickly, zig zagging, etc.. I asked the witness about how she was holding the camera, knowing that any slight movement while video taping can make ""something"" appear to move. In the footage it shows the object moving erratically around the sky. The other members of her family who stood watching this event unfold saw the very same thing with the naked eye..... something flying all around the sky.  The witness said  these objects (plural as there are more than one at different times) ..... was also seen by her husband whilst he was up in the mountains which is around their area.  He described one of the objects as being as big as a house and covered in lights.  At the time, he was waiting for his daughter and her cousin to return with the snowmobile.  He watched the object with his naked eye and estimated it to be approximately a mile away from his location.  He was so excited and frightened at what he saw whilst he waited...  that he immediately drove back home, ran into the house and told his wife of his adventure.  She thought he had been drinking as he was acting strange and obviously was very scared.  Knowing they had to go back out to that location where the object was seen because they had to pick up the kids, the gentleman said he was not going back out there alone !  The husband's sighting took place before December 26, 2003, and what the family caught on tape on December 26, 2003 was the same object.  It had returned. They also saw the object through their binoculars and described it as being in the shape of an acorn or a diamond.  It was an extraordinary sighting because not only did the object shine brightly and move around erratically ... but at one point when it was stationary ... it shot out a large red fireball, then six bright orange lights appeared in the sky around it.  Each of the orange lights had another two white lights on them.    These white lights shot a beam of light towards the ground.  Approximately  half an hour later four more of the large acorn/diamond shaped objects showed up and sat either stationary or moved around the sky. The witnesses said the objects appeared to have hundreds of lights on each of them.  These folks have recently moved into this home, but the previous owners said they used to watch in the daylight hours ... on many occasions silver disk shaped objects flying over and around the mountains behind the house.  This case is under investigation and this is only raw data at present. Video tape is currently being examined.  A foot note to this. The lady who reported the sighting and who rang the RCMP told me that when the constable arrived and saw the object .. he commented to her that he knew of nothing that moved that quickly ... nor of anything that could stop like it did on a dime.  This story proved interesting enough that the television station (CHBC TV out of Kelowna, British Columbia) sent a news crew to interview  the family and to get a copy of the footage. CHBC TV is a part of the Global TV network which is one of Canada's giants in the media business. The story ended up airing not just on that station, but aired all over British Columbia on Global BCTV. They ran the story at least three times as a part of their news. Once at 6:00 p.m. Friday night, again at 11:00 p.m. and again on the Saturday morning news.  As I was the investigator on the case they also called me a number of times and interviewed me about the story. The news gave this story a good length of time to play out on TV which was really great to see.  Something else of interest prior to these sightings but in the same area was when an RCMP officer who was out on his usual rounds in his patrol car ... noticed an object in the sky and was instantly hit with a beam of light from it.   After his shift was over and upon his return to his detachment he informed his co-workers of what he had seen.  They thought he was seeing things.   Now perhaps they have a different interpretation of the event.  On a separate note, sightings are still coming in.

It was a triangle figure with three bright lights at each corner of it with a strobe effect red light in the middle.  It was going very fast but gliding very smoothly and it was relativley proportioned low in the sky for a flying device.  I freaked out and speed the half of a mile home.  My house is surronded by fields mind you...so when I got home I was really freaked out.  I started to get out of my car and I heard noises like someone/something was tapping my car and someone/something was dragging their feet on my driveway (which consists of rocks)  So I heard the noise of feet scraping against rocks.  I called my mother and woke her up and had her come open the side door and start to walk outside so whatever was making noises in my driveway would disappear.  I went into my house safley, and began to look out the window and saw the same triangle figure except it was going in the opposite direction than I origianlly saw it.   I then glanced outside a couple mintues later and saw another triangle figure with a blue light, and a couple mintues later another figure with a green light.  So i dont know if it was the same triangle figure and it changed it's middle light? Or if theyre were three triangle figures in the sky.  I was really freaked out by the situation and I still am.  I get scared driving down my street in the dark, I am afraid I will see it again.  And I am not so lucky that I live near fields...which it is rumoured that the UFO's like to land there.

I climbed on the trampoline and laid back to gaze at the clear blue sky. I saw many buzzards flying about but what caught my attention was a cluster of bright circular objects much higher in the sky than the birds. These objects were circling each other in a whirlwind/tower pattern. Each followed its own course, but they all were circling and, as I was to soon find out, going upward. My wife came out of the house to talk with us and I asked her to take a look at them. She watched them with me until they slowly vanished in the atmosphere. The objects at the top of the ""tower"" began to disappear first followed by those at the bottom. They appeared to be bright white with a haze around them. I also noticed a refraction of some sort on the outside of that. Like bending light. At first I wanted to shrug them off as birds and leave it at that. But my wife urged me to look closer and really observe them. It was then that I knew they could not be birds. They were circling much to fast and I've never seen birds shaped like orbs that disappeared into the atmosphere. Another thing we both noticed was that when they circled around on our side of the loop they were brighter and seemed to reflect the sun. When they were on the opposite side of the loop they were dull and faint. That would be the result of astetic distance because they were blued by the atmosphere. Several buzzards flew between us and the objects and it was even more obvious how high they were. Later, a jet flew by in the same area where the objects had been. The jet was very far away by the time it appeared to be the same size as the objects had appeared. These objects obviously traveled upward and not horizontal. We haven't seen them since. Unfortunately I was debating with myself as to what these objects were before I thought to retrieve the video camera. By then they had all vanished. I could draw a picture of how they appeared and email it to you, if you'd like.  Thank you.  ((name deleted))",2004-01-17T00:00:00,34.3527,-83.2983

It had blue, red, and white lights flashing at various times.  It was a mile to two miles high.  It made no noise.  It was not seen on the Tri-State Airport's radar in Huntington, WV. or Indianpolis Center radar. Follow up investigation: Mr.A.(name on file for privancy reasons), states that on the evening of the sighting he was headed for his garage.  He looks up and spots the light.  He goes on into the garage and when he comes back out he looks again and sees the light is still there.  He first thought, it was a helicopter out near the atomic plant but then thought that it may be near the Portsmouth Regional Airport which is about 6 miles from his location.  He stated that this was in the east to southeastern skies. He began to think that a helicopter was flying towards him because he saw one large very bright light which is what a helicopter would look like if coming head on.  However, this object seemed to barely move if at all at times.  It seemed to hover in the same altitude of approx. 5-6 thousand feet up. To him it seemed there was blue and red with the white light somehow together, dimming and then getting brighter.  Mr. A. called on his family to come out and look at the light.  All memebers in the family were curious as to what it could be.  His son looked at it through a telelscope and said that he could not make out what it was because it was too large and bright when veiwed through magnification.  Mr. A. then called the Ohio Highway Patrol Post about 5 miles away.  The person he spoke to said there was a hill right oustide and they doubted they could see anything.  Mr. A. says he does not think they even looked because he did not hear back from them even tho he asked they let him know if they saw anything. They did not go to look while he was on the phone either.  About 15 minutes later he called the Portsmouth Regional Airport and spoke to the base operator.  He did not get any names from whom he spoke with.  He asked to be connected to the control tower stating that he was a pilot.  Not getting connected he then called the tower directly.  The tower operator told Mr. A. that they had nothing on radar of an unusual nature.  The tower operator asked Mr. A. if he saw a plane, to which Mr. A. said yes. This was to test to see if the radar was working properly.  That was all that was seen on radar.  Then Mr. A. looked in his airport directory book and called the Huntington Airport.  They also said nothing unusual was seen on their radar.  He also tried calling Indianpolis.  Nothing was found unusual on their radar.  During the time he was on the phone the light vanished. Mr. A. says that it had been in veiw for over an hour.  I asked Mr. A. if it could have been a star or planet? Mr.A. said that he is very familair with the stars and planets in that part of the sky and also that he watches planes coming from the airport all the time.  He was adamant that it was not a star or planet. He also says that he knew it was not a satelite or meteor because of the slow if at all movemment.  Comments: I commend Mr. A. on his determination to find out what the source of the light was! He sounded sincere in his story. He sounded puzzled by what he had saw and the family members did not know what it was.  They were just as puzzled.  It has come our attention here at Ohio MUFON that over the past year several unidentified lights and objects have been reported in the near vicinity of Lucasville, Ohio.  Some of these locations are: Proctorville, Chesapeake, Rome, Wheelersburg and several from Portsmouth, Ohio.  We also have had reports from Huntington, WV.  In 2003 we had an upsure in sightings from these areas. This is a somewhat rural area with few reports in past years.

Date: January 27,2004 Time: Between 1:00 a.m. & 1:30 a.m. Good evening, thanks for your concern about my picture..  This picture taken from my web cam shows an unknown object flying in the sky in front of my house. It was too fast so I just took two pictures of it, due to the speed the object was traveling. It was the night of 27/01/2004 between 1:00 & 1:30 the early hours of the morning of 27/01/2004 in Lebanon, Beirut City. I thought you might be interested in the photo.  The sound of this object was so strange and so strong ! I took the picture behind the window's glass because I was so surprised and I don't even know how did I catch the object on the cam as it was that fast. I didn't want to loose it and I felt it is something so strange. I hope you will reply to me soon with more information about that picture, now that you know a few details about it. Also I was searching for some web sites for pictures showing something strange in the sky like my picture and I have found out that the pictures that I took are very similar to the others UFO photos on the internet. I have found your web address during my search. This this is the second picture where it shows that the object has changed his place and then disappeared.

The lady said it was almost completely dark out when she spotted it just above the horizon over one of the local hills.  A short contrail, coral red in color. She mentioned if it had of been light out she may have been able to see the body of the craft, or something that may have been making the colored contrail. But because of the time of day, and being almost pitch black out she could not see what was causing the contrail. The witness said it was very bright, defined trail. The lady said she didn't believe it was very high up in the sky and the object did not have any flashing strobe lights on it. It traveled on a steady, straight path not making any unusual moments as it flew along. The witness said she observed it for approx: a couple of minutes and then she walked back into the store. The object was still visible at the time she stopped watching it. So we have no idea just how long the lady would have been able to observe it for.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Again it rose up rather quickly, then stopped and sat stationary for a few seconds. It finally continued it's travels maneuvering in a strange fashion towards the west. The witness said as it flew a long it would make a tight maneuver on a curve, in other words it looks as if it was going around a bend.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Dozens of residents see lights in the sky.,Prince George,BC,2004-01-31T21:00:00,light,two hour spread?,"Occurred : 1/31/2004 21:00  (Entered as : 01/31/2004 21:00) Reported: 3/11/2004 12:09:40 AM 00:09 Posted: 3/17/2004 Location: Prince George (Canada), BC Shape: Light Duration:two hour spread?",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35536.html,"Dozens of residents see lights in the sky. On the evening of January 31, 2004 a large number of Prince George residents were stunned and puzzled over what they were witnessing in the night sky between 8:00 - 10:00 p.m., PST. Some called the Prince George Citizen newspaper to explain what it was they saw, and how peculiar it was. All of the witnesses, by the dozens, observed two extremely bright, orange circular lights in the sky.  The lights stayed fairly close together and did not make any sudden moments. Many residents reported the lights just hanging there for a number of minutes before moving ever so slightly. HBCC UFO Research was contacted by the Prince George Citizen enquiring about it, and a staff reporter did an interview for Saturday, February 7, 2004, newspaper.  Over the weekend the telephone did not stop ringing. Many reports of orange lights came in from Prince George residents. Plus other very interesting reports for 2003 and back as far as the 1950s. Some of these reports included beams of lights hitting their vehicles as they travelled along the highway. A huge ball of light hovering over the tree tops not making any sound. A line of red balls of light sitting stationary in the night sky, etc...  After taking the calls and listening to the stories, some of the descriptions started me thinking. More folks contacted me. Some had watched the whole event unfold viewing the lights through binoculars. A retired military man was certainly the key to this case. Plus another lady who also gave a great description of the event.  I made several enquiries to the RCMP but the police had no information about the matter and took no calls from the general public over it.  I typed up a few reports below from the eye witnesses who called in.  Report #1 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 30, 2004 Time: Between 8:00 & 9:00 p.m.  I had a call from a lady on February 7, 2004 who wanted to file a report on something she and her husband witnessed as they were driving down Tabor from 15th. They looked to the east and saw lights in the sky and thought at first it may have been an airplane. The witnesses mentioned they saw no strobe lights which they knew an aircraft would have. They reported the lights were moving rather slowly. As they drove down the road they passed by the trees which blocked their view of the lights in the sky. After they came to a clear area, they stopped the car and looked to the south and again noticed the lights.  The witnesses told me that when they saw it again, this time it appeared to look like a black balloon, or umbrella shape.  The lady said it looked as if the object would flip over, so the umbrella appearance was at the bottom and then would show up back on top. The lady and husband reported not a sound coming from it and whatever it was dropped downwards. The couple reported the lights as being white in color. The witnesses estimated they observed the event for approx: 5 minutes.  The folks didn't believe the object was very far from their location and said it wasn't that high up when they first saw it. Also they finally lost sight of the lights when they dropped down low enough that homes finally blocked their view. The people estimated the size to be roughly that of a golf ball. One other note, the witnesses said they believed that the lights were moving diagonally as they came closer to the ground.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.  Report #2 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: Between 9:00 - 9:30 p.m.  A gentleman called to report seeing the orange lights witnessed over Prince George on January 31, 2004. He and his wife live near 1st & Foothills in Prince George and were planning an evening out when the walked out of their home, which faces towards the downtown area they noticed the two orange colored lights in the night sky. They said the lights were very bright and that is what caught their attention. The witness went on to say he is used to seeing helicopters and fixed winged aircraft flying over all the time, but what he could not understand was the brightness of the lights, also how close the lights were to one another. The couple stood just outside their front door watching the lights for a good three minutes, but due to them having reservations they had to get on their way. The husband wondered if it might be a UFO, his wife said it possibly might be a plane, but both still thought it looked rather odd. He told me he almost dismissed it at that time. But as they drove along 1st Avenue heading towards Tabor and not traveling very far the fellow decide it was time to pull the car over as he said one doesn't get to see anything like this very often or ever.  As they both sat watching, they were able to get a good view of what was taking place. One of the orange lights appeared to be over top of the other or maybe off to a bit of an angle to the left. Another 3 to 4 minutes passed and the bottom light started dropping off towards the left and seemed to flicker a little bit. He thought it may have been going into some of the light clouds that were present that evening, then all of a sudden the light disappeared. The other light was still visible and stayed around the same area in the sky for a little while longer. The witness estimated the last light held it's brilliance for maybe another 30 seconds before it started to flicker. It began to fade and then would become very bright again.  This went on for a very short period of time before it to vanished.  Again it was lightly overcast with a high ceiling. The witness also estimated the objects were roughly a finger length apart if one was to hold out their hand at arms length. The witness stated that the lights did sit stationary for some of the time, before moving. The witnesses reported no sound was heard, and no aircraft were seen in the area. At arm's length, using his thumbnail to guess at an approx: size of the lights, he said each one may have been one fifth of the size of his nail.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.  Report #3 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: approx: 9:30 p.m.  Calls kept coming into HBCC UFO Research over the January 31, 2004 sighting in Prince George, B.C.  Below is another report from a fellow who wanted to tell me what he witnessed that evening. The evening was overcast and no stars were visible at the time of the sighting. The man went on to tell me that his daughter spotted it first and then called to the rest of the family to come out and look at the strange lights in the sky which were reported to be just over top of one of the local mountains. He explained that the color of the lights were an orange/white. The witness also said he thought there may have been a small tail behind each of the lights, but it was hard to distinguish for certain. The lights were stationary for a very short time when these folks noticed them and as they watched, the lights did start to move but ever so slightly.  They said there were two very bright lights which looked identical to one another. The man's wife said they looked like landing lights from an aircraft due to how close they were together, and the brightness of them. They all ruled this out quickly as the lights just stayed in the one area of the sky. They observed the lights rise up for a short distance, still staying close to one another. As they watched one of the lights seemed to disappear quickly, but they didn't think it went into the clouds as he noted the cloud ceiling was rather high that night and the lights weren't close to them.  The other remaining light was seen to move back, or away from the families location and it also disappeared. Both lights were extremely bright, and the family said they stayed that way until they finally blinked out, or just vanished.  These folks figured they watched the lights for at least two minutes before they were gone. The man said, how long they were visible before he noticed them is anyone's guess. They also reported no sound and the witnesses said if it had a plane or helicopter you would have certainly have heard it. The folks estimated that the lights were approx: 10 times larger than their thumbnail.  Thank you to the family for their report.  Report #4 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: approx: 9:30 - 10:00 p.m.  Now this was a very interesting call that I received from a man who resides in Prince George, B.C. When I answered the phone, the fellow said he had just read their local newspaper and that he could tell me exactly what the lights were that everyone saw that evening. Below is the report the gentleman gave to me.  The fellow said he watched the whole event through a pair of field glasses. It was January 31, 2004, between 9:30 - 10:00 p.m. and the man claims ""it"" landed two blocks from his home. The witness said what he watched was a couple of night jumpers, jumping with parachutes with lights attached around their feet or ankles. The man observed them coming over from the west over the hill. He mentioned that he had a fairly strong set of glasses (binoculars) and was clearly able to see the jumpers hanging in their chutes and saw when they turned their lights off. One of them landed in a park just two blocks away from the witnesses home and the other went towards the Fraser River and the BCR Railway. The gentleman figured the were practicing night jumping.  When the jumpers were first spotted they were rather high up and he and his wife first thought it may have been an airplane. He went on to say the lights were a very bright orange in color, and the reason they were no longer visible was simply because they had turned them off. The fellow, now retired, was in the military himself and had done a lot of jumping and as soon as he spotted the orange lights he thought it looked familiar due to the descent, plus the way the lights were traveling. When he looked through his binoculars he knew exactly what it was he was seeing. He figured the jumpers used their lights to keep track of each other and to designate where they were going to. Once they started getting closer to the ground they turned off their lights and just used the lights from the city to land. He also said the chutes were beautiful, very modern shaped parachutes and the jumpers with such good gear were able to carry out some of the antics they pulled off that cold evening. It was actually comical as the witness said one of the jumpers almost turned himself upside down and then this would give the impression of the lights going back up into the night sky. The two jumpers were carrying out some acrobatics on their way and obviously no sound was reported.  Thank you very much to the witnesses for their reports.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Moon sized object hovers above the ground.,Houston,BC,2004-02-03T07:06:00,other,3 to 4 minutes,"Occurred : 2/3/2004 07:06  (Entered as : 02/03/2004 7:06) Reported: 3/11/2004 12:28:42 AM 00:28 Posted: 3/17/2004 Location: Houston (Canada), BC Shape: Other Duration:3 to 4 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35539.html,"Moon sized object hovers above the ground. This sighting took place approx: 5 kilometers west of Houston, British Columbia. The area where the sighting took place has been a very active location for numerous sightings over 2002 and 2003. The farm I visited today (February 4, 2003) sits high above the Bulkley Valley and these folks and their neighbors have a terrific view of all the surroundings.  A witness called me on the morning of February 4, 2004 to report that she and her husband both saw something that didn't look right. The woman gets up early to get her husband and children ready for the day's work and school. As she made her way through her home at 7:06 a.m. she walked by the kitchen sink, stopped, backed up and gave a call out for her husband to come and have a look at what she was watching.  Both stood inside their home looking out the window at a moon sized object. It's color was very bright, (a good example would be if you were sitting looking into a camp fire watching the bright colored flames shooting up). This object was ""bright""! The witness only could guess as to the shape of it, but thought it was circular. She reported to me the top of the object was domed shaped for sure. (also what is very important in this story is that it was completely dark outside, the sun had not started to rise).  The farm the family owns is very large, and there is a great deal of pasture. From the kitchen where they observed the object, there is a clump of poplar and spruce trees. Then behind that is another opening of pasture area, then another row or clump of trees. In-between these rows of trees, is where the object was seen moving about. Not in an erratic fashion at all, it just dropped down slowly and ""stopped""!  Since the orange glowing object was staying stationary at the time, the lady grabbed her video camera and started to shoot some film from the kitchen window. Because what she and her husband were watching was certainly strange looking, she thought about making a move to the outside onto the patio. She ran quickly to the front door, opened it and went outside with video camera in hand. When she looked over to the area where the object was sitting, or had been ....it had vanished. The woman ran back inside to the kitchen window again, and there it was, sitting stationary and shining very brightly. So she shot a little more footage until it just blinked out.  After I took the call about the sighting, I asked was she going to be at home for a while, and if so, I would like to come out to have a look around. I also wanted to take a look at the footage and do the report of the sighting. The witness said it would be fine if I wanted to come up to their home right away, so I grabbed my keys and headed out.  I was greeted by the witnesses when I arrived and she explained exactly what they saw, showed me where the object was located and where she was standing when filming. The lady then showed me into the kitchen and told me that this is where she first noticed it. She then took me outside and pointed to where the object was when she tried to capture it on film.  I said you are kidding, because it would not have mattered from either location the lady was filming from, the object should have been visible. With winter here the popular trees had already dropped their leaves months ago. There were not many spruce trees in the area to block out such a large object. Why the witness could not see it when she went outdoors is a mystery to me, there was nothing to block out this large orange glowing object. I could see clearly through the first set of trees to the second row. So why the light disappeared has me baffled.  We went back into the house so she could let me view the footage she shot. What I viewed was a totally blackened area, there was no light from an approaching sunrise. The object as the witness described to me was sitting exactly where she told me it was. It was a brilliant orange light and extremely large in size. Something else I found interesting was one of the larger popular trees which was in front of the light, (closest to their home and at the edge of the open field) there is what looks like a string of lights which is running down the tree. When I first looked at this part in the footage it reminded me as if one was looking at a set of Christmas lights running from the top branches downward to about half the length of the tree. The lights also spread out over a few of the larger branches as well. These streamers of light were also very bright.  I eventually left the witnesses home and drove up the road to look around away from the site where the object had been seen. But from the vantage point I was at now, I was able to look over all the fields and the valley below. I did not see anything out of the norm. I also drove back down the road and stopped at the side of the road and looked around the area where the large object was spotted, again I saw no signs of any kind of disturbance in the snow or around and on any of the trees.  So what the husband and wife witnessed is an unknown for now.  I was also given a copy of the tape to have it looked at.

I just want to know what it is ((NUFORC Note:  The photo looks interesting to us, but we turned to a professional photographer, requesting his opinion.  The photographer is retired from the aerospace industry, where he worked as a photographer and (computer) artist.   ((BEGIN COPIED MESSAGE FROM PHOTOGRAPHER)) Peter, This seems to be an artifact of the camera or film. (film flaw or perhaps a bit of static electricity in a digital camera) Something that bright would show purple or violet on surrounding bushes etc. I would expect violet highlights on the white cat or the snow for example. I don't see them.  The other thing it might be is something on the branch that focuses the light like a prism there seems to be another bright spot just below the cat maybe the same color. but it seems to me to have happened after the image was captured.  With a digital camera in cold weather there is sometimes a static electric charge that makes interesting effects.  so there are my thoughts Ray-Paul ((END COMMENT)) ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ray-Paul Nielsen, Brier, WA, for supplying us with the opinion.

After taking sunset photos from a hill-top in Escondido, CA, (With a view over the city lights, looking west, towards the ocean) A string of 6 horizontal lights appeared suddenly along the coastline, approximately 10 miles away & approximately 1300Ft. I could not see what the lights were attached to. I would guess the craft was about 200 yards wide from my vantagepoint. The 6 orbs seemed to rotate through colors from left to right, shimmering. They remained in formation, stationary, and (one to another) for 5min. 13sec. Until they vanished out of sight, as quickly as they had appeared. The lights never changed their position in the sky, to each other or the area. I have taken thousands of photos, with the same camera, from the same hill, for over 5 years, and have never seen anything like it before. I have lived in North County more than 31 years and have never seen Camp Pendleton (Marine Corps Base) produce any similar visual displays while commencing military exercises. I also grew up next to Oceanside Airport, in addition to spending many hours at Miramar Top Gun School watching all the various types of planes. So I know what different craft look like in the night sky. In my opinion, these 6 lights are not ours! ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the several photographs, provided by the witness, and they show 5-6 unidentifiable lights, oriented horizontally.  We do not know what the lights are, although we believe that military flares may be a possibility.

I had a call from an older gentleman this evening, February 13, 2004. He resides in Red Rock British Columbia and is an amateur astronomer. He mentioned that he lives a very organized life and keeps track of the things that take place around him. On the evening of February 11, 2004 at 7:00 p.m. he was out in his yard feeding the dogs and socializing with them for a while and at 7:27 p.m. he looked up into the sky, it was clear and beautiful to look at he said.  Seeing Orion to the south of him and almost due northeast he saw a star that started to grow brighter and brighter and it out shone Venus several times over. As the fellow watched it finally just faded away into nothing. The witness said it did not move. As mentioned above, he first thought it was a star, but there was no flickering to it and the color was a steady bright white.  The gentleman thought it rather strange, as he spends every chance he gets outside viewing the night sky through his telescope. He said he has seen nothing like this before. The witness also said he knows what a satellite, star, planet, etc is, what it was the man saw was no star, at least in his mind. The fellow said he stood speechless there for a while after witnessing this strange event. The man called a close friend who resides in Prince George who also belongs to an astronomy club. His friend had no idea and suggested he contact me, which he did.  I enjoyed chatting with the fellow as he was telling me that the club is pouring a cement pad for a large telescope they are putting in when the weather warms again. Also he has invited me down for a visit when everything is up and running. I am certainly going to take the trip to visit. Red Rock, B.C. is approximately 3 hours 45 minutes drive away from me.

And it went down as quickly as a shooting star and disappeared at about  2 o'clock (i don't know if that mesure exist in english).It was super big and super fast. After that, i looked carefully at the planes to check with their size but their is nothing in common between them.This object was either very close which seems impossible, or huge.Even if close, i would still say it was a supersize light. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter,  i'm very glad you answered my report. I have waited two weeks back in Paris, since i came back from New York, and then i remembered i had to check on a UFO site if something was reported that day , the 14th of feb, because i expected a lot of people to have seen it.And what was my surprise when i saw the other reports on your site!Reassuring in a way...(your site is very well done in terms of ergonomy by the way) So, for more info, i thought i would be better if I send you the global aspect of this ""light"" as a drawing on one of my pictures taken back then.  Also , according to me it was rather blue, a pale blue very luminescent, hazy on the edges, the size of the moon maybe? a bit bigger.It had the kind of move and way of disapearing as a shooting star, very fast.  It didn't seem to burn , though, and the speed of it was really astonishing. I cannot say which was the direction,but i remember I was looking at the left, and going down manhattan.  I was walking with a friend, she didn't see it.But immediately i thought this had nothing in common with anything i've seen in the sky so far.   Did any newspaper talked anout it?Or anyone took a picture? I would like to know the clue of this ""light"".

Received Report: February 14, 2004 The Week of February from the 8 to the 12  The following report has been difficult to put into description. I have never seen this before and it is hard to describe something to others without comparing it to familiar things. I have very little to compare it to except science fiction and special effects that have been in popular movies.  I live Vernon facing west. My view has a ridge of hills about 900 to 1200 ft on either side. In the centre is the airport and moving west further is a small inlet leading to Okanagan Lake. On the other side of Okanagan lake are mountains.  The current events are taking place on the north ridge of the airport in the western direction.  Monday  Tonight at 8:10 pm a ""star"" rose vertically over the ridge. The ""star"" was a bright white and golden light surrounded by a bubble (aura) reflecting the inner swirling colors, of green, blue, orange and pink. This light moved vertically to about an angle of 30 degrees in the sky. It moved horizontally south to hover over the down slope of the hill.  Inside of the bubble the ""light"" expanded to a large spinning ball of flame orange color. It then changed into what appeared to resemble a vehicle with two headlights, changed back to the ball and then to the vehicle. After the changes the bubble disappeared. The size of the bubble is of a pencil eraser held at arms length and the distance from me is about 7 k.  This happened in the time it takes to blink three times. The two large headlights had one green flashing light on one side and two flashing red lights on the other suggesting a shape of a vehicle. I do not get enough time to get a shape of the body but it does not reflect any light as does the body of an airplane. The vehicle hovered then the headlights turned away from me and headed south slower than an airplane can fly at landing.  Wednesday  Tonight at 6:30 pm in the same area as the other sighting a large cloud lit up like a patio lantern with white light. The two lights appeared coming out of the cloud near the top of the cloud. The headlights moved slowly over the same area as the other and then the lights were switched off. The lights were switched on and the vehicle turned south. As I watched the flashing red lights head south, the flashers were switched off.  Thursday  Tonight at 6:30 pm, two headlights crested the hill. Tonight it was different as the ""vehicle"" seemed to be outlined in a webbing of strung golden yellow lights reminding me of Christmas lights. There was still no detail of the vehicle but it was covered in this netting effect. It rose to about 40 degrees in the sky, moved south into the valley and stopped. The golden glow dimmed and three large circular lights in triangular formation came on underneath the vehicle. I watched it slowly head south and could see it until it dissappeared over the top of the hill and highway 97 to Kelowna. It was followed by alot of flashing red and green lights,suggesting something huge or several of the smaller ones described above.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

On 9 Feb, 04,at 18:00 or so I was driving North on Highway 4 in Iowa, just south of Wallingford and North of Graettinger. There, Highway 4 is two-lane, and twisty. It has an upward grade on the West side and a valley to the East and the road goes slightly to the NnE.  Because Highway 4 is winding and visibility is low at this point, I was driving slowly (40mph or less) when I saw a small ball of Blue-white light to the west side of the road, apparantly coming towards me. The west (left) side has a grade that goes up steeply, and whatever it was would either have to go up the hill or onto the road. I slowed further and pulled to the centre of the road. At first I thought it was someone on a snomobile outing, but it was the twilight of day and I saw no snomobile, but just the light. The ball of light, as it turned up to be, came onto the roadway from the west side, and rolled in a SsE direction. It rolled over the Northewst (front driver) corner of my car and across the hood. It did not burn the paint or make sparks off of the car. The ball rolled up the hood and spread out over the windshield. My radio ariel is inside of the windsheild as wires in the glass so there were no sparks from it, either. As the ball passed over the center rear of the hood the engine died cold, although the car continued to roll of its own momentum. The dashboard lamps and headlamps went out, and the radio went off. The ball passed over the roof of the car and rolled down the back window, and across the trunk and off of the southeast (rear passanger) corner of the car. I can't be sure I heard it make a sound, if it made a sound it was like a plastic grocery bag rattling if you crumpled it up. I looked in my mirror and saw as it rolled southward a short distance (30-40 feet)down the center of the road and rolled off the East (right) side of the road into the valley below, where I lost sight of it. I turned my key off and turned it back on, and as the car was still rolling and in gear the motor started up, although the headlamps and dash lamps were dim for a few miles. By the time I had reached Estherville (Ten Miles North) the headlamps and dashboard lamps were brighter, and I continued on to Spirit Lake via Highway 9. By the time I reached Spirit Lake (about 20 miles West) all of the lamps and the like seemed to work, but my presets on the radio had to be reset, and the clock was wrong.  The ball of light left no marks on my car's paint or the vinyl roof, and as my car is old enough not to have a computer in it (1978) there seem to be no lasting effects. I was physically unharmed, except that I had ""flash bulb syndrome"" (a ghost of the light was showing up as an after effect) for ten miles or so, and some metal fillings in my teeth hurt for a few days.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,,

At first we thought it was a boat, but the light got closer and brighter, moving very fast in the air. Then it stopped level with our deck, about 1/2 mile out over the ocean and five bright amber lights began flashing in a random sequence. This display lasted about 10-15 seconds then went dark. We went back in the house thinking it was over, then about 5 minutes later spotted it again over the ocean coming closer towards us. As we were trying to follow the lights, they disappeared again and went dark. Then we looked up and there were 3 large amber lights about 30-40 ft. up from our deck. The object was there about 30-45 seconds hovering in the air and from the spacing of the lights, we estimate it was about the width of our house. The lights were almost rectanglar with rounded edges and about 4 ft. wide each. My husband climbed up on the roof to get a closer look and the lights went dark again. There was no sound, or was so quiet it was masked by the sound of the surf. We returned to the house, found the camera this time and waited again in case it returned. About 5 minutes later we spotted it out over the ocean again about 3 miles out going south. It had numerous amber/white lights displayed around the bottom in a circle and a red pulsating light above and then a white, more diffused light above that. It looked like a three story crown floating out over the water almost to the horizon. We watched it travel very slowly for about 45 minutes with zoom binoculars but were unable to get a good picture as it was so far away by then. It continued it's slow course, went behind a boat which was lit up brightly and then went into a fog bank. The last sighting was at 8:10 pm pacific time.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,44.9435,-123.9487

First Sighting – 	Traveling west on the country road (Kim Road) out of Marion, IN heading toward Sweetser, IN.  Proceeded beyond the stop at Toby Pike heading west and looked up in the sky at the angles reported above.  The sighting appeared spontaneously - a bright glittering light to the right side of the road came on.  It was a type of blinking effervescence – bright white and blinking gold – a similar set of lights – looking to be about 2 inches apart from my location - come on just to the right of it, horizontally – shinning in the same pattern.  Then the second set of lights shut off – does dim quickly – and the original light dims in the same way and then disappear – total duration 5 seconds or so.  Somewhat disbelieving my eyes I scan the sky I see the exact same pattern occur to the left of the road this time and parallel to the first sighting – same pattern and same duration.  I slowed down and clearly saw other types of stars, clear sky, and bright planet, jet lights but all paled by light brightness and size comparisons.  I saw it again after a 10 second interval, the same set of lights appear a third time on the right side of the road again in what appeared to be in the same spot as the first sighting.  Not knowing what I was seeing I turned left and headed south toward State Rd 18 and looked at my watch that read 7:40 PM. That means that all had transpired in 5 to 10 minutes.  I turned west onto State Rd 18 traveling towards Sweetser – I picked up my cell phone to call my husband and was unable to complete the call due to severe static that was atypical to the usual connections in this area.   At this time of year the sky at this time would be dark and star filled and I had no more sighting that evening.  The sighting was unusual enough that I discussed it with my family and searched the web for similar experiences.  I did not report to local law enforcement at that time.  Two days later at approximately the same time, 7:44 PM my husband and I were in separate cars following each other heading west on State Rd 22 just west of State Rd 37 south of Marion, IN.  The same pattern of appearing and disappearing lights reoccurred three times, both of us saw the sightings from the different cars.  I tried to call my husband’s cell phone to see if he was seeing the same sight but my cell phone would not ring through even though the display showed it was ringing. He later stated that the his cell phone never rang.   We checked his phone later – it was on and in reception mode and showed no recent call from me.  Later both phones were working fine as we reached home.  The pattern of the lights this time occurred to the left of the road then moved to the right of the road and back to the left of the road at about the same height from the horizon and off the road to the same angle as the first sighing.  This appeared to almost be a reversal of the first sighting on Feb 9 that was right then left then right.  The only difference was that the lights did not appear to glitter as much as the first time.  Then as I turned of State Road 13 heading north toward Swayzee, IN my eye caught movement of a low flying plane over Swayzee and noticed, in the western sky, 90 degrees to my left, the pattern of lights appearing once again and the companion set of lights with all disappearing in the same way.  After getting home we checked the web for other sightings and noticed similar occurrences have been documented on –1/14/2003 by a person located in Peru, IN traveling West toward Kokomo which was the same direction we had been traveling each time.  Another report was 11/15/2000 – Kokomo at 8:00 PM.  A third report was found on 10/15/1998 – location Dublin, IN (south of).",2004-03-02T00:00:00,40.55987014925373,-85.62199402985075

It was about 9:32 P.M. on the west coast.  i had just finished watching Family Guy and looked out my window at this star i had been watching for the past couple of nights.  After a few minutes i saw a white light appear beside the star, it began to fall twards the earth.  I thought this was kind of strange, but i continued to watch it fall, not wishing to record the event(pictures/movie ect.).  I thought of it as a meterorite or somthing, and relitivly cool to watch.  The object had then been falling for about a minute, when it began to change.  It started turning red, darker and darker and getting larger and larger.  At this point i thought it was going to explode because of the heat from entering the atmosphere, this happened for about 30 seconds, at which point i noticed that this was mot a meterorite, because it was leaving no trail.  I wanted 2 grab my camera but was enthraled to stay and watch, just to see if I was wrong.  At this point it turned white again, I knew then I had to grab my camera.  I watched for a few more seconds and it began to flash bright red, becoming about 15 times the size every time it did so.  I went and grabed my camcorder, turned it on, no tape, ran back and grabbed a tape, switched the tape and hit record.  I could not see anything through my camera, so I ran outside and turned on the nightshot.  The street light  was blocking my nightshot workage.  I soon figured out if I placed my hand to the side of the camera the light wouldn't hit the lens.  All this took about 2 minutes to take place.  At this time the light was moving horizontally across the sky as opposed to vertically.  I filmed it with some shakey hand work, I then saw a commercial airliner, I decided to film that so there would be some refferance as to what airoplanes looked like on my camera, when I looked back at the object it had dropped down again and was now flying horizontally behind some trees.  I got a few seconds of that and when it disappeared i turned off the camera and watched to se! e if it returned.  It didn't, but it left me with some great footage, and an even better story.  And once I get this program on my computer working so I can capture my film I'll send it in.",2004-03-02T00:00:00,,

It was early evening around 7 or 8 in the evening in mid Winter.  A lot of fresh snow had fallen and it's surface had a crisp crust to it under a bright winter moon. We lived on a long country road about 30 minutes from Moncton and it's airport.  This road is due North and lines up with the airport where in the distance it's beacon can be seen at night. My mother had asked if I would go to the store a few houses away and get something needed for the home.  I called my friend and cousin from across the street to go with me.  We could see across the valley for miles.  No clouds in the sky, the moon was out and the stars were crisp.  As we neared the store, my cousin and I remarked how in the North in the direction of the airport, a bright red light could be seen and it must be a plane or something.  Both our fathers worked at the airport and we both had a facination with aircrafts and flying. We entered the store and within a few minutes we were outside on our way home but we soon noticed that now above the house with the store and behind us was a large red half-ball and it was folowing us.  It was about 30 feet high, silent, about the size of a small car and it was flashing similarly to a police light. If you took a red glass ball, painted the top black, and then painted a wide black band dividing the base into two red wedges, and then placed a rotating light within it.  Mind you, we could clearly see the two base of the half-orb but I did not see anything above it. A moment of fear came over us and we wanted to go back into the store but it meant going towards this and since it was not making any noise and slowly moving towards us, we turned and walked South towards our two homes.  I remember vividly walking home all the while being accompanied by this flashing light.  We were scared as we walked but it kept the same distance from us on our way home. From this point to us getting in front of our houses, I have a feeling of dis-jointed time.  As if something happened or that of missing time.  I don't know. All of a sudden, my cousin and I are standing on the road directly between our two houses.  We were scared and didn't want to seperate but wanted to get inside quickly.  We decided to split and run at the same time and both of us ran into our respective homes. When I got in, my mother and several of my siblings (big family with 12 kids) could see that something had scared me.  Several of my sisters saw it through the back windows as the object just passed over our house and went towards the river about a mile away and then turn North again. This has been etched in my mind for over 35 years and I still can't figure what it was or what happenned to us between the store and us getting home. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In 1970 right after I had graduated from high school I went to Carrolton Georgia to attend West Georgia Colledge.  I believe the name has changed to The University of West Georgia.  I entered at the end of 1970 and left in 1973.  The best I can remember was this event happened in 1971.  At the time the student center had a small valley that seperated it from the gymnasium.  At the bottom of the small valley beside the student center was a small pond.  Almost every night that was nice there were always people sitting around the pond and the general area.  This night was a moonless night and the sky was very dark as it was somewhere around 9 to 11 PM.  Me and a friend were walking from my dorm room to go to the gym to lift weights and had just walked past the front of the student center when we noticed people looking up into the night sky. We were looking over the pond about half way up into the sky.  As we looked up we saw 4 or 5 round objects each one had a different solid color.  I can't remember all the colors but one was solid blue and one was red.  They were close to each other and in a perfect horizontal line.  Although they appeared to be far away they were still about as big as the end of an eraser on a pencil.  All of a sudden they would jump out of line and do these eratic maneuvers and then get back in line.  The angles in which they moved were nothing a aircraft could do and they were doing these maneuvers as fast as the eyes could keep up with them.  We watched for what I estimate was about 30 minutes and left.  When we left the lights were still there and many people were still watching them. I would estimate 30 or more people were there.  The solid colors never changed and there were no blinking lights.  They didn't appear blurry at all but just circles with a particular solid color.  I have no ideal what they were but I expected to hear something about it but the only thing I ever heard was another student there say it was swamp gas.  Well I just never bought that as this was a rural area and the night sky was as clear as you could ever expect.  Not one cloud was in the sky.  My dad had retired from the Navy and was in what they called MATS, which stood for Military Air Transports.  I grew up on Navel air stations in Norfolk Virginia Port Lyauty Morroco and Rota Spain and went to sleep with planes taking off all night long. I knew what planes in the sky looked like and had seen all kinds of conditions observing the sky.  In the 60's we had no TV over seas so we spent a lot of time outside at night.  I can only imagine that at the time most colledge kids were considered dope smoking hippies and the relationship with this rural town was strained.  Maybe no one felt like reporting this to the police as they would not be taken serious, who knows? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-02-12T00:00:00,,

During the twilight hour in the middle of winter 1975, my mother came in to the trailer home we lived in and asked me to come outside and ""look at something"". I went with her to the end of our driveway and she pointed east. At the end of the dead end street we lived on there was a line of bare trees that bordered the entire trailer park where we lived. Above these trees I saw a huge triangular black shape that seemed to be floating very still and silent. On each corner of this shape small white lights glowed dimly. As we looked at this shape , my mother kept trying to question what it was, saying things like 'thats not a plane, is it?'.. 'is that a blimp?'.. ' what is that?'. My mother knew a lady in the park that had many cameras and we went to ask her to come out to photograph this thing.The woman became angry and refused to come and see the shape and told us to go away. We returned to our house and the shape had slowly drifted south from where we first spotted it. The air temperature was very cold and there were no other people around to alert them to this shape. The shape continued to move south and we watched it until it was no longer visible. I guess the most unsettling things about this sighting were that it was so silent and so slow in moving. Given that we lived in a mountainous and remote area it was shocking to see this perfect triangle floating above the woods.

Late one afternoon I looked into the western sky and became aware of an aircraft that looked just like a glider - cigar shaped with long narrow wings, a vertical tail fin, ailerons, and a white blinking light at the bottom of it which was flying across the top of a western mountain range. Suddenly it quickly moved South over, and probably beyond Santa Barbara (about 45 mile South) in a matter of seconds. We all became intrigued as we watched it further. It turned East, looped around and began coming closer to the ground and heading straight for us. After a few seconds I remember watching this craft floating about 25 feet off the ground right between our house and the neighbors in a large subdivision. It was painted black - like the stealth craft of today. It was so close we could have thrown a stone at it, but it made no sound at all - it was completely defying gravity. It was also dark out by that time - which now doesn't make much sense. The sun doesn't set that fast from the time we first saw it. It seemed to know we were looking at it and picked us out. I looked up and saw a pilot who was dressed all in black and wearing a black helmet. There was an orangish-pinkish glow that seemed to come from the instrument gauges and was glinting off of his helmet and gloves. He looked over at us, then looked back down at his gauges, then turned to wave to us as the craft started to slowly move away gaining speed as it moved. I never discussed it with anyone in the family until recently. Nobody else in my family remembers this event except my little sister who was 8 at the time. I was 10. I remember more of us in the back yard though, so I'm not sure why they don't remember. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))",2004-02-12T00:00:00,34.6119,-120.2269

During a routine return trip from Mesa Az, to Safford Az late Sunday night my wife spotted what she described as an ""odd light"" in her rear view mirror.  She said it was too high off the road to be headlights and too low to be an aircraft.  As I was the passenger I took a look behind the van and observed this egg shaped light that wasn't bright like headlights and not glowing either.  The object appeared about a mile behind our van and hovering something like 40' (?) above the roadway. We watched it behind us for what seemed like a couple of minutes.  I cannot report what happend next.  The trip seemed to simply ""resume"" and neither of us spoke about the object again.  Upon our return home we noticed the clock - we were about an hour and 15 to 20 minutes later than we should have been - having made the trip many times, we know exactly how long it takes.  We wondered about the object and its relationship to the missing time, but dismissed the entire event and went to bed.  We're reporting this now because we'd like to simply forget that night; but you can't forget something you can't remember?  What we do know is that since that evening, when we pass that exact area late on a Sunday night conversation ends and we both get quiet.  Its an odd feeling to sense something happened but the harder you try to remember the more something inside insists you don't???  Anything beyond this right now would be simple speculation.

If there is a place to upload the graphic on this form, the graphic will accompany the report. Otherwise, please email me at the address provided if you wish to view it and I will email it back to you.  I would like to start this report by welcoming Mr. Davenport back to the ""Coast""  program. It has been great hearing him again, and his updates have been missed.  I will also preface this report with this general statement: this is not a very dramatic account. It is, I believe, a sighting of non-natural objects in (or outside)our atmosphere, but is only qualified as such by the confluence of observational details, the character of which seems to add up to something unusual or non-natural. I have had one other sighting in the past, which I reported to NUFORC, which shared many of the same characteristics with this one. While relatively uneventful in a comparative sense, I personally feel that this was a sighting of non-natural objects traveling through our atmosphere (or perhaps, outer space) at fantastic speeds. At this stage of the game, however, such a sighting might be viewed as mundane, and it is anyone's guess as to whether these objects are ""ours"" or ""theirs"". I'll leave that judgment to you.  Here goes:  I was standing outside in my driveway at approximately 6:40 A.M., facing East. It was still dark, and the pre-dawn sky was crystal clear. Looking up, I could see the half-Moon directly overhead, with Orion positioned W/SW of the Moon, just over my right shoulder. Looking Eastward several degrees past the Moon, I was just stargazing, staring in the area of Procyon and Pollux, when I noticed an object moving in a linear trajectory from N/NW to SE. I briefly focused on one of the nearby stationary stars so that I could be sure that this was indeed a moving object. It had the appearance (size/luminosity) of a dim point of light, not unlike one of the smaller/dimmer stars that I could see that morning. In fact, it looked like just that&#8230;a moving star. The quality of luminosity was consistent and regular, with no flashing, twinkling, flaming, sparking, etc. the object appeared to be very, very high up in the atmosphere at first, but as I watched its traverse across the sky and focused more on its position relative to other bodies in the sky, I became certain that this object was at the very least in near-Earth orbit, if not farther away. As the object moved through and past the Pollux/Castor region of the sky and began to pass the Moon, I began to lose it from direct vision. I attempted to continue tracking the object in my periphery, and was able to hold it for a moment, but lost it in the glare of the Moon (due to the extraordinarily clear sky, the Moon, though only half-lit, was still casting a nice glare). At this point, I was not sure whether the object was beyond the Moon or not. It was not on a trajectory close enough to the Moon to tell whether it would pass in front/behind it. By the time the object reached a position that was past the Moon&#8217;s position in the sky, I had lost sight of it completely. This seemed odd to me, because I thought I would be able to pick it up again as it moved past the glare of the illuminated half-Moon. Nevertheless, I lost track of it.  Just as I was about to write the object off as a near-Earth object of some terrestrial construction, I picked up more motion in my left periphery. I was still staring at the place where I had lost track of the 1st object, when I noticed a 2nd object coming in from the N/NW, following an identical trajectory as the 1st object. It had the exact same appearance, size, and luminosity (that of a dim star) as the 1st object, and seemed to be the same distance away, but was moving at roughly twice the speed as the 1st object. It almost appeared to be in pursuit of the 1st object, or moving to catch up to it, at least. This object continued at this pace until it reached the same general position of the 1st object when I had lost sight of it, and I lost track of the 2nd object in the exact same place. As with the 1st object, I focused on the place where I lost sight of it in hopes of picking it back up, but did not.  As I began to turn to my left, I thought I caught a streak of light (much like that of a meteorite) in my periphery, moving from the spot where I lost track of the 2 objects and streaking toward SW, but I cannot be sure of it. I assumed this was probably an optical illusion, as I had no direct view of whatever it was. It is, of course, very possible that the streak came from further movement of one of the two objects, but I do not know. I saw nothing more after this.  To give you an idea of the speed of these objects, I offer the following (please understand that I am not informed in the calculation of relative speeds, but I understand that it can be done, and this type of information helps in doing so): v	As the Moon was directly overhead, it appeared somewhat small, and could be completely obscured by holding a nickel over it in my outstretched hand (I have an arm span of 6&#8217;, so approx. 2.5&#8217;-3&#8217; in one hand from my eyes). v	The 1st object traversed a path in the sky from about the position of the star Capella to the position of Procyon in about 3.5 seconds. At my arm span (6&#8217;), and holding my arms outstretched and pointing my index fingers at each of these positions (like scoring a field goal), the distance between my fingers was about 2-2.5&#8217;. v	The 2nd object traversed a path starting well before Capella (when I first noticed it) and ending somewhere around the position of Procyon in about 4.5-5 seconds. Estimating the point where I picked up the 2nd object and pointing one finger there and one to Procyon again, the distance between my fingers was about 4-4.5&#8217;. v	So, the 1st object spanned a length of 2-2.5&#8217; in 3.5 seconds, and 2nd object spanned a length of 4-4.5&#8217; in about 4.5-5 seconds.  Again, understand that these are all estimates, as I had to reconstruct positions and times/distances against the star chart after-the-fact, and some of my star references could have been mistaken at the time. Also, I have no good way to estimate the distance of the objects. I am not a mathematician or what you could call a &#8220;trained observer&#8221;, but I have observed airliners flying high in the atmosphere by day and at night, and I have observed traditional near-Earth objects (satellites, etc.) at night with the naked eye, and I am quite certain that these objects were neither of those things. Though not a great judge of distances and measurements, I am also quite certain that these objects were much higher/further out than those common ones just mentioned.  For the above reasons, it is my opinion that the objects seen had to be non-natural objects that were extremely fast and were extremely high up. Due to the consistency and quality of the light emitted, the linear, airplane-like trajectories, and the speeds at which they apparently were traveling, they almost certainly had to be intelligently piloted craft of some design, capable of distances and speeds not possible with known traditional aircraft.",2003-10-31T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

The youngster asked if I would like to talk to her mother, she called for her to come to the telephone and the Mom described what they were observing at the moment.  About an hour before arriving at their home, the family was at the shopping center and mentioned they could see the lights in the sky. Now calling me from their home, they are looking out the window and watching an amazing display of lights high above them in the sky. The 4 lights at equal distance from one another stayed in the same area in the sky, they turned around as if one would be looking at a Ferris wheel. She also noticed aircraft moving close to where the lights were. The witness described the lights as being a neon green in color. She also told me the lights would turn like the hands on a clock, but very quickly, then they would come together in the middle, becoming very bright. Then the lights would move back out again and perform the same maneuvers all over again but moving faster each time. No sound was heard.  Thank you to the family for the report.

The ligths appeared to be about 500 yards off-shore but they did not reflect off of the water so they could have been out over the horizon (20 miles).

Object was stationary, approx. 10,000 to 15,000 ft in the air.  It was a full blue sky with no clouds.  The object was about the lenght of an airliner fuselage, but had no wings or vertical tail fins, just the long tube shape, similar to a pipe.  At the time I told the passenger in my car that it looked like the UFO on the Star Trek Movie with the Whales.  The Movie had the Crew of the Enterprise go back in time to get a humback whale to save the future from a destructive UFO that needed to talk to whales before it stopped destroying earth.  I don't remember what installment of the Star Trek movies it was, as I am not a fan of the series, but it was a major motion picture, not a TV episode, that is what this object looked like.  The object did not move the entire time I watched it, also no soud that I could hear, I was in my car on a busy street.  I was traveling in my car with my girlfreind (now wife) and we both saw it.  We saw it just sitting in the sky, not moving, no lights, just this long black tube, tilted at about a 45deg. angle in the air.  I am a believer in UFO's, however my wife is not.  She does not believe in anything like UFO's, ghosts, and that sort of thing.  When I tell people I do beleive in UFO's, my wife will roll her eyes and make fun of me when we are around other people.

It stayed at a constent speed, very slow.  It was long, about 50 yards from our view point, looked like a string of lights or string of stars moving through the sky. The one way to know for sure that there was something there was to look at the stars in front of it, while we were beneath it and watch it move over them, the stars would disappear and the lights that looked like stars would just be moving along at the same speed.  It looked to me like it was reflecting the image of the stars above it to the bottom of it.  Some of the lights would twinkle a little.

The area the sitghing took place in was sparsely populated at the time so there was only 3 sources of light polution in the night sky in line of site of the craft which helped me make a guess at the size of the craft, it was enormous. My house was a few blocks off a main f.m. highway and i45, the fm highway ran east to west and i45 north to south from my position. From the spot i was standing observing the craft i45 was 2 miles east and the closest edge of the craft was close to the end ot the road i lived on which dead ended 2 blocks east of where i was stranding. Between the end of the road and i45 were maybe 20 houses and several acres of woods and pastures. There were a few scattered clouds in the sky and no moon but the light from i45 and the mall could be seen clearly reflecting off near the center of the craft. Id say the craft was less than 1000 feet up and it moved very slowly. There was some traffic on the near highway but over the slight road noise i could hear an audible hum. After making note of the scale of the craft i knew it had to have been something on the order of 4 or more miles long near to far end though i couldnt see the far end, the center of the craft was just slightly above the treeline/horizon with the rest of its outline disappearing below the treeline. The craft had a number of lights on its leading edge and at least 2 on its trailing all of the same hue of red and a constant light no flashing as an aircrafts marker lights would. Against the night sky it was pitch black save where the lights of the highway and the mall reflected off its underside. I would have written it off as a collection of planes flying in formation if it werent for a few things that dont add up. It was clearly a solid object. Jet black against the dark blue of the night sky, stars visible over the light polution disappear! ed as the craft flew between them and me line of sight. It flew too slow to be any regular aircraft save for maybe a blimp but it was far too big to be a blimp of any known make. The thing that convinced me it was a solid single craft was the scattered clouds described earlier. In the 2 hours i watched it passed through 1 of the errant clouds and parted it some going over the top and some underneath. I went inside to get a drink and a sketch pad to draw out what we were seeing and when i got back outside it was gone. It had taken the craft 2 hours or so to move roughly 3 miles but in less than a minute it had gone completely out of sight without making any noise. To this day it remains the single largest thing i've ever seen. if requested i can scan the sketches i made of the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object was leaving a green trail of something behind it as it moved. The first thing I thought of was a ""plasma trail"".

None of us could identify it. I wanted the driver to pull over so I could get out to take a better look at it while not moving but no one else wanted to stop.

Husband got a brief look through binoculars before the craft went behind a sign obstructing our view.  Though viewed only briefly through 8X binoculars the craft appeared to have light colored (perhaps silver) drop shaped wings.  Where the wings joined was a central area that was much darker than the wings with what was perhaps a cockpit in the center.  We know this sounds like a bird or a plane but the pattern of movement was far too agile for a plane and the objects appeared too large for the apparent distance to be birds.  Once they went behind the sign obstructing our view (which was very close relative to the distance of the objects) we waited for them to reappear but they didn't!

The reunion is held in a town of 200 in a heavily forrested area of northern Wisconsin.  My sister left to go home just before I did.  She flagged us down on the county road, an we pulled over.  She pointed to an opening in the forrest and said what is that. We looked at an area that is cleared for a natural gas pipe line from Canada.  The width of the clearing is about 100 feet wide and runs from Canada through the center of the United States. At the top of the hill about 1 mile from the road we saw four bright white lights, equally spaced. The two lights in the middle were brighter than the lights on the side, as if they were pointed in a slightly different direction. The distance the two end lights were appart was about 50 feet (it took up about 1/2 of the clearing).  We went back to the farm house that we had the fire at to get a pair of binoculars.  We came back with two more people and looked through the binoculars at the lights.  Through the binoculars we could make out somewhat of a shape, as if the lights were attached to a piece of equipment.  The lights seamed to pulsate when looked at with the naked eye, but did not when seen thruogh the binoculars.  We all tried to guess what this could be.  A piece of farm equipment, but it was on government land, late at night, not moving, no sound.  There was no electricity to power the lights, a generator or equipment would make a noise.  It was so quiet, you could here for miles.  No one wanted to walk through the tall grass to get a closer look, (in retrospect I wish I did).  We were not sure how far away it was.

Location:  Suburban Philadelphia, PA USA  Environment:  Mostly clear sky, after sundown, light breeze  Witnesses:  (2) Male - 25, Male - 55  Aircraft:  One triangular/delta wing shaped object of airliner size at an altitude of not greater than 800 ft (more likely below 500 ft) making very little noise and traveling very slowly (150MPH estimated).  -Shape- Triangular in shape, although not a 'triangle.'  The outline was distinctly a delta wing configuration and there was a clearly visible fuselage.  The best example of the shape is the old F16 Delta Wing concept.  No rear mounted horizontal stabilizers and a clean, straight trailing edge to the main wing.  No forward mounted horizontal stabilizers were visible either.  Two vertical stabilizers were visible, ruling out many possible aircraft types that fit the 'basic' shape (B2, etc).  The total wingspan of the 'delta wing' was longer than the totall length of the aircraft.  -Lighting- Very familiar lighting pattern.  Red, white, and blue lights on the wing, nose, wing, respectively, as one would see on a normal airliner, but the lights were in the wrong places.  The wing tip lights were 'too far back' to denote a typical airliner.  No other visible running lights.  No strobe effect or color changes.  -Size- Large.  737 size at least.  -Position- Altitude between 500 ft and 800 ft AGL.  Traveling from ENE to WSW.  -Speed- Very, very slow.  Best guess is between 150-200MPH - if that.  -Sound- Astonishingly quiet.  The exhaust note was more similar to a constant gust of wind than a jet engine.  Description of Event:  Standing outside home talking.  During the converasation, the lights of an 'airliner' were visible approaching from over the roof of the house across the street.  Initially, the size, speed and altitude through me off.  The aircraft traveled in our direction, although very slowly.  As it came nearer, its outline was visible against the stars and moonlight.  The aircraft resembled a typical airliner in lighting patterns only - and only at a distance.  It was apparent when the aircraft flew overhead that the lights were in the wrong positions as the wingtip running lights were at the trailing edge of the aircraft - too far back.  The delta wing shape became visible at roughly the same time, which sparked my interest as I moved a few feet down the driveway to keep the aircraft in view longer.  Other obervations made during this time (~30 seconds from initial view to passing over house) were the flight charectaristics.  The altitude of the aircraft was very abnormal for my area.  Philadelphia Int'l airport does not have traffic patterns over my area and even if they did, an approaching aircraft would still be well above 10,000 feet as the airport is a good 45 miles away.  The local NAS operates mostly C130's, A10's, and the occassional F18.  The altitude of the aircraft was almost enough to make me duck - it appeared that the aircraft would be landing no more than 1000 yards away based on this as well as the speed.  The speed again reinforced the idea that the aircraft was landing somewhere very close by.  At rougly 150 odd MPH, you would expect an airliner size aircraft to be seconds away from touchdown, full flaps, etc.  Except this aircraft kept on going straight and level until it disappeared from view over treetops 500 yards away.  The sound was the last abnormal charectaristic of the aircraft - there really wasnt any.  The aircraft engines sounded more like a sustained gust of wind than a jet or prop engine.  At that alitude, one would expect even a civilian airliner to drown out the conversation, let alone a military aircraft, but the aircraft was so quiet that we were able to speak to eachother while observing it.  Reason for reporting: Was advised to do so.  There is no single aspect that stands out about this aircraft - but the sum of all the aspects made this an interesting experience.  The combination of 'way' too low, 'way' too slow, 'way' too quiet, and shaped like the old British Avro Vulcan were enough for me to question what, exactly, the aircraft was because I know of no civilian or military aircraft that exibits this combination of charectaristics.",2003-11-26T00:00:00,40.2262,-75.2931

From this position I am able to see up into the night sky without any effort.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed an unusually bright light directly over the neighbors house.   (My neighbors house was brightly light up for the holiday season, so I found it partcularly strange that I could even see a star with so much light over there., but I sat down to read and forgot about it. About 4:00 a.m., a log I had loaded fell against the fireplace door and started leaking smoke into the house, so I got down on the floor to adjust the fire and once again the light caught my eye.    I remembered thinking ""That is a bright star.   I have lived here 13 years and never noticed a star there before, and is it that thing flashing"".   So I grabbed a pair of binoculars and was astonished to see it was in deed flashing in a sequence of white, red, and green.   Its flashes were so definitive that they brightly light up the sky around them. I sat there on the floor in the dark and watched it for about 10 minutes and decided to call my husband at work and tell him about the weird thing that was over the neighbors house.   We joked about me signaling the aliens so if I disappeared he would know where I went and he told me to keep him posted.     After I hung up from talking to him I started looking around the sky to see if there was anything else ""strange"" out there I had never noticed before and I saw another similar object directly across the sky from the firsts one.    I am no good at distances, but I could say from one mountain top to the other. I once again called my husband and noticed at that time the first light was very much lower in the sky and much closer to my neighbors house.    That really interested me so I sat there and watched it move until it disappeared behind the mountain.  I then took my attention back to the other object and it had gone behind the grove of pine trees and was no longer visible to me. Well you better believe I have checked the same spot every night since.  The object was there again on New Years Eve at roughly the same times and pretty much experienced the same series of events.  Have been watching every night since, but it has been cloudy here at night, so haven't seen anything. There were lights on the object Not sure if you could consider the colored flashes reflecting off the sky an auora or haze? Thought I may have caught something that looked like a red flare type thing shooting out of the second object on the first night, but wasn't directly looking at it with the binoculars so didn't mention it, but when I read the question thought I better mention it.   Couldn't swear to it though it was just like a short red line for a second. Don't known exactly what I saw come out of it, just something flare like and red. Light flashed white red green.  Actually there was a plane that flew under the second object shortly before it disappeared.

Here is this person's quote ""Tirangular-shaped object hovered over New York State Thruway on September 27  I was driving home from a friend's house on the night of Saturday, September 27,2003. I took the N.Y.State Thruway home. I was traveling alone. Somewhere between the Catskill and Coxsackie exits I saw a triangular-shaped object approaching from the north-west. It moved very slowly and hovered over the lane I was in. It had 3 red lights along it's points that did not flash. As it moved over my car I looked up through my windshield and saw the body of the craft. It was a matte gray. My windows were closed so I could not discern if there was sound or not.  A mile or two before this occured, I noticed a police car along along the left side of the Thruway. All traffic slowed down because of this. Once this object appeared, all cars accelerated to speeds of 80-85mph. I know others saw this and I want to find out if anyone else has reported a sighting on this night.  I am a public school teacher in New York.""  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32150.html  While we were going home on a local road, I saw a stationary triangular object (black) over the trees. Interestingly this exactly matches the description of the person I quoted what I saw. It was triangular (perfect triangle), and had red lights along its points (did not blink). Thought it appeared black to me, probably because it was dark, however gray color that was reported would be close enough to my witness since it was daylight for the other person. I can bet 100% a gray object would appear black in the dark. Also this object did not make any sound.",2004-01-17T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

That is until I went to put the garbage can out by the edge of the road. Off to the north west was a very bright circular object, 2 to 3 times brighter a larger than the north star.  As I watched this object it slowly moved to the north. All of a sudden, it took off like a rocket for about a half a second. It slowed down, then it started moving south. It slowly moved south for a few seconds then it turned moving back towards the north again. At times it would be like it was hanging in the night sky swinging like a pendulum. It would go in all directions, like someone scribbling on a piece of paper. It also had faint blinking colors such as you would see with the stars. Occasionally you could see what looked liked a tail from a comet.  At about 9:45 Eastern time I walked back outside and the object was nowhere in sight. Another thing I should point out is that my nephew said he has seen it for the last couple of days. Even first thing in the morning when they were heading to school. I don't know If anybody else has seen such an object.  Additional information:  The object was low in the sky, taking a guess would say at a level of approx. 25 to 30 deg. This morn. I woke up about 4:45 to get ready for work. And the object is back in the sky. This time at a more easterly direction and at an approx. angle of about 60 deg.  There was no indication of any type of craft, even through our telescope it only looked like a circular bright, white light with blinking colors(red, green, and blue.) The tail I was speaking of was not visible at all times. It would just appear randomly. Even through the telescope you could just make out the tail occasionally.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The clouded parts of the sky on that day had some weird shaped circular or oval.,Portland,OR,2004-02-21T22:05:00,unknown,unknown,"Occurred : 2/21/2004 22:05  (Entered as : 02/21/2004 22:05) Reported: 3/10/2004 10:45:14 PM 22:45 Posted: 3/17/2004 Location: Portland, OR Shape: Unknown Duration:unknown",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35524.html,"The clouded parts of the sky on that day had some weird shaped circular or oval. Hi Brian,  I was out on an errand yesterday afternoon. The sky in Portland was clear and dry except for the jet trails overhead which had obscured parts of the clear blue with some agglomerating cloud cover.  I hardly go anywhere without a digital camera these days. I snapped lots of sky pictures as aircraft trails intrigue me, especially on a rare otherwise clear day.  Several pictures were quite interesting. The one attached here had a plane approaching passing to my right which I remember seeing, and a green spot, possibly a lens flare, which I don't remember seeing. So I decided to look a bit closer at it to discover what may have caused the green spot. Also, this picture is under exposed to highlight the sky details, a trick I learned a while back.  The clouded parts of the sky on that day had some weird shaped circular or oval tracers cut into them, some quite clear which I have other pictures of from 2-20-2004. This intrigued me further to see what I could learn about the green spot. After all, it's not every day you are dealt a green spot in a photo (or maybe it is, you decide).  I made a copy of it (-2) and cropped out an area, because in the original image I thought I saw what could be a circular or oval tracer near the green spot.  I then solarized a copy (-3) and you can plainly see the green spot (now turned magenta) appears to be leaving some kind of trail ""behind"" itself, coming off of a circular tracer. If you look closer, it appears there may be even more objects and circular tracers. Maybe, maybe not. They may just be artifacts of the enhancement program.  There appear to be in close proximity two other similar, or the same, objects flanking the circular tracer. Of course, that is my guess, and they may just be spots in the clouds. Or maybe not. The green spot is making me think ""adolescent showing off to its buddies"" for some reason. I mean, what with impending springtime and all.  The spot in the upper left is the sun illuminated cloud cover.  Just thought I would brighten your day a wee bit. I am a novice at this and don't know how to get more out of this photo. Maybe you can, or know someone who can.

Number of witnesses: 2 Number of objects: 1 Shape of objects: Round  Full Description of event/sighting: a very large, bright white object in the northwestern sky, stayed in one place for about ten minutes, then appeared to fade in brightness slowly, then it gradually moved north over the period of about 15 minutes. it then slowly disappeared from view, it was far to bright to be a star, and did not move in the fashion of any satellite that I have ever seen. I'm sure that other people must have seen it, as it was to bright and long to miss    Additional Information Below:  I will answer your questions in order.  (1) The movement appeared to stay in one place for about ten minutes, then very slowly moved north until moving out leaving my view. It was a very clear night except for a low cloud line, about the altitude of the object.  (2) the altitude , if it was in the atmosphere, was about the same as the Grouse mountain range if being viewed from Vancouver.  (3) The color was bright white, just like a very bright star, although it was about twice to three times the size of Venus to the naked . Very big and very bright. The brightness faded slightly as if it were moving away when it appeared to be stationary.  (4) I did see one plane fly right in line with the object, although the plane appeared to be very far away, probably a commercial line,( the blinking red light) was faint.  (5) No trail of any kind  (6) the second witness only viewed the object for about 5 min. but I can assure you that her interpretation would be similar as we discussed the object.  I am very interested an fairly well informed on these matters as I have been the witness to several sightings and in occurrences throughout my life, please let me know if you find anything out.
